      <P>As I indicated in reply to questions about this matter on 13th February, 1968, the Government have made representations to the United States Government expressing deep concern about the possible effects of the proposed restrictions on our tourist industry.  The representations were based mainly on the fact that tourism is of vital importance to the Irish economy and that it accounts for more than one-fifth of our total foreign earnings.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say, at this stage, what the results of the representations will be.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that they are not aware of any general concern of the nature suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Board appreciate, however, that with the extension of building and the number of electrical appliances in use there may be individual houses or groups of houses where temporarily supply is not fully satisfactory.  The Board make every effort to eliminate the difficulties in such cases by strengthening the distribution system. The Board estimate their expenditure in their Cork district on such work this year at over £400,000.</P>
      <P>Persons affected should bring particular cases of difficulty to the notice of the local office of the ESB for investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The following categories of postmen are not eligible for pension on retirement: auxiliary postmen, unestablished postmen and temporary postmen. There are about 2,600 auxiliary, that is, part-time, 260 unestablished and 500 temporary postmen employed at present.  The number of temporary postmen fluctuates from week to week, and many of them, who were recruited on a casual basis, have no prospect of continuous employment.</P>
      <P>On retirement at the age of 60 years or over, auxiliary, unestablished and temporary postmen are eligible for a gratuity provided they have at least seven years service.  The question of introducing a pension scheme for these postmen is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether a temporary postman (name supplied), <Col N="166" /> who recently retired after 57 years service, will be granted full pension and gratuity rights as a regular postman; and the gratuity normally paid to a retiring temporary postman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The officer referred to by the Deputy was an auxiliary or part-time postman and as such he was not eligible to receive a pension when he was retired recently at the age of 72 years.  He is in receipt of an old age pension however and he will receive the usual retirement gratuity payable to part-time officers which is calculated on the basis of three-quarters of a week's pay for each year of reckonable service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that, owing to the refusal of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to negotiate with the Irish Sugar Beet Growers' Association on price and conditions for next season's beet crop, growers of beet for the coming season will suffer cuts of 1/9d per ton following a contract cut in pulp ration of a quarter cwt per ton, plus 8/9d per ton owing to the increase of £1 a week on agricultural wages; and that they are now faced with an increase of ten per cent in CIE freight charges involving a further 1/3d per ton, making in all a cut of 11/9d per ton or a total loss of revenue to beet growers of £548,000; and if intends to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <P>The prices and contract conditions offered to growers for the sugar beet crop are matters for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and I do not propose to intervene.  My information is that growers have sought contracts for 1968 beet acreages in excess of what the company is in a position to allocate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a State subsidised company or a semi-State body, and does the Parliamentary Secretary think it right that tillage farmers, when the price of everything else is going <Col N="167" /> up, should have their prices cut by over £500,000 due to the interference of a couple of ranchers from the midland counties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to a letter from the Dairy Disposal Company Limited to all suppliers stating that the early notification of results of tests inserted in the supplier's pass book is provisional and subject to correction on re-check and that payment of the special price allowance for premium grade milk is in all cases based on results of tests as finally checked; and if, as this would indicate that the results of tests in suppliers' pass books are not necessarily accurate and as suppliers are anxious to get clarification on this point, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Creamery Milk Quality Grading Scheme samples are check-tested by inspectors of my Department and, where the result differs from that of the most recent test carried out by the creamery, the inspector's test determines the supplier's eligibility for the quality allowance for the month concerned.  The scheme also provides that, where milk is refused acceptance because it is dirty, stale or contaminated or is contained in a dirty vessel, the supplier is ineligible for the quality allowance for that month irrespective of the results of the testing of the samples of his milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is to provide for such circumstances and also for possible clerical errors in notifying the <Col N="168" /> results of tests immediately they are carried out that the Dairy Disposal Company has notified its suppliers that the results of tests are provisional until they have been finally checked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the bridges across the Liffey in Dublin city rests with Dublin Port and Docks Board and Dublin Corporation.  The Port and Docks Board is responsible for all bridges east of Seán Heuston Bridge, with the exception of the &ldquo;Halfpenny&rdquo; bridge at Liffey Street which, together with Seán Heuston Bridge, is the responsibility of the Corporation.  The formulation of proposals for the provision of additional bridges over the Liffey to cope with increasing traffic would be a matter for Dublin Corporation acting, of course, in consultation with the Port and Docks Board and the other authorities concerned.  No such proposals have been submitted to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that, as part of the planning process for the city, the Corporation engaged a traffic consultant; the reports received from him to date make certain recommendations for an improved street network involving a new high-level bridge to the east of Butt Bridge in the Cardiff Lane area, and the widening of Butt Bridge. I understand that the Corporation are examining these specific proposals in consultation with the Port and Docks Board and that the examination conducted so far indicates that, because of cost, a tunnel instead of the proposed high-level bridge appears to be ruled out, and, because of technical difficulties, the widening of Butt Bridge is not feasible, and an alternative proposal for the construction of an additional quay-level bridge immediately east of the Custom House is therefore being considered.  A proposal of Dublin Corporation for the reconstruction and widening of Seán Heuston Bridge was approved in principle by my Department in January last and I understand that contract documents for the project <Col N="170" /> are at present in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>I am advised by Dublin Port and Docks Board that they carry out annually a detailed survey of the Liffey bridges in their charge, augmented by quarterly inspections, and that, in addition, small diameter borings are taken from time to time to determine the condition and/or thickness of some of the materials in these bridges.  I understand that the &ldquo;Halfpenny&rdquo; bridge, which was redecked recently, is regularly inspected by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>In view of the early stage at which the consideration of the proposals for new bridges still rests, it would be inappropriate as yet to go into the question of Road Fund grants.</P>

The council were informed in April, 1967, that the design submitted by them for four such houses in Doneraile was unsatisfactory and required revision.  An alternative design for these houses has not been submitted to me since then.  A design for old persons dwellings at Kanturk, which has been under examination by my Department's technical advisers, will be discussed shortly with the council's advisers.  Following this discussion an early decision will be given by me on the council's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of central heating being installed in the houses being built by the National Building Agency in Carlow was decided two years ago in consultation with the purchasers when the houses were being designed.  At this stage it is too late to make any changes, as the heating unit has already been installed in two houses and units for the remaining houses have been delivered on site.  Insistence on the use of an alternative Irish manufactured unit now would result in unjustifiable additional expenditure to the purchasers.</P>
      <P>My anxiety that heating units manufactured in this country should wherever possible be used has been conveyed to the Agency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the policy of the Department but this matter was decided in consultation with the purchasers. The only Irish manufactured unit available would be uneconomic in houses of this size.  The output is too high and so the running costs and the capital cost would be uneconomic for houses of this size.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>When replying on the previous occasion, I had dealt with most of the questions raised by Deputies and it would not be in order, I think, to deal with general matters of agricultural policy.  However, there are a few points I may have missed which I shall deal with now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton raised the matter of a lactose factory and the use of whey for pig feed.  I should like to say at this stage that I am as anxious as any other interest to have the clearest possible indication whether in fact a lactose factory is in the best interests of our dairy industry, or whether, indeed, the whey which would be directed to such a factory would be more profitably used in the production of pigs.  If there were a possibility that whey could be so absorbed fully and profitably in the production of pigs, I personally would feel very much attracted to that method of its disposal, rather than to the lactose factory project.  The fact is that during recent years the demand for this sort of factory has been growing because of the fact that whey in quite substantial quantities, we understand, has been found incapable of being directed towards any useful purpose such as the feeding of pigs.  Even its disposal has created a problem.  If it is not possible, the sooner we get to know that is the case the better, because we have a projected factory for the manufacture of lactose from this whey and we could get along with it pretty quickly at this stage.  If anyone has any information that would confirm whether we should or should not, the sooner we get it the better I should like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell talked, among other things, about the Bord Bainne plan for securing new markets and the general future prospects of the dairying industry.  So far as the dairying industry <Col N="181" /> is concerned and its outturn in recent years, the producers in that industry have good reason to be pretty pleased with their future prospects.  As everyone is aware, milk production has been setting new records almost year by year in recent years.  On the other side, cattle prices at this particular point in time are giving every indication of being good in the immediate future.  So, from the two sides of the interests of the dairy farmers, the outlook can be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy mentioned his concern about foreign participation in the processing of milk.  This is something we have come to live with in regard to many of our products, whether they derive from agriculture or from industry.  The question here must always be whether participation means progress and the establishment of further processing, or whether the lack of participation would nullify any effort in any direction.  If expansion is desirable and worthwhile for its own sake, I think we must live with this foreign participation.  Indeed, we should welcome foreign participation when it is the only means whereby we can find additional outlets for processing. I can see reasons for this inhibition particularly when it comes to milk processing.  It is very near home, as it were, then and many people begin to feel that contrary to what their local co-operative may have done in the past in the handling of milk, in buttermaking and so on, it would be out of their control.  I understand that sort of inhibition, but what we should never forget in this type of industry or any other industry is that the people who come in here from outside are far more vulnerable than we ourselves are here at home.  If they are prepared to come in here and give us of their knowledge, and know-how, and capital, and possibly existing markets as outlets for our products, we have nothing to fear in this regard and we should, as we do in most cases, welcome foreigners in here to help us to do the job better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully mentioned the Drink More Milk Campaign. The National Dairy Publicity Council which was set up in 1964 to <Col N="182" /> promote an increase in the consumption of milk and dairy products have contributed to a reduction in the high cost of subsidisation by their activities, and have done a useful job.  It may be that they will do an even greater job and play a greater role in future in pushing our own raw milk products, as it were, to a greater degree.  I hope they will continue to work even more effectively in future.</P>
    <P>Fears were expressed by more than one Deputy in regard to bovine tuberculosis and the fact that there has been some evidence of a breakdown in a few parts of the country.  They really were querying whether we were worrying about it and what we were doing about these breakdowns.  We must first of all get the record straight in this regard.  We must not forget that nearly 99 per cent of our herds are completely free of all disease.  Whether these fears about breakdowns are real or imaginary, we must recall that 99 per cent of our herds are completely free. In the Department we are following up any evidence of any breakdown and we will continue to do this until we are in a position to sit back and say we have safely got the whole situation completely under control.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheep industry was mentioned here and was described by Deputy Clinton in reasonable terms as not being in a happy position generally.  We must go by the common indicators. While admitting and agreeing it was a difficult year so far as wool prices and wool disposal were concerned&mdash;and indeed man-made fibres are making further inroads on the need for raw wool of the type we have here which does not augur too well for the future of the wool trade&mdash;nevertheless wool is only one part of the sheep and a relatively small part, financially speaking. The sheep trade as a whole has been and continues to be pretty sound.  At times this year it was extremely good. The small contribution we made to the mountain sheepbreeder this year has been very much appreciated.  The House will be aware that the lamb subsidy scheme this year which was directed towards Black-Face and Cheviot breeds has brought to mountain sheep-farmers about £176,000 in direct subsidy without any tags <Col N="184" /> attached or sale conditions as applied in the previous scheme initiated the year before.  I have met a number of these people and they are quite satisfied that, so far as we have gone with this scheme, it has worked out quite satisfactorily.  I had no real complaints about its administration but I had much praise for its impact and the manner of administration this year.  I feel it will have done a considerable amount for hill sheep-farmers who represent no small part of our sheep industry.  Prices have been good and fairly steady and demand has been reasonably good, taking a good period back over the year, and present indications seem to be set fair for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully spoke of the beef export subsidy and a remark made by either or both of them at the time, of which I took a note, was to the effect that producers do not know enough about how to get paid the subsidy direct and have to wait an unduly long time for the subsidy payment. They went on to calculate how much this could mean and the impact on the farmers who had to wait a considerable time.  While this might be true in the initial stages&mdash;the direct payment arrangement is only a short time in operation&mdash;and because of the upset caused by foot and mouth restrictions, a great deal of trading has not taken place in this way since then, but, suffice to say, the direct payment scheme is now operating through the dead meat factories and it means in essence that the price offered on any particular day for the animal as heretofore is now capable of being broken into two parts and that the farmer can get the price plus the subsidy as a separate payment, subject to bringing the animal to the factory and filling in a form so that we have a record afterwards.</P>
    <P>As regards the passing of these claims, if there has been any undue delay&mdash;I do not anticipate there will be any in the future&mdash;we should realise that farmers are not accustomed nowadays, particularly with marts operating as they are throughout the country, to getting cash in hand as in the old days when we had fairs only in the different towns. <Col N="185" /> Now, they rather get it a week or ten days later and this applies to any produce they sell through the marts. If they have to wait for part of their money which comes through the Department while the claim is being processed, I do not see that it should be any undue hardship and is less of a hardship, if anything, than is involved in selling an animal through the mart and getting a cheque a week or ten days later.  We should be able to serve the farmers under this scheme in regard to these payments with about the same expedition as the marts.  I do not think that this is something that should scare people off applying for the direct subsidy. I doubt if it has done so.</P>
    <P>The direct subsidy to the farmers as we have brought it into being probably has not a great deal to commend it, other than that you can get the subsidy in a separate payment and know the subsidy content of the total price.  I do not claim that it has any great advantages for the farmer but, candidly, after a great deal of examination of various suggestions I and my Department concluded that it was the only way in which the farmer could have the option of getting the subsidy direct rather than lumped in with the price, a procedure which led to some complaints, probably with justification in recent years.  I am not claiming any great advantages for this system.  It is something that was sought and is now being given in what we think is the best way and, as I said before, if anybody knows of a better way I should be only too glad to hear of it and put it into operation. Until we get a better one&mdash;I doubt if there is one&mdash;this system will operate and I hope the farmers for their own sake will avail of it at any rate occasionally just to keep the records straight and satisfy themselves what the subsidy content of the price is at any given time.  It will probably give them the satisfaction of knowing that they are not being taken short by reason of the lumping of price and subsidy together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about grants for milk-coolers and said that possibly <Col N="186" /> one of the reasons why more people had not applied for them is that they may not have electricity on their farms.  That is true for a small section of farmers but I do not think it would explain any short-fall in regard to applications for milk-coolers.  Rather I would think the reason why we have not had so many applications in the past six or eight months was that at the time of the introduction of the milk-cooler subsidy the milk production season was then in full swing.  We were right in the middle of it and it was unlikely at that stage that anybody who had not already arranged to procure a milk-cooler for that season would be encouraged to get one, even with the incentive of the grant.  I should expect the demand to be correspondingly higher in the early part of this year when the general milk season is ahead of us.  I hope this will be so and that as a result more farmers not yet earning the bonus for quality milk will qualify because this would help them to secure it.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the overall percentage earning this bonus has gone up beyond our projections.  We are very glad that it is higher than we expected but we believe the milk-cooler scheme can further add to this scheme to produce high quality milk.  When we introduced the scheme, it was my hope that in a few years time we would not have two grades of milk being sent to the creameries but that it would be all quality milk.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here that the matter of the safeguards imposed by the British Minister of Agriculture, in regard to the import of meat from countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic, was one on which we should make every effort to make our voice heard.  We have done this; we have missed no opportunity of having our say in this matter, which, however, is something that is finally determined by the British Minister and the British Government.  While we have made our plea in this regard already, and will again at any time in the future when we feel it will be useful to say anything in this context, we must keep in mind that it is a matter that is not for us to decide.  In the final analysis, <Col N="187" /> it is the British Government who must make the final decision.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter mentioned by Deputy Coughlan about bacon factories.  He referred to the closing of bacon factories and attributed this to an inadequate supply of pigs.  The number of factories at the moment is about the same as we have had, take or give one, for many years past.  For 20 to 30 years there has not been much difference in the number of factories operating in the country.  It is also true to say that the number of pigs going into the factories even last year was higher than the number in any year for 20 years before 1960.  While it is true that during the years from 1960 to 1965 there was a rising graph in the supply, again, we have to keep the matter in context and realise that when we have had this set-back in production, this downward cycle, which has lasted longer than heretofore or than had been expected, the same number of factories today as we had pre-1960 have got more pigs during the past 12 months than in any of the 20 years immediately prior to 1960.  To attribute any closure to inadequacy of supply is, obviously, not the entire answer by any means.</P>
    <P>I may say, also, in regard to the decline over these last couple of years, that the number of sows and gilts in pig, at a count last June and at a short count, as it were, in January of this year shows a small but, nevertheless, significant trend upwards again. We hope that this trend will continue and that during the year 1968 not only will the downward trend evidenced over the last couple of years have been arrested but that the numbers will begin to climb again and that factories which may have had difficulty and which undoubtedly, have been in competition with each other in getting sufficient supply, will find that this difficulty will gradually disappear and that our overall pig numbers can be raised substantially above that attained two years ago.</P>
    <P>We aim not merely at restoring the number that we had a couple of years ago, but it is my hope and intention to <Col N="188" /> try to bring about a situation and atmosphere in the pig and bacon industry in which there would be a substantial increase, gradual, no doubt, but nevertheless real, over the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>I would hope also that the increase looked for will come mainly from the western counties where the production and fattening of pigs in very much greater number than is now the case would be not only good for the country but particularly good for the farmers and especially the small farmers of the western areas.  This is my intention.  We are trying to find ways and means of encouraging such a move and of these the House will, in due course, I hope, hear more in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The overall situation is that scarcely anybody will disagree that this additional money is needed and, in various ways, is being used for very useful purposes in our primary industry and, large though this demand is, I think the House will agree to the provision in order that we may continue to fund those who are dependent to some degree on these various supports.</P>
    <P>Of the total amount of money going to agriculture, directly and indirectly, the indirect part is a matter to which other members of the community should occasionally have regard.  I do not intend to analyse this at the moment.  Suffice it to say that while the total overall figure, direct and indirect, is very substantial, approaching £70 million during the current year, we should not allow it to be thought that this is overdoing it and that it is not in a very worthy and useful cause.  We are supporting this industry in these various ways, directly and indirectly, for the very good reason that we recognise its value and importance.  To those who have no connection with farming operations I would point out that not all of this money is a direct hand-out or dole to farmers, that a large part of it is directed in other necessary ways.  It is computed that the direct payments as well as the indirect arrive at this total figure which, as I say, is substantial and represents a heavy burden on the taxpayers as a whole but, if it is examined, it will be realised that it is to quite a <Col N="189" /> degree not direct payment to the farmers and where it is direct that it is doing a useful job in our most important industry on which all taxpayers to a greater or lesser degree depend for their very existence and for the better way of life which they may be enjoying as a result of agriculture doing its job as efficiently as it does, and has done, despite all the difficulties over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the question is put I should like to ask the Minister a question.  He spoke when concluding of the problem of reviving the number of pigs.  He spoke earlier in this House of his being aware that the recent increase of £3 a ton in the cost of pig feeding without any corresponding adjustment of the minimum factory price for pigs was calculated to discourage the production of pigs.  I wonder if he is in a position to say now that the factory price of pigs will be adjusted to meet the increased cost of pig feeding because my experience in Monaghan and in the province of Connaught suggests that the apprehension of this continued disparity between the price of pig feed and pork is driving a considerable number of people out of pig production ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may, I should just like to correct a possibly wrong impression given by Deputy Dillon.  For a considerable period the actual market price for pigs has been greatly in excess of the guaranteed minimum price which for grade A Special pigs has been 266/-.  Market prices have been around 280/- to 288/-.  Therefore, an increase in the guaranteed minimum price would not at the moment be of direct benefit to the producer because the market price is about 20/- above the guaranteed minimum.  The increase in feeding stuffs has had its effect in these recent weeks mainly as a result of devaluation.  All these matters are under consideration in regard to an increase in the minimum price but let me say straight away that such an increase will be reflected in an increase in subsidy to the exporter for his exported bacon and need not necessarily reflect itself in any benefit to the pig producer.  The mere raising of the <Col N="190" /> minimum price would not necessarily be to the advantage of the pig producer because of the fact that at the moment and for months past the market price has exceeded the minimum price by up to 20/- a cwt.  The impact of the increase in the cost of feeding will not approach nearly 20/- and, therefore, it would not bring the price up to the 280/- or 288/- and, therefore, it is not as real an advantage to the farmer as it may appear but is a more real recompense to the factory, to the bacon curers, who export bacon, in respect of which we are under a commitment to make up to them a price related to the minimum price.  This is, as I say, under consideration but it will not necessarily mean x shillings additional to the producer.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet excess expenditure on certain subheads of the Vote the extent of which could not be foreseen when I took the original Estimates and the two Supplementary Estimates in November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original Estimates, a sum of £13,620 was provided in respect of <Col N="191" /> travelling and incidental expenses. This sum did not provide for the cost of the printing of patents specifications which in the normal course would have been provided for in the Vote for the Stationery Office.  However, because of an administrative decision to change from conventional printing of these specifications to direct reproduction by the off-set method, the Stationery Office Estimate for 1967-68 in respect of the printing of patents specifications provided only for contracts placed in 1966-67.  For technical reasons the change-over in printing methods was more gradual than had been anticipated and consequently a considerable amount of conventional printing became necessary in 1967-68 which was not provided for in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>My Department therefore, with the approval of the Department of Finance, took over responsibility for expenditure on conventional printing in 1967-68.  The decision to do so was taken too late for the inclusion of a provision in the printed Estimates. The total expenditure for this service in 1967-68 is expected to amount to £9,500.  I might add that no further expenditure is anticipated as I understand that the change-over to offset printing by the Stationery Office has been effected.</P>
    <P>An additional £2,500 arises in the provision for travelling and subsistence and is due to the intensification of the campaign for industrial promotion both at home and abroad by officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £15,000 is needed to provide funds to cover the increased costs which Córas Tráchtála are required to meet resulting directly from the devaluation of the pound. These increased costs have arisen in connection with the Board's overseas offices and in connection with particular export promotion projects in areas in which devaluation did not take place.</P>
    <P>The supplementary provision proposed for Córas Tráchtála will bring the total provision for the Board for the current financial year to £732,000. <Col N="192" /> Failure to provide the additional funds necessary to meet these increased costs would involve some reduction in the services provided for exporters by Córas Tráchtála.  I am sure the House appreciates the necessity of maintaining these services so that the momentum of our export drive shall in no way slacken in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>The excess of £60,000 on technical assistance is due to increased expenditure on grants for private minerals exploration.  The original provision for minerals exploration included under Subhead L was £11,000.  Actual expenditure has to date amounted to £83,640, an excess of £72,640.  The increased expenditure is due to additional assistance made available in respect of development in the coal industry. Grants for private minerals exploration are repayable by way of a royalty on commercial production.  The excess of £72,640 is offset to some extent by savings on other projects covered by the technical assistance subhead.</P>
    <P>The British Temporary Charge on Imports, or levy, which was imposed in October, 1964, ended on the 30th November, 1966.  Deputies will be aware of the arrangement whereby exporters who had to pay this charge on their exports received from us a grant of 40 per cent or, in cases of exceptional difficulty, 50 per cent of the amount of levy paid.  Obviously payments from State funds were bound to continue for some time after the levy was withdrawn.  It was expected, however, that the bulk of the amounts due to exporters would have been paid by the end of the 1966-67 financial year and this has been so.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, applications for payments in respect of exports prior to 30th November, 1966, have continued to come from exporters right through 1967-68 and are still being received. These apparent delays were due in part to difficulties some exporters met in trying to get the necessary documents from clearance agents and other people in Britain and also to delays in settling final assessments of levy with the British customs, for example, in cases where there was a dispute about the value of a particular consignment, or where other problems <Col N="193" /> arose.  The amount of £200,000 provided in the estimates for 1967-68 for these claims was insufficient and it is now estimated that an additional sum of £120,000 will be needed in the current year.</P>
    <P>When I approached the House on 9th March, 1967, for further moneys to subsidise the operations at Castlecomer Collieries, I mentioned that exploratory work had indicated the presence of an extensive deposit of coal and that there was then the question of gaining access to this new deposit and proving if it could be extracted economically.  I then expressed the hope that viable working of the mine would be achieved by this effort.  So far, I am afraid that this has not proved to be the case.  A number of factors, some of them perhaps temporary but some more basic, have worked against it.  Losses are continuing and the amount sought by the present Supplementary Estimate, £65,000, represents the further advances which have been or will be made to the company in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I regret I am not in a position to assure the House that economic working of the mine can be foreseen in the immediate future.  I am giving urgent attention to the matter.  The House will understand that there are serious social and other considerations involved.  In the meantime, I have to ask the House to agree to the provision of this sum to cover the amount needed in the present financial year to keep the mine in operation and maintain employment.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the national campaign to persuade Irish industry to prepare for freer trading conditions needs to be revised and intensified by a special effort aimed at securing much greater involvement at individual and local level by all whose interests are vitally affected.  The reason, of course, is the dependence of the economic progress of our people on the degree to which they fit themselves to grasp the opportunities and overcome the difficulties which free trading conditions will put in their way.</P>
    <P>A decision has, therefore, been taken by the Government approving of proposals <Col N="194" /> to organise and run a National Productivity Year commencing in September, 1968.  Its main objectives will be to bring home to all concerned the need for adaptation to meet the new conditions and for greater concentration on marketing strategy.  The need for more widespread and more radical adaptation in many firms is unquestioned in the face of the highly competitive conditions which firms here will have to meet for the first time.</P>
    <P>The need for greater attention to marketing matters also arises from the same conditions but more particularly from the fact that this is an area where many Irish firms have little or no expertise by modern standards.  All but a few such firms have been selling on a protected home market and this was not conducive to the development of such expertise.  At the same time significant new marketing techniques were being developed abroad which were giving marketing a new and critical importance for industry.  Irish firms must quickly catch up in this area.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the National Productivity Year will be made by a small working group which has been appointed by a steering committee representative of all the interests concerned. Management and labour and the public sector are represented on the committee.  The management members come from many industrial sectors&mdash; manufacturing, distributive, agricultural, fishing and building.  The Irish National Productivity Committee will be the main agent in co-ordinating and promoting the arrangements for National Productivity Year.</P>
    <P>Details of the arrangements have not yet been worked out.  At this stage all I am asking the House to do is to indicate their support for the general idea of a National Productivity Year.  I am confident that this support will be forthcoming from all Parties.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the total cost involved will be about £92,000 of which about £2,500 will be required in the current year 1967-68.  The total extent of the increased expenditure amounts to £274,490 but this will be offset by <Col N="195" /> a surplus of £22,000 on appropriations in aid.  In addition there will be a saving of £252,480 on the provision under Subhead J for An Foras Tionscal. Accordingly the net amount required is £10.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the passing of this Supplementary Estimate.  There are certain matters, however, that must be mentioned arising on various subheads.  I would like, first of all, to give the Minister an undertaking from this side of the House that he will receive every support in his project for a National Productivity Year.  I note that one of the items that will be pushed forward during the National Productivity Year is making people aware of the necessity for adaptation, for making their business or industry ready for change.  I am amazed that is all he said because it would have opened up for him the position of being able to discuss what he intends to do to encourage adaptation. Only a few days ago, he utilised a different venue to indicate this and as spokesman for the main Opposition Party on Industry and Commerce, I am relying on the report which appeared in one paper&mdash;apparently his speech was too late for the others and only appeared in one.  I do not read the <i>Irish Press</i>.  He took the opportunity of addressing Cumann Mhichíl Uí Annracháin, Fianna Fáil, in Dublin, last Thursday and he is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, March 1st.  He gave details of changes in relation to the application of adaptation grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to pass a small sum to start off this National Productivity Year in September, 1968, and presumably a much larger sum, around £90,000, the following year.  He is asking us to co-operate with him and I am assuring him of that co-operation. However, it is not very helpful to us in this House if, when introducing his Supplementary Estimate and dealing with matters such as adaptation grants, the Minister says nothing about changes which he announced to Cumann <Col N="196" /> Mhichíl Uí Annracháin, Fianna Fáil, in Dublin last Thursday night.  I take the gravest exception to the fact, and I observe that some leading articles have been written since about it, that this House was not told in the first instance of a change in the system of giving adaptation grants and that, in the second instance, an opportunity to discuss it has now passed with the introduction of the Estimate without one word about the changes he announced last Thursday.</P>
    <P>I do not know who this gentleman is &mdash;whether he is alive or dead&mdash;but I mean no discourtesy to Micheál Ó hAnnracháin, alive or dead, when I say that surely he is not as important as Dáil Éireann.  The Minister, like many other Fianna Fáil Ministers, is blinded by the importance of his own organisation and he has done a disservice and rendered a discourtesy to the Members of Dáil Éireann in announcing to Cumann Mhichíl Uí Annracháin last Thursday what these changes are, while here he introduces a Supplementary Estimate which is to provide money to publicise this project and to make everybody aware of what he can do in relation to adaptation grants and he does not mention those changes.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise too much the discourtesy of a Fianna Fáil Minister who would do that sort of thing.  Relying as I do on the usually most responsible reporting of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> I find that what the Minister is going to do&mdash;as far as I can understand from the report, and not having had the courtesy of a handout from either the Minister or the Government Information Bureau&mdash;is to provide adaptation grants not only for something that is classified by An Foras Tionscal as major adaptation but also for the replacement of plant, buying new machines and that sort of thing.  I would refer him to previous speeches made by Fine Gael spokesmen and myself in which we advocated this step. Speaking on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, I referred the Minister to the distance he was lagging behind Northern Ireland in that regard where all one has to do is to buy the plant, send the invoice to the Ministry and get back the adaptation grant.  One does <Col N="197" /> not have to get oneself classified as doing a major adaptation.</P>
    <P>It is very important that these things should be remembered, that policies of individual Parties should be recorded and that the adoption of such policies by other Parties should also be recorded, and I would refer the House to a speech which I made at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis on May 10th, 1967.  I referred to the Fine Gael policy in this regard and said it was to extend adaptation grants to existing industries, whether their products were for export or not, and to end the system whereby certain industries were subject to a blanket refusal for the grants.  There are other items of industrial policy with which I will deal at another time as I am not allowed to do so now under Standing Orders.  It is quite clear that what the Minister is doing is what we adopted as our policy before last May and which we announced last May.  He has been guilty of a great discourtesy in not announcing it here in this House and in going to the faithful few, who are getting fewer and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  It may be that mention of these adaptation grants may have given the impression that this matter was being provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.  As I understand it, they are not.  While I was interested to hear what Deputy Donegan had to say about Fine Gael policy being implemented by Fianna Fáil, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that this does not seem to be relevant to this discussion.</P>

      <P>Sir, I would refer you to the Minister's speech.  Under the heading &ldquo;National Productivity Year&rdquo;, the Minister states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision has, therefore, been taken by the Government approving of proposals to organise and run a National Productivity Year commencing in September, 1968.  Its main objectives will be to bring home to all concerned the need for adaptation to meet the new conditions and for greater concentration on marketing strategy.  The need for <Col N="198" /> more widespread and more radical adaptation in many firms is unquestioned in the face of the highly competitive conditions which firms here will have to meet for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to deal with marketing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was being kind then.  When the Minister introduced his main Estimate, he indicated there was likely to be a falling-off in the numbers coming here to establish new industries. This is very serious.  I have some figures here which indicate that, if we are to have full employment by 1980, we shall need an 8.5 per cent annual increase in output and a 7,000 average increase in employment.  I am fully aware that this, of course, has to take care of people leaving agriculture as agriculture becomes more efficient.  But, if there is a falling-off in the number coming here, there must be some reason for that falling-off.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the policy of the Government has meant that Ireland is becoming less attractive from the point of view of the establishment of new industries. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was something with which every sensible man agreed, but, even with that, the situation is that our costs here are becoming higher and, as restrictive action by the Government becomes more prevalent, Ireland becomes less attractive to industrialists from the point of view of establishing industries here.  The Minister, when introducing his main Estimate, indicated this would happen.  It has happened. Worse still, a figure of between £10 million and £15 million in grants for new industry was wasted.  I do not want to go through the long list of failures, but they are far too numerous for comfort and blame attaches to the Government particularly in regard to loans of more than £250,000 under Taiscí Stáit legislation.  These loans are granted direct by Cabinet decision and grave blame is due to the Government in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take into consideration the prospects for the coming year.  We are going to spend less and we are more worried about the coming year.  We are facing&mdash;it is time the country realised it&mdash;the biggest range of wage demands ever asked for in this country.  That does not start with the working man at all.  The Minister for Agriculture who was at one stage Minister for Local Government will be aware that right through the local government service <Col N="200" /> wage demands of as much as £500 and £700 a year have been lodged in the proper place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, of course, aware that this Supplementary Estimate relates to the present year and not to the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but I am adverting to the fact that we have saved £250,000 in grants for new industry because new industries did not come or their quality was such, when they did come, that we did not give them the grants.  I am pointing out that there will be fewer in the coming year, if I read the indications aright.  I will pass from it as quickly as I can because I do not want to get involved, but the position is that we are faced with this wage demand of round about 30 per cent when one takes into account the increase per hour, the service-pay and extra holidays.  These are now standard. The position is that the country is becoming, because of Fianna Fáil activity, a place less attractive from the point of view of the establishment of industry.  I do not want to go any further than that because emphasis might not do us any good, but it is right to record the fact that that is the situation.</P>
      <P>Extra money is being provided for Córas Tráchtála.  That body is doing a good job.  It has brought untold benefits.  It is helpful to everybody and industrialists are received by Córas Tráchtála with open arms.  Some sort of Government agency was necessary particularly from the point of view of the small firms.  We all welcome the expansion of Córas Tráchtála and we trust that expansion will be efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Castlecomer, I am sorry the Minister is not in a position to tell us that he found a new seam and things are all right.  I exhort him to continue investigations and not to give up too soon.  I have personal experience of using Irish anthracite and, at present day prices, it is the most efficient fuel one can get.  I suppose the reason our hospitals and State institutions were not allowed to use Irish anthracite was that they were restricted to using turf.  Irish anthracite is not <Col N="201" /> suitable for cooking because of the high arsenic content but it is a fuel which, price for price and thermal unit per thermal unit, is cheaper than oil, coal or turf.  The miners who are employed there have just as good a right to their jobs as the men employed on the Bord na Móna bogs.  This is something that should be expanded and I express my sympathy with the Minister that he has not so far been able to give us good news.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance grants are good and we would like to see them developed.  In general, apart from the Minister's despicable behaviour in relation to the change in the industrial adaptation grants, we welcome this National Productivity Year and we assure the Minister that we will give him every co-operation, as we have always done, in every effort to create a new job or to defend an old one.  I may say in passing that it was in 1956 that the Industrial Grants Act and the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act were passed and this was the first step towards the expansion of our industrial base.  This was the first effort, made by Deputy Sweetman and the late Deputy William Norton, to get away from the supply basis and it was the first realisation that exports must be our main gambit.  I find the conversion of Fianna Fáil to that policy welcome, if belated.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that in this Supplementary Estimate there is no sign of any acceleration of the establishment of industrial estates such as those now being built in Limerick and Galway. It is evident that Fianna Fáil are shirking the decision on where they should be located and the ignoring of Sligo, the gateway of the West, in this connection is absolutely ludicrous.  The time for decisions is passing and the loss to the people of the West is considerable indeed.  I do not wish to deal with any further items in this Estimate except to say that we have no objection to it and that we realise that, under certain subheads, considerable benefits will accrue to Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by saying on behalf of the Labour Party that we <Col N="202" /> welcome this Estimate and personally I welcome it because the Castlecomer Collieries are specifically mentioned in it.  I want to stress again the importance of continuing financial aid to this area and to press for a long-term policy in relation to the Castlecomer mines.  The assistance being given at the moment is very welcome but it is of a piecemeal kind and leaves the future of the mines in doubt.  The sooner the Minister tackles this problem of making a long-term decision, possibly over a period of ten years or longer, the greater will be his help towards the success of the undertaking.</P>
      <P>There are some difficulties at present and one of these is due to the manpower situation.  This, I think, is due to the uncertainty of the future and to the piecemeal nature of the assistance being given up to the present.  While saying that, I want to stress the importance of keeping up that assistance.  It is providing employment in an area that needs employment; it is helping a worthwhile national undertaking, because, this is an industry that should not be allowed to die out in any circumstances. If work should cease for any period of time, we all know that the reopening of the mines would be both difficult and costly.  We hope that in the not too distant future the Minister will decide on a long-term policy. If that is done, it will increase the flow of manpower to the mines and make for greater confidence in the future.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to one or two other items in the Estimate, the first being the increase to Córas Tráchtála, which the Minister points out is due to the devaluation of the pound.  This increase covers the amount that has been lost in the previous Estimate due to devaluation, but I think something extra should be provided for Córas Tráchtála in order that they can take advantage of devaluation.  There are spheres in which advantage of devaluation can and should be taken and it would be a good investment to increase the aid in those particular spheres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are still assisting industry which was affected by the British import levy is an indication of the serious and widespread effect which <Col N="203" /> that levy had on certain industries.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome the announcement of the National Productivity Year and to wish it every success.  It is most important that it should be successful. I interpret what the Minister said regarding the National Productivity Year as a very alarming warning to Irish industry.  He said:</P>
    <P>The need for more widespread and more radical adaptation in many firms is unquestioned in the face of the highly competitive conditions which firms here will have to meet for the first time.</P>
    <P>Further on, he says:</P>
    <P>All but a few such firms have been selling on a protected home market and this was not conducive to the development of such expertise.  At the same time significant new marketing techniques were being developed abroad which were giving marketing a new and critical importance for industry.  Irish firms must quickly catch up in this area.</P>
    <P>The part of his statement I want to refer to is where he says we must catch up.  That is a confession on the part of the Government that Irish industry is behind.  I hope the National Productivity Year, with the co-operation of management and labour, will be a success.  I notice in all such undertakings that it is those who need the exercise least who partake in them the most.  Those who need the exercise do not avail themselves of it.  Some more compelling method should be used to induce those firms who go their own way and take little notice of efforts such as this to participate.  In the long run, it is the employees of those industries who suffer.  Some firms I know are very slow to shake themselves and take part in exercises of this kind.  They are afraid of change and of new ideas. When the crunch comes, they will just go into liquidation and the workers will be thrown on the scrapheap.  A way should be devised to get those who choose to ignore such proposals to participate in them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the assistance <Col N="204" /> being given to Castlecomer and appeal for a long-term plan for the area as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two things in regard to the Supplementary Estimate on which I want particularly to dwell.  I am afraid that this is another stunt.  The first Programme for Economic Expansion and the Second Programme broke up and we heard no more about them.  Now we are to have a National Productivity Year.  That would be a very useful exercise if it had regard to realities.  I want to suggest to the House that we are far too much given to publicity exercises which have no regard to realities at all.  There are two realities relative to increased productivity in this country, both of which this Government firmly turns their back upon.  One was referred to by Deputy Donegan&mdash;inflation.  I am not going to go into a long discourse on the subject of inflation at this time, but increased productivity at increased production costs is a complete illusion. If we allow the costs of production to rise, as they are bound to rise in sustained inflation, we have as much chance of maintaining increased productivity as a snowball has of growing in volume in the Sahara Desert.  Fianna Fáil do not want to face realities. They have become obsessed with this detestable system of gimmickry in Government.  Gimmickry is the exact opposite of realism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing Fianna Fáil turn their back on is the new world into which we are moving.  There was recently published an article in a monthly review called <i>Encounter</i> dealing with what I think they called the &ldquo;autonomic age&rdquo;.  They were inventing a new word.  In more familiar language, it is the cybernetic age.  I think the use of the word &ldquo;cybernetic&rdquo; causes the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries some dismay in that he thinks that is an extravagantly novel expression. If this National Productivity Year induced industry, the trade union movement and the Government to go out and familiarise themselves with what is happening in the world and what that means for industrial development here, then this National Productivity <Col N="205" /> Year would be of some value to the country.</P>
    <P>I see us engaging in what are for us extremely expensive investments in the establishment of industries that are operating, are planned to operate and are being equipped to operate by methods which were obsolete 20 years ago, methods which were obsolescent before the last World War.  If representatives of industry and trades unions and Córas Tráchtála and An Foras Tionscal would go and see the extent to which automation has taken over whole areas of industry and completely revolutionised the whole concept of its organisation, then we in this country would be equipped to concentrate on promotional activities in areas where there was a real prospect of survival and expansion, but for us to be establishing small units of automated industry and thinking in world terms is to bring on ourselves a double catastrophe.</P>
    <P>The first is that we waste what is for us, a relatively poor country, a very large capital investment because we are investing in something foredoomed to uneconomic operation and therefore foredoomed to exclusion from the export market.  What is even worse is that we draw into such industrial units a whole lot of young men whom we then proceed to train in utterly obsolete procedure for which there is no demand.  When the pressure of the highly developed industries of the world destroys the obsolescent unit we have instituted here, it is not merely a question of a loss of capital.  There is the appalling social problem of the redundant men who have invested ten, 15 or 20 years of their lives learning skills which were obsolete before they started to learn them.</P>
    <P>We have seen certain cases happen in this country in the recent past.  That is nothing to what is likely to happen in the next 20 years if we do not face facts now.  What I am trying to bring home to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that the first essential thing to do in a fresh effort for productivity is to take the long view and make up our minds that there are certain branches in industrial <Col N="206" /> activities which require such vast units in order to permit of their being equipped to function efficiently that they are too big for us to attempt to establish here.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to heavy industry. Deputy Corish will remember this incident well and I make no apology for reminding the House of it.  He and I were guests of the Federal German Republic which is by no means the most sophisticated industrial country in the world to-day and we visited a large iron foundry outside Cologne.  It was in Dusseldorf.  It consisted of four blocks.  In the first block, 300 men were working making steel pipes.  In the second block 300 men were working making steel pipes and there were 300 men working in the third block making steel pipes.  Those pipes were intended to be furnished to the line running from Marseilles to the Rhine to carry Algerian oil.  Then we went into a fourth block which was also producing the same pipes and, in the fourth block, there were 14 men working on a thing like a huge organ console.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a great memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It stopped me in my tracks.  Iron was going in at one end, being melted down and converted into steel.  It went straight through this long block with 14 men operating the controls on separate consoles and came out at the other end as 40 foot lengths of piping.  Water was pumped through them looking for flaws.  They were put on one side if there was a flaw and passed to the production line if there was no flaw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember saying to the general manager of that great iron foundry: &ldquo;If you can do this operation of making these pipes with 14 men, why are you keeping the three other units which have 300 men doing the same job?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;This is the secret, Mr. Dillon.  So long as I have a customer waiting for each length of pipe that comes out, this unit in which you are standing is economic.  I have no storage place for 40 foot lengths of pipe of this gauge.  They must go straight to the point of consumption from the <Col N="207" /> factory outlet.  If we had to stop this unit here, which has recently been built by an American firm, I would lose in a week more than the profit I make on a month's operation.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;What about the other three where you have 300 men in each?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;That is quite different.  Supposing I were notified in the morning that there was no market for my pipes, all the men in the other places are experienced old warriors who have been in the metal industry all their lives.  I could get a contract from the German railways to repair their rolling stock, or I could do 40 jobs.  All those men in the other workshops are highly versatile and could switch over to alternative employment, but the block in which you are standing makes pipes and nothing else but pipes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I am trying to bring home to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is not here, to the Government, the trade union movement, and the employers, is that there are vast spheres in industry now in the United States of America where cybernetics have advanced a generation beyond Europe, which are operating now entirely on the basis of cybernetics and automated control where there is no employment for what we used to call semi-skilled craftsmen.  I am not talking about unskilled labour; I am talking about semi-skilled craftsmen. Machines will wipe them out but, if you segregate these areas of industry which are subject to that kind of development, there remain areas of specialised skilled industry where human skills still count.  It is in those areas that we should seek to expand.  It is in those areas that we should seek to build up the skills which machines cannot as yet supplant.  It is in those areas we should get increased productivity in the certainty that our markets will not be swept away by the economies of automation abroad and that even if for some other reason, a particular enterprise here ceases to function, we can rest assured that the men we have induced into it will have skills which are valuable and saleable anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>I shall not expand further on this <Col N="208" /> Supplementary Estimate, save to emphasise that this special aspect of the problem of increased productivity is possible, and desirable, socially and economically, if it is done in the right way, in an atmosphere of realism and ecletic procedure, choosing those areas of industry where we can reasonably contemplate a reasonable degree of continuity but it can be attended by nothing but disaster if we pour vast sums of money&mdash;vast in our context, considering our resources&mdash;into the development of industries which were obsolete before we began to build them.  That would be economically and socially wrong because it would invite good men to invest something infinitely more precious than capital, that is, their lives, the formative period of their lives from 18 to 35, in the acquisition of skills and expertise which intelligent foresight should warn us are going to be worthless in the middle age of the men who have acquired them.</P>
    <P>That is the cruellest thing that could possibly be done.  We are in a peculiar position in that regard.  Here industry is very largely directed, controlled and oriented by Government policy and therefore fellows entering it enter with a sort of belief that there is a guarantee from the Government that it will pro vide permanence and security.  Therefore, we have a very special responsibility not to mislead those who are investing that which is more precious than money, to persuade them to invest their lives in this type of industry which automation and cybernetics and the new industrial society is not certain to extinguish in the early future and do all we can to develop that.  But let us not throw our resources away in promoting industry foredoomed to failure in the long run.  That and inflation are the two observations I want to make in regard to this Supplementary Estimate and, without much hope, I cherish the dream that some day some Minister for Industry and Commerce may have the intelligence and the courage to take cognisance of what I have said.</P>

      <P>I thought at the beginning that Deputy Dillon was <Col N="209" /> going to prove that the National Productivity Year would be a failure, but I was interested in the point he made about the increase in automation in major industries abroad, with particular reference to development here.  If I understood him correctly, the word &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; was indeed the Siberia for our industries in Ireland but he should and must have regard to the many industries here which are dependent&mdash;they are small, I admit&mdash; more or less on the great skills of our workers and in respect of which automation, if it comes, will not mean a lot.  In many countries where automation has taken over, smaller industries have survived and become viable in the face of increasing markets for articles produced, as we used say, on a mass production line.  We should not regard Deputy Dillon's warnings of doom around the corner as a great threat to many of our existing industries. Many of those that have grown up in recent years such as Waterford cut glass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These were the types of industry where an animal goes in at one end and comes out as a sausage at the other.  We have industries here that have been set up in the past 30 years and we cannot throw them to the winds now.  We must gear them to meet the competition that will come out of our joining or going into Europe and our duty is to look after these industries and, in particular, the men who work in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these industries will not feel the cold wind of automation but they <Col N="210" /> will have to gear themselves to the realities of what entry into Europe means, increased competition, more productivity and the future welfare of workers if they are to be retained in employment.  For that reason the Minister, in his introductory speech, rightly referred to the National Productivity Year.  I welcome this year because I think it should bring home to workers and everybody concerned the absolute necessity for them to gear themselves to meet this challenge which will come.  If our country is to make economic progress, we must be ready to face reality.</P>

      <P>Automation will not come as quickly as Deputy Dillon has said in regard to many of our industries. Automation, as I have read about it, has taken place in Detroit where motorcars, heavy machinery and all the rest are mass-produced.  I admit that there are some factories that will be affected by automation but there are many more that will not; there are many more industries that will either survive or die, having regard to the productivity of the workers concerned in them.  We must put these people on the alert.  There is no better way of putting them on the alert than by the introduction of a National Productivity Year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that we must persuade Irish industry to prepare for freer trading conditions and must secure much greater involvement at individual and local level by all whose interests are vitally affected.  If automation comes, it can have a profound effect on a small country like this and, if it has to come, we all hope it will not come to the degree that we expect. Surely, Deputy Dillon should have some regard to the size of the country we are living in?  It is not the United States of America; it is not the industrial Rhineland of Germany.  We must have regard to the country concerned&mdash; our own country.</P>

      <P>Few people have any idea of the vast amount of money involved in mining.  I come from the Tynagh area where mining has been a great boon.  As far as I can understand from the Minister's statement, grants will be made available to persons engaged in private mining exploration and these grants will be repayable at a later stage, if the mine succeeds, by way of royalties.  I should like to know whether this will apply to private individuals exploring for lead, zinc and all the other minerals that, luckily enough, have been found in Galway, Tipperary and other parts in the West and Midlands because many of us thought that when persons engaged in drilling and mining they had to take the loss themselves. They succeeded in finding minerals more often than not.</P>

      <P>I notice that Córas Tráchtála are being helped and that the extra money required is due to the fact that many of their employees are working abroad and costs have increased because of the devaluation of the £.  I feel sure that none of us will deprive the Department of Industry and Commerce of the money required.  Unlike some Deputies who have spoken, I welcome the National Productivity Year and hope it will secure, as the Minister says, greater involvement at individual and local level by all those whose interests are vitally affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked here for £92,000 for expenses in connection with the National Productivity Year.  May I ask the Minister if it is the intention to engage in this sort of activity for a year only?  This seems to me a very puny effort and one which, while it could be regarded as being late, may not be too late.  The Minister and other Members of the House must recall that when considering not alone the Second Programme but the First Programme for Economic Expansion we asked from these benches that there would be greater consultation between management and labour so that both sides would know exactly what they were at.</P>
      <P>In my view, the reason for the failure of the First and particularly of the Second Programme was that there was not sufficient consultation.  While Ministers, civil servants and economists could read and understand the Second Programme, the person vitally concerned, the man on the shop floor, was not consulted in any way whatsoever. That is the reason for the failure of the Second Programme to a very large extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is going to be only a year's effort, the £92,000 will be completely wasted.  It is a bit late in the day to be introducing this sort of proposal, while, on the other hand, it is welcome. Whether or not we are going into an area of free trade, this sort of activity is necessary.  This was stressed by members of the Labour Party five, six and seven years ago.  There is no use <Col N="213" /> in management knowing what the plan is or their being conversant with the Second Programme; as long as workers and trade unions did not and do not know what is expected of them, a programme cannot succeed in respect of the entire country or in respect of an individual industry.</P>
    <P>It is a sad admission by the Government that their efforts to get Irish industries to gear themselves for free trade have not been a success.  We never believed that the Government's aids to industry and their exhortations to industrialists to re-adapt and fit themselves for free trade would be a success.  There is no use in saying, &ldquo;There is money available for you.  If you like, you can take it up.&rdquo;  There is no use in ministerial speeches, as has been proved.</P>
    <P>I have here a most revealing document, which can be said to be objective, produced in the last week by the Federation of Irish Industries under the title of &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo;.  The Minister must recognise that there is in it a great deal of sound commonsense that, again, let me say, was spoken from these benches when we were discussing free trade and the Second Programme. Of course, there must be consultation. I do not say that this has been deliberately avoided, but no real effort has been made to ensure that this consultation will take place in the cities and the towns and in the factories right down to the ground floor.  The objectives and the plans for the Third Programme, whenever we get it, must be made well known and understood by both management and labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce should utilise to a greater extent and to greater effect the National Industrial and Economic Council.  In my view, this has been an excellent body.  It has produced excellent reports and recommendations some of which have been acted upon by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and others of which have been completely ignored.  If we are to get greater productivity, if we are to adapt ourselves to free trade, whether it is in Europe or elsewhere, the National Industrial and Economic <Col N="214" /> Council must come more and more into the picture.  I do not think industry should, as it does now, work in isolation.  There should be a national plan in the matter of production, whether it is this commodity, that commodity or the other commodity, and we should not have this mad scramble. Each section of industry, in consultation with the Government, should decide what it can do and find out what is expected of it in so far as the national economy is concerned.  This national plan would ensure that there would be the utmost production, in accordance with our requirements, from each and every individual in the country.</P>
    <P>There should be much greater consultation than there is, therefore, between the Government and the National Industrial and Economic Council and industry itself.  Each industry should know what is expected of it and should know what assistance it would receive in carrying out the plans.  It should also be known to them what new measures would be taken in the event of these expansion targets not being reached.</P>
    <P>I have listened for a number of years to talk about aids to industry which, I may say, have in the majority of cases been pretty generous.  Unfortunately they have not been taken up by certain industries.  The greatest assistance seems to be afforded to new industries about to be set up with the assistance of foreign capital, and far too little attention has been given to the old-established industries that did not and could not qualify for State assistance. There has to be a reappraisal of the condition of these industries and there should be proposals from the Government to ensure that they will be assisted, if not to the same extent, as newly-established industries, at least to a greater extent than they are being assisted.</P>
    <P>The Government plan seems to be that certain selected areas will be marked out for industrial development. That is all right as far as these areas are concerned, but I do not think you can afford to ignore small towns with populations ranging from 1,500 up to <Col N="215" /> about 16,000.  We must have regard not alone to the actual industries in these towns but to the public amenities that are there: houses, schools, hospitals, churches, streets, lighting, water and sewerage.  These are things we cannot afford to waste.  These are things to which we must have regard when we think about the establishment and development of industry.  We are only creating trouble for ourselves if we establish industry in isolated places, knowing that the community will have to provide houses, schools, hospitals and the different other amenities that are available in the towns at the present time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of a National Productivity campaign, but I am sure the Minister does not mean that it will obtain for a year only.  By that time the idea of consultation will only have seeped through to management and possibly to workers as well.  All too seldom have we any sort of consultation between management and labour. In the main, the only time we have consultation is when there is a dispute between management and labour, when there is a demand for a wage increase, for a shortening of hours or when somebody is sacked.</P>
    <P>If our industries are to progress as the Minister would have them progress and as the Government envisage that they should, consultation is essential. This consultation should have been encouraged by the Government long ago.  Management have always been reluctant to let workers know what their plans are as far as industry is concerned. In many cases the only intimation workers have that the industry is not going well is, perhaps, when they get 24 hours notice that they are going to be sacked.  If this National Productivity campaign will do the job of getting workers and management together for their mutual interest, then it will be a very good thing, but I am doubtful if it can get off the ground within the year which, according to his opening address, is now proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like <Col N="216" /> to apologise to the House for being unable to be present for all of the debate as I was engaged in the other House.  I got some notes of the points that were made and I will endeavour to deal with them as well as I can in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might begin at the end in regard to the point made by Deputy Corish on the National Productivity Year.  The position is, of course, that for a very long time efforts have been made in various directions and, in particular, through the Irish National Productivity Committee, to raise our standards of productivity.  These efforts will continue during the National Productivity Year and thereafter.  There is no question of our losing interest in productivity at the end of the National Productivity Year.  Rather is it intended to lay particular emphasis on the aspects of national productivity with which the economy may be concerned, to highlight the problems and some of the solutions, we hope, and thereby, through spreading a little knowledge and awareness of the problems and the possible solutions, ensure that we as a nation will do better in this field.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have noticed from the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate that it is intended that the National Productivity Year should lay particular stress on two things: adaptation to meet free trading conditions and marketing strategy.  These are very important matters to us at the present time.  It will be realised that, in the nature of things and having regard to the manner in which our industries have been built up, largely in a protected home market, our industry has tended to be production-orientated rather than market-orientated.</P>
      <P>Talking of the National Productivity Year does not mean that we are concerned merely with production; in fact, for many of our industries marketing is a much greater problem than production. This is in the context of their selling on the export market and it is intended to highlight the problems and, as I say, the solutions with which we should be concerned during the course of the National Productivity Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies may be mistaken, in <Col N="217" /> particular Deputy Corish judging by something he said, in regard to the progress of adaptation.  When I talk about adaptation.  I do not mean physical adaptation only, because there is a great deal more to it than that, but physical adaptation is the first stage which must be tackeld.  In that connection, while nobody is satisfied with what has been achieved, nevertheless we should not underestimate what has been achieved because, on foot of grants approved by An Foras Tionscal for adaptation, there is a commitment to pay almost £70 million between grants and contributions from industry itself towards physical adaptation.  This is a very substantial sum and represents a very great effort at physical adaptation in many sectors of industry. Let me repeat that this does not mean that I am satisfied with the level we have achieved, and nobody should be satisfied with it, but because we are not satisfied we should not run away with the idea that nothing has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, this scheme of adaptation grants applied to existing industry and of course was almost exclusively used by, and available to, native industry. It is important that it should be realised that, while we have been offering attractions and inducements to foreign industry, the same attractions and inducements were available to home industry.  In addition, we had these adaptation grants and we have, further, the new scheme for re-equipment grants which I announced recently, at 25 per cent in most of the country and 35 per cent in the undeveloped areas.  This will apply again to existing industries which are reequipping themselves.  It should be clear therefore that there is no question of ignoring native industries.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might also comment, when I am talking about the re-equipment grants, on the point raised about the manner in which I announced those grants.  I announced them at a public meeting organised by a Fianna Fáil cumann in my constituency.  That meeting had been arranged a long time ago for the last day of February and the schemes which I announced were coming into operation on the following day, March 1st.  I understand that exception <Col N="218" /> was taken to the fact that I made the announcement at a function organised by a Fianna Fáil cumann and I have seen some press comment on this.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, first of all, that anyone who says that Ministers should make announcements of these schemes in the Dáil, and who implies that Ministers should not make these announcements anywhere else, is either unaware of the procedure of the House or is deliberately suppressing his knowledge of that procedure in order to create a certain impression.</P>
    <P>As you know, Sir, it is not feasible for Ministers to make announcements of this nature in the Dáil unless there happens to be a coinciding of the time when the announcement can be made with a suitable opportunity under the procedure of the House.  Therefore the suggestion that Ministers are in some way remiss in not availing of Dáil Éireann to make these announcements is based either on ignorance or on an attempt to mislead.  Secondly, criticism was made that on the same day on which I made this announcement, I attended a function organised by the Federation of Irish Industries and that this would have been a suitable occasion for me to make the announcement. It is true I did attend such a function. That function was organised by the Federation to publicise through the communications media the booklet which they have just issued and which was referred to by Deputy Corish, arising out of their study of free trade conditions&mdash;a very valuable document, I may say&mdash;but anybody who knows anything about these things will appreciate that the Federation of Irish Industries would not have thanked me if on that occasion I made the announcement which I made later that day because it would have served only to distract attention from the message they were trying to put across.  My attendance was designed to assist them and not to confuse the issue.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to say that I get the impression that people who object to an announcement such as I made being made at a function organised by a Fianna Fáil unit would not object if the announcement were made to a <Col N="219" /> chamber of commerce or some similar body.  I have no objection to chambers of commerce and, in fact, I attend many of their meetings, annual dinners and so on, but I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, Fianna Fáil supporters and Fianna Fáil members are not lepers in this country and have as much right as any other body to be treated with courtesy and to be treated in the same way as other bodies.</P>
    <P>If such announcements as I have referred to can be made at these bodies without objection, it seems to me there should not be any objection to an announcement being made in the manner in which I made it.  I do not say that all such announcements should be made at functions organised by Fianna Fáil groups.  Indeed, we all know there are not so many and, in fact, they are fairly rare, but when they occur, it strikes me that there is something in the nature or the mentality of those who object which suggests that Fianna Fáil people are people apart and not to be treated in the same way as other citizens.  The fact that they are roughly half the voting population should of itself give the lie to that, apart from their inherent rights as citizens.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the saving in the subhead for the capital provided for An Foras Tionscal.  The fact is that An Foras Tionscal find it difficult to estimate accurately their requirements in respect of grants because so many factors arise which are outside their control.  It depends on the speed at which the firms involved proceed with their schemes and this in turn depends on such factors as the acquisition of sites, the building of factories, the rate at which they are built, weather conditions and other matters which can arise and which are outside the control of An Foras Tionscal who pay the money when the work is done.  Therefore, for them to estimate beyond two or three months with any great degree of accuracy is impossible. The reduction here is not so much a reduction as an error in estimation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred to Castlecomer <Col N="220" /> Collieries and wanted a long term decision on them.  He criticised what he thought was a piecemeal approach to the help being given there. I would agree with him in principle but the matter is not as simple as it may appear.  I would hope that it will be possible shortly to make some long-term decision on this.  I should say, I think, that the difficulty lies in establishing that the mine will be economically viable in the long term.  This question is being examined.  The fact cannot be ignored that the hopes held out when previous subventions were made by this House have not been realised.  I do not think I should disguise that.  The long-term viability of this mine is certainly open to question and the position is being studied closely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison felt more money should be provided for Córas Tráchtála to enable our exporters to reap the benefits of devaluation.  With this Supplementary Estimate, Córas Tráchtála will, in fact, have £132,000 more in 1967-68 than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Dillon complained that the Government are promoting industries which are using obsolete methods and ignoring automation. I should say that some of the acknowledged leaders in industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt it would be impossible to paraphrase a speech by Deputy Dillon, but, without wishing to misrepresent him in any way, I understand this was the gist of one of his criticisms.  If that is correct, I want to point out that some of the acknowledged leaders in industry in the field of automation have, in fact, set up in Ireland and all Irish industries are being encouraged by technical assistance grants to employ consultants in all the latest techniques suitable for their particular industry.  The Government, as the House knows, pays half the cost of engaging these consultants. When they recommend schemes grants are made available towards the cost of implementing the schemes for the improvement of the performances of <Col N="221" /> the industry concerned which, in many cases, means the use of the most up-to-date methods, techniques and machinery.  In addition, the Government is itself employing American consultants of acknowledged eminence to advise on the types of industry that can be successfully established here and that can compete in an automated world.</P>
      <P>We should remember that one of the great advantages we have as a location for industry is our manpower and automation might not, therefore, be quite so important as yet here as it would be in a country short of labour. I want to stress that the objective we have in encouraging industry of any kind, whether it be the establishment of new industry or the adaptation of existing industry, is to ensure that those industries are established which are designed to give the maximum employment consistent with their viability in free trade conditions.  That means that, apart from the special cases of industries which can exist in free trade conditions with very little competition, the others have to be competitive and have, therefore, to be as well equipped and as well managed as their competitors.</P>

      <P>I was referring last night to the two proposals which are before the House in these Bills and to the fact that it does not help discussion or <Col N="225" /> understanding of the business before the House to suggest that their adoption would result in jack-boot dictatorship and further to suggest that those opposing them are solely interested in the defence of democracy in this country.  I submit that it would be reasonable for the uncommitted voter who may be confused, and has reason to be confused, in that the Fine Gael Party which, in its own interest, should be supporting these Bills, is not doing so and that the Fianna Fáil Party which, in its own interest should be opposing them, is not doing so, to find out to whose advantage are these proposals and to find out the relation of everybody who supports them or who opposes them to his own advantage and to the national advantage.  I further submit that such a non-committed voter would do well to weigh up the benefits to each Party in the light of these advantages as he sees them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposal for a tolerance between different constituencies, I may say that what is proposed now to be put to the people is the system which we have operated in this country for 40 years.  It is exactly the system agreed to unanimously by all the Parties in the Dáil and subsequently upset by a High Court decision.  How has this system suddenly become a matter of grinding down minorities when it operated successfully all those years?  Or was it all wrong then to agree to it?  Or has it been wrong for 40 years?  I would suggest that during that time we were operating a system which suited the requirements of this country.  All of us know the great importance of county boundaries and we know that this system of dividing up constituencies was in accordance with our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That method had to be changed by a decision of the High Court, a decision based on the interpretation of one word in the Constitution.  There have been suggestions that we in Fianna Fáil have been denigrating that decision or the judge who made it.  There is no such intention as far as we are concerned.  What we do say is that the system under which we operated was a system agreed to by all the Parties, the importance of which could only be <Col N="226" /> understood by practising politicians. The eminent judge concerned acted within the strict limits of the law and arrived at a decision.  I do not dispute that he was correct in law.  The fact that he did so does not mean that the people should be deprived of something they understand, something they have watched in operation for 40 years.  It does not help people to a fair and deliberate assessment of these proposals to suggest that this is a decision seeking to undermine democracy in this country when one remembers that the system now proposed is the system we used for so long and the system which was agreed to by all Parties.</P>
    <P>The question of the difficulties which can arise in a constituency between members of the same Party is one to which the Taoiseach has referred.  All of us in this House are aware of examples of this kind of thing and few of us can believe that it is to the benefit of the people or of democracy that this should be so.  I know that the Labour Party have not got experience of this because they do not have more than one Deputy in any one constituency. They may have experience of it in the local bodies but the fact that the Labour Party have not got experience of this in the Dáil is no reason for stating that it does not exist and that it is wrong to try to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>If the people could see an actual count going on under our system of proportional representation, and could see that it is not proportional, if they could see that in the case of the elimination of anybody upon the first count, the procedure by which the surplus is distributed is by taking the top bundle, they would understand that the system is not proportional at all.  If they could look further, they would see how frequently there are cases of people who vote for a fairly popular candidate who fails to be elected and whose votes do not count at all, whereas there are other cases of people who vote for an unpopular candidate and can have up to their twelfth preferences counted.  People who vote for a popular candidate may not have their first preferences counted.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned yesterday, I was describing the procedure laid down statutorily for dealing with planning appeals under the present system, the system which the Opposition propose to change.  I pointed out it was prescribed that the appeal must be made in writing, that it must state the subject matter of the appeal and the grounds of the appeal.  This is in order that the Minister will give a copy of the appeal and the grounds of the appeal to each party to the appeal.  The Minister must allow them a reasonable time in which to make any observations they think fit.  This is part of the statutory procedure that must be followed.  When people make observations on the grounds of the appeal, a copy must be given by the Minister to every other party to the appeal.  If the Minister requires any special document or information to be submitted by any <Col N="228" /> party, that document or information may be inspected by any other party to the appeal.  I am quite well aware that the facts of the situation do not interest Deputy L'Estrange in the least, but this purports to be a Bill to amend the present system and I thought it might conceivably be that some member of the Opposition would be interested in what the facts are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past four days, I was dealing with the irrelevant matters raised by the Opposition.  Since the Minister is obliged to deal with an appeal as if the application had been made to him in the first instance, he may find it necessary to deal with issues other than those raised by the parties to the appeal, but he cannot consider such issues unless he has first brought them to the notice of the parties and afforded them an opportunity to make observations on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any party to an appeal may request an oral hearing either when the appeal is made or at any time subsequently until the appeal is determined and unless the party who requested the oral hearing withdraws the request an oral hearing must be held.  In addition, the Minister may on his own initiative decide to hold an oral hearing.  This has been done on a number of occasions when it appeared to be warranted by public interest in the particular case.  The person appointed by the Minister to conduct an oral hearing is obliged to conduct the hearing without undue formality and to permit any party to appear in person or to be represented by another person.  He also has discretion to hear any person who is not actually a party to the appeal and in practice everybody who appears <Col N="229" /> at the hearing and expresses a desire to make a statement is allowed to do so.  When the oral hearing has been concluded, the person who conducted the hearing furnishes a report and the Minister is obliged to consider this report before giving any decision in the appeal.</P>
    <P>I think it must be accepted that the procedure is as fair and open as anyone could wish.  These regulations were laid before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the Act and could have been annulled by resolution of either House. No such resolution was proposed. Although the system when introduced was new and untried, I am not aware that there has been any criticism of these provisions.  Deputies opposite have repeated the phrase that not only must justice be done but must also be seen to be done.  In my opinion, this procedure ensures this.  It is as fair and open as it can be, consistent with the avoidance of unnecessary delay.  The appeal system has been devised to operate as fairly as possible for persons from all walks of life. Deputies from all Parties have made representations to me from time to time about various appeals, but I am quite sure the pattern of the results of these representations would be the same in all cases.  I say quite definitely that, in deciding an appeal, it is of no concern to me which Party the applicant supported or who made representations on his behalf.  This could be clearly shown by an examination of the decisions I have given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of no concern to me and should be of no concern to any Minister for Local Government.  I have not implied it was of any concern to any Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to be clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that, if anybody wanted to make similar implications with regard to Deputy P. O'Donnell, it could be done.  Cases could be produced that would <Col N="230" /> make it possible to make such imputations. If Deputies opposite were sincere, they would co-operate with me in trying to make this clear to the public rather than trying to make it appear that the opposite is the case.  The Act of 1963 is much more specific than the Act of 1934.  No Minister for Local Government deciding appeals under the present Act could afford to deal with them in the manner in which Deputy P. O'Donnell said he dealt with them when he was Minister.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, planning appeals involve a heavy load on me, and I would willingly divest myself of the load if I could be satisfied that a satisfactory alternative existed.  As I said, I am having the whole question examined afresh.  In the meantime, I would like to stress that appeals are not decided primarily on legal questions but on planning questions.  For this reason, it should not be necessary for applicants to incur heavy legal costs in pursuing these appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is obvious that the Opposition were not serious in putting down this Bill.  The debate has shown that the real purpose was to make these unfounded allegations.  I am quite satisfied that I have shown that my decisions were justified in the cases that have been mentioned and I have no doubt that the same could be done with regard to any other cases that may be referred to later.  I have also shown how easy it would be to make similar charges in respect of an Opposition Minister for Local Government.  I appreciate that it might be wise to try to forestall the contributions which are still to come from those Opposition Deputies who have not been not allowed by the Whips to speak so far.  But since these cases come in at a faster rate than they could be dealt with here during Private Members' Time, this would mean that there would be no other speakers in the debate and that the debate would never end.  I have noticed some slight indications of impatience in the Opposition benches.  Because I do not want to do this&mdash;desirable though it might be from my own point it might be from my own point of view to anticipate further cases that might be raised&mdash;I have decided to cut <Col N="231" /> short my own contribution to the debate.</P>
    <P>To establish the case that the Opposition have been trying to make, it would be necessary to establish, as I have shown, that bodies like An Taisce, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Bord Fáilte, the Irish Mountaineering Club and an assorted selection of people with a close association with the Opposition Parties, not to mention such well-known members of Taca as W. Brendan Allen, Lord Sligo and Deputy Belton are all corrupt.  While I am thoroughly satisfied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the case Deputy Cosgrave made.  As I was saying, I am thoroughly satisfied with the present method of processing appeals but, at the same time, I should like to have a different method of deciding on them.  I will make the Opposition a present of the admission that I do not like to be in a position which, because it involves deciding these appeals, makes me a suitable target for their campaign of slander but, so long as it is my duty to decide these appeals, I intend to decide them and, much as it may displease the people who think that their particular view on any matter is the only one that is relevant, I intend to consider all aspects before making a decision and I am not prepared to hide behind the claim that I put my name to what I am told, as Deputy P. O'Donnell stated was his practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The most powerful speech in support of the Bill at present being considered by the House has taken seven hours to be delivered and has been made by the Minister for Local Government.  I think it is the longest speech we have ever heard in the House.  The next longest was made by Deputy Paddy Smith years ago when he spoke for 6½ hours on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. The Minister for Local Government has spoken for seven hours on this Bill and the whole burden of his speech, as he himself has said, has been to demonstrate the possibility&mdash; and I am sure he did not mean to demonstrate his own ability&mdash;of aspersing the integrity of his own predecessor in office.  Of course he wound up his seven hours oration by a kind of lame disclaimer of the disagreeable and rather smelly procedure of trying to asperse the reputation of his predecessor in office by reference to the files in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all that Deputy Boland, Minister for Local Government, said during the seven hours he has been speaking on <Col N="233" /> this Bill is true, does it not present an absolutely irresistible case for the Bill which we have submitted to Dáil Éireann?  The Minister says he dislikes the present system.  He says, as Minister, that it interferes with the due performance of his duties as Minister for Local Government and as a member of the Government.  He represents himself as burning the midnight oil until 11 o'clock on Christmas Eve deciding planning appeals.  He says that, unlike Deputy P. O'Donnell, he has familiarised himself with a summary at least of every file upon which his signature was required.  Frankly, I do not believe him.  It is like my friend Deputy Chub O'Connor from Kerry who told us last week that he wrote 26,000 letters per annum to his constituents in Kerry. These are flights of fancy which we excuse in such a highly regarded colleague as Deputy Chub O'Connor.  I do not think he expects us to believe him.  These are the trimmings and frills of a Deputy who is making himself heard in order to fill in the period of time assigned to him by the Whips for obstruction.  It is another story when the Minister for Local Government formally tells the House that, unlike his predecessor in office, he has always considered it his duty to consider every single planning appeal laid before him. I do not believe him.</P>

      <P>Oh, no; I never aspersed Deputy O'Connor.  I am now referring to Deputy P. O'Donnell who, when he was Minister for Local Government, adopted what seemed to me the sane and rational approach of selecting a number of officers of his Department whom he considered to be responsible and delegated to them substantially the function of determining whether the decision of the local planning authority should be sustained or reversed.  I have not the slightest doubt that, if he got representations from any Member of the Dáil on any side of the House about some particular planning decision, he would say to the responsible officers: &ldquo;There is a letter from Deputy So-and-So.  When you get that, please direct my attention to it as I shall have to give him some explanation of our decision on the appeal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I remember being in correspondence with the present Minister's predecessor because somebody wanted to build a public convenience under somebody's drawingroom window in the town of Monaghan.  I was informed that the planning consultant for the Monaghan locality was a gentleman who lived in Merrion Square.  How he could determine where was the appropriate place to erect a public convenience on the Diamond in Monaghan, the Lord knows.  I have no doubt that the Minister will find a letter from me on his files written to the then Minister for Local Government to the effect: &ldquo;No matter what the planning officer says, you have no right to put a public convenience under this man's drawing-room window.  He has been living there for years and his father and grandfather before him.  I am astonished at this happening and I want to tell you from my knowledge of the town that the objector is perfectly right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose every Deputy in the House, including myself, gets a variety of representations from local people which he passes on to the responsible Minister.  I do so because that is my job.  I have no doubt that in cases of that kind, particularly if the Deputy says he has personal knowledge of some flaw in the planning officer's decision and that the appeal should be <Col N="236" /> allowed, or disallowed, as the case may be, the Minister will give the officers of his Department an injunction to draw his attention to that so that he can send to me an appropriate note saying that the appeal is allowed or disallowed and such other information as he thinks it proper to impart.  Surely we all know that, unless the Minister for Local Government is a raving lunatic, he must delegate to the trusted officers of his Department the great bulk of the detailed investigation of the substantial files submitted to the Department on planning appeals.  It would be impossible for a Minister dealing with 1,500 appeals per annum to go through the file on each appeal with the diligence with which it should be gone through and give a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is being done, but what this Minister claims is that he requires the experienced officers of his Department to go diligently through the file and attach to the file a summary of the contents and a recommendation as to the decision that should be arrived at and that he himself sat burning the midnight oil until 11 o'clock on Christmas Eve reading the summaries and recommendations.  Personally, when Minister, I took the recommendation of my experienced officers and dedicated staff and signed the document on the dotted line.  It is very easy to create a great <i>scandale</i> in suggesting that the ordinary method of administration is impermissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember very well when I was Minister for Agriculture, an old and trusted civil servant who used come to me every Thursday morning and put a document in front of me and ask me for my signature.  I said to him.  &ldquo;What is this document?  What is it about?&rdquo; He belonged to the old school&mdash;this is 20 years ago&mdash;and his attitude was: &ldquo;Minister, do not bother your head about it; just sign on the dotted line.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I could not do that; it must contain something.&rdquo; After great agitation, this old and respected colleague was persuaded to tell me that it was some old statutory return required <Col N="237" /> by Hogan's Act for amalgamating creameries in 1923.  It had lost all significance but a statutory duty remained on the Minister for Agriculture to sign this document once a week.  I said: &ldquo;Let us get rid of this nonsense.&rdquo;  He was greatly shocked.  He had been arriving in with this return every Thursday morning of his life.  But it went out again and nobody ever heard of it since.  That kind of thing is always turning up in large Departments&mdash;old survivals of statutory requirements which served a purpose in the years immediately after the legislation had been passed but which became obsolete, and, of course, a new broom coming in says: &ldquo;Get rid of it; I am not going to sign silly chits which have lost their significance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But there is no planning appeal which comes properly within the description of an irrelevant chit.  It may be a very small matter looked at from the broad aspect of the Department of Local Government but it may be a very vital matter to a very small person who is perhaps confronted by a very powerful interest and that small person, in the kind of society we want to have here, must not only get justice but must, so far as it is humanly possible to ensure, be sent away from the tribunal of final appeal in the knowledge that his case has been fully heard and that, even though the decision is adverse to him, there has been no power in the land strong enough to withhold justice from his claim.</P>
    <P>Does anybody here believe that everybody in the country at present is of opinion that substantial justice is done in every planning appeal?  I am convinced that there are people going around the city at present boasting that they are in a position to use influence to ensure that a planning appeal will be either granted or withheld and claiming the right to recover monetary reward for the influence they profess to be in a position to use.  Is that a desirable situation?  I do not think it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's rage but his rage when I am trying to make a reasoned and reasonable argument, I think, does him more injury than what I am saying.  I am saying that people are making these claims and I am saying that the present system creates fertile soil in which to set such claims, because the decisions are taken behind closed doors and ultimately, according to the claim of the present Minister for Local Government, on his desk, at midnight on Christmas Eve.  Is there any other circumstance in which the rights of two citizens of this State conflict and they ultimately bring the matter for arbitration to ultimate authority in this country in which it would be seemly or proper that the ultimate decision should be taken, in the absence of both of them, at midnight on Christmas Eve?  And the interesting thing is that Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, says that to himself the burden is intolerable and the system undesirable and that he wants to change it but he does not know how.</P>
      <P>I would have much more respect for the Minister and he would have done himself a far greater service if he had said: &ldquo;I am so profoundly in agreement with the proposer of this Bill that I am prepared to agree to its Second Reading,&rdquo; and it would have been a very good thing for the public life of the whole country if the Minister had said : &ldquo;I agree that the present system is highly undesirable and, therefore, I accept the principle of this Bill but I am bound to warn you that, if you want to persist with this Bill in Committee or on Report, we will have to resist it on the ground that many of its sections do not appear to us to provide the effective machinery that is necessary expeditiously to get this work done.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there anybody in the House who considers that the present system is <Col N="239" /> satisfactory?  Is there any Deputy who does not agree with me that the present system of determining these appeals in the Custom House has in it the potentiality of corruption and has in it all the surrounding circumstances calculated to promote suspicion in the public mind?</P>
    <P>We have all known of cases.  I know of a case of a man who went to a widow-woman&mdash;she was not a poor woman&mdash;and took an option on her land.  I do not think he made any appeal to the Minister but he managed by certain somewhat devious processes to get planning permission for this piece of land which had heretofere been withheld while his option continued. Then he employed a fellow to go and search in the back streets of London and he found a firm in London who were prepared to give him £120,000 for the land with the planning permission attached to it.  He got the planning permission and paid the widow £20,000 which was all he had promised to pay her and the following morning he sold the land for £120,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think there was any appeal.  There is a long story about that.  I want to make this clear: the man went to the woman and she offered him the land and he took an option&mdash;perfectly legitimate business. He then got planning permission&mdash;perfectly legitimate business.  He then got the land plus planning permission&mdash; perfectly legitimately &mdash; and got £120,000 and he then came back and bought the land from the widow at £20,000 and put the £100,000 profit to the credit of his account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  There are dozens of cases in which people with land sell the land because they cannot get planning permission from the local authority and the man who buys the land sits on it for a while and applies for some different development for this particular piece of land <Col N="240" /> and does not get it from the local planning authority, and then appeals and gets the planning permission; the planning authority and then appeals versed.  Now, say what you like, the piece of land for which he paid £25,000 suddenly, overnight, becomes worth £150,000 and that £125,000 accretion in the value of the land derives from a decision taken, not in public court, not by somebody who holds his right of office by the tenure of a judge, but, according to the Minister's own testimony to us here, as a result of a decision taken by him between 10 o'clock and midnight on Christmas Eve.</P>
      <P>Does any Deputy consider that that is a desirable procedure?  The Minister says he does not think it is desirable.  I do not think it is desirable.  We as a Party thought it so undesirable that we brought in a Bill to try to set it right.  Is there anybody in the House prepared to get up and say: &ldquo;We would prefer the present system to the establishment of an independent tribunal who would have to carry out the investigation in public and give its decision in public, a tribunal presided over by a person who was irremovable except on the same grounds as a High Court judge is removable?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there anything wrong in that proposal? Is there anything unseemly in that proposal?  Far from there being anything wrong or unseemly, according to the Minister's own testimony, it would relieve him as Minister from an intolerable burden of what he considers to be almost irrelevant work, irrelevant that is to say, from the point of view of the Minister for Local Government. It would wipe away at one stroke any suggestion that the land speculators of this country are making huge fortunes out of planning appeals.  It would make every individual who wanted to do this come out into the open and justify it in public.  Would it not be a good thing that the public should know what was going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose somebody is getting a capital gain of £50,000 or £100,000 or £200,000 by successfully prosecuting a planning appeal, would it not be a desirable thing for the public at large to know that?  I think it would.  I cannot see how any rational person can <Col N="241" /> object in principle to letting in light on transactions of this kind.  I cannot ask the Minister to say that he does not accept the principle of this Bill because he says he does.  I would like to ask: is there any Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party or any other Party who does not accept the principle of this Bill?  Certain Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government have developed a rather odd disease.  Most of them have hides like rhinoceroses, but, like the salmon coming up our rivers recently, they seem to be developing a kind of obscure furunculosis which makes them as sensitive as maiden ladies to reflection upon their virtue if they are questioned about any matter arising out of the administration of their Departments.  The introduction of this Bill sent the Minister for Local Government into orbit out of which it has taken us seven hours to bring him.  He is worse than Explorer II.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister read from a typed document an asseveration by himself, which he made at least three times previously in his speech, that he thought the present procedure unsatisfactory, <Col N="242" /> that it was an excessive burden on the Minister for Local Government and that he hoped to be able to devise a plan to take that burden off the shoulders of the Minister for Local Government.  I did not interrupt him because I thought he was trying to get back to something approximating rational ground.  But what has interested me is his intense sensitiveness to the actual introduction of this Bill. How much more disarming would it have been if the Minister for Local Government had said right from the beginning: &ldquo;I could not agree with you more.  I think the present situation is intolerable.  The machinery you are offering to rid me of this intolerable burden will not work, but I am quite prepared to give the Second Reading of the Bill and then refer it to a Special Committee where we will try to work out alternative machinery that will work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the way the planning machinery has been working recently.  If the Minister does not know, I am telling him now that this city and rural Ireland, but particularly this city, is full of rumour that vast sums are being made by land speculators as a result of successful planning appeals.  It is extremely difficult to establish definitely these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It always is, but there are people claiming publicly that they are in a position to use influence, the value of which could be measured in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  I am warning you that is the situation, and this Bill is designed to remedy it. It is not enough for the Minister for Local Government to say that he agrees that a Bill along these lines is necessary and that some day he will get around to introducing it.  I told him more than 12 months ago that one of the regulations which his predecessor made under the Planning Act of 1963 was being used by speculators in this country for the purpose of tearing down buildings in order to force the planning authority to give them permission to make money out of their purchase and that these were buildings that could be <Col N="243" /> used for dwellings and should be used for dwellings rather than torn down to make way for office blocks.  All the Minister needed to do was to amend his own regulation.  There was no necessity for legislation.  It is more than 12 months since he told me in this House that he would not amend this regulation because he intended to bring in legislation and that it was in that legislation he would repair what he himself knew to be a flaw in the regulation made by his predecessor declaring demolition to be a matter outside the control of the planning authority.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister for Local Government that I do not accept his undertaking to introduce legislation along these lines as soon as he can get around to it, because that means we shall have too long to wait. I believe the present situation is giving rise to scandal, scandal of two kinds: the scandal of causing legitimate suspicion in the minds of people who feel themselves aggrieved, and scandal in the public mind that a few individual property speculators can make inordinately large profits as a result of getting, on appeal, planning permission which heretofore had been withheld. I believe the Minister, in his own interest, would be wise to accept the principle of this Bill and, if necessary, to refer it to a Special Committee. Whether the Minister accepts the Bill or not, the House would be wise to pass it.  But it is necessary to warn the House, the Minister and his Party that the continuation of the present situation is going to do great harm.  Sooner or later it must be remedied.  We all appear to be agreed upon that.  The sooner legislation on these lines is adopted in Dáil Éireann the better it will be for us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one last matter I want to deal with.  The Minister speaks contemptuously of the proposal that a judge, sustained by two assessors, should preside over this tribunal.  I do not think there is anything inherently desirable in a judge presiding over this tribunal.  I believe the inherently desirable element in that proposal is that whoever presides over the appeal tribunal will be a person who holds his <Col N="244" /> position not at the pleasure of the Minister for the time being but on terms similar to those by which a judge of the High Court holds office, that is, unalterably, except for cause stated and then by a majority of two-thirds of this House.  The important thing is to get somebody who is not only known to be impartial but who is seen to be impartial and independent from pressure from all sources, but subject to the overriding authority of this House, as is every member of the judiciary, and that, if he should be detected <i>in flagrante delicto</i> in improper conduct, that improper conduct should be reported to this House and, if it were of such character as to deserve the censure of the House, he could be dismissed from his position, the same as any High Court judge or member of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for assessors because of the fact that this whole business of planning is a pretty complex one.  It might well be that in the initial stages we might have to set up two such tribunals to get rid of the backlog of planning appeals but my judgment would be that, within a reasonable period, one tribunal might become redundant and the ordinary current of appeals from the planning authority could be handled by one tribunal with reasonable expedition.</P>
    <P>The strongest speech for this Bill so far has been made by the Minister for Local Government and it took him seven hours to make it.  How much better could he have acquitted himself to this House if in seven minutes he had said: &ldquo;I accept the principle but need time and consultation to arrange the working details so that we can effect an enduring improvement in the present intolerable situation.&rdquo;  It would have been good for our public life; it would have been good for our parliamentary institutions; and it would have been good for public rectitude if he had approached this measure in that spirit.  He has not chosen to do so but I do not despair, that grace having touched him today, it may illuminate his mind and he may at some early stage indicate that he regrets his mulish obstinacy so far.  He has already been compared to a steamroller; if that be <Col N="245" /> the appropriate comparison, I hope at an early stage he will display his ability to go into reverse.</P>

This was necessary because we have a lovely county and we are anxious to preserve everything that is worth preserving and, at the same time, develop the county for the benefit of the people and the benefit of progress.  We are doing a good job of work.</P>

      <P>We have run into difficulties but we found that, by using commonsense, the difficulties were not so bad as they appeared at the outset. We have fewer refusals in our county than in most other counties and a number of refusals have been reversed on appeal.  Here again commonsense prevailed. The matter lies best in the hands of the Minister and it is best to let him straighten out the position.  I agree that he needs some assistance but to set up a tribunal would only hold up everything. As it is, matters can very often be straightened out in an office in a few minutes but nobody can tell us that, once you sit down before a judge, matters will be straightened out in minutes.</P>
      <P>This planning arrangement is of very real importance, particularly in tourist areas and, where commonsense prevails, it is possible to work out the best system for all concerned.  We have had some difficulties and possibly in cases where permission was refused, a certain amount of development should have been allowed.  It is not easy to meet the wishes of everybody but there should be some way of curbing the statutory bodies which in the past have been throwing in objections to everything. All too often we have had them objecting and they certainly were not a help to the Minister.  In Kerry, we had consistently to use section 4 of the County Management Act to get many of our schemes through even in the very early stages when it was mandatory on the manager to grant permission. All too frequently staff in the office were, behind our backs, conveying the case to the statutory bodies. However, we succeeded in getting that position corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, by and large, we are satisfied. <Col N="247" /> We have a planning office manned with officials to look after planning projects.  The bulk of these projects are being granted.  That is as it should be.  The elected representatives are the best people to judge as to what should or should not be erected in County Kerry. It is our task to develop our county to the utmost.  It is the shop window of the country.  It is to Killarney the tourists come, to the Ring of Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula.  We want to develop the county to the maximum for the benefit of the people in the county and for the benefit of the tourists.  We think we are best fitted for that job, not some outside body.  We are doing a good job.  At the moment 25 new hotels are listed throughout the Ring of Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula.  Some of these will be very large.  Every hotel is a small factory; a 100-bedroom hotel will employ on an average 65 people.  That is welcome additional employment.</P>
    <P>We would not like any outside body interfering in our plans.  I do not think a judge would be likely to give quick decisions.</P>

      <P>Just think of 1,400 cases, which is the number the Minister had, piling up waiting for the judge to give a decision in each case.  That would obstruct development.  There could be some improvements in the present position, some cutting down on the number of objections voiced by the statutory bodies.  I think the statutory bodies should be compelled to substantiate their objections.  In Kerry, they seem to think they must object to every project within three or four miles of Killarney.  It is easier to object, I suppose, than to examine each project on its merits.  It is easier to object and then let others take the case up with <Col N="248" /> the Minister.  If these statutory bodies had to substantiate their objections, they would be less prone to object.</P>
      <P>That position does not, I think, arise really in Kerry.  We have laid out a plan which will permit us to develop the county to the very best advantage. We are an important tourist area and our ambition is to sell this lovely showpiece to visitors from abroad, to entice them to come to Kerry and spend their money there.  The existing situation suits us perfectly, as far as anything can be perfect in this imperfect world, and I should be rather worried about this proposal in this Bill.  I think it would slow down instead of speeding up development.  It would have the opposite effect to that intended and that would be detrimental to our interests.</P>

      <P>The last speaker said that a judge or any other body would slow down development.  I do not think it would slow it down, but it would certainly improve the present position to the extent of allowing the Minister a great deal more time to plan for this city and what I say in regard to Dublin applies to most other areas.  The man at the top in any business plans ahead. He does not become bogged down in detail.  I do not suggest the Minister is bogged down in detail but this proposal would allow him to shed a certain amount of work and that would allow him more time for more important work.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 or 18 months, I have heard repeatedly from the Taoiseach and his Ministers the word &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;. This word has been bandied around time and time again.  It is an important word when it is put into operation because productivity is probably the one thing that is going to get Ireland out of its troubles and the one way in which we can make up for our lack of resources if we get into the EEC.  Since this matter has become important, the workers, through their trade unions, and the employers, through their various bodies and federations, have put it into operation by amalgamation and planning but the Government have failed to give a lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities and the <Col N="249" /> Department of Local Government are responsible for the servicing of new developments.  They service land and, if that land is eaten up by builders, it becomes dearer all the time.  Local Government should plan at least ten years ahead and should have land available for building at least ten years ahead all the time.  It took ten years to get rid of 50,000 acres for building, so that the local authority should service 100,000 or 150,000 acres and have it ready for the builders to move in.  At the moment land is jumping in price daily and a person does not know how much a house is going to cost next week because of the dearness of the sites.  If you service 100,000 to 150,000 acres, you will have a supply greater than the demand and the price will go down.  If you put a sewer from the north side of the city to Malahide or Donabate, sites would be cheaper as you moved out from the centre of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor spoke and he never mentioned appeals. This matter has to do with planning. At the moment about 1,000 applications per annum are coming in and many of these are coming from local authorities which are completely under-staffed. In Dublin Corporation, they require 32 or 33 people; they have only about 13 who are regular employees. They get in an occasional two or three people who are newly qualified and when these have got some experience, they go out into private enterprise where they get more money.  The same applies to Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation.  I have frequently gone in there and discussed a plan with an official but, when I went back the following week, he was gone.  The man in charge of that office hardly has time to look at a plan.  I do not know what the salary is but I do know that they cannot get men for more than a couple of weeks at a time.  They build up experience and then they get promotion to country areas and the plans <Col N="250" /> they have been dealing with go back to the top man in the place.</P>
      <P>In the Department of Local Government, they are fully staffed and, when plans and appeals come in, they can go through them and get them out fairly quickly.  The local authorities are not in the position to do this.  At the moment they have to pass or reject a plan inside two months and, if the plan presents any difficulty, all they can do is refuse permission in case they might make some mistake.  They cannot go through a plan in detail as the officials in Local Government can do. Many of the cases which come before the Minister are only a matter of form, although some of them may be quite difficult because the local authorities have not got the staff to process them before they go to the Department.</P>
      <P>For that reason, it is up to the Minister to increase the salaries of the local authority staffs to the same level as those operating in the Department of Local Government.  In the local authorities, a man is there for about five months and then leaves when he is only halfway through some of the plans.  The officials who are left have to recheck the plans and the work done on them, which means that they practically have to start from the beginning.  While the staff in Local Government do not get the same salaries as people in private enterprise, they have pension schemes and other such benefits which the staffs of local authorities also have.  What is happening is that a number of these people go into private enterprise for a period of years and then, because the local authorities cannot build up staff, they are willing to take back the ones who have left them when they wish to come back.  I agree they have a certain amount of experience in private enterprise which they may not have had in the local authority where they were only checking plans.  The planning of this sewerage scheme throughout Dublin is taking up a considerable amount of the time of the planners in the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the person concerned is refused because of shortage of staff, or because there is a legitimate reason, there still has to be an appeal.</P>
      <P>During the debate, the Minister referred to Raheny.  Builders try to work five years ahead so they can have continual work and will not have to leave staff go.  Employment in building is up and down.  You can be working one month and out the next.  Three builders were involved in this appeal against the compulsory purchase order in Raheny.  They bought the land and wanted to develop it.  Two builders got out of the CPO and I ask the Minister why the third builder was not allowed out as well.  He said that two of them had paid for their land while the third had only an option on it.  To me there is absolutely no difference.  He is in the same position as the man who owns the land.  The option is probably subject to the Corporation allowing him to build.  They may not allow him to build a certain type of house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The option in this case was by a builder who had planned ahead for a period of three or four years.  He could not plan ahead any further because building land was not available at the right price.  Two other people came along.  They went to arbitration and got the CPO taken off them.  If I could describe this land: a man called Forkin had land on the west side of the railway.  The other two builders had it on the east side of the railway. <Col N="252" /> Forkin may have had some bit on the east side of the railway as well.  Forkin had already built right up to where his land was.  At the time all those houses were in the £3,500 to £4,000 bracket. They are now probably in the £5,000 or £6,000 bracket.  He did not appeal, but he did approach the previous Minister and made the plea that, if two were getting out, he should get out too. He did not.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister knows this part of the country quite well.  The Corporation generally keep their schemes near one another.  As they develop the land, they are inclined to try to keep their schemes together so that the cost per house is less.  On one side there were private houses plus Corporation houses and, on the other side, only those houses in the £3,500 to £4,000 bracket. Now they have bits and pieces.  Eventually they may build a bridge to get out of this.  Right in the middle of the scheme you have this Corporation bit. To me, looking at it as a builder and a layman, the person who should have got out of the CPO first was Forkin and not the other two.  We all know the Corporation are looking for land.  They have bought a tremendous amount of land but it is not serviced yet.  Instead, Forkin is the one man who has to stay under the CPO whilst the other two have got out.  Surely in that area it should be a question of all out or none?</P>
    <P>I come now to the Minister's reference to the following statement by Deputy Cosgrave:</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case in my own constituency where at the junction of two roads there was a petrol filling station already established which had access to both roads. Although the residents objected and the local authority refused permission, on appeal, permission was granted to build another petrol station.  Justification for decisions of that character is not obvious.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Cosgrave said has nothing to do with what happened afterwards.  The Minister spent his time trying to bring in Ministers and personalities, people outside this House who were in business in this city.  I am <Col N="253" /> quoting from column 2013 of volume 232 of the Official Report of 28th February, 1968.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I promised Deputy Belton I would deal with the case which his leader utilised as his contribution to the Opposition campaign in this regard.</P>
    <P>He went on later:</P>
    <P>This site has quite a long history. It starts in 1953 when one Dr. R. Belton appealed against refusal by the planning authority of permission for four shop dwellings, a garage and a cinema.</P>
    <P>The Minister was trying to make a case that there was a certain amount of politics in this.  This programme started in the Glenageary-Killiney area in 1946 and not in 1953.  There were discussions with various planners in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the two main proposals in the Bills before the House at the moment, but I have not dealt with one of the matters referred to in the Bills, that is, the question of the Commission which is proposed to draw up the boundaries of the constituencies.

      <P>Last night Deputy Treacy used some stronger terms in referring to it.  I asked Deputy Treacy if he had any constructive suggestion to make in regard to the composition of the Commission, or how this problem of delimiting the constituencies should be tackled.  He did not have any suggestions but Deputy Dunne, apparently answering on his behalf, said: &ldquo;Leave it the way it is.&rdquo;  Apparently he would prefer that the constituencies would be settled as they are at present under the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government. It seems to me that if Deputies wish to oppose the proposals in regard to the Commission, there is an onus on them to suggest an alternative and, in their view, a better way of dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>As I indicated when I put the question to Deputy Treacy, the Government are more than willing to listen to any constructive suggestions as to how this problem should be dealt with.  Certainly, if anyone can suggest a better or fairer or more reliable method of doing this than that which the Government propose, the suggestion will get sympathetic consideration from the Government.  I do not think that so far we have had any constructive reaction to this proposal, and I do not think that Deputy Dunne really meant that he would prefer, if these proposals are accepted by the people, that the constituencies should be delimited under the authority of the Minister for Local Government.  Frankly I do not think that anyone, including the Minister for Local Government, would welcome that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> Again, I should like to plead that in the whole discussion on this question we could do a great deal to clarify the issues for the people if we approached it in some kind of constructive way and if we ceased misleading the people by grossly exaggerated statements as to what is involved in this proposal. The question of the Commission is a very good example of whether we are entitled to complain, so far at any rate, of the performance of the Opposition Parties who could, I submit, reasonably be expected, if they are dissatisfied with the Government's proposal, to suggest what, in their view, is a better one.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that in any election under our system of government two objectives are being attained.  One is the election of a Government and the other is the election of representatives of the people. Under a Presidential system of Government such as that in the United States of America, they do not have the problem which arises for us because they can, and frequently do, elect a President from one Party and elect Congress or the representatives of the people with a majority from another Party. Under our system of government, the Government are elected by Dáil Éireann and, so far as I can ascertain, there is no great demand for a change in that system.  So long as we have it, we are trying to achieve two objectives in any general election, which are, as I have said, the election of a Government and the election of representatives.</P>
    <P>If one considers what is involved here, one will realise that to some extent those two objectives are opposed to each other in the sense that the most efficient method of election, if your only objective is the election of a Government, is almost diametrically opposed to the most efficient way of carrying out an election if your objective is merely to elect representatives. We are trying to do both.  Therefore, any system we devise which is trying to achieve both these objectives at the same time will of necessity be some form of compromise and will be less than ideally satisfactory in dealing with either of those objectives.</P>
    <P>At the same time, our present system <Col N="256" /> is weighted and unduly weighted in favour of the election of representatives to the undue detriment of achieving the objective of electing a Government. We have in fact been fortunate in this country, on the whole, in the manner in which our system of election has worked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, we cannot deny the fact that an analysis of the results will show that, in the main, we have had either minority or coalition Government.  It can be taken from that that the objective of electing a Government is not being achieved in the general elections we have been holding.  In the main, it is not being achieved, and it has only been due to certain accidents of history, and to the good sense of our public representatives, that we have not had very considerable difficulties in the past as a result of this failure on the part of our electoral system.</P>
      <P>I think that anyone with any feeling for democracy would hesitate to recommend a system of election which would be very effective in electing a Government but which would operate to deprive minorities of representation in Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is made that our system of PR with multiple member constituencies caters for minorities. I wonder does the evidence support that?  After all, we have in this House at the moment only three Parties.  It is true that on occasion we have had quite a number of Parties, but it is also true that in the course of time, various new Parties which started up either disappeared or were incorporated in one of the bigger Parties.  This would seem to indicate, in so far as this claim for PR with multiple member constituencies is concerned, that it ensures representation in Parliament for minorities as such, that is, separate representation for them, that it is failing to do this.  Indeed, if you compare the situation in this country with that in Britain, you will find that under the straight vote system which they have there, the representation of religious <Col N="257" /> minorities in Parliament is very much greater than it is here under PR.</P>
      <P>I think it is pretty clear by now that it is not only open to minorities to work through existing political Parties but that it is more effective for them in achieving their objectives to work through existing political Parties rather than endeavour to form Parties of their own thereby being compelled to contest elections separately, and with a very limited degree of success, with the result we have seen over the years here; their Parties disappear and disappear fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>I do not think it justifiable to argue that our system is a necessary protection for minorities, if by that we mean that they should be enabled through it to obtain separate representation in Parliament, when, in fact, the record shows that this is not what happened and that in other countries where the straight vote system operates, minorities are more adequately represented in the larger Parties than they are in this country, in so far as you can identify minorities here.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this which I think should be referred to, that is, the extent to which the voters in this country who have had the PR system for so many years in fact operate on the straight vote principle.  I would regard people who, in a by-election under our present system plump for only one candidate or, in a general election, people who vote only for the candidates of one Party as people who are endeavouring by their votes to operate the straight vote system.  All the proponents of the PR system argue very strongly that to work the system effectively, one should vote for all of the candidates on the ballot paper in the order of one's choice but, increasingly in recent years, it is becoming obvious that our voters are not doing this and there is reasonably good ground for believing that in the fairly recent by-election in Cork city, 60 per cent of the voters plumped in their votes.  If this is so it seems to me to indicate that, whether all the voters concerned realise it or not, they are in fact opting for the straight vote system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to stir up unduly difficulty <Col N="258" /> between the two Opposition Parties but I think it is a bone of contention between them as to whether or not there is an obligation on their respective supporters, having voted for their Party, to vote for the other Opposition Party.  I shall leave that argument to them.  The point I am making is that a sizeable number of the supporters of the policy of the Opposition Parties will not go along with this; they just will not use the PR system.  If you add that sizeable number to the very high proportion of Fianna Fáil supporters who will not use the PR system, you will find a very sizeable number of the voters of this country&mdash;possibly more than half; I am not sure of the figure&mdash;who even though they have the present system do not want to use it.</P>
    <P>There are various reasons for this but it seems to me that what we are really concerned with here is: what is the most effective system we can have, suited to our conditions, to ensure that we have a worthwhile and dynamic political system and with, in my opinion, the essential feature of democracy whatever system of election you have, and that is a clearly identifiable and credible alternative Government? It is my contention that we do not have that here today and that we never will have under PR, except when Fianna Fáil are in Opposition.  When that is the case, we have an Opposition which is sufficiently large and sufficiently active to present to the people a viable alternative to whatever other Government is in office, but when Fianna Fáil are in Government, we do not have this and I believe that no matter what efforts may be made by Fine Gael or the Labour Party we never will have this so long as we have the PR system because that system is designed to prevent the growth of Parties or, alternatively, to foster the reduction of Parties.</P>
    <P>What would, under the straight vote system, count as a landslide in an election records very little in the results under the PR system and I believe that the effect of this is to create a feeling of stagnation to some extent, and also a sense of frustration in many people.  They need not all be opponents <Col N="259" /> of Fianna Fáil to feel that way about it.  Nobody, no matter what his Party, likes to feel that our system of election, and consequently our whole system of politics, is such that it is forced into a permanent mould which people cannot in practice change, even though they might be able to do so in theory. I suggest that it is because of the clear realisation of these facts that Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Flanagan and other members of their Party clearly accept that the proposals which the Government are putting forward are proposals which, having given consideration to them, they would favour if the matter were entirely in their own hands.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in very exaggerated terms that the effect of these proposals being enacted by the people would be not alone to give Fianna Fáil an overwhelming majority but to give them a permanent majority.  I do not know what kind of reasoning goes into this but anybody who thinks that Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Flanagan wants to see a permanent Fianna Fáil majority here should have his head examined.  Of course, they do not want to see that, but they see very clearly and realistically that the only way in which the country can be given a real alternative to the present Government is by adopting the proposals which we are now putting before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am human enough not to want to see my Party going out of office, but nevertheless there are more important things than Party interests and this applies to all Parties in the House.  I believe it is in the best interests of the country and its future that we should change the electoral system in order to ensure a more dynamic political system of organisation, with greater possibility of change and consequently a greater reaction on the part of our political Parties to movement within the community.  I believe that this is certainly in the best interests of our country and, in particular, it is in the best interests of our young people, because, as we all know, if we have the straight vote single-member constituency in a constituency at the moment which has, say, five seats in which, let us say, Fianna Fáil <Col N="260" /> and Fine Gael at present put forward perhaps three candidates each and Labour two candidates, each of the Parties would, in fact, have to put forward five candidates.  This gives the opportunity to young people who are interested in politics&mdash;and they are the kind of people the country needs&mdash;to go before the electorate, an opportunity which they find it very difficult to obtain under our present system.</P>
    <P>It does not mean that all of them will be elected.  Some of them may go forward in areas where they have not a hope of being elected, but it gives them an opportunity to go before the people, put forward their ideas and establish both to their own satisfaction and that of their Parties whether or not they are of the calibre we should look for in Members of Dáil Éireann.  I believe this is one of the most important aspects of these proposals which the Government are putting forward and that the young people of the country when they ponder on the opportunities which these proposals create for young people and on the frustration which can be, and is being, engendered under the present system, will give their wholehearted support to these proposals and, in doing so, they will not merely be doing it out of a sense of self-interest, out of a sense of giving themselves, personally, an opportunity, but out of a sense of what is good for this country and what is good for the kind of society we are trying to create in this country, the kind of society in which there will be movement, in which there will be an inter-play of ideas freely expressed and in which people who have worthwhile ideas will, by advocating them sufficiently well and with sufficient determination, have some hope of having these ideas accepted and put into practice rather than having to make them conform to a particular mould into which political life in this country is being forced by our present system of election.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons, I urge Dáil Éireann to support the proposals being put forward and I urge Deputies who cannot support the proposals to base their case on the realities of life in Ireland today and of what we think life is going to be in another generation, not <Col N="261" /> on the past and not on exaggerated claims about what is involved in these proposals and what is likely to be the result of their enactment.</P>

    <P>One of the vital facts of life, of life yesterday, of life today and of life so long as freedom survives has been over-looked by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that is, that in a free society the Government of the day must not only be physically able to enforce the law, but must be in a moral position to enforce the law if that enforcement is to be effective.  In the last analysis&mdash; and these are harsh words&mdash;the legitimate Government of this country, chosen by this Dáil, has a right to say to everybody: &ldquo;You are guaranteed your right to roll out your barrel if you do not like the Government of the day and make your case to your neighbours, <Col N="262" /> and, if you can command a sufficient number of their votes, you are entitled to take over the Government, but there will be no government by mob law, and if you attempt to intimidate the legitimate Government of this country by mob law, force will be used to resist it and, if necessary, the Army will be used to invoke the supreme sanction if that be required to establish the authority of the Government.&rdquo;  No Government in a free country can do that if they do not find themselves in a moral position to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we must look forward, but I think it would be a grave mistake not to look back, for history has a lesson to teach us.  The last time we debated this question in Dáil Éireann there were 100 men incarcerated on the Curragh without trial, interned by the then Government; and there were four Sinn Féin TDs who would not come into the House.  The moral right of the Government to hold these men in detention was the fact that they were the popularly elected Government of the country. They were the legitimate Government of the country who thought it was necessary for the protection of public order so to hold these men.  These four men themselves had sought the public suffrage and had secured seats in the House.  They were entitled to come here and make their plans as a Party until the way was open to them ultimately to take over the Government, if the majority of their fellow-citizens desired they should.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of ways to elect a free democratic Parliament and various views can honestly be held as to which is the best.  But one thing is certain: changing the rules to eliminate minorities is the worst of all options. I do not deny that the Minister for Industry and Commerce sounded persuasive when he spoke of his indifference to Party interests, his certainty that in the long run, both for the welfare of the Oireachtas and the country and the rising generation of young men and women who want to enter public life, the single vote system commended itself to him.  I notice that he did not fall into the trap into which <Col N="263" /> many other promoters of this Bill have fallen, that is, to protest that the PR procedure of voting is too complicated for ordinary people to understand.</P>
    <P>How many people in this House realise that not one per cent of all the voters in the country today have ever voted any other way?  Here there are nine Deputies.  How many of us know a man or a woman who has ever voted with a cross in this country.  Nobody under the age of 71 has done it, and there are very few under the age of 80. I have never voted with a cross since I first cast a vote in Ireland.  I never voted with a cross in my life from the first election I ever voted in down to today.  I voted 1, 2, 3, 4, down to the end of the ballot paper.</P>
    <P>When I recalled that on the last occasion we debated this issue there were 100 men in internment on the Curragh and there were four Sinn Féin TDs who would not come into Dáil Éireann, and that that fact gave the Government the moral position from which they could justify internment for the public weal, that may have sounded unrealistic to some of the younger Deputies here.  That is because they do not look back.  I was in this House the day the Fianna Fáil Party came in here having dwelt in the wilderness for seven years.  They were dragged in kicking and screaming and praying to God that their hands would wither before they ever signed the Oath, and then they signed it.  They came into this House a minority, and they got into this House as a minority through the instrumentality of proportional representation. In an astonishingly short time I walked through that Lobby myself to establish that minority as the legitimate Government of this country.  Remember that the bulk of them had been on the barricades.  The bulk of them believed that there was no way in which they could make their voice heard or have their feelings respected in this country except by civil war.  I saw them come into this House with their pockets bulging with revolvers, and one old gentleman down in the Lobby in the telephone box assembling a machine-gun. I see them now lolling on the Government Benches in mohair suits.  I <Col N="264" /> am not sure which costume I would prefer to see them in&mdash;the old hairy tweeds and the knickerbockers and the revolvers bulging in their pockets and their eyes blazing with the light of fanaticism.  At least they believed in something.  At least it was a passionate desire to serve, albeit they sought to serve principles which were illusory.  I cannot say that they create the same impression on us today, but it is noteworthy for younger Members of this House to realise what a metamorphosis can be achieved by this now repudiated system of proportional representation. Stripped of all the verbiage, the plain fact is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is a sordid plot to destroy the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I think that is a very silly thing to do.  At the present time there is a substantial body of our people who support a minority party and who feel that they have the fundamental right to be heard in this House and to be represented and who openly declare that they aspire to control the Government of this country not through violence but the vote.  Do we want to send them to the barricades?  Do we want to slam the doors of this House in their faces?  I do not agree with much of what the Labour Party, on occasions, stand for.  However, I think it is a salutary thing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce when speaking here today said to them: &ldquo;I notice in recent elections that a very large body of our people do not seem to want PR because they do not vote PR.  They plump.&rdquo;  I see sitting on the benches of the Labour Party at this moment a member of the Labour Party who advised the supporters of the Labour Party not to use PR.  I think it was profoundly wrong for that Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood, but that is what I understood <Col N="265" /> him to say.  I think he was wrong but I would cheerfully die in defence of his right to say it, either here or on the hustings.  What I think is particularly admirable is that in spite of the impression his words were calculated to create he is here through proportional representation and as far as I am concerned he is welcome.  So long as he represents a quota of our people he is a Deputy of this House with all the rights and all the privileges and all the obligations of every Deputy from the Taoiseach down to the most junior member of the Oireachtas.  I say &ldquo;from the Taoiseach down&rdquo; because it is by our vote that he is appointed, that he is nominated to the President for the position of Taoiseach from whom he gets his appointment, but it is our vote that makes him Leader of the House.  These are two offices he combines in one person and for the honour of each of which all of us should be jealous.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a moment ago the fundamental question: where do minorities belong?  Are they to belong here or on the barricades?  I was much struck when Deputy Seán Lemass appeared in reminiscent mood on Telefís Éireann some time ago.  He told the story of the dilemma in which they found themselves in the old Party which preceded Fianna Fáil.  He said: &ldquo;We collected all the lunatic fringes, everyone who had a grievance, everyone who had a straw in his hair, they all began to congregate around us, until suddenly Mr. de Valera and I and a few others made up our minds that this would get us nowhere and it would be better to go into the Dáil.&rdquo;  And so he told the story of how a minority of a minority went to the hustings and turned their backs on the barricades finally and came in here as a minority.  Sometimes we hear some of our colleagues and you would imagine that at any moment they were going to draw from their bosoms the Red Flag and raise it above our heads, or possibly produce the small red book of Chairman Mao and threaten us with its contents.  Sometimes I begin to wonder if some of them have not assumed the role of Ho Chi Minh ambassadors at large but that does not alarm or affront me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>God be good to the late Deputy <Col N="266" /> Seán T. O'Kelly.  I heard him from these benches roaring like a lunatic. &ldquo;Murderer, murderer, murderer&rdquo;, and yet he lived to shed distinction and charm upon the office of President of the Irish Republic.  I heard the present Minister for External Affairs, and I can see him now in a mustard coloured suit that was hairy and ill-made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in which he glowingly described to us in detail how he burned a train with John Jameson whiskey.  Of course he thought it was magnificent.  Look at him now&mdash;he is in a perpetual state of shuttling to and fro across the Atlantic and the marvel is that he does not circumnavigate the globe.  He is an elder statesman.  That is due to the genius of our people and it is something of which everybody in public life has reason to be proud and it seems almost incredible to foreigners today who visit this country that the country was, a short 45 years ago, racked with a civil war.  They cannot believe that out of such a history there has arisen stable Parliamentary institutions in which the voice of every minority is heard.  Of course. minorities come and go in this House; is that not the way it should be?  If they are good minorities they grow to be large Parties; if they are not they vanish away.  They create coalitions, they amalgamate with others, they come in as Independents, as I did, and join a Party; they sometimes leave that Party if they feel their consciences bid them, but they return to join their colleagues as soon as circumstances will allow, the better to serve the common cause.  We see Independents coming and going.  I name no names but I have seen them in my time come in and sell their souls for a few penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon to be vomited up by those who bought them and thrown on the scrap heap in contempt to be given scraps of meat you would not give to a mangy dog.  I have seen the Fianná Fáil Party try to buy out others.  But there is one common thing. the public find them out.  Sometimes they are here for three years, or for <Col N="267" /> six years but ultimately the public find them out and every time one is found out public life is the purer, stability is the stronger and institutions are the better for we have found again that fraud cannot long survive. The presence of minorities in this House has never dismayed me.</P>
      <P>Most civilised countries in Europe and elsewhere have government drawn from a coalition of Parties.  The interesting thing is that the only continent in the world in which it is true to say they have had a single Party government for a century is South America and there was not a single Government in it that has not been overthrown less than 15 times by force of arms.  They all have the same non-transferable vote&mdash;let us not go on calling that the straight vote because it is really the crooked vote&mdash;but they all have it.  The only continent in the world in which the single non-transferable vote has been a permanent feature of public life for a century is South America and in almost every case these countries have been the homes of bloody revolts and intolerant dictatorship.</P>
      <P>Now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce most graciously asks the question, having protested that he thought of nothing but the public weal: If this system of proportional representation is of benefit to the Fianna Fáil Party how can the Opposition not agree with me, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that we would be foolish to get rid of it?  I do not think the system of proportional representation has any part in it.  I think they have used it most successfully to introduce a stable system of Government, with a due proportion of change in the electoral scene, which preserved stability and, at the same time, avoided that very sense of frustration to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred, the feeling that the people under this system could not change their Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pretty certain that but for a speech made by Deputy Corish in Tullamore during the last general election Fianna Fáil would have been put <Col N="268" /> out of office.  I have no doubt whatever that his announcement in Tullamore that he would have no part in an inter-Party Government persuaded very many thousands of people to say: &ldquo;If the Labour Party are not prepared to play then there is no use voting for Fine Gael or for Labour&rdquo;.  I think it would be a good thing for this country if Fianna Fáil had got out of office.  The burden would have fallen on me and I should have found it an intolerable one to bear, or very nearly intolerable, but I would have got on with the job and certain members, some younger and some older, of the Labour Party would have found me very difficult to get on with and many of my colleagues might equally have found them difficult But if we were not able to provide the country with good Government and place the national interest above the interests of our respective Parties, then the people would have put us out and put Fianna Fáil back in again.  And that is something that would not have caused us desolation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce is right; it is a good thing for democracy to have change and change about.  It is good for a Government a long time in office to be for a time in opposition.  I think we manage to achieve that under the system of proportional representation and it is for that pragmatic reason that I am concerned to defend it.  I am not proposing to the House that this is an unalterable law of God or of Holy Writ. I am defending proportional representation in our system, under our conditions, for our people on no better ground than my own personal experience of the public life of this country. It does not produce landslides.  It is not subject to the same abuses that the single non-transferable vote is open to.  But it can be made to work as a useful method to enable the people of our country to secure a stable government, which is always in the moral position to say to any minority, whether it is represented in this House or not: &ldquo;We are the legitimate Government of this country.  We will deploy all the resources of the State to protect your right to speak <Col N="269" /> in public, within the law, but, if you seek to organise a mob, to challenge the authority of the legitimate government, we are in a moral position, and we are in a position physically, to control you and to prevent any such attempted takeover.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I often think, when we dwell on such things, that we should remember with affection and admiration the man mainly responsible for building that up, at immense personal cost to himself, because we can never deliberate on issues of this kind without remembering that it was the late William T. Cosgrave who built here a stable State from bricks consisting of revolutionaries, reactionaries, Protestants, Catholics and, perhaps, not the least recalcitrant, of all the Fianna Fáil material which he had to bring into this House and which he ultimately forced to accept the responsibility of government.</P>
    <P>I have partaken in ten general elections. No single one of them failed to produce a stable government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>How many produced a majority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not matter. No parliamentarian with any understanding of how parliament works doubts that you can have a perfectly stable government in a parliament of 144 with 70 or 71 Deputies.  And it is a good thing for a Government to feel that, if they are inclined to go berserk, they arouse the universal indignation of an outraged Opposition to combine against them.  That is salutary. Mark you, I think Deputy Booth will find that now that the chance of by-elections has given his Party an absolute majority in this House that will tend to drive them berserk.  I think these two Bills are symptoms of this madness.  Do not forget that when this committee was sitting Fianna Fáil had not got a clear majority in Dáil Éireann and, if rumour speaks truly, even Deputy Seán Lemass said, behind the closed doors of the committee: &ldquo;I think it would be foolish to put the issue of proportional representation to the people again, they having decided it only nine years ago&rdquo;.  And Deputy Colley, Minister for Industry and <Col N="270" /> Commerce, presiding said: &ldquo;I think that is the general opinion of us all.&rdquo; And they passed on to the next business. But, since that, Fianna Fáil has secured a clear majority in Dáil Éireann, whereupon the same men come forward with these Bills at this time because they argue, I think foolishly, that by this device they can virtually eliminate the Labour Party from the political horizon of this country. I think that is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the theme the Minister for Industry and Commerce elaborated.  One of his reasons for the present proposal was that it was essential to secure stable government.  The single non-transferable vote, he said, tended to do that and to eliminate irrelevant Parties.  I see my old friend Deputy Corry here and I know well what his trouble is.  I remember speaking in this House 20 years ago after one of the redistribution Bills of the Fianna Fáil Party and pointing out that, if you were a pure devotee of the system of proportional representation, you should maximise the number of five-seat and seven-seat constituencies.  I said that, like everything else Fianna Fáil touch, they corrupted this system and sought to maximise the number of three-seat constituencies and thus turn proportional representation into a cod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that our present system is a pragmatic device to produce what is good.  We do things in this country for our own people and for our own requirements and we make them work. That is what puzzles me about Fianna Fáil, that they cannot see that.  I told this to the lady who is an expert on proportional representation, a Miss <Col N="271" /> Witherspoon or something like that; I told her that I was not interested in the theory that it was necessary to have seven-seat or five-seat constituencies in order to provide the best results.  We have worked out a system to give the results that are best for our people and our country, to give representation to minorities and to provide stable Government. It is all cod to be talking to me about the pure theory of PR.  I am not interested.  I am interested in a pragmatic system of election which will produce an Irish Parliament and provide our people with stable Government.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience that that is what we have got and now we see the attempt suddenly to throw it away for the purpose of adopting a scheme which operates satisfactorily in no other country in the world except in Britain and the United States of America.  I will have a word to say about that later because it has been made a subject recently of a Supreme Court decision in the United States.  I want the people to see and know on such authority as I dispose of that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is nothing more than a sordid attempt on the part of Fianna Fáil to wipe out the Labour Party.  I find myself frequently in disagreement with the Labour Party but I do not want to see them wiped out.  It would be a bad day for this country if that should happen and I will do nothing to achieve that end.  Therefore, without hesitation, I advise the people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Happily I find myself in the position that I want them to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; twice. I recognise that a good deal of confusion and difficulty will arise in this matter.  I cannot find in the context of any of these Bills the words that will appear on the ballot paper on which the people will be asked to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I am not certain if the words do appear in these Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely on the last occasion there was a subsequent Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister for Justice tell me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="272" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; there was a subsequent Bill last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So there will be a subsequent Bill that will set out the words and I am now in the happy position of being able to advise the people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; to both questions.  When we come to the Third Amendment of the Constitution we find that it is designed to make a rural vote count more than an urban vote.  There are powerful arguments for both sides of that question.  I have lived all my life in rural Ireland.  I was born and reared in Dublin but for the last 45 years I have lived in the congested areas and for 35 of those years I have represented congested areas in this House.  I think the voice of those areas needs to be heard.  I think it is vitally important that they be adequately represented.  There is a powerful argument for saying that reasonable territorial constituencies should be drawn up and a certain minimum representation given to them all.</P>
      <P>Deputies like Deputy O'Connor of Kerry spoiled the case for that by overstating it.  He was offering me proof to-day that he is writing 500 letters a day.  I need no proof of that.  I am sure he is a very diligent Deputy, misguided though his political beliefs may be.  There is a powerful case that you should make a certain geographical division of the congested areas, which have now become the deserted areas, and see that each such receives some representation in Dáil Éireann.  This has been tried in the United States in the light of experience there.  You had that situation throughout the southern states of the United States.  In States like Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana and even in Texas there has been a tendency over the years for the people to drift into the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I went to work in America 44 years ago 40 per cent of the people were in the cities and 60 per cent were on the land.  To-day 82 per cent are in the cities and 18 per cent on the land. In that changing pattern of population there has been no change in the representation of the state constituencies and in many of the southern states the same number of representatives <Col N="273" /> in the state assemblies are representing about 14 per cent of the population that used to represent 60 per cent because the states would not change.  They claim that there was no power under the American constitution for the federal Government to change that.  That issue has now been tried in the Supreme Court of the United States and it has been established that the principle of one man one vote must reign supreme.  Apparently the States have now been required by the Federal Government to carry out the necessary re-allocation of representatives so that each constituency will be represented on the basis of population rather than of territory.</P>
    <P>I, in my experience living in America, saw the absurdity of the municipality of New York dominated and distorted by a rural majority which was elected by constituencies drawn 100 years ago in the State of New York.  I do not think I exaggerate when I say that I have seen the municipality of New York sink into something approximating to chaos because no political Party in the State of New York can persuade the rural voter in the State of New York to permit the State Government to give the municipality of New York the financial resources without which it cannot hope to resolve the problems such a vast conurbation of people involves.  I have seen States in the Southern States of the United States of America presented with growing urban problems which have strangled them because the country people have taken up the position&mdash; understandable, however misguided it may be&mdash;that if the swells living in the city want things let them blooming well go and pay for them themselves. One of the roots of the present race relations problem in the United States has been the constant refusal of rural minorities to provide the money requisite for education.</P>
    <P>You may say these things will not happen here or ask how do we make them relevant to our situation.  The relevance is this.  You must stand on some principle if you are not to have all sorts of irrelevant questions seeping in.  There is one principle which can be <Col N="274" /> made common cause for all.  That is that in respect of every citizen of the State entitled to vote his vote should be of equal weight and value wherever it may be.  The moment you depart from that principle you are walking out into quicksands of which there is no end. The interesting thing is that the Fianna Fáil Government have themselves seen the quicksands into which the Third Amendment threatens to throw them and so have rushed to provide a very special machinery in their Bill to provide against the possibility of constituencies being formulated for ulterior motives.</P>
    <P>Does anyone seriously believe that any such machinery can possibly be made to work?  I do not want to draw a sordid picture of bargaining and back-scratching going on between the Deputies of this House in such a Commission as is here proposed to be set up for the redistribution of the constituencies.  But this House is composed of human beings and nothing is more certain of us all, whether we be men or women, boys or girls, if we have no principle to guide us we shall drift inevitably towards the lowest common denominator of human kind. It is a hard rock of principle I seek on which to stand for my own protection as much as the protection of everybody else.  In formulating electoral policy I can find no solid rock on which to stand once we step off the principle of one man, one vote. I can only hope in a Parliament so elected there will be enough wisdom to be found&mdash;and I think there will&mdash; to recognise that justice needs to be done between all sections of our community wherever they live and however they live if they belong to Ireland. I am sure it is safer to trust in that than to create a whole lot of false constituencies where a vote is worth two votes in any other constituency. I do not want to see a rural constituency in Ireland represented by two Deputies here in comparison with a more populous area such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, Drogheda or Dundalk represented by only one.  I do not want to see in our assembly two classes of Deputies&mdash;one the poor one who comes in representing <Col N="275" /> half as many as the rich one who can claim two votes for one.  Mark you, I think it is a bad thing.</P>

It most aptly illustrates whither we are going when we leave the solid rock of one man, one vote.  Deputy Booth says: &ldquo;We never said two against one, only three against two.&rdquo;  Would you glance over your shoulder at the hardy old warrior from East Cork? Ask him how many he should send up. Every vote in East Cork should count for two or three.</P>

Make up your minds to this. If you succeed in assassinating the Labour Party and its individuality by this device, you are settling for ever more into a Coalition pattern just as they have in America.  The democratic Party in America is a Coalition of the Left confronted by the Republican Party Coalition of the Right.  So in this country you will have a Coalition more or less of the Left confronted by the many members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I could not vote for a Tory in England, a Republican in the USA, or Fianna Fáil in Ireland because the paper would burn my fingers before I got it into the ballot box.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt whatsoever about the outcome of the referendum.  It is my view that the proposals of the Government will be defeated.  However, many people appear to be concerned about the future of the Labour Party.  Some would suggest that, if the Government's proposals are carried, this would mean the elimination of the Labour Party.  I am prepared to concede that there is a possibity that in the first election, and perhaps the second election, under the system proposed by Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party would not increase its numbers.  Therefore, the proposal might hinder for some time the growth of the Labour Party.  Under any system&mdash; and I think the Government know this better than anyone else&mdash;in present circumstances and with a more enlightened electorate within a reasonable time, there will be, and there must be, a strong Labour Party in this House. In any case, let no one be concerned about the Labour Party because we can look after ourselves as we have in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many other attempts to stultify the growth of our movement, some dirty and some not as cleancut as the proposals made by the Government now, but we have resisted all those efforts to stultify the growth of the Party.  The evidence in recent elections, by-elections, local elections and general elections indicates the views of the electorate so far as choice of Party is concerned.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, like many of his colleagues and some sections of the press, <Col N="279" /> continued this campaign to discredit the electoral system under which we have worked for such a long time, this system which was so lauded&mdash;I do not propose to give quotations&mdash;by various prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party and by prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the past who babbled about stable government and the democratic system of election.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce would have us believe that the people do not use PR.  Some people accuse the Labour Party in particular of not using PR properly.  As a matter of fact, the Minister was getting on so well this evening and appeared to like his speech so much that he went so far as to suggest that, so far as the Party were concerned, there were 60 per cent plumpers&mdash;or did he say 60 per cent of the voters who did not continue their votes?  If the Minister had done his homework and had examined all the results of the last general election, he would find that the people in fact did use PR to a very large extent and used it intelligently. I have some examples here which I propose to give to the House.</P>
    <P>In the constituency in which we shall have a by-election tomorrow week, there was a valid poll of 25,167 and the non-transferable papers, not defective, were 138.  In my constituency where the valid poll was 10,000 higher, 35,515, the number of non-transferable votes was 1,100.  In Waterford, where the valid poll was 27,203, the non-transferable votes were 88.  In Sligo-Leitrim, where the valid poll was 33,480, the non-transferable votes were 491.  In North Tipperary, where the valid poll was 26,766, the non-transferable votes were 338.  Somebody may say these are rural constituencies and that this is not the overall picture, but in Dublin South-East, the valid poll was 28,812 and the non-transferable votes 454.  In Dublin North-East, the valid poll was 53,477.  This was the famous constituency where the count went on for some days.  The non-transferable votes totalled at the end of the 10th count, 524.  In Dublin North-West, with a valid poll of 28,322, the non-transferables <Col N="280" /> were 395.  This was the pattern in every one of the 38 constituencies in the last general election.  Let nobody therefore try to tell me that the people do not understand PR or that they did not use it effectively in the last general election.  It may well have been that in the first few years in the 1920s people did not really understand it and use it effectively but, in 1965, when we had our last general election, the people did, in my view, use it very effectively.</P>
    <P>There are allegations that the Labour Party advocate plumping for their own Party and their supporters do not usually vote down the whole ticket.  That is entirely wrong.  If there is a percentage of voters voting for Labour who do not carry on their preferences after their own Party, I would say that within the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party the percentage is practically the same, small though it may be, of people who do not continue to vote the ticket, but, over all, the picture is certainly not as bad as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has painted it.  The non-transferable votes after nine, ten, 11 or 12 counts, as I have demonstrated, are very small in number compared with the valid poll.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

There is very little talk now from any of the Ministers of the Government as to the number of new jobs needed in the country or of the promise of the Fianna Fáil Party that in every year during the operation of the Second Programme there would be 11,500 new jobs created.</P>

      <P>We understand the Government's motives for the introduction of these proposals at the present time.  It is obvious from the speech of the Taoiseach that no longer can they get support on the plea, for example, that they are a Republican Party.  This plea, which was very successful for them for a very long time, is now regarded by the Taoiseach as being worn out.  Now he believes they are not going to win the political game and wants to change the rules in order to suit himself and the Party.  No longer can they get large blocks of votes on that plea or by aggravating&mdash; and this has been done over the past 30 to 40 years&mdash;the political bitternesses that started in 1922.  This is the way the Fianna Fáil Party have got their votes and their majorities in various elections since 1927.</P>

This is the way they have been elected for quite a long time&mdash;something the Labour Party have tried to get away from, in particular in the 1920s and 1930s, by putting to the people economic issues and not trying to get votes on the basis of where one was in 1922 or 1923.</P>

      <P>The Minister may never have made a public speech about it but I have a fair idea of the mind of the Minister.  The Fianna Fáil Party must see the logical development of politics in this country but they have been somewhat illogical.  With all due respect to the two Parties who regard themselves as the major Parties, they were founded out of bitterness, but there is now evidence of the emergence of a strong socialist Party.  I do not know what the idea of the Fianna Fáil Party is; I do not know what the idea of the Fine Gael Party is.  Deputy Dillon seems to think that this would mean the elimination of the Labour Party.  How the Fianna Fáil Party stand in this, I do not know, but the Taoiseach has said that he wants two Parties.  He has never put his finger on one or the other for extermination or survival.</P>

      <P>This proposal suggests that a majority Party would have more seats than they were entitled to by votes.  The Minister for Justice certainly must understand that, in view of the various examples that have been given as to the results that there could and would be under the straight voting system.  As I said in the beginning, they believe that by this proposal they may harm the Labour Party but they <Col N="287" /> will do much more harm to the political, economic and social development of the country if they attempt by this method to stem the growth of the Labour Party.  Of course, they have never expressed any basic philosophy or any ideology.  This is the Party who have ruled by regulation, not arising out of any policy&mdash;government by rule and regulation and, if you like, by majority decisions of their Party in Dáil Éireann on a day-to-day and month-to-month basis.</P>
      <P>We have been told that stability will be ensured under this system.  To the Fianna Fáil Party, in my view.  That means a Party who want to ride roughshod over the people with a huge majority and to, as they do with even a slim majority, bestow favours on their favoured friends.  In other times they tried other devices to ensure that the Labour Party would not grow.  I know that Deputy Lenihan is, as he boasts, of a younger generaation, but surely he must remember 1942 and 1943.  He must remember the campaign of people like Deputy MacEntee and other people in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I am thinking about the future.  He starts this gambit here again.  What I am trying to demonstrate to the Minister is that they have tried by dirt and filth to stem the growth of the Labour Party and are now trying it by this method.  I do not think the Minister for Justice would be at all impressed if one were to talk about the merits of proportional representation. It does, indeed, give a choice between Parties and policies which have a possibility of being represented in Dáil Éireann.  It allows the voter a choice, not alone between Parties, but between individuals also.  As has been suggested by the Taoiseach, he wants to see in any constituency maybe only two candidates and two Parties in Dáil Éireann.  PR ensures proper representation of organised political <Col N="288" /> opinion in Parliament&mdash;and that I do not think the Minister for Justice could deny.  The idea of having minorities represented here seems to be anathema to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I certainly would subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Dillon when he talks of the rights of minorities to be represented here in Dáil Éireann.  If we are to have the situation where fairly large minorities are not to be allowed under this system to be represented here, we must put up with it, but if, through frustration or otherwise, these minorities should take other action, that will be the responsibility of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have made references to minorities as if they had no right to exist.  This country now seems to be settling down to a certain pattern but we should not push it to the extent that after the next general election, or the one after, there will be only two Parties here.  We have had the Clann na Talmhan Party, the Clann na Poblachta Party and the National Progressive Democrats, of which there were only two members. These disappeared from the Irish political scene but we should not push that pattern to such an extent that our system of election will ensure that only two Parties will be represented in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>If these people group themselves into Parties legally, there should be no attempt made to deprive them of representation in the Dáil.  I hold no brief for the Liberal Party in Great Britain but it is ludicrous to think that, while they get ten per cent of the votes, while they represent ten per cent of the people, they have less than one per cent representation in the British Parliament.  I do not see why there is all this talk about instability. Fianna Fáil should be the last people to complain about that.  Even when they got less than 50 per cent of the votes under proportional representation, they got a majority of six.</P>

May I suggest that, if the Government Party want the two-Party system now, in ten or 15 years time we might get a proposal to vote for or against the nominees of the Fianna Fáil Party. Do the Government think that two Parties in this House would adequately represent the wide range of political opinions in the community?  I do not think they would.  If we have a two-Party system here, the minority <Col N="291" /> will be frustrated because they will be required to vote for one of the candidates or not vote at all.  It would be far better that we should retain proportional representation and allow the voters to carry down their preferences rather than put them in the position of being able to vote for only one candidate or not voting at all.

Some members of the Fianna Fáil Party likened this to a horse race and suggested that the first past the post gets the first prize, and that is that. Perhaps this is what they mean when they refer to stable government.

Candidate X gets 5,000 votes, Y gets 4,000 and Z gets 3,000 votes.  Does the Minister for Justice suggest that the person who gets the 5,000 should get the seat, in view of the cat that there were 7,000 who did not say positively they wanted him, in view of the fact that 7,000 people could be against him and in view of the fact that 7,000 people would be unrepresented in Parliament?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that in such a constituency, where one candidate gets 1,001 votes, he should not get the seat, leaving 8,999 unrepresented in Dáil Éireann.  Of course, the tolerance issue is the biggest fraud of all the proposals contained in the second Bill.  We are told, and this is the old Act we had in 1959, that a Commission will be appointed which will decide the number of seats for Dáil Éireann within a margin of between 20,000 to 30,000 of the population and they will fix the national average for the constituency between 20,000 to 30,000. <Col N="295" /> The Commission is to be comprised of three members of Dáil Éireann nominated by the Taoiseach and three from the Opposition.  It is not clear whether the Ceann Comhairle will nominate those three or whether the Opposition will agree between themselves who the three should be.  The Commission will be presided over by the President of the High Court or by a judge of the Supreme Court; it does not make any difference, because the Commission is all cod.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that if the national average were fixed at 20,000, in one constituency there could be such a tolerance that there need only be 16,670 in that constituency&mdash;it could be one-sixth less than 20,000 but in another constituency it could be one-sixth higher than 20,000, which would mean a constituency of 23,330.  It would mean therefore that in one constituency there would be 16,670 and in another 23,330.  We do not believe in this; we believe, as we have always believed, in the idea of one man, one vote, and we do not believe there should be this difference of 40 per cent as between one constituency and another.  This could lead to gerrymandering.</P>
      <P>There is no point in telling me that this will be decided by the Commission and it will be presided over by an eminent judge.  This Bill also proposes that Dáil Éireann may terminate the appointment of a member of the Commission.  This means that a simple majority of the Fianna Fáil Party can decide that Deputy Michael O'Leary is not fit to be on the Commission, or Deputy Paddy Belton, or Deputy Esmonde, or Deputy L'Estrange, or Deputy Corry.  Do the Government believe this is a fair proposal?  Do they believe that the Fianna Fáil Party with a majority of one, two, three or four, should have power to remove a member of the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes a little further.  The quorum is four.  These must present their report with regard to the tolerance and the fixation of the boundaries within a period of three months.  A simple majority report is sufficient. This is presented to the Ceann Comhairle, <Col N="296" /> the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, and it is laid before the House for a period of, I think, 14 days.  Within that period, it can be amended by Dáil Éireann.  A simple majority in this House, a majority of the Fianna Fáil Party, can decide to change a constituency in any part of the country, can decide that the population tolerance should be changed.  That can be done by a majority of one vote of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It means, in actual fact, that the Fianna Fáil Party, the ruling Party in this House, have the power to decide how many people will be representative of a constituency and what the boundaries are to be.  They can, as I said, remove any Member if they do not like him, whether he be from Fianna Fáil, from the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  Of course, if the Commission fails to make a decision in respect of the constituencies or the population tolerance, the Chairman can present the report.  I have the greatest respect, as far as the law is concerned, for the members of the judiciary, but one must remember that most of these are political nominees.  They will not be there in a judicial capacity on this Commission.  Does the Minister suggest they will be?</P>

      <P>I should like now to refer to this famous or, shall I say infamous, Constitution Committee.  I remember when it was first proposed that this committee be established.  I was written to by the then Taoiseach, now Deputy Seán Lemass, who asked that the Labour Party would participate in a commission in order to examine the Constitution with a view to seeing whether it could be amended and also to examine our public institutions, our procedure in Dáil Éireann, etc., etc., etc.  It was suggested at that time that there should be other than Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas on that Committee, that people should be drafted from the Incorporated Law Society, the various other professions and the Civil Service. My Party was of the view that, if this examination was to be carried out, in the first instance, it should be engaged in by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  To this Deputy Lemass agreed.  I do not know what the attitude of the Fine Gael Party was, but we believed we were right in our attitude.  Deputy Lemass gave me, as <Col N="300" /> Leader of this Party, the impression that this was to be a genuine examina-of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We welcomed this examination not alone of the Constitution but of our procedure in Dáil Éireann, the workings of Departments of State, the role of civil servants.  All these were to be examined and discussed with no commitment to any Party or to any individual in order to get the overall view of public representatives as to what changes ought to be made.  Our people went into that Committee in good faith.  We had Deputy James Tully and Deputy Seán Dunne on the Committee. I must confess I was warned by members of my organisation, not members of the Parliamentary Party, that this was a ruse by the Fianna Fáil Party to try to get us committed to the idea of changing the electoral system from proportional representation to the straight vote.  I, because I believed Deputy Lemass, suggested that this was not so, and that, if there were to be changes made in the Constitution and in our public institutions, the Labour Party should participate.  As I said, we did so in good faith.</P>
      <P>I discussed the proceedings with a few representatives of the Labour Party on that Committee and they were able to do this because they got permission from the Constitution Committee to consult with the leaders of the Parties, with Deputy Cosgrave and myself.  I was kept well informed as to what was happening.  I was told that there was a discussion about our electoral system, that there were different systems proposed, some good, some bad, some outlandish; as a matter of fact, some of the outlandish ones were proposed by prominent members, but I was told it was unanimously agreed that the straight vote was out, that it should not be mentioned and that one of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party on this Committee considered that as it was an issue which had been decided in 1959 it should not go back to the people again.  Other matters were discussed, matters that were of more importance, I suggest, than this system which nobody asked for except certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They discussed the name of the country.  I think it is necessary that we should change the name of the country to Ireland.  As far as the Constitution is concerned, the name of the country is Éire.  This was one of the suggestions which was agreed to unanimously by the members of the Committee.  The consensus of opinion was that we should make it clear in the Constitution that the area of jurisdiction of Dáil Éireann was the Twenty-six Counties, pending re-unification of the whole Thirty-two Counties. This is a desirable change.  I remember a Ceann Comhairle one evening being there where the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Jones, is when we talked about the Industrial Development Act.  I think it was some member of the Clann na Poblachta who proposed that County Fermanagh should be included in the under-developed areas.  Of course, the amendment could not be taken.  Under the Constitution we were entitled to legislate for Fermanagh but the Chair refused the amendment; he was very embarrassed, and so was Deputy Aiken who was then the Minister in change of the Bill.  This is one of the desirable changes that should be put before the people for decision.</P>
      <P>Another matter which was discussed at the Constitution Committee was the desirability of having a President. There were some who thought there was no necessity to have a President. I do not say that that is the overall view in the country.  It may be a minority view, but there are people who believe we should not have a President, who think this should be combined with the Office of Taoiseach or that there should be some other arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a discussion as to whether or not the Seanad was a useful body.  Many people believed it was not.  I will not say they were in the majority or in the minority, but this was the sort of discussion that took place.  As far as my Party is concerned, we believe there should not be a Seanad.  We believe the Seanad serves no useful purpose.  However, it is part of our Constitution that we should <Col N="302" /> have a Seanad.  Would that not be something the people might like to express an opinion on?</P>
    <P>Another matter which was considered by this Committee was whether or not there should be a vote given at 18 years of age.  I believe it should, but the people will not be allowed for another 20 years to decide whether or not this should be allowed.  There are many arguments in favour of giving votes to people at 18 years of age.  We could give a litany of the responsibilities they have: they pay taxes; if they join the Army they have to go out and fight if they are ordered to do so.  There are hundreds of arguments as to why they should have the vote, but, because we are going to mark the year 1968 with a referendum, we shall not have one on this question for, perhaps, another seven years.</P>
    <P>The first referendum was, I suppose, that on the Constitution which took place in 1936.  I will admit that in 1936 we had this political bitterness to which I referred, apart from the merits or demerits of what is contained in the Constitution.  There were good things in the Constitution.  I suppose the majority of them would be accepted. There were other things in it that could be and were objected to at that time. But again it was a question of wanting a package deal and one had to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are approaching this whole question in any sort of democratic way or adult way and I do not think the Minister could blame us for believing that there are ulterior motives in what the Government are doing.  Their solicitude for the position of the Labour Party does not impress anyone.  If the Constitution is to be changed, let us change it in other respects as well.  If we are going to imitate the Six Counties and employ the straight vote, why should we not imitate the system in the Six Counties whereby those people who emigrate to Great Britain are given a vote for a period of two years or while they are on the register?  Why do we not give a postal vote in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>These are much more important questions than this question that was decided by a majority, even if a slim <Col N="303" /> majority, of the people in 1959.  We believe and we have good reason to believe that this Constitution Committee was a cod and a fraud.  Indeed, the Minister for Industry and Commerce as Chairman of that Committee has the neck to suggest that Deputy Tully and Deputy Dunne would resume the second part of the examination of the public institutions and procedure here in Parliament.  Once bitten twice shy.  If they think they are going to get the Labour Party to participate in this fraud, they are very much mistaken.  I thought the Minister, Deputy Colley, was sincere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought he was sincere in his approach to this Committee.  As a matter of fact, we wondered at the urgency of it; he came into the committee room and at 6 o'clock one evening wanted the reports of the discussions immediately.  He was not concerned about votes at 18 years of age or the usefulness of the Seanad or the election of the President.  He wanted to have something to put before the Government, believing that the reports would give justification for changing our voting system.  As I say, we were codded in this, but we are not going to be codded twice.  We were codded as far as the famous Health Committee was concerned, the one that was established by Deputy MacEntee and that went on for years and years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government want to make this a parliament, they will have to have a little more regard for the Opposition, not necessarily for Deputy Cosgrave or myself or any of the personnel of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties.  They seem to be so concerned about the Opposition now that they will have to show this in a better way than they are doing in the arguments they are using here.  We concede that they have a majority.  We concede that they can outvote us on any issue whether singly or combined but, if this Parliament is to be regarded as a parliament, if people are to have respect for public representatives, there must be greater respect shown by the members of the Government not alone for people in <Col N="304" /> benchers as well and this has not been benchers as well, and this has not been shown.</P>

      <P>They put you there to behave properly, and you are not doing a service; I am not concerned with the service or disservice you are doing to the Fianna Fáil Party but I am concerned with the disservice you are doing to the nation in, as has been mentioned, your announcements opening a petrol station or a small meeting of a local cumann in Roscommon or down in Ballydehob.</P>
      <P>I think we must be impressed with the speed with which the British Government responded to something that happened within their Commonwealth, the hanging of those three unfortunate coloured people in Rhodesia.  There was a statement immediately.  They did not wait for Cáirde Fáil or a dinner of Taca.  The Minister knows only too well that in order to get any information from the Government, we have to put down questions and questions. The difficulty is that four and sometimes five clear days have to elapse before we can get any information from any of the Ministers or from the Taoiseach, say, when we know he has vital information to transmit to the nation with regard to the Common Market or his talks with Mr. Wilson or with Mr. O'Neill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the Fianna Fáil Government as the most arrogant Front Bench I have ever seen and I have seen them here since 1945.  I am not concerned about the disservice they are doing to the Fianna Fáil Party but the disservice they are doing to the nation.  If, as they say, they are concerned about the Opposition to such an extent that they want to change the system of election, they would want to demonstrate their solicitude for the Opposition in more ways than trying <Col N="305" /> to impose on the people a system of election that is undemocratic, unfair and unjust.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Corish has said in his remarks about the Labour Party.  I cannot see in Cork county&mdash;and I am a fairly good judge&mdash;that there will be any change as far as the four representatives of the Labour Party are concerned. I cannot see Deputy Mrs. Desmond losing her seat under either PR or the single seat; neither can I see Deputy McAuliffe nor Deputy P. Murphy losing their seats.  I cannot see Labour losing a seat in Cork city either.  I give them that above board. My reason for being in favour of the straight vote is one and one only: I do not give two hoots whether it is PR or what kind of representation you have, I will be here anyway.</P>

I know some people are old at 30, and Deputy Dillon has come to that stage. I remember him coming in here, a fine, arrogant young man.  The first thing he did was to vote for &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; as Taoiseach.  Then he was shifted over there and you could see in later years that the &ldquo;nut&rdquo; was not too sound. I will give you the gospel according to St. James.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The rag-tag Constitution that we have provides for proportional <Col N="306" /> representation.  I suppose that, until we can change that, we have got to abide this as well as the many other evils that have been foisted upon us by the incompetent Government that we have got ....</P>
    <P>Proportional representation is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation.  So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog.  I doubt if any other sane democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament....  It was foisted upon us by a collection of half-lunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle, but like all these crank ideas in operation, it has resulted here in an election in 1931, an election in 1932, an election in 1938, an election in 1939, an election in 1943, and an election in 1944.</P>
    <P>That is the statement made in this House on 12th November, 1947, by Deputy Dillon.  That was his opinion at that time of PR before the brain went on him.</P>

You have Deputies on both sides of the House who believe one way <Col N="307" /> or the other.  I do not believe that the dangers Deputy Dillon saw in 1941 and 1942 exist any longer.  I do not believe if we had a minority Government in the morning it would be shifted.  Every Deputy knows that it now costs anything between £1,000 and £1,500 to get in here.

    <P>That was Deputy Dillon on 12th November, 1947.  Could anything be stronger than the words he used about PR: &ldquo;... the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation&rdquo;?  Could anything be stronger than that?  That was Deputy Dillon's description of PR I should not say a word about it.  I will be 41 years in this House next June.  Therefore I cannot say anything very hard about it.  We should examine the grounds of the objections. Speaking of Cork county&mdash;and I cannot speak for any other part of the country&mdash;the Labour Party would get back their four representatives from Cork county under the proposed system. I know the four Deputies concerned and it does not matter what Party they belong to.  They are four representatives who are doing their work.

There is such a thing as paying a man according to his work.

      <P>Since we are talking of constitutions let us examine this matter and see where it leads.  There is argument about changing the representation in big urban areas as compared with rural areas but we know the difficulty of the representative in a single-seat constituency.

      <P>The Deputy who is pinned down and has a population of 20,000 to look after must do his job for those people and, if not, he will be out in the next election, whether he is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. You will not have to wait for free elections to discover the fellow who is dodging.  That is why I say you will get a better Deputy who will do his job better.  He will be able to travel through his constituency in a day at most and will be able to look after it in a day.  He will not have the trouble such as I have seen in the case of some Deputies&mdash;I gave one example in Adare &mdash;of leaving home for two or three days and going to another portion of the constituency and working there for that period.  No expenses are allowed by the House for that kind of work. That Deputy gets no more than the man who has to take a 4d bus ride. That is the difference between the city constituency and the rural one.  There is no comparison between a Deputy in Dublin city, in Cork city or Limerick city and a Deputy elected for a rural area.</P>
      <P>I have a pretty close knowledge of Deputies in my own county and I have seen how things work out.  For example, I know that Deputy McAuliffe is as hard working a Deputy as any in this House.  He has worked hard and built up his constituency and he will hold his seat in any portion of that constituency that is marked out.  I can say the same thing for Deputy M. P. Murphy and also for Deputy Mrs. Desmond.</P>
