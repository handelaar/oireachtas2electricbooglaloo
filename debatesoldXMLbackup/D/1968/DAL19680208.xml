      <P>On the Order of Business, might I raise a procedural matter in connection with Motion No. 21?  This motion is down in the name of Deputy Hogan, who is Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. I understand it is the first occasion on which a motion of this sort has been put on the Order Paper and I should like to know from the Taoiseach what arrangements can be made for discussing it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This is a motion which is in the name of Deputy Hogan, not as a member of the Fine Gael Party but rather as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understand there is a desire that this motion be discussed at an early stage. I am not certain, however, whether the Committee required that the motion be discussed in Government time. Normally, if a request of this nature is made by the Leader of the Opposition for a debate on a matter of public importance, the request is treated sympathetically by the Government side.  I would be disposed to do that in matters of that sort.  Might I suggest that this being an all-Party matter, if the Committee of Public Accounts decide to seek priority, as laid down in Standing Orders for a debate on this motion, I would certainly be agreeable to instruct the members of my Party on the Committee <Col N="724" /> to seek that priority and agreeable also to giving it priority.  Of course, it is a matter for the Committee themselves.  May I suggest that as this is something novel, a motion in the name of a Member of the Opposition in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, he might discuss the question of giving it priority with his Committee and perhaps raise it again next week or as soon thereafter as the Committee meet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1968, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Dáil Éireann on the 31st day of January, 1968, under subsection (6) of Section 4 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these regulations is to bring the employment of managers <Col N="725" /> of employment offices within the scope of the social insurance scheme.  Hitherto the employment was not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts or under the former National Health Insurance, Widows' and Orphans' Pensions and the Unemployment Insurance Acts. The method adopted is to include the employment among those specified as insurable in Part I of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>The question of the insurability of the employment of managers was raised by their Association at a conciliation council comprising representatives of the Association and representatives of the Department of Labour.  The agreed recommendation of that council is that the employment be brought within the scope of the social insurance scheme.  Since managers are not pensionable and have no sick pay privileges, I consider that they should be fully insurable under the Acts and accordingly, the draft regulations provide for the inclusion of the employment in Part I of the First Schedule to the Act.  Where the employment is of a subsidiary nature or the manager is not mainly dependent on the remuneration for his livelihood it is proposed to exclude it from the effect of Article 3.  This is being achieved by Article 4 of the draft regulations which adds this type of employment to the list of employments specified in Part II of the First Schedule to the Act as being excepted from insurance.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the position because this is a typical example of regulations which do not obviously explain themselves.  We should be grateful, too, because this is one of the rare occasions on which a Minister makes a regulation of which a draft must be approved by the House before it can come into effect. We have all too often complained of legislation which provides for the making of regulations which stand and are the law of the land until such time as they are amended by motion tabled <Col N="726" /> here in the House.  This is one of the rare occasions on which a regulation cannot come into effect until specific approval is given to it and we are, therefore, glad to have this opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Minister has explained the necessity for this but I wonder if he would be good enough to let us have some information as to the mode of recruitment of the people whom it is sought to provide for in these regulations.  One would have thought that they would be classified as persons in the employment of the Government and as such would come within the scope of paragraph 3 of the First Schedule of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and that they therefore would not need any further coverage.  Apparently there are other views on that but I would be glad if the Minister would be good enough to put us wise on that specific issue.  From the Minister's remarks it would appear to be done because the people concerned are regarded as being in the employment of the State under contract for service rather than under contract of service which of course is provided for in the 1952 Act.</P>
      <P>For a considerable number of years past, we on the Fine Gael benches have been pressing the Minister to introduce a similar regulation to the one which he is introducing today to provide for insurance agents who make their livelihood out of commissions earned on premiums and life policies and so on which they collect, but so far the Minister and his predecessor have hesitated to introduce this amending legislation to provide for those insurance agents who, I would consider, are probably much greater in number than the people to be covered by the regulations for which approval is sought today.  I should like, therefore, to hear the Minister's comments on these employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, we wish to agree in all respects with the regulations as drafted.  We consider it proper that they should be made and when we say that, we say also that any other classes of people in the community who are in a similar position should also have regulations made in respect of them and it should not be confined to those <Col N="727" /> persons who are termed employment officers under the Minister for Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course the Minister for Social Welfare is solely responsible for those who are covered by social insurance and this is the context in which I am raising this point.  I shall be very brief.  I should like to ask the Minister at this stage what prompted the ESB and the Department of Social Welfare to notify those men, who have been employed down the years as meter readers with the ESB and who were covered in fact by insurance, that they were no longer subject to insurance and that the Department proposed to refund the amount those employees had paid into the insurance fund.  It seems to me to be an injustice to this group who are employed by the ESB to read meters. Without having had time to look up this matter and purely off the cuff, I am asking the Minister to explain briefly the position at this stage because I propose to raise the subject matter of this question later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to add to what I have already said. Subsection (5) of section 4 of the 1952 Act makes provision to cover new categories and that is what we are doing in this case.  It has been done as a result of a conciliation council, representative of the association representing the branch managers, and the Department of Labour, the Department by which they are employed, and agreement was reached requesting me to have them made insurable.  This is a case where I am glad that decision has been taken because these people, while we may quibble about the question of a contract for service or of service, do work irregular office hours and most of them depend entirely on that as their main, if not their sole, means of livelihood and they were not pensionable.  I think it is fair that the benefits of insurability should be extended to them.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ryan, I should say that the same applies to any other section who might request that they should be made insurable.  Their case will be considered if they make a case. I can see a difficulty with regard to insurance agents whose hours of work would be pretty difficult to determine because they are acting as agents and might work only a few hours per week or very long hours.  I can foresee a difficulty there.  However, if any person wishes to make a case, I shall be glad to have it considered.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether we should plunge into this question, which is <i>sub judice</i> at the moment, of meter readers.  I had a couple of questions here yesterday or the day before and the House will remember that in my reply I pointed out that one of those aggrieved persons or one of those applicants has appealed this case and the decision in that case, which will come before an appeals officer, will determine the insurability or otherwise of similar persons in that category.  It will then be open to each individual to make a separate application if he feels that he comes within the category.</P>

      <P>I was making reference to the category to which Deputy Carter referred, relevantly or otherwise. I do not like the remark about hanging them separately.  My Department are most generous with regard to the treatment of every category.  That fact is proved by the almost universality of coverage that has been <Col N="730" /> reached in recent times.  It would be necessary to have them apply individually. For some of these meter readings, which is only one of the jobs, some of them are very few hours on the job; others have long hours.  It is specifically stated in the Act that under 18 hours is not insurable.  It is not to hang them separately.  I resent that remark.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Education).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Education is one of the most important aspects of our everyday life and it would be a shame not to avail of this opportunity to speak on that subject.  A few years ago the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; was a very dull word in the minds of most people but now it is one of the most live issues of our time.  The public are fully aware of what is going on in the matter of education and there is constant dialogue on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that, irrespective of who does it, something must be done in the next ten years for the sake <Col N="731" /> of the generation that will emerge from our schools at that time.  In that context, we are doing what we believe to be right, irrespective of what other people may say.  We are acting now for the benefit of the schoolgoing population.</P>
    <P>I am very gratified, as I am sure every Deputy is, by what I will describe as the new inspector/teacher relationship. At one stage the visit of the inspector to the school was regarded almost as an interference, something that had to be endured.  The anticipated visit of the inspector would have an effect on the entire school and the children would be told to have on their best bibs and tuckers for the occasion.  That is no longer the position. In these days the teacher looks forward with enormous interest to the visit of the inspector and there is constant dialogue between teacher and inspector with a view to solving the common problem as to what is best for the children.  I welcome this change of atmosphere for which the Minister is very largely responsible.</P>
    <P>I was horrified to learn of the condition of certain schools, as I am sure was the Minister.  Most people who saw photographs of these schools were equally horrified.  I know the reaction of the Minister and most honest people here would agree that his reaction is that such schools will have his immediate attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in regard to this matter, said in his introductory statement:</P>
    <P>I will not rest content, however, until all our school children are housed in decent buildings with reasonable standards of hygiene, heating and general comfort.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>One step I have recently taken is to give authority to school managers to have the heating and sanitary systems in schools brought up to suitable standard, where this is necessary; and I have given an undertaking that, where a manager has such work done satisfactorily, a grant will be paid towards its cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The Minister cannot do more than that. If there are any schools in a similar condition to those that have been reported in the South of Ireland, the Minister is the first person who would want to know about them.</P>
    <P>The grants for new school buildings are the most generous that anyone could ask for.  If the cost of a new school is £100,000, the £100,000 is advanced and only 30 per cent of that would be repayable over 15 years.  It is obvious, therefore, that every possible aid is being given for the extension of education facilities.</P>
    <P>My colleague of Dublin South-West, Deputy Dowling, referred to a subject to which I should also like to make reference and I would ask the Minister to state his view in regard to the problem.  I would suggest that a person who passes even one subject in either the intermediate certificate or leaving certificate should receive a certificate to that effect.  The subjects in which the candidate passed could be listed. If this were done, the person would not be in the position of having to say that he had neither the intermediate nor the leaving certificate.  I know that a form is issued indicating that a candidate passed in some subjects. If my suggestion were adopted, candidates would not have the terrible inferiority complex that might be involved in having failed mathematics, Irish or English.  A candidate who reaches a standard in other subjects is entitled to have an appropriate certificate to that effect.  If I were engaging a person and I wanted to know if that person had the intermediate certificate or the leaving certificate and if only those with the intermediate certificate or leaving certificate applied, I might be condemning a lot of people who had passed in a certain number of subjects and had no particular aptitude for certain other subjects.  I would be most interested to hear the Minister's reply to that particular point.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Lindsay referred to the so-called interference of Ministers in relation to university appointments. It is all very well to talk about Government interference and about the <Col N="733" /> setting up of bodies for this and that. We all hear people saying that the country is being run by bureaucrats, that members of the Government are only rubber stamps and we hear of Ministers becoming rubber stamps. When Ministers show they are not rubber stamps, the criticism is that political influence and the like are resorted to.</P>
    <P>The Government have the responsibility of spending the nation's money, the taxpayers' money, as wisely as possible.  If millions of pounds of the Irish taxpayers' money is being spent on education, university and otherwise, it is essential, in my opinion, that the Minister and the Government should have an active interest in how this money is spent and in the people who are placed in positions of responsibility. They must ensure that the money is being spent wisely.  It is all very well for the education authorities to take this money and say: &ldquo;Thank you very much.  Now get away from us.  We will spend this as we think fit&rdquo;.  Thank God, we have a Minister for Education who is interested in education and is enthusiastic about it.  This is vital.  He has never been afraid to take on anyone or anything in the interests of education.  He is director of the policy on education.  He is the one who will take responsibility for it in the final analysis.  Here is a man who, in my opinion, if he is going to take responsibility for education in this country will seek the power to do so.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of criticism was aroused when the one-teacher schools were abandoned, but as we can see, this has died down.  People have become educated to the fact that two-, three- or four-teacher schools are far better than one-teacher schools. They have seen that where one teacher has to take all the subjects for all the classes, any extension of the curriculum of that school was wellnigh impossible. It is all very well to talk about broader education if you have only one teacher in a school because he can do nothing about it.  I am delighted to see that more and more people at last are aware of the tremendous advantage of modern schools in regard to better education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> Another point I should like to touch on before I conclude is the extension of the curriculum.  A few years ago the great cry was for the teaching of civics.  Now they are being taught and our children are being allowed to grow up knowing something about the institutions of this country and knowing something about manners.  When I say &ldquo;manners&rdquo;, I mean that they have respect for private property.</P>
    <P>I consider that the outstanding feature of this whole Estimate is that ten years ago we were spending £16 million a year on education, whereas now that figure is £38 million. This is a phenomenal increase and I doubt if there are any other countries in Europe which can show such a sharp increase.  I am also very pleased to see in the Minister's speech that he abolished the primary school certificate examination.  As we all know, some children develop later than others.  It is unfortunate that a child nine, ten or 11 years old, who is a late developer, was condemned in the past to work at something for which he was not particularly cut out because he had not developed far enough to pass a particular certificate examination.</P>
    <P>I am delighted at the attention given to vocational education.  Some years ago it was not considered respectable to attend the vocational school.  That prejudice has certainly been eliminated. I know parents whose children wanted to pursue a vocational education and because they did not consider that this was suitable, they insisted upon their becoming clerks or something like that, with the result that about 20 years later they ended up in a mental home because they were forced into something they did not want to do.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the Minister's scheme in regard to the bus services has been so successful, particularly in view of the fact&mdash;I should not derive satisfaction from this but I do&mdash; that some people said that the scheme was impossible to operate.  I always love to see something being achieved when there are comments saying we cannot do it.  Nothing is impossible. I think this is the greatest philosophy of our Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> I do not intend to delay the House much longer.  I am delighted to see a decline in the number of children detained in reformatory schools.  It obviously points to an improvement in the educational system.  You have juvenile delinquency where you have not proper education.  Now that our educational facilities are improving, I am sure that those figures will decline further.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear if the Minister has any information as to whether paintings from the National Gallery which are not on view will be exhibited in other cities.  I am all in favour of those cities contributing something either by way of insurance or in some other way towards the protection of those paintings.  If they are insured here at Government level, the people in those cities and towns will not have the same respect for them as they would if they had a stake in their care.  They will also be well looked after.  We can boast of some wonderful treasures in the Art Gallery and it would be a wonderful thing if cities such as Cork and Limerick had an opportunity of putting those paintings on show for the public.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the comprehensive schools have been so successful and that a further two schools are being erected, one at Glenties and another at Raphoe, County Donegal.  I am very conscious of the fact that the Minister has impressed on his Department the need to get modern aids in education, that is to say, audio-visual aids in schools for which I understand grants are being availed of by all schools, or most of them.  They should be availed of by all schools.  It would be most helpful.</P>
    <P>People say that free education is not free.  They forget one essential point, that is, that the students who obviously could not receive post-primary education because of their parents' lack of financial resources can now obtain it. As far as I am concerned, that is free education to a person who normally would not have been able to receive it and nobody can tell me that, in that respect, it is not free.  Certainly, the taxpayer pays for it but it is free to the children and they know it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I congratulate the Minister on his achievements.  I wish him the very best of luck.  May his path be as smooth as possible through the next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Since the Estimate for the Department of Education was introduced last year, the Minister has organised the financing of post-primary education so as to make it available to very many children who otherwise could not avail of it and he is to be complimented on that and thanked for his efforts.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the organising of the financing of post-primary education so as to make it available to a much wider range of children was long overdue. While in no way belittling or endeavouring to detract from the Minister's efforts when I say it was long overdue, I wish to point out that it has been available in many other countries for very many years.  We all know that free education, as it is called, has been available across the Border, in the Six Counties, for quite a considerable time.  What I am saying is not meant in any way to detract from the Minister's efforts but I do not think we should create the impression or get the idea that this is something completely new, completely unheard of.  It is something new in this country but it was something which was considerably overdue.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the Minister's efforts not as providing free education but as organising the financing of post-primary education so as to make it available to a wider range of pupils. Really, through his Department and through the Government, the Minister has made a further redistribution of the national income so as to make post-primary education available to a wider range of students.  That is not meant to belittle the Minister's efforts or to detract from them but it is an effort on my part to get things into their proper perspective.  If it costs money it must be paid for.  In this case, it must be paid for by the taxpayers in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, a Deputy referred to the transport of pupils to post-primary teaching establishments and its cost.  At the same time, he referred <Col N="737" /> to a cut in the grants from the Road Fund towards the upkeep of county roads.  It is, I suppose, significant that the cost of transport of post-primary students in this current year amounts to £840,000.  I think the cut in what are known as the road grants to county councils throughout the country amounts to approximately the same figure.  That shows that the money must come from somewhere.  However, the Minister is to be congratulated and I do genuinely congratulate him, on taking this step which was long overdue.</P>
    <P>Any new scheme is bound to have its teething troubles and undoubtedly this scheme has its problems and difficulties. The Minister said in his opening speech that students are required to attend the nearest post-primary school, whether that be a small technical school or a large secondary school, properly so called.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Briscoe that a very sound education can be given and is given in technical schools. There is a lot to be said for technical education as opposed to purely secondary education as we have understood it up to the present time.  It is an undoubted fact that some technical schools are not as well-equipped to provide a suitable post-primary education as other technical or other secondary schools.  Therefore, the position at the moment is that some children are getting a post-primary education under this scheme of a lower standard than others&mdash;and I shall not put it any stronger than that.</P>
    <P>I quite realise that this is the first year of the scheme.  I quite realise that everything cannot happen overnight. The point I want to make is that if the Minister intends to continue to provide post-primary education in the nearest post-primary teaching establishment&mdash; whether it be a technical school or one of the secondary schools as we have understood them up to the present&mdash; there is an obligation on him to see to it as quickly as possible that every technical and, indeed, every secondary school that is recognised for the purposes of this scheme is brought up to a minimum standard.  Nobody in the <Col N="738" /> House can seriously disagree with that request, that all students availing of the Minister's scheme should get equal opportunities from the contribution the Minister is making.  The only way that can be done properly is to bring all the post-primary teaching establishments, especially the smaller technical schools, up to a minimum standard and to provide them with adequate teachers and adequate rooms.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of teachers for technical schools, I am sure the Minister knows that very often it is difficult to get teachers and sometimes even more difficult to retain them in certain areas when they have been employed.  The Minister and his Department will have to see to it that an adequate number of vocational teachers is available.  He will have to consider granting incentives to vocational teachers to encourage them to remain in areas which might not be regarded as attractive as other parts of the country.  That is one of the problems. In the poorer and more remote areas, vocational teachers are inclined to come and go.  That is not good for education.  It is not good for the pupils and it is bound to produce less favourable results than if the teachers remain for a long time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that during the year the Minister allowed the scheme to operate in a flexible enough way. For example, I think it is correct to say that he allowed pupils who had been attending a school other than the nearest post-primary school before the scheme came in to continue to do so. That shows a reasonable approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>If I might be parochial, the Minister knows there is a problem in Killeshandra, where a number of children, including some Church of Ireland children, wish to attend secondary schools in Cavan town and, indeed, have been attending those schools for some time.  Due to some local difficulty, the Minister has not yet seen fit to agree to defray the cost of transport from Killeshanda to Cavan town. There is considerable anxiety in the area over this problem.  A hardship is being inflicted on the parents of the children there.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="739" /> to cut through the red tape as he has been doing in so many other ways and provide this transport for the pupils concerned.  I know it is under consideration in his Department but in the matter of education, every month that passes is a considerable period.  The parents will not be satisfied until this matter is remedied.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk recently about the condition of our primary or national schools.  I am glad to see that this problem has been brought to a head and that some action has been taken to focus public attention on the disgraceful conditions of these schools. This is not something that developed overnight.  These buildings have simply been neglected for years.  In my lifetime, I have seen some very attractive national schools built, but in some cases within a year or two after they were built they were allowed to deteriorate and become shabby and unsightly.  The neglect of these buildings has been a gradual process.  I do not know whose fault it is, and I do not very much care.  But apart altogether from its being a waste of public money to allow these buildings to deteriorate, it cannot be good to educate children in such conditions and in such circumstances.  It cannot be calculated to give children respect for buildings and to instil in them the need to look after their own property properly later on.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that if sufficient grants are not being given to enable these schools to be properly maintained, adequate grants should be given.  If adequate grants are given, then the Minister and his Department should exercise some control over these establishments to see they are properly maintained and looked after.  Very many of the national schools on the sides of our roads are eyesores.  Indeed, some of them could qualify for a grant under the derelict sights scheme, or at least if they were removed, the countryside would look much better.</P>
    <P>I get the impression that the maintenance of these schools is nobody's responsibility.  I understand that some <Col N="740" /> grants are given by the Department but it is obvious these grants are inadequate.  However, I do not think any blame attaches to the INTO for bringing this matter out into the open and making an issue out of it.  Indeed, I think they are to be congratulated and I hope as a result these schools will be put in order and kept in order.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note from the Minister that he has responsibility for the education of mentally retarded and physically handicapped children.  In this field there is a lot to be done. I heard Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins dealing with this problem yesterday. It is a problem we find in all parts of the country.  I do not know how much longer it will take to provide accommodation for mentally retarded children, but there is an obligation on the nation to tackle this job and to tackle it at once.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been given considerable credit for the manner in which he implemented his post-primary education scheme, and it has been said that he cut red tape and got on with the work.  I am appealing to him now to do something for the unfortunate parents who have the cross of having in their family one retarded child or perhaps more.  There are very many families in which there is a retarded child, and that child is one of a family, maybe of three, four, five or six.  As that child comes to be seven or eight years of age, it is still left at home, and it is the cause of continual mental anguish to the parents who cannot do anything about it.  It is an embarrassment to the other members of the family.  That is probably putting the claim on its lowest level.  However, I do not know whether the Minister has ever had the experience of having these parents coming in frequently appealing to have something done and appealing to get this child away.  I know one father and mother who refused to vote for anybody at the last election or at the election before that because they have a retarded child at home and because they believe that the Government and public representatives have let them down.</P>
    <P>There are things that people can <Col N="741" /> talk about and appeals that people can make, but this is something that should be tackled at once, if it has to be tackled by the erection of prefabricated buildings which can be used for something else later on.  This situation leads to unhappiness among parents.  It leads to the children of the family who are physically and mentally all right being held up to ridicule by the other children at school.  The retarded child becomes like a ghost in the house that people are ashamed of; perhaps they should not be, but they are continually conscious of it.</P>
    <P>I have some experience in my professional capacity of the relationship existing between the parents of a retarded child and the child, and I can tell the Minister that all through the life of the father of such a child, he is conscious of his obligation to it. He is living in continual anxiety as to what is going to happen to this child when he dies.  I have had the duty on a number of occasions of making wills for people who have had this problem on their minds, and it is a very real problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much money it would take to solve this problem, but by comparison with the money that is being spent and has to be spent in other directions, I think it must be relatively small, and I would ask the Minister to see to it that this problem is solved.  At the present time there is a waiting list of years in every school in the country.  You write to this convent or to that institution run by brothers, and they simply tell you there is nothing they can do and that they cannot give you any idea as to when they might be able to house the children on whose behalf I am appealing.  It is a reflection on the Government; it is a reflection on the country and on everybody in it that we stand for this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Take people living in rural Ireland miles from a town.  The mother of a family, a farmer's wife, has, perhaps, to give a hand in the farmyard.  She has three or four normal, healthy schoolgoing children.  She is living in a house with three or four apartments and she has the constant worry of this <Col N="742" /> retarded, maybe badly retarded, child for 24 hours every day.  Is it any wonder she would become distraught? Is it any wonder she would become sour with society?  Is it any wonder she would think the Government had let her down and that the public representatives had let her down?  Is it any wonder that as a protest she would say: &ldquo;I refuse to vote for anybody.&rdquo;  I am trying to speak as forcefully as I can about this in order to bring home to the Minister that it is a very real problem and one which cannot be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>So much for the mentally retarded children.  There are physically handicapped children who present nothing like the same problem, but I am glad to know that there are many schools in the country which rehabilitates these physically handicapped children and try to provide them with the necessary skills to enable them to earn a living. I have come across a case recently of a girl who was sent to such a school to do a commercial course, and the only point I have to make here is that there should be a better effort made to place these young handicapped children in employment when they are trained.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this could be done.  I would suggest, for example, that the local authorities should be encouraged by the Department responsible to take on a number of these physically handicapped young people, even if it is only in a temporary capacity. The difficulty here is that these people are conscious of their physical handicap and the only way of getting over that consciousness and inferiority complex is to get them established in a job, even for a while.  There are a number of charitable private employers who employ them.  We have no control over such private employers but we can, as I said, encourage the local authorities, who have now become almost the biggest employers in the country, to take on these people in clerical positions or in whatever positions they have been trained for.</P>
    <P>More or less in the same line of country, I am glad to note that the number of young people in reformatories and industrial schools is quite low.  Deputy Briscoe thought that was <Col N="743" /> due to the expansion of our educational facilities.  I am sure that has something to do with it, but the very humane approach of the district court bench to juvenile delinquents is also responsible for the fact that there are not more young people in reformatories. I know that most district justices send boys to reformatories as a last resort, and only when there is no alternative.  They are quite right.</P>
    <P>I know one district justice who presided over a certain district court for about 20 years to my knowledge, and he was often blamed for being too lenient with young scoundrels as they are called, juvenile delinquents, but the answer was that in his area when he retired there was no serious crime. If he had been wrong in dealing with these young people with kid gloves, there would have been serious adult crime in the locality, but that was not so.  That does not mean I am saying that in the courts district justices should not impose severe penalties when the necessity arises.  I certainly think that young people should get every opportunity before they are locked up.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this comes under the Minister's Department or under the Department of Justice, but I think a more serious effort should be made to rehabilitate these boys who unfortunately have to be sent to reformatory schools, to keep in touch with them when they come out, through the probation officers or otherwise, and to try to find employment for them.  Otherwise we know what happens.  It is not too long before they are back in again.</P>
    <P>I completely approve of the common inter cert course.  That is a move in the right direction.  It is excellent to give children the opportunity of using their hands and their heads up to a certain point before they decide whether they want to pursue a trade or to go on to other types of education.  Under the vocational heading, I should like to appeal to the vocational section of the Department to cut the red tape and to cut out delays.  It is frustrating for vocational education committees to put proposals to the Department and <Col N="744" /> find they do not get a decision for months, and sometimes for years.  Unnecessary delays should be cut out.</P>
    <P>I was interested, indeed, to hear Deputy Briscoe appealing for a limited intermediate certificate certifying that a student had passed in Irish, English and maths or maths, history and geography.  Fine Gael have been asking for such a certificate for many years.  The Fine Gael Party have been advocating that a student should not be deprived of a certificate just because he fails to pass in Irish, for example, any more than if he failed to pass in maths.  We have been advocating that he should get a certificate certifying that he has passed in the subjects he did pass in.  On that I am in complete agreement with Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the revival of the Irish language.  I am glad to note that since the Fine Gael Party published their policy on this subject some time ago, there has been an improvement.  The Fine Gael Party thought then and think now that the stick should be taken out of Irish, that fear should be taken out of Irish, and that the Government should cease trying to revive Irish on a purely commercial basis.  In so far as the Buntús Cainte programmes are attractive and tend to encourage people to take an interest in Irish I wish to express my complete approval of them.  The Fianna Fáil Party, as they have done so often in other spheres, have accepted the Fine Gael policy on the revival of Irish.  They do not do this lock, stock and barrel overnight.  They take it bit by bit, digest it over a long period, and eventually accept it, lock, stock and barrel.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand there is new thinking in the Department on the leaving certificate. I do not know how well this information is founded but I understand that some sort of advanced leaving certificate is being talked about in the Department, and that when it <Col N="745" /> becomes a reality it will be possible to get a leaving certificate without a pass in Irish.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has heard anything about this but it is being talked about.  Since the appeal by the Fine Gael Party for an approach to the revival of the Irish language other than by methods of compulsion, there has been a change.  When I came into this House first, when you rang up any Department you were answered in English, notwithstanding the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party were howling for the restoration of the Irish language. Since the Fine Gael Party came out with their policy and appealed for a more rational approach to the language, you are answered in Irish. That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>If we are to revive the Irish language, we will revive it only by creating an atmosphere in which a man will not consider himself fully educated unless he knows the Irish language. Create that sort of atmosphere and you will revive the language but you will not revive it by encouraging students to cram Irish into their course for six, or 12 months or for two years until they can get an examination and then forget all about it.  That has been the approach for far too long.  In so far as the Buntús Cainte programmes display a civilised approach towards the restoration of the language, I welcome them completely.  They are a move in the right direction and they are programmes which were inspired by the Fine Gael approach to the revival of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>To describe the Minister as being dynamic in his approach to education is, I suppose, a gross understatement.  While appreciating what the Minister has done, we must also pay tribute to his predecessors, each of whom played a certain part. The Minister's greatest achievement is that he educated the people to think about education.  Apart from providing the huge total of £36¼ million, which is double the expenditure of ten years ago, he has got the ordinary people thinking about education.  He has made education a popular talking point.  The people are prepared to make sacrifices by paying taxation and <Col N="746" /> parents are prepared to make further sacrifices so that their children can go on from primary school, now with free secondary education, and eventually on to the university.  Our greatest hope for full prosperity lies in the fact that an educated people will be prosperous. Then you will have a proper climate in which to create the society which the vast majority of people want to create.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we must appreciate that the Minister has difficulties, as have all other countries, but be it said to the credit of the Minister and the Government that they have refused to cut back on educational services.  Some so-called socialist countries are held up to us sometimes as being the very epitome of perfection in social services, yet when they experience financial difficulties one of the first things which they cut back is education.  To my mind, this is deplorable and personally I would cut back on any service except education.  If you educate people you can create a society which is as near perfect as you will ever get.  If you do not have proper education then you are building a house which will not last.</P>
      <P>I can recall the state of educational services in Dublin 30 years ago when there was an educational apartheid.  If you went to a primary school only you were classed as being much lower than the boy who went to secondary school. If you did not wear a flashy schoolcap with a nice crest on it then that was your badge of apartheid and you were one of the untouchables.  I want to pay tribute to the teachers and the Christian Brothers of those dark days when they provided a magnificent service and tried to do as best they could from the resources they had.  They educated our boys and girls from the poorest homes.  That was not fashionable then. It is fairly fashionable today.  I should like to pay tribute to the primary teachers who followed in the footsteps of Pearse and to the Christian Brothers who rendered such a magnificent service to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we hear of teachers taking action today about insanitary schools, we may consider that this is not the best approach, but at the same time I <Col N="747" /> have a certain sympathy with them, being aware of the conditions obtaining in this city years ago.  At that time, perhaps we did not have the resources, or perhaps we did not think in this way, and little was done about such matters.  Now the Government, the Minister and the people are thinking about education, which is the greatest guarantee that we will build a really prosperous society in which our people will be able to live full lives in full employment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned snobbery earlier and there is another type of snobbery today where parents are inclined to send their children for commercial careers rather than to vocational schools where they would receive training of a manual nature.  It is seldom I admire the Soviet Union but some time ago I read about the vast sums which they spend on vocational education.  Someone said that they are too poor not to be able to afford this huge expenditure.  That may appear contradictory but it is not, and I agree we are too poor also not to be able to afford all the money we can get for vocational education.  With the advance in science it may be that in 20 years the computers may be doing most of the work but we should train our youths to make these computers, to service them and to operate them, because I am afraid that for the ordinary clerical worker the future is not very bright.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that when the Minister is considering his final plans for setting up the new university in Dublin he should bring in technical schools like Kevin Street and Bolton Street.  The new Kevin Street school is a magnificent building and it will play a great part in the educational services.  Speaking as a layman, I wonder if we could not have a university complex with UCD and TCD and also, as types of constituent colleges, Kevin Street Technical School as well as Bolton Street and the new school in Ballymun.  Then you would have a complete run from primary school to secondary school and on to the constituent colleges then to take, say, an engineering degree in UCD or TCD.  There is a great opportunity <Col N="748" /> for us to do something really new in this line.  The Minister's courage in tackling the proposed merger between UCD and TCD took the breath from many of us but it is well worth considering and it will remove the last vestige of snobbery in the university in that boys will be able to go on right up to university level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made an eloquent plea for better facilities for handicapped children.  I do not think there is anybody in the House who will disagree with him in this regard.  Each one of us as a public representative or otherwise meets people who have mentally or physically retarded children and we find that the story Deputy Fitzpatrick tells is true, that it is impossible to get some of these children into a school.  When they try they are told there is a waiting list.  There are several associations doing tremendous work with the help of the Government and by their own efforts, such groups as the Parents and Friends of Mentally Handicapped Children and the Polio Fellowship.  These people are doing a tremendous job but they just cannot do the whole job.  The whole resources of the State must be thrown behind them.  In the world today there are lots of people with funny ideas about people who are deformed or handicapped in any way.  The more materialistic nations do not consider them worth bothering about.  We must set a headline on this.  Where there is a handicapped child, let there be a school he can go to get some training. If he has very little mental power, it may be difficult to give him training but we can relieve the parents of the terrible anxiety of having a handicapped child with nowhere to go. Deputy Fitzpatrick says that they say: &ldquo;What will happen to him when I die?&rdquo;  This, of course, is what is on the minds of the parents.</P>
    <P>If we can say: &ldquo;We, the State, will train him to the best of our ability and at least he will not be on the street when you die.  He will have a home and he will be educated all the time&rdquo;, it will not be so bad.  Some years ago, just after the Minister was changed to Education he opened a Polio Fellowship house at Goatstown, County Dublin and I would suggest to any <Col N="749" /> Deputy to go out there and see the work those people have done.  Thank God, polio is dying out because of the advance of science by way of serums but this is only one disease which is dying.  I feel that the mentally handicapped child is even worse off than the physically handicapped because the physically handicapped can be given some training.  It may be difficult with the mentally handicapped but still we must not just throw him aside.  I hope when the Budget comes and in next year's Estimates that we will make a much greater contribution towards schools and the training of those children.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to read that the numbers going to industrial reform schools is declining.  I do not know if this is a sign of betterment of our social life&mdash;we hear a lot about delinquency. I should like to ask the Minister to try to ensure that where possible boys should be sent to a school near their home, say, within ten or 15 miles of it.  Boys from this city are sent to County Galway.  I suppose a number of those boys come from people who are in the lower income group, not the majority of them but a number of them, and the parents just cannot afford to visit them.  Therefore, I feel we lose a certain amount of parental help with these children.  If a boy is away from home for 12 months perhaps and does not see his parents, it is very unlikely when he returns home that he will accept their control.  While he is in the school, he is being trained in different ways by good people who are teachers, but he will not have had the affection that he would have had at home.  I feel the Minister might well consider arranging that a boy should be sent to the nearest school and in the case of Dublin the nearest school should be much nearer than Letterfrack.  People may say: &ldquo;These children must be punished.&rdquo;  It is not so much a question of punishment, but they must be shown that this is not the right way to live.  However, I suggest that the parents' influence is a tremendous factor and if a Dublin boy is sent to Letterfrack he is out of touch with his parents.  I feel that frequent visits by the parents would help tremendously. <Col N="750" /> I would ask the Minister to remember this when he receives the report on the matter.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to mention one other thing.  I know that some allegedly clever people now think that it is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to do to attack religious orders.  While they may have had their faults in the past, we should not forget the great service they provided for our people, at one time the only service open to the mass of the people.  I want to go on record as saying that while I have had my reservations about secondary schools of 30 years ago when we had educational apartheid in this city, at the same time I want to reiterate again my admiration for the primary school teachers and the Christian Brothers.</P>
    <P>I want to again congratulate the Minister who is doing a magnificent job.  Not alone has he got the Government and his Party behind him, but I believe he has got the whole country behind him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their constructive suggestions, and while I may not refer to every point dealt with in the debate, I would like to assure the Deputies in question that if I do omit anything in my reply now, I shall write personally to them in the course of the next two weeks when I look further into some of these matters which could not be dealt with today.</P>
      <P>The first question that might be asked of a Minister for Education is what is the principal thing that animates him in seeking better education for the people of his country.  My answer would be that it is to enable every citizen to lead a full life.  We cannot expect a citizen to lead this full life unless his education is such as will enable him to develop his potential to the greatest possible extent and having reached that stage, he can then expect to derive a high degree of satisfaction from work and pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our present age a high level of education is essential not alone for any worthwhile position but for any real <Col N="751" /> enjoyment of many of the modern vehicles of entertainment.  Whatever else we might say, for example, about television, it does provide us from time to time with first-class educational programmes which can be fully appreciated only by those whose own education is adequate.  Not only will the educational requirements for various posts continue to rise but all human activities will become more and more sophisticated. A man or woman who has not acquired a good education cannot hope to live a full life in the circumstances which will obtain in the future.  Therefore, education is important, not only for its own sake but for the sake of the social man.  I make these opening statements in winding up the discussion on this Estimate so that people will appreciate, I hope, that I know not only where I am going as Minister for Education, but why I am going.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of education referred to by some of the speakers which I feel does not get the attention it deserves when we come to debate education in general.  I refer to adult education.  Of course, there are very many bodies engaged in adult education. The work being done in the vocational schools and by the various voluntary bodies comes readily to mind.  Excellent work is being done in many centres through the development, for example, of youth clubs.  It has been suggested to me that many more such clubs might be formed if accommodation were available.  This brings me to the thought that we have very fine assembly halls and large rooms associated with many primary, secondary, and vocational schools, the use of which is limited to a few hours every day.  Indeed, you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, could cite instances where some of these large halls are utilised only a few times a year.  This, of course, is a great tragedy.  We cannot let this position continue much longer while these clubs are crying out for accommodation and when we would just not be in a position to supply the millions and millions of pounds to fulfil this need.</P>
    <P>I would again refer to one of <Col N="752" /> Ireland's outstanding sociologists&mdash; perhaps he might not so entitle himself &mdash;Father Liam Ryan of UCC and his social document <i>Social Dynamite.</i> Those of us who have read this document recall with feelings of regret the lack of community centres in our housing schemes throughout Ireland. Father Ryan quoted families being taken from the old Georgian cities and put into other cities and into fine new houses and then the local authority saw the lovely plan coloured green called &ldquo;open space&rdquo; and now all that is there are boulders, rocks and wandering horses and the housing scheme is there and the young people are at the street corners and the old people have nowhere to go because of that lack of a community centre.  One cannot take this problem in isolation. It is very much associated with education of the young and adult education.</P>
    <P>Training in the use of leisure for our young people in their formative years is absolutely imperative.  The Minister for Education, the Department of Education and the Government cannot do a great deal but they can give indications, can provide guidelines; they can try to initiate co-ordination of the activities of these excellent voluntary bodies.  That brings to mind the boys' clubs and the tremendous work they are doing and all these other bodies comprising the National Youth Council.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that I got a letter from the Minister for Finance last evening authorising a small grant to the National Youth Council to help them in their problems.  It is not so long ago that all these various bodies dealing with the youth of the country&mdash;Macra na Tuatha, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Muintir na Tire, came together.  Perhaps I should not have mentioned those four because I have left out about 20.  An interesting development is that the Federation of Catholic Boys' Clubs have now received approval that these youth clubs be comprised of both sexes.  This is forward thinking by the Hierarchy or whoever is dealing at a high level with the organisation of these clubs.  It is mature thinking.  There is now approval that in these youth clubs boys <Col N="753" /> and girls can come to gether in an environment under suppervision.  They will have somewhere to go.  It is a wonderful step forward.</P>
    <P>Perhaps someone in the public gallery listening to me might ask what this Estimate is about.  We all appreciate that we cannot divorce the problem of leisure from the question of education.  The type of community centre to which I have referred and the utilisation of schools for this purpose will help our young people and those not so young to build up their character, develop their talents, increase their physical well-being, will give them an opportunity to exchange views and, as I said earlier, enable the individual to develop his full potential.</P>
    <P>Our schools are not concerning themselves sufficiently with the out-of-school recreation activities of our children.  We have very long holidays in Ireland.  Perhaps I might digress for a moment.  I have an idea at the present time in regard to which many school authorities do not agree with me although there are a few who do. I would like to see the schools in Ireland close down at the end of May and come back in what is the autumn, August.  Tourism immediately comes to mind but before we come to that, I want to say that I think everyone who contributed to this debate said that the children are our prime concern.  June, with the long days, even if there is not much sunshine, would enable families, as we know most of us would like to do, to go to the seaside or take their holidays in June, but due to the set-up at present, some of the schools go on to the end of June and I think some of them go into early July.  This just is not right.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the tourist industry. I have had a very strong case made to me by the Minister for Transport and Power to look at this problem of summer holidays.  Again, I have had some interesting correspondence from some children.  One of the most heartening things about Ireland today is the number of children who write to me on many of their problems.  It is <Col N="754" /> very encouraging that young people are able to express themselves.  I do not think we would have done that in our day.  This is a good trend.  One of the most interesting comments from a letter I received recently was that as things are at present they are at school until the end of June or early July.  They do their leaving certificate or the matriculation examination and they are waiting for results which do not come out until the first week in August.  If the child had to repeat some subjects, which is quite normal, he would have to continue studying.  If the schools closed at the end of May and the children sat for the leaving certificate and had to repeat some subjects, they could have a rest of a month or so before studying for those extra subjects.</P>
    <P>May I say this?  I do not know whether we will be able to achieve this.  As I say, it is difficult to upset our institutions and their ways.  They will tell you 101 different reasons why they should not be upset.  If this thing is basically sound, we will just have to adapt ourselves accordingly in the best interests of our children and in the national interest as well.  We do not want to do anything that will cause upset to anybody or any organisation. We will have discussions.  We will not wake up some Monday morning and find a statement saying that this big change has been made.  We know that there are three, four, five or even ten sides to every story.  Possibly there might need to be a transitional period.</P>
    <P>I know this is rather revolutionary but I think it will come.  I have discussed this matter with Deputies.  I am glad to say that I do not think any week passes that I do not meet Deputies of all Parties.  Education is not a political matter in the sense in which we use the word &ldquo;political&rdquo;: it as far above that.  We are all agreed that as time goes on, our educational policy will have to improve year by year.  We are all united on that, thank God.  Deputies on all sides of the House seem to feel very strongly on this holiday aspect.</P>
    <P>We should organise on this whole <Col N="755" /> question of holidays.  I was talking about the non-utilisation of our schools and I want to say that we are alive to that because we know that during the holidays our children have just nowhere to go.  We should utilise our schools for those children.  I often quote Kevin O'Higgins who said: &ldquo;You, me and the fellow around the corner, that's us.&rdquo;  It is the Irish tax-payers who pay for those schools in the final analysis.  We are pouring millions into schools and here are magnificent buildings which are not fully utilised and some of our children have not any accommodation during the holiday periods.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy knows of the different organisations who will come to him asking him to subscribe to a particular club so that they can provide facilities for those kids.  An opportunity should be given of using this leisure time by attending lectures or something else in those schools.  There is a tremendous exciting potentiality in this regard. Career guidance and things like that could be given and it could be followed up with adult education.  We have not supplied enough community centres or recreational facilities either in built-up areas or in rural areas.  It is all right to be talking about the flight from the land, but with television and everything else, it is the old story of &ldquo;how you goin' to keep them down on the farm now that they've seen Paree.&rdquo;  It is all right saying that there is a living on the land, but night must fall.</P>
    <P>There are parts of Ireland where there are some fine factories but there is all female employment in some of them.  If you have not the boys, the girls will go.  They will go and settle where the men are.  We want an Ireland more than anything else where industry is geared to a high male labour content. Then, take the modern family house. In some of our houses, it is not possible to bring in friends.  The parents like the children to bring their friends back but they like to have a party and this has to be organised for them.  A lot of children would like to buy those modern records but they are too expensive for them.  They all like to be <Col N="756" /> together but there is not any place for them.</P>
    <P>The reason I dwell on this so long is that we all feel so strongly about it.  God knows in relation to some of our modern dance halls the less I say about them with regard to the spiritual and physical health of our people the better it is.  We also know that young persons are not supposed to go into dance halls if they are under 18 but children throughout the world are maturing earlier and and the rule is openly flaunted.  I would not blame the proprietors because you would not know sometimes what age some of those individuals are.  You would not know whether they were dwarfs or old men.</P>
    <P>There is no organised recreation for our children between the ages of 14 and 18.  I do not apologise for spending all this time on this matter on the Education Estimate.  I hope at the end if it this will sink in and I hope it will excite comment, discussion and debate by Deputies in all the rural areas because it can do so much good.  Then you have people hitch-hiking to these dances.  Some of the girls over 21 think their chance has gone and that all the dance halls are filled with young people.  Bearing in mind adult education, I do not confine the utilisation of these school buildings to young people alone.  I would have some rooms for the old people where they could watch television and meet their friends so that there would be a preservation of the community and parish spirit and a coming-together.</P>
    <P>It is like the philosophy of industry in rural Ireland, particularly in the West.  I think I cited on one occasion going down to Cornamona to visit an all Irish-speaking vocational school.  In the evenings, they had adults taking classes: everything was through Irish.  In the daytime, they had may be 30 boys and girls together there in a beautiful school with equipment, and so on.  Then, when they reached 16 years of age, or so, off with them to Chicago, New York, and London.  I remember coming back to Dublin in the car that night.  I do not think any single thing agitated <Col N="757" /> my mind as much as the thought, &ldquo;Could we not get an industry there, a little place built on to that school, where the children from the vocational school, in co-operation with the trade unionists, could become apprenticed and, when they had their apprenticeship served in the factory attached to that school, the family could be preserved and the principle of building-up the family unit in rural Ireland could be developed.&rdquo;  That was the thought that was all the time in my mind that evening.</P>
    <P>It is all right to talk about the Irish language and all these other most commendable things but these are facts, and realistic facts, and I think the answer is there.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows of a city close to parts of which are small holdings. People from those small holdings go into the city on bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and in cars and get employment at Shannon and other areas&mdash; thank God, although it is not enough &mdash;and they come home in the evening to the small holdings.  They are living at home and bringing in a few pounds every week.  If they were not doing that, the holdings would be uneconomic.  They are preserving the unity of the family.  The boys are working and so are the girls and they are bringing money home.  This is the philosophy which hinges on education and leisure.  There are people emigrating from Ireland today, we all know it, throwing up good jobs, because there is nothing to do in the evenings&mdash; nothing to do.</P>
    <P>Some clubs have been started&mdash; what they call &ldquo;clubs&rdquo;&mdash;but they are grossly overcrowded.  I would say to every Deputy, every elected representative and all those wonderful people who do voluntary work that if any of them who are interested in fostering youth activities feel that my Department might be reluctant to sanction the use of halls, they need have no fear in that regard.  If any of them fear that my Department might be reluctant to do so&mdash;and I say this to the school managers, to the vocational education committees, to the owners of schools and I say it to everybody from the highest down&mdash;they need have no <Col N="758" /> fear in that regard.  It would achieve a great deal for our youth, our young people.  I see these halls lying idle for so long.  They could be utilised for concerts, films, indoor amusements, billiards.  They could have a little tea and mineral bar.  There could be a lounge with television. Sports grounds are attached to almost all our schools.  Frequently, there are playing-fields close to such halls.  I am thinking of the desirability of facilities for boxing, physical training and so on.</P>
    <P>There was just one other point.  I did not mention it to anybody.  However, as we are looking into this whole matter, it is no harm to consider it also. Look at our boarding-schools throughout Ireland and consider the long months they are closed.  We have all paid for those, too.  The Irish taxpayer has paid.  I do not deny at any time that great sacrifices were made by religious orders down through the years to provide education for our people.  As a matter of fact, we should not have the educational system we have today were it not for their sacrifices and the sacrifices of others.  I have had my clashes with them.  They were very necessary.  I had some &ldquo;reluctant debutantes.&rdquo;  But, by and large, I cannot speak too highly of the work the religious have done in the country for our education.</P>
    <P>However, on the question of the non-utilisation of schools, I would point out that there are children in Ireland who never have a holiday.  I know there are children who have never seen the sea but there are children in Ireland who have never had a holiday.  Everybody does not have to go to the sea.  His Lordship of Ossory, Dr. Birch, has made considerable strides in a limited way.  With the voluntary committee, he has helped to give some children a little holiday.</P>
    <P>From an educational point of view, an urban bias is a most dangerous thing in Ireland: it would be bad that our youth should think only in terms of life in the city.  We must educate our children, through civics and otherwise, to realise that children from urban areas and children from rural areas are complementary.  Children <Col N="759" /> from rural Ireland come to Dublin to visit the National Museum, the National Gallery, and other places of interest.  The process should work in reverse, too, and city children should be enabled to visit rural areas.  Consider the tremendous impression that would be created in the formative minds of children from Dublin on going to the West and visiting these historic areas and having a holiday in the beautiful boarding-schools which are now closed-up for the long hot summer and some of which have not alone playing fields but swimming pools.  Can Deputies imagine the excitement that would be created in the minds of some of the kids from the cities, and the thrill they would experience, when they found themselves having a holiday in the country in beautiful conditions?  Above all, it would give our Irish urban children an opportunity of seeing what rural Ireland is really like, what makes it tick, its problems.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking to one of the heads of a certain school.  I shall not tell the House where the school is but, if I did, Deputies would appreciate the look on the face of the person to whom I was speaking when I answered his question.  He had asked me: &ldquo;What would it please you most to do with our boarding-schools?&rdquo;  I replied: &ldquo;You have a very big boarding-school which is very highly thought of throughout the country.  If I had my way, I would put itinerant children into it during the long hot summer&mdash; with the consent of their parents.&rdquo; That was the end of that conversation.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the itinerant problem and of the plight of our itinerant children: it agitates our minds.  In a certain area a local committee helped tremendously.  Then one of the Wards died down in Galway. The children had been at school for five weeks.  The children had been the funeral.  The funeral took another two weeks.  The children had been doing very well.  They were remarkable children, capable of picking up points very quickly.  They were taught for another seven weeks but then there <Col N="760" /> was a fair below in Kerry, and off they were again.  That took another three weeks.</P>
    <P>Those are the difficulties.  It is all right for people to speak about this on television.  I would love to see some of those children attend a type of boarding school with the consent of their parents.  You have to have an opportunity of getting to them.  Schools nowadays are not playing the big part they did in the past.  Family environment now counts more than anything else&mdash;television, the home, the parents themselves.  It all goes back to Father Ryan's <i>Social Dynamite</i>&mdash; family environment, bright children going back to appalling conditions in the home.  It is very hard to educate in a caravan, going back there in the night.</P>
    <P>This problem of the education of itinerant children is not one I am trying to avoid.  I acknowledge the efforts being made by the clergy and other members of the public to improve the lot of these children.  My Department will give all the help it can and co-operate in any way possible. I am afraid the progress is slow. There is no single solution to the problem. We just have to continue to examine the position in each area.  It is one case where <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements will just have to be made to suit local circumstances.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the question of free books for post-primary schools. I pointed out in my opening speech that the number of pupils coming within the scheme of free education was greater than we thought.  We thought it would be 75 per cent but in the event 92 per cent have come in. Furthermore, the percentage of pupils who qualified for free books was higher than had been expected.  Therefore, it has been necessary to make additional sums available for the scheme.  This is being done by way of Supplementary Estimate to be moved later, with the permission of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay criticised me and said that as the percentage of children getting free books was so high, why not go the whole way and give them to everyone.  This is not necessary.  The <Col N="761" /> national average is 25 per cent of the children.  Indeed, there will have to be improvements in the administration of the scheme.  I do not think my decisions as to the working of it were entirely sound.  I appreciate the extra burden I have thrown on many of the principal teachers in trying to do the very difficult task of assessing who is entitled.  But this is a growing pain. The basis has been laid and I hope next year the position will improve. When Deputy Lindsay wants free books for all, I would like to remind him that in the Fine Gael scheme he quoted, they forgot about books altogether.</P>
    <P>There is one group of pupils I did not refer to in relation to the scheme of free education, that is, pupils whose homes are situated in areas outside the range of transport.  These pupils are not large in number.  They can only avail of post-primary education in boarding schools because no post-primary schools are available in their area and they are outside the transport range of 15 miles.  I promised special assistance in those cases and I will announce the details of this assistance shortly.  This refers to children in the islands and other isolated areas.  It would be uneconomical to bring schools to them and it is far more sensible economically to help them go to boarding schools.  I believe only about 1,000 children are involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of old, unsuitable substandard schools, I mentioned that in my opening statement. Undoubtedly, it is a problem and I have referred to it previously in no uncertain manner.  But it is a problem that can very easily be exaggerated into enormous proportions.  If we all got it into our heads for a start that in relation to the requirements of modern education small schools are just doomed, we would be a long way towards solving our problems.  That does not mean I have adopted this policy of scrubbing the lot across the board.  Deputies know there are extenuating circumstances in certain cases, transition periods and so forth.  But if we do appreciate that small schools are out, the first result will be that all <Col N="762" /> the interested parties will stop dragging their heels and we can get on immediately towards enlarging what will be in fact central schools and providing them with basic amenities.  Given these conditions, a programme can be mounted which will break the back of this problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dialogue between the INTO and the Managers Association going on in the papers at present, in fairness it must be said that in the final analysis it is the Minister for Education who is responsible to ensure that these insanitary hovels are made good.  This is a big task.  It is all right to say the managers are responsible for this.  I have certain rights when I see a manager is not doing his job.  If this position were to obtain and continue without any likelihood of the 700 or 800 schools being repaired and brought into proper condition within a reasonable period, then I would have to take drastic action myself.  What I am trying to say is that, in the final analysis, the Minister for Education is responsible, and if he does not do certain things, then he is shirking his responsibilities. The success of such a programme which I mention here will depend on the full co-operation of all concerned. I seek in that regard the co-operation of Deputies from all sides of the House, and I would ask them not to lend themselves to agitation to have outmoded one-and two-teacher schools retained.</P>
    <P>When I say that, I am not criticising Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins' very eminently sound speech which she made last night, or the speech of Deputy Donnellan.  People are quite entitled to talk on something in which they genuinely believe.  I have in mind the agitation to retain outmoded one-and two-teacher schools, and in that connection I should like to remind Deputy Treacy who waxed so eloquently on Mullinahone and its associations with Charles Kickham and on other schools in his area, that his own Party expressed itself in full agreement with the policy of securing larger national school units.  I am surprised that he should be running around Tipperary associating himself <Col N="763" /> with a shortsighted agitation to keep some of these small schools open.  I can assure him that in the long run the parents will not thank him at all.  They will learn very quickly&mdash;we have evidence that they have learned where it has happened&mdash;the value and the benefits of the larger school to the educational needs of the child.</P>
    <P>There were Deputies advocating the granting of extern degrees by our universities here and their suggestions merit full consideration.</P>
    <P>I did not refer to it here because I have not much to say about it, but it is a very important issue which we cannot ignore indefinitely, that is, the non-utilisation of our national television service for educational matters. I think I said some time ago that I had evidence of some countries who rushed into utilising their national television service for educational purposes without any examination in depth, and those countries, European countries, were the first to admit that they were wrong and they should have given a lot of consideration to it.  Both from the point of view of our schools and the great potential for god in education that RTE could do, we are examining this very assiduously and in detail, and when we have certain recommendations I shall give the House an opportunity of discussing them.  We had some programmes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had certain programmes beamed on the schools.  For a school to get a programme from television, the first prerequisite is a television set.  That sounds infantile, but there was a large percentage of schools in this country that up to some time ago did not have television sets at all, and there are some still in that position.  Then again if we are going to beam educational programmes to the schools, the curriculum will have to be so organised that if you have, say history, French, Irish, English or <Col N="764" /> science, from 11 to 12 o'clock on television, all the schools throughout Ireland will have to have that on the curriculum from 11 to 12.  That did not happen always.  Then of course, the individual giving a lecture on the film will have to be a first-class person, but when the film is over on the television, the work really only starts.  It is then the elaboration and the enlarging of these things by the teacher takes place.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell and Deputy Mrs. Desmond spoke about a pupil-teacher ratio of 30 pupils per teacher, saying we were aiming at having no more than 35 pupils in any class.  We are, in fact, aiming at a position in which the average number of pupils per class will not exceed 30.  Deputy Gilhawley's suggestion that the teachers be consulted has already been adopted.  Representatives of the teachers have from time to time had discussions with officers of my Department and officers of the Board of Works, and they have been very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay made the point that in my Department educational planning is confined to administrators.  This is a suggestion which has been made not only by Deputy Lindsay but many other people who are interested in education and who write on the topic. This is not true.  My inspectors are not administrators.  They have been recruited from the teaching service and are of high academic qualification.  The same can be said of our psychologists. Every project relating to purely educational matters as distinct from educational administration has been formulated after the fullest consultation with the teaching bodies.  The latest example&mdash;I just give it because it is the latest&mdash;is the recommendation in regard to the structure of the leaving certificate course.  These recommendations were drawn up by a committee consisting of six members of the teaching bodies and three officers of my Department, two of whom were inspectors.  Moreover, the revision of the syllabuses for the intermediate and leaving certificate courses&mdash;and these are at the heart of our post-primary education&mdash;has been carried out by <Col N="765" /> committees composed of the representatives of the teaching bodies and not more than two inspectors of my Department.  I hope that people who base their policy documents on false suppositions will not continue to remain in blinkers and ignore facts, but for the record that is the position.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy T. O'Donnell and Deputy Mrs. Desmond to define exactly the functions of a vocational school, a technical college and a college of technology.  That is a reasonable and valid question.  A vocational school provides continuation education and education suited to pupils proposing to enter into trade apprenticeship.  In recent years the vocational school has expanded its activities and can now undertake the preparation of pupils for intermediate certificate and subsequently to leaving certificate.  A technical college will accept pupils who have completed the intermediate certificate course and who wish to take apprenticeship courses, junior technician courses, to follow secretarial courses or to follow the leaving certificate courses in technical, scientific and commercial subjects with a view to proceeding to higher education.  Some of the technician courses would cover a period of three or four years.  By and large, the technical college offers a concentration of technical courses at junior level and preparation for higher technician and technological courses.</P>
    <P>A college of technology offers technical courses of third-level quality.  The entry standard will be leaving certificate or its equivalent, and this standard will be the take-off point for all courses in the college.  The entry level to the vocational school is completion of primary education, to the technical college completion of intermediate certificate, and to the college of technology completion of leaving certificate course.</P>
    <P>The definitions I have given are theoretical to some extent, because of the sharp division between the technical college and the college of technology. In our circumstances, it would be difficult to insist on such sharp divisions.  Certainly in our regional <Col N="766" /> technical colleges, it is my intention that these colleges will, where circumstances warrant it, provide higher technician and commercial as well as the courses I have indicated as appropriate to a technical college.</P>
    <P>One thing that has disturbed me greatly since I became Minister is the lack of emphasis on agriculture as a subject in our schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;outside the cities.  I am upset to think that the courses in rural Ireland in our vocational schools, and in other schools in rural Ireland, are not sufficient to cater for children who will live on the land for the rest of their lives.  I want to tell the House that we hope that the curricula will be brought into line with modern thinking, and that agriculture in all its facets will be adequately catered for, which it is not at the moment.  In that connection I should like to say that it appears to me from looking into the matter that the school day in our national schools is about the shortest in Europe, which is disturbing. This is a matter which will arise in connection with the proceedings of the salary tribunal which has now started. This is an important matter.  The committee of inspectors are at present engaged in re-allocating the school day and preparing revised curricula preparatory to their submission to the various school bodies for their opinion.</P>
      <P>The fact that our school day in the national schools is one of the shortest in Europe is tied up, too, with possible rethinking on the five-day week for our schools in Ireland, which will come some time.  It is just one of those things.</P>

In it there is a <Col N="767" /> breakdown of the subject matter of different subjects: religious knowledge, mother tongue, writing, foreign language, arithmetic, physical science, natural science, geography, history, civics, singing, drawing, handicraft, physical education, and so forth in the different countries: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. This is such a basically essential matter that possibly the time will come when we will have a discussion in depth on it.  As I say, we are looking at the curricula. On the question of the Irish language, there is this emphasis on grammar which I deplore for our young children, and there will have to be rethinking on that score.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some correspondence in the evening papers and in some of the daily papers about the leaving certificate and the people who do the course at night.  Deputies are aware that the structure of the leaving certificate is under consideration, and one of the matters proposed for consideration is the awarding of the leaving certificate on cumulative results for people who are at work and must study part-time. They cannot be expected to take the full range of subjects at one sitting. They should be allowed to take one or two subjects at a time and so build up to the full leaving certificate over a period of years.  That is common justice. I think that the schools committee will accept it.  After all, there are many people who could not avail of post-primary education due to their financial circumstances and who had to go out and work.  Some of them are clever, and some are indeed brilliant.  This will be an opportunity for them.  When <Col N="768" /> we talk about adult education, let us be consistent.</P>
    <P>There were letters in the papers which agitated and disturbed people taking the courses in the leaving certificate at night throughout the country. There was an outcry of disappointment. I do not want to identify anyone but I had one letter which read:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. O'Malley,</P>
    <P>I wrote to you only the other day about secondary schools, now I find I must write to you at once about this awful situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know this lady at all, but, however, she continues&mdash;</P>
    <P>now I find I must write to you at once about this awful situation.  It was only after reading&mdash;</P>
    <P>a certain paper last night&mdash;</P>
    <P>that I learned about it, it is about the night student and the leaving certificate, what a dreadful state of affairs to say that they do not get a proper Certificate after all they do to achieve this.  I am sure Mr. O'Malley that I know you are a very just man and it is only with this thought that I write to you to plea with you to do something at once to remedy this state of affairs as soon as you can.</P>
    <P>I can only speak with the knowledge seeing my eldest son who is 19 years old doing a job all day from 9.30 to sometimes 7.30 at night and then going three nights on from work to a night school the other nights studying also Sunday all day until about 9 o'clock Sunday night, to get his leaving certificate, he hopes this year please God to get it, last night he was very disappointed to learn that he will not get a proper leaving certificate and to my mind Mr. O'Malley this is dreadful, here you have children that are trying their very best to get on to better themselves and to help to make this a better country and what do they get for their efforts, they could just as well be filling the dancehalls, the bars and what else have you, mind you I am not saying there is anything wrong with these places but <Col N="769" /> surely you can see the injustice in this.</P>
    <P>Please, Mr. O'Malley, do something soon or else these wonderful people shall be completely lost to society, as my son on going to bed last night said after a day of hard work, nine hours work and 2½ hours studying, &ldquo;it is so unfair.&rdquo; So please, Mr. O'Malley, hear their voices and do something for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the topics being discussed by those who are reviewing the whole field of the leaving certificate and the possibility of an advanced leaving certificate. They are looking at the problem of these young people studying at night time, at the possibility of doing the leaving certificate on a basis of cumulative results for people who are not now at school.  I have not yet examined the recommendations on the leaving certificate structure because I have not got the views of all the school bodies, but the recommendation on cumulative results has appealed to them and appeals to me.  When the new certificate is decided on, reasonably <Col N="771" /> soon, I hope to issue to all Deputies a comprehensive statement showing exactly what is envisaged.  When we are talking about adult education this is one of the key problems.  So many people now have what we call post-primary education which was not formerly available to them and they are to be commended for trying to better themselves and we must give them every assistance.</P>
      <P>Following my introductory speech on the Estimate, a number of Deputies referred to the ideal of comprehensive education at post-primary level for all our children.  I feel that the House might be interested if I set out in rather broad terms what we are seeking to achieve in the comprehensive schools, those we have set up in Cootehill, Carraroe and in Shannon. The comprehensive school offers full post-primary education to all pupils of the school area who have completed their primary education. The pupils come from all sections of the community, regardless of socio-economic groups.  They have a wide range of ability and differ considerably in the matter of educational achievement.</P>
      <P>The essence of the comprehensive idea is the development of educational interests and aptitudes of the individual pupil.  On entry to the school a pupil might be backward in educational achievement.  The causes of his backwardness might vary: lack of interest at home, illness during earlier years, a certain weakness of teaching perhaps&mdash;let us face this&mdash;in a primary school or a private primary school.  But that pupil might have a potential far in excess of his achievement. There is no doubt about this. He will realise that potential, given the proper stimulus.  Screening at entry to the school would be disastrous for a pupil of this kind.  In the comprehensive school, individual pupils are assigned to classes at random and there are no screened classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not mean that they are assigned to classes <Col N="772" /> at random but assigned to a sort of entrance class for determination of aptitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean to convey they are not put in with grade A or grade B.  Non-screened classes demand more preparation for the teachers as well as greater versatility.  If screening is avoided, no pupil will be designated second-rate from the beginning of his post-primary career, with its psychological reaction.  The curriculum must be wide and it must offer a choice of subjects in languages, science, social sciences and technical subjects and every pupil must take a common core of subjects: religious knowledge, Irish, English, mathematics, environmental studies and a hand and eye subject. The hand and eye subject could be metalwork, woodwork and art.  This common core takes up about two-thirds of the pupil's time and the remaining one-third of his time is devoted to subjects of the pupil's own choice.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is further scope for a revision and an improvement in the curriculum of particularly our comprehensive schools.  May I say also that while these schools I have cited, the new comprehensive school in Ballymun and the new one in Glenties will be physical entities, the conception of comprehensive schools does not depend on the physical building per se.  The conception can be brought into being by, as in certain areas in the west of Ireland where convents have gone co-educational or sent their pupils to the vocational schools for such and such a subject and in turn, the vocational pupils come to the secondary school to get other subjects, the best utilisation possible of teachers and premises and the bringing together of all our children.  We just cannot overnight build comprehensive schools all over Ireland but I would like to see, once this tendency of comprehensive education is there and as it grows, those comprehensive schools as educational workshops covering the widest field of education where a child in respect of this one-third for subjects of his own choice, if he wanted to do nothing would be trained to do that. There is an art in doing nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, in order to develop the pupil's aptitude and interest, the three-year period leading to the intermediate certificate is regarded as a period of observation and guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidance makes <Col N="774" /> necessary a continous detailed observation of the pupils by the teachers, supported by the Department's psychologist; it demands regular consultation with the parents so that they may know where the pupil is strong and where he is not so strong.  The parents will have the information available to them to enable them to reach the right decision in regard to the pupil's future career, whether he proceeds to the leaving certificate course or takes his place in society. The observation and guidance of pupils from the time of their entry into the school and consultation with parents are essential features for comprehensive education.  I would say then that these are important features of the comprehensive schools.  One of the most important features of the comprehensive schools is that they accept all the pupils of the area, whatever their background or achievement. Pupils from the time of entry are observed and guided towards the development of their aptitudes and interests; there is regular consultation with the parents; and screening on entry is avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the place of art in our schools.  I think it was Deputy Lindsay who said that I betook myself down to see the Ursuline nuns in Waterford and expressed myself fully on art, and that here was an Estimate and I said nothing about it. I did not say anything about it because I have not anything much to report unfortunately, except, to put it mildly, that I am not satisfied, any more than anyone else is, with the progress of art. I am engaged now in examining the primary school curriculum and consultation is proceeding with all the interests concerned.  I hope that a timetable will evolve which will allow reasonable time for drawing and art as well as studies of the local environment. In the post-primary schools, less than half of the pupils study art or drawing.  The figures look reasonable enough but closer examination reveals that only 1,491 students out of 19,000 took the full art course at the intermediate examination in 1965 and only 597 out of 11,600 at the leaving certificate examination. <Col N="775" /> This low participation has a number of causes.  The subject is not recognised for matriculation and on that account is not of high standing with schools and pupils.  This is extraordinary to me.  I had personal experience the other day that not only in matriculation but in the leaving certificate, too, if one is to go on for architecture, art in the leaving certificate is not accepted.  I know possibly the reason is that the standard of the art is not deemed to be sufficiently high by the university people dealing with admission.  Anyway this participation rate is appallingly low. The subject is not recognised for matriculation and therefore the schools and the pupils do not pay much attention to it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the shortage, of course, of fully qualified teachers and this is a problem which we are looking at. There is no point in talking about what we will do about art, without solving the teacher training problem. You cannot have teachers trying to teach our children for examinations which they have not passed themselves, brilliant and capable as they might be. I am looking also at the courses offered in the Colleges of Art in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and I am looking for a complete reappraisal of the work of these colleges, of their function and their purpose, because these colleges must give the lead to the country in general, must provide teachers for our schools.</P>
    <P>What we really want in Ireland is an overall policy on art.  That cannot be dealt with in isolation.  We want to know where we are going from the primary school up to the College of Art.  The report of the Higher Commission on Education in regard to art cannot be ignored.  The schools of architecture in University College and Bolton Street, the College of Art and all down to the primary school are complementary in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is true that the conditions in the College of Art are very primitive. There is a fine studio there.  Exhibitions of outside work take place there. I asked them not to have exhibitions <Col N="776" /> there.  They made representations to me that they should have them there. I do not know whether they should or they should not.  All I know is that there is very valuable studio space taken up for a great deal of time with exhibitions and students are deprived of that space.</P>
    <P>In the corridors there are old plaster cast sculptures and old presses.  The College of Art was part of the stables of Leinster House in the old days.  I was talking to some of the students there the other night.  A new building is essential and we cannot wait for that.  It is standards that we must look to.  In the case of all matters appertaining to education in Ireland&mdash;art, technology, the universities, the primary school&mdash; our ambition should be to make Ireland the one country, not only in Western Europe but in the world that could be cited in years to come as the country having the best approach to the perfect education system.  A perfect system is impossible to attain because it would be a question of interpretation of the word &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; but it should cover the widest possible scope with the highest standards.  In my opinion standards and quality are everything in Irish education.  Mediocrity is an appalling concept.</P>
    <P>I have often said that if in the merger of University College and Trinity College we were under any circumstances to have a lowering of our standards then it would have been better never to have thought of it or to have dropped it from the start.  Degrees of the National University and of Trinity College are regarded in the academic world as of a high standard and anything that would detract from that would be appalling.</P>
    <P>Crudely speaking, we must get from the primary school to the highest education establishment full value for the money expended and must ensure that we use the best possible methods of teaching and employ the best possible teachers, that we keep in touch with modern developments and adapt what is interesting and useful for our circumstances and discard the irrelevant.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that in the realm of technology a country of our size could not afford the millions of <Col N="777" /> pounds necessary for technological research. Therefore we must keep in touch with developments in other countries. There will be changes and there must be flexibility.  If someone were to ask me now what subjects would be taught in the regional technical colleges I would have to say that I could not say absolutely.  I would know that certain basic things would be taught. We do know that by the 1970s there will be a shortage of 70,000 junior technicians. There will be 70,000 jobs going abegging if we do not train children at junior technician level, which is not a very high degree of education.  We are observing developments.  For instance, I send some of my people out to observe the stockyards in Chicago and study techniques from the killing of the beast right up to the production of by-products and the 101 other facets of this industry.  All this information can be made available in our technical colleges. That is one facet of agriculture. We know the developments that are taking place.  We know the emphasis that is laid by Denmark on agricultural education in all its spheres.  We think that even at the lower level children are not being taught effectively how to keep farm costings, whether on a large or small farm.  They require to be taught simple things such as how to repair a tractor.  Perhaps I should not stray but I think small things are really the big things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the essential element in that is the provision of sabbatical leave for teachers who may go and acquire these technological skills in the United States of America and bring them back?  You cannot send all the pupils all over the world. What you want to do is to provide sabbatical leave for the teachers to pick it up and bring it home.</P>

      <P>No.  We must not confuse this with the work of bodies like An Foras Taluntais and the Faculties of Agriculture in our universities. I am talking about what my responsibility is.  My responsibility is to ensure that the best interests of our children are served by the curriculum in the primary, secondary and vocational schools.  For instance, in secondary schools in Ireland agricultural science is on the curriculum but out of 5,800 boys, only 486 took agricultural science in the leaving <Col N="779" /> certificate in 1965.  I have not got the other figures.  There were 486 out of 5,800 pupils who took agricultural vocational schools for the group certificate. Out of 9,600 approximately 2,500 took rural science.</P>

      <P>There are certain aspects which could be disregarded and there are certain aspects which are crying out for inclusion.  We are meeting Muintir na Tíre next week and other bodies to try to evolve a course for pupils who will leave school at 14 years of age and go back to the farms of their parents. There are some such children who, unfortunately, do not continue on.  The best thing I can say is that we are looking at this.  May I say that it might be possible to have a crash course in building or improvements of schools but it is impossible to have a crash course in education?  In educational thinking everything has to be gone into. I have heard the views of people who are experts in the schools and they have made recommendations to me which are sound.  I have also heard views of teachers who specialise in English, Irish and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not easy of solution.  Then, of course, there is the notification of any drastic changes.  All those matters have to be gone into.  For instance, we are always asked why we have Macbeth and why not have it changed. Then you have the teachers who would be mentally disturbed if they had not Macbeth for the rest of their lives.  At <Col N="780" /> least <i>Macbeth</i> lasts for two years, then you have <i>Henry IV</i> and the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> and then you start the cycle again.  You also have the textbooks.  All those things would be worthy of debate here for a couple of days.  This is a great tragedy.  This educational matter is of such great moment that I would have preferred to see greater discussion on it.  I am rather disappointed that we did not have the views of many more people on it.</P>

      <P>We are not going to solve our educational requirements next year or the year after.  I am particularly concerned by the fact that in <Col N="781" /> relation to our textbooks particularly so many of our children can come in and go out of our schools without knowing anything about the history of their country or any history.  Some of the Irish textbooks which I have read are very disappointing.  There is also the appalling price of our Irish textbooks. They are most unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that very often the wrong slant is put on history?  Children are taught that the English are our enemies and all that sort of thing.  It is time to cut that out and let us be a little bit more broadminded.  They are our neighbours and friends and we hope to live happily with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking there is an approach towards maturity but this thing takes time.  In fact, if we could get those educational and historical programmes on our national television, if we could have facilities for showing our national treasures, our National Gallery and the one hundred and one other things, it would be very good.  It is frightening that there is so much which has to be done in education. I would say that my predecessors in all Parties who were Ministers for Education played their part in a noble way too.  They laid the foundations for any development which we are all taking part in at present.  Nobody ought ever be satisfied with our educational achievements.  There will always be so much to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned Great Britain and I endorse thoroughly what he said.  It is only fair to say that on television and radio and all the other programmes there is a lot said about the British educational system but I am sure my friend, Mrs. Shirley Williams, the Minister of State for Education in Britain, will not mind me saying that it is not the best system in the world.  Ours is not the best either. but we have a far better basic system than we possibly appreciate.  It is only when one compares the position in other countries and when one goes to international conferences and examines in depth the educational systems in other countries that one sees we have a lot to be proud of and thankful for. <Col N="782" /> Do not let us be too anxious to copy Great Britain in certain aspects of their educational system.  There are certain matters, such as the 11 plus and other forms of screening and tests which upset certain generations.  Scotland is a different matter.  The Scottish educational system is a very exciting one in my opinion.  However, that is another day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the part which Ireland played in formulating that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to just make a reference to Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins.  She mentioned the Coolarne school.  We cannot go into that fully today but in this Coolarne secondary school there are at the moment 82 pupils spread over three years intermediate certificate and it offers a fairly wide academic curriculum. It does not cater at all for pupils looking for any other type of education. The potential is about 45 to 50 pupils.  Last year, 50 pupils left the national school in this catchment area and only 20 went to the Killarne school.  The remainder chose schools elsewhere.  The majority of the parents did not send their children there.  I think they are looking for a form of education other than academic.  The intake last year, 20 pupils from the catchment area and seven from outside, is just not sufficient to maintain an adequate post-primary school, that is, a school that would cater for the interests of all the children in the area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins and Deputy Seán Dunne put up a case.  I have seen the press cuttings.  I accept responsibility for all of these decisions. I do not lightly make such a decision.  However, I spoke to the school manager: I met him.  He came to the Department and we went into the matter.  I looked through the files. I believe that what we are doing there is the right thing.  Always, in these decisions, there will be local upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech introducing the Estimates, I did not expand on higher education, for the simple reason that the higher education area is one in which a number of Government decimates <Col N="783" /> sions have still to be taken.  Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me to wind up without some attempt to look ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>An inevitable outcome of the Government's decision in relation to the university problem in Dublin will be the dissolution of the National University.  This will create a new situation for the Cork and Galway institutions, a situation which, in my opinion, will give them an opportunity of acquiring a status more in keeping with their dignity than is now the case&mdash;and I use that word in no derogatory way.  Within the past few days I have received the views of the Governing Body of one of these two Colleges on how best that College might fulfil its academic functions and its obligations to the community for the future.  The points they make are fully valid.  For the moment, I cannot say any more than that about them because before any firm decision is arrived at, a great deal of consultation with the Governing Body will naturally be called for.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current negotiations in Dublin, I am satisfied that the parties concerned are, with the fullest goodwill and sincerity, using every endeavour to find a suitable solution, and thus clear the way for a frontal assault on the entire problem of higher education in relation not only to Dublin, but to the country as a whole. The best help we can give the negotiators is, as I have already stated in Seanad Éireann, to add our goodwill and patience to theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That there is necessity for a frontal assault on our higher education problems is evident in the recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education for several co-ordinating authorities in this field.  One such authority which they envisaged was what they called a Permanent Commission for Higher Education.  Such a Commission or Higher Education Authority would be charged with the co-ordination of the financial needs of the universities&mdash;and perhaps of other <Col N="784" /> elements of the higher education spectrum. In such an Authority there might also reside, under the Government, the financing of a number of other higher education institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In substance, they get the lump sum for university education and allocate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Other institutions might be concerned&mdash;the technological colleges or a section of them; the teachers' training colleges; the National College of Art; the Royal Irish Academy, and so on.  I mention the matter merely to show what a lot of consultation and of very serious thinking is ahead.  We are not filing the Report of the Commission on Higher Education and ignoring it.  We are looking into it.  It will be a great debate on the report of the Commission on Higher Education and on the implementation or the rejection of any of the recommendations in whole or in part.</P>
      <P>While the Commission saw a higher education authority as carrying, under the Government, the ultimate responsibility for the co-ordination of the administration of higher education, it envisaged also an academic co-ordinating authority.  These two recommendations of the Commission highlight an organisational defect in our higher education system which up to the present has greatly hampered progress, to put it mildly.  That defect is that hitherto there has been no clear central locus of policy-making.  Every institution tended to go its own way without much regard to the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to these recommendations of the Commission, let me pay it a tribute on what I consider to have been a piece of vision on its part.  Let me repeat what I said in Seanad Éireann, that from the point of view of the national interest, it is as much a <Col N="785" />&ldquo;must&rdquo; as any other section or level of our system and accordingly that investment in higher education, too, is called for&mdash;and on a massive scale. More buildings, more and better equipment, a better staff-student ratio and the lowering of the financial barriers which block access to higher education for many students of high ability&mdash; these are my four targets for the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not lucky that we bought Belfield on which all this can be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All these other facets, then, will be dealt with.  With regard to the growing pains, you cannot say &ldquo;so far and no further&rdquo;. Cognisance must be taken of the existence of Cork and Galway and the building-up of these equally important academic institutions in the State. Examination possibly may have to be taken of students coming from parts of rural Ireland to Dublin and over-taxing the capacity of the existing new University of Dublin.  It might seem illogical for people from Munster or from the west of Ireland to come up here.  Therefore, nothing must ever be done which would in any way downgrade the university colleges of Cork or Galway, or any of our institutions of higher learning, including technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are matters which agitate my mind.  We read a lot about the autonomy of university thinking and freedom of speech and some of these things which have become <i>clichés.</i>  Nobody is stopping anybody in a university from saying anything he or she likes.  This is a figment of the imagination of some individuals.  Nevertheless, the Irish taxpayer, I am sure, and we, his representatives, must worry from time to time about what faculties and what courses are in the national interest. Surely we must be in a position to express ourselves from time to time as to how many graduates Ireland needs in a certain period, what is the tendency, are we lacking the courses and faculties in our universities which Ireland should have in the national interest.  While we appreciate if our graduates wish to go <Col N="786" /> abroad it is a good thing&mdash;and many of them, please God, will come back here and we will benefit from the fruits of their knowledge&mdash;but as time goes on, we must have discussions with the universities themselves.</P>
    <P>Up to now I do not think we have had sufficient liaison or communication in my Department, certainly on such questions as admissions and examinations.  Up to recently there have been discussions on the leaving certificate and these, I am glad to say, have been very helpful.  But there are other fields.  We will have to suggest that the State is entitled to express itself, and indeed must.  I would be failing in my duty were I not to do so, if I did not say: &ldquo;Right; we respect your freedom of action and your autonomy, but for goodness sake, try to conserve the money we give you and use it to the best national interest.&rdquo;  I think that is a fair and reasonable outlook and not in any way dictatorial.  From individuals I have spoken to I believe the universities themselves subscribe to this view and I am sure by exchange of view and discussion as time goes on we will achieve all those things.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank Deputies for the constructive views put forward.  My only regret is that while the discussion of local issues was of benefit to me&mdash;and very interesting because these issues are indicative of the system as a whole&mdash;nevertheless it is a disappointment that on education in 1968 we did not have a true discussion in depth of the subject and all its facets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to afford the Minister an opportunity of providing some depth to the discussion. He has spoken at great length this morning, and most properly so.  But I see from the Estimates on the Order Paper that apart from Vote 27, which covers the Office of the Minister for Education, Primary Education, Secondary Education and Vocational Education are provided for.  There is no specific Vote for the universities.  I believe that Vote falls to the Minister for Finance.  I took it that Vote 27 would cover the general broad question.</P>

      <P>At what stage am I to ask the Minister why he has not thought fit to give us further and better information as to the progress, if any, that has been made in the discussions between University College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin on the road to amalgamation or evolution to the new Dublin University?  I am just as much in the dark now about what is happening in that sphere as I was when I began listening to the Minister for Education or when I finished reading with great care and attention his introductory statement.  There is not a single reference, except of the most passing kind, in his introductory statement to this very important question. In his concluding observations, I think he will agree with me he has dealt with it in a very general way. Has there been any progress made and, if there has, can he tell us what in his opinion the ultimate end is going to be and when is it going to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is, so to speak, academically <i>sub judice</i> and I do not think it would be fair or helpful for me to attempt to go into it in great detail or anticipate what the ultimate picture will be.  I cannot say when agreement will be reached with regard to the representatives of University College and Trinity College.  I cannot say there will be agreement.  We would all hope that there are certain common basic grounds on which agreement will be reached, but today all I can report to the House is that six such meetings have taken place between the representatives appointed by the governing bodies or boards of both colleges.  They are progressing.  I understand that headway, although small, is being made; and I would hate to do anything which might hurry unduly matters of such tremendous importance to both these institutions. In fact, I gave an undertaking to the University Teachers Association, the body representing the teachers in both colleges, that before anything was a <i>fait accompli</i>, and even before my final recommendations went to the Government, <Col N="788" /> I would at that stage appear before them both and say: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, this is the position as I see it and this is what I have in fact decided to recommend to the Government as a result of these discussions which have taken place.&rdquo;  Then of course that will come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and no doubt will be fully debated.</P>
      <P>I think we are all agreed in hoping that the parties concerned will be in agreement.  In reply to Deputy Dillon, it is not just possible for me to give him the information he seeks.  All I can say again is that there seems to be goodwill on both sides, an anxiety to come up with an equitable solution and achieve what is aimed at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is then that the Minister desires in the interest of ultimate success that there should not be in Dáil Éireann for the time being a discussion in depth of university education, lest these delicate negotiations might be prejudiced thereby. I am not prepared to dissent from that view, but I am sorry that the Minister should go on to express his disappointment that such a discussion did not in fact take place here.  We do not want to embarrass the Minister in these very delicate negotiations.  However, the Minister cannot say in one breath: &ldquo;I am disappointed there has not been a discussion in depth,&rdquo; and in the next phrase say &ldquo;I urge you not to undertake it or you will make it very difficult to get a satisfactory issue in our present negotiations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to convey was that I was disappointed that there was not a discussion in depth on education as opposed to schooling or different important local topics, of importance to the Deputies and their constituents, and so on.  What I really want to convey&mdash;and I do not want to be impertinent in any way&mdash; is that it would have been of considerable assistance to me if Deputy Dillon and others had discussed this whole topic of education in depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of University College and Trinity College is a single problem, and while certain decisions in <Col N="789" /> regard to higher education must await its ultimate outcome by way of legislation in this House, nevertheless, higher education at university level was discussed the other day and in the previous session by the Seanad in very great detail.  The nominees of Trinity College and the National University and graduates of the various colleges, all these Senators, discussed this problem from the point of view of Galway, Cork and both universities in Dublin. They did not discuss what they saw as the ultimate outcome, but they were helpful and constructive.  The main thing is that we got an opportunity of talking about the subject.  However, I cannot answer Deputy Dillon as to how I see the picture emerging and how the new University of Dublin will be shaped.  All I can repeat is that I understand that the six meetings which have taken place have proceeded in a satisfactory manner, slowly, but with great deliberation on the different points, tremendously important to both institutions.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £65,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>With this Vote are Supplementary Estimates for Primary Education, Secondary Education and Vocational Education.  The total provision in these Supplementary Estimates is £2,575,510.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sums required in respect of Vote 27&mdash;Office of the Minister for Education, are for Subheads A.1.&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances; D.1.&mdash;Publications in Irish; F.1.&mdash; Purchase of Specimens (National <Col N="790" /> Museum); F.2. Fittings, Materials, etc., (National Museum); H.3.&mdash;Royal Irish Academy.</P>
    <P>In regard to Subhead A the excess of £22,000 is due mainly to expansion in the staff of my Department in consequence of the recent considerable increase in the provision of educational facilities in general.</P>
    <P>The excess in Subhead D.1 is due to certain publication costs accruing and falling due for payment earlier than anticipated, including the very successful Buntús Cainte which is proving to be a best-seller.  There is also provision for a special payment of £9,000 to a firm engaged full-time in the publication of books in Irish.</P>
    <P>In Subhead F.1, a supplementary sum of £14,000 is required for the purchase of specimens for the National Museum.  This includes provision for the purchase of the Killymoon gold collection recently acquired and for the possible purchase of an important collection of Irish antiquities which may be offered for sale shortly in England.</P>
    <P>In F.2, Fittings, Materials etc., an excess of £5,700 is occasioned by expenses in connection with the exhibition of archaeological objects in the National Museum which formed part of the recent Rosc Exhibition.</P>
    <P>The other subhead in this Vote for which a supplementary sum is required is H.3.&mdash;Royal Irish Academy.  An additional £4,500 is needed to meet the increased operating costs of this Institution.</P>
    <P>Savings of £9,000 are available under other subheads of this Vote which reduce the total additional requirements to £65,500.</P>
    <P>In the case of Vote 30, Primary Education, £301,000 is required in Subhead A for the payment of capital grants towards the cost of the erection of a new training college for Protestant student teachers at Rathmines, in place of the existing building at Kildare Place which is no longer suitable for use as a training college and will be vacated this year when the new building is completed.</P>
    <P>The training college authorities are utilising the proceeds of the sale of the <Col N="791" /> Kildare Place premises to meet portion of the cost of the new building.  The balance will be met by the payment of capital grants from this subhead and by a loan raised by the college authorities which will, as in the case of St. Patrick's Training College, be repayable as to principal and interest out of State Grants over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The sum of £105,000 in Subhead C.1 is required to meet increases in grants to managers of capitation national schools and increased rates of social welfare contributions for national teachers.  The increased rates of capitation grants are in line with the salary increases&mdash;tenth round&mdash; awarded as from 1st June, 1966 to teachers in classification national schools in accordance with the general agreement made at the National Teachers Conciliation Council.  At the time these increased capitation rates were awarded the Estimates for 1967-68 had already been prepared and it is necessary to provide £80,000 to meet the additional cost in the current financial year.  A further provision of £25,000 is required to meet the cost of increased rates of social welfare contributions for national teachers which were introduced subsequent to the preparation of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Supplementary Estimate required in Vote 31, Secondary Education, I am glad to be able to report that participation in the free education scheme has exceeded the expectations on which the original estimate was based.  Because of this and of the extension of the scheme, as announced in December last, to include the tuition element of the fee for boarders in diocesan colleges, juniorates and Protestant schools, it is necessary to provide an additional sum of £129,000 in Subhead A.2.</P>
    <P>The greatly increased numbers of pupils in attendance at secondary schools since the introduction of the new scheme brings as a necessary corollary an increase in the number of teachers employed and an estimated additional provision of £85,000 is required in Subhead B for payment of Incremental Salary to these teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> In Subhead J, an additional provision is required for secondary school building grants.  The provision made under this subhead in the original estimate was based on the scheme of grants as it existed at the beginning of the year, which took the form of 70 per cent of the annual repayment of principal and interest on loans obtained by secondary school authorities to meet the approved cost of new school buildings or major extensions to existing buildings.  In view of the difficulty being experienced by school authorities in obtaining loans for building, the scheme was amended in the present financial year to provide that the full amount of the approved cost of building be met in the first instance from State grants of which 70 per cent will be by way of an outright grant and 30 per cent of a loan repayable as to principal and interest by the school authorities over a period of 15 years.  The estimated additional provision required in the subhead for the purpose of this amended scheme is £1,425,000, based on an estimate of the building work which will fall due for payment within the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The original provision made in the estimate for 1967-8 for grants for free school books under Subhead L was based on the estimated number of children who would receive free education and the proportion of these who would require assistance under the free book scheme which was introduced at the beginning of the school year.  As I have already mentioned, the number of pupils participating in the free education scheme has exceeded all expectations. Because of this and the fact that a higher proportion of pupils will require assistance in the matter of free books, grants under the scheme will exceed the original provision by an estimated £50,000.</P>
    <P>The other subhead of this Vote for which a supplementary sum is required is M, Transport Services.  The scheme for the provision of free transport for pupils residing over three miles from the nearest post-primary school was introduced with effect from the beginning of the current financial year.  At the time the original estimate was being prepared it was anticipated that <Col N="793" /> the implementation of the scheme would be spread over three years and a provision of £225,000 in the Subhead was based on anticipated expenditure in the first year.  With the co-operation of CIE it is now possible to implement the scheme in full in the current financial year and a supplementary provision of £615,000 is therefore necessary.</P>
    <P>Savings on other subheads totalling £200,000 are available to reduce the total requirement.  These savings are due in part to the fact that building operations on the two comprehensive schools at Carraroe and Shannon have not yet been fully completed and that the erection of the new school at Glenties did not proceed as quickly as anticipated.  Part of the savings is also due to the fact that a revised scheme for the provision of science and equipment grants for secondary schools has not been in operation throughout the full year.</P>
    <P>With regard to Vote 30, Vocational Education, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to enable savings in the Vote to be used to meet preliminary planning expenses in connection with the provision of the regional technical colleges for which a new Subhead D.3 has been opened.  When the Estimates for the current year were being prepared, the method of financing the provision of the colleges had not been decided and consequently provision had not been made to meet these expenses.</P>
    <P>As sufficient savings are available in Subhead A of the Vote, only a token Supplementary Estimate is being sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise some matters on these Supplementary Estimates. I take it we are discussing them all together?  The Minister spoke of:</P>
      <P>The greatly increased numbers of pupils in attendance at secondary schools since the introduction of the new scheme brings as a necessary corollary an increase in the number of teachers employed and an estimated additional provision of £85,000 is required in Subhead B for payment of incremental salary to these teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Does the Minister advert to the fact that one of the great difficulties is to get teachers with suitable qualifications for our secondary schools?  I understand that there are a large number of teachers with all the suitable qualifications who are teaching in Great Britain and other places abroad, who would gladly come home and teach here if their service acquired in Great Britain would be recognised at home.  I understand that in order to qualify for an incremental salary here, you have to go through the farce of pretending you can conduct your social life with your fellow teachers through the medium of Irish.  That is complete cod, and everyone knows it is cod.  The examination to establish this fact is a grotesque farce; yet it excludes a number of available teachers who otherwise would come back here.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is that when I was attending secondary school, we derived immense benefit if we were learning German, French or Spanish, if we had a competent teacher who was a native speaker of the language.  I understand that the system at present virtually precludes the possibility of the employment of a Frenchman to teach French, a Spaniard to teach Spanish or a German to teach German.  I do not suggest for a moment that we have not competent teachers to teach German, French and Spanish from our own resources, but over and above that, if there is, as I believe there is, a scarcity of competent teachers, it is a pity not to tap every available source.  In the Romance languages and modern languages, there is an advantage in certain circumstances in being taught by a native speaker.</P>
    <P>In regard to science and the natural sciences, it is becoming progressively more and more difficult to get teachers because the competition from industry for the services of science graduates is fierce, and the number available is not equal to the demand.  Does it not seem absurd that when there are teachers willing and, indeed, anxious to return from exile and teach here&mdash;and they are badly needed here&mdash;they should be precluded from contributing to this effort by an idiotic regulation under <Col N="795" /> which they are required to conduct their social life through the medium of Irish when what they are needed for is to teach children the elements of science?</P>

      <P>There is an oral Irish examination for all secondary teachers. That is part of their recognition as secondary teachers.  The other matter the Deputy raised is tied up with the teachers' training.  For example, in regard to service in Britain, they do not get the number of years for incremental purposes which they get in the Six Counties.  I am speaking from memory.</P>

      <P>Or in the developing African countries.  This is a very difficult question and, looking at it with an open mind, there are pros and cons. The attitude of some people is that if we do this, we encourage our young teachers to go abroad.  In certain instances, that is desirable, and in others, it is not.  It is argued that people can go abroad and get very high and attractive salaries in countries like Canada, and if they decide to come back here, why should they be given incremental salaries.  There <Col N="796" /> are cases to be made on both sides.  It is not an easy problem but we are certainly looking at it.</P>
      <P>The other problem which Deputy Dillon raised is not easy of solution either.  Our French results are appalling. It is absolutely essential that so far as possible a person teaching a language to our children should either belong to or have taught in the country of the language in question.  We are acutely aware of this difficulty and I can assure the House that it is under active consideration.</P>

There are many difficulties in the way of producing a standard for compulsory enforcement in regard to an article of this nature and the effectiveness of such a standard is even open to question.

Nevertheless, I am continuing to pursue the possibility of taking some action to protect children from the dangers involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The total sum sought, £965,010 is £171,610 in excess of the previous year's figure due primarily to the provision of an increase of £133,500 in the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and of £25,000 in the grant-in-aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated.</P>
      <P>The year 1966 was a year of record achievement for our fishing industry as a whole.  For the first time ever, our landings of sea-fish and shellfish exceeded £2 million in value and our total exports of fish of all kinds reached a value only just short of £2½ million. The progress made in achieving these results is indicated by the fact that they represent value increases of £? million and £½ million respectively, as compared with the corresponding figures for 1965, which had itself been a record year for value of landings of sea-fish and shell-fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures show only part of the contribution that our fisheries made <Col N="813" /> to the national economy in 1966. Income from angling tourism is estimated to have amounted to £3,737,000 being an increase of £137,000 over the corresponding 1965 figure and bringing to no less than £6,230,000 the total external income attributable to our fisheries in 1966.</P>
    <P>Another indication of the progress made in 1966 is the fact that consumption of fish here at home increased by about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Landings of sea-fish increased from 563,000 cwt. in 1965 to 626,000 cwt. in 1966.  These figures do not include shellfish, landings of which are only partly recorded by weight since some varieties are recorded by number only.  The total value of landings, including shellfish, rose by £333,000&mdash; almost 20 per cent&mdash;to the record figure of £2,033,000.  The expansion was shared by all three main sectors of the sea-fishing industry&mdash;the value of the pelagic catch, herrings mainly, and of the shellfish catch having increased by £149,000 and £148,000, respectively, while the demersal catch, comprising plaice, whiting, cod, haddock, etc., showed an increase of £36,000 in value.  The varieties which contributed most to the total value of landings were herrings, lobsters, plaice, whiting, cod, crawfish and haddock in that order.</P>
    <P>The value of landings in the first eleven months of 1967 increased by £81,000 to £1,885,000 compared with the corresponding period of 1966.  The quantities of demersal and pelagic fish landed in this period increased by 16 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, but the value of shellfish landings fell by 13 per cent, due mainly to reductions in the quantities of crawfish and Dublin Bay prawns landed.</P>
    <P>Determination of Ireland's future position in relation to the European Economic Community must be expected to have repercussions on our fishing industry and our fishery policy. As the EEC has not yet adopted a common fishery policy, we cannot foresee in what respects and to what extent the Community's decisions in that sphere may alter conditions for our fishing industry and entail changes in our fishery policy.  Pending the establishment <Col N="814" /> of the main lines of the Community's fishery policy, it would not be appropriate for me to engage in speculation in the matter.  Meanwhile, my Department is giving careful attention to developments in the EEC countries in relation to fishing.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1967-68 shows a further increase to £575,000 for administration and development work and for capital purposes.  On the capital side, in addition to the normal provision for the payment of grants towards the cost of new boats and new engines, there is also provision for the establishment of ice-making plants at a number of centres in connection with the new fish handling regulations to which I will refer later and also for improvements at the boatyards operated by the Board.  Advances to the Board of £215,000 have also been authorised from the Central Fund mainly to enable the Board to issue loans for the purchase of boats and gear.  During 1966, 36 new fishing boats ranging in size from 26 to 56 feet built at the Board's or other Irish yards were issued on hire purchase terms. The Board also provided grant assistance in relation to the purchase abroad of two stern trawlers of approximately 110 feet in length, two vessels of the 75 foot class also built abroad and eight boats from 26 to 34 feet built at home.  The purchase abroad of three second-hand boats of the 60 foot class was also facilitated by the Board by way of loan.  Demand for boats continues to be buoyant and the growth of confidence in the catching side of the industry has resulted in the acquisition by progressive skippers and private companies of larger and more modern fishing craft.  The development of the technical skills necessary for the efficient working of these vessels has been aided by expert fishery advisers and regular contacts with fishing operations in Northern European countries.  Modernisation of the shell-fish vessels is also receiving attention and there is a growing interest in more effective gear and mechanical hauling equipment.</P>
    <P>The Board's market development programme again recorded satisfactory <Col N="815" /> progress during 1966 with a further increase of five per cent in home consumption of fish and a significant increase in exports.  Considerable progress has also been made in the regional marketing of fish based on distribution direct from the ports to the surrounding hinterland.  Local co-operative societies and provincial fish merchants have, in co-operation with the Board, played their part in this very desirable development.  Local co-operatives have also played a vital role in increasing exports to European markets and a notable innovation in recent times has been the export of fresh fish from Donegal to Great Britain by insulated container traffic.  These direct marketing operations by fishermen's co-operatives ensures that the primary producer gets a greater share of the end price.</P>
    <P>As I indicated when introducing last year's Estimate, we are fully conscious of the need to improve personnel training schemes and to encourage a greater number of our existing fishermen and new entrants to the industry to participate in such schemes.  The Committee of Education to which I then referred has since submitted its report and the primary recommendation, with which I fully agree, is that there should be a permanent school for the training of personnel for the sea-fishing industry. The expansion of our fishing fleet along modern lines cannot be achieved unless we have a regular stream of fully qualified young fishermen capable of manning these vessels and I intend, therefore, to press ahead with the provision of the necessary school facilities as quickly as possible.  Pending completion of the permanent scheme, arrangements are being made to provide extended short courses for new entrants in temporary school premises at Moville, County Donegal.  Having had the benefit of this course the boys will complete their training aboard selected fishing vessels where they will acquire practical fishing experience from our best skippers.  The full training period will extend over 10 months during which the boys will be paid an allowance of £3 per week and will be maintained free of charge.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the results achieved under <Col N="816" /> the existing training schemes are not unsatisfactory and I am glad to see that a new awareness appears to exist among boys leaving both secondary and vocational schools of the attractiveness of fishing as a career.  Since the inception of the scheme up to 31 December, 1967, 127 boys have graduated as trained fishermen and on that date a further 39 boys were undergoing training.  It is of interest to record that, following the recent press advertisement in regard to the revised scheme which is due to come into operation on 1 March, 1968, over 100 applications have been received for admission to training.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for training experienced fishermen as skippers, 13 fishermen attended a course at Galway vocational school in 1967 and all of them subsequently succeeded in obtaining certificates of competency from the Department of Transport and Power.  This is an increase of five on the number which attended the previous year's course and is an indication of the growing realisation on the part of fishermen of the benefits to be derived from such training. Complementary to the full-time course at Galway, local port courses for existing skippers and experienced fishermen have been organised at a number of centres by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in collaboration with vocational education committees. These classes are being very well attended and during 1967, 59 fishermen secured certificates of competency following attendance at the courses.</P>
    <P>I would again like to express my thanks and appreciation to all who have co-operated so whole-heartedly in the operation of the schemes, particularly the Town of Galway Vocational Education Committee and the various county vocational education committees and I look forward to their continued assistance in the more comprehensive schemes in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall my statement last year that I intended to introduce compulsory standards for the handling and distribution of fish to ensure that we market fishery products of the highest quality so that these products may compete more successfully against other primary products in the food <Col N="817" /> markets of the world.  Following consultation with all sectors of industry, I have now made regulations which will come into operation on 1st April, 1968, relating to fresh demersal fish and covering handling from the catching point to the end of the distribution chain.  I am pleased to say that the regulations have generally been well received in the industry and I have asked fishermen, fish merchants and fish processors to operate them on a voluntary basis between now and the operative date so that any difficulties experienced can be resolved in time. When we have a little experience of the operation of the regulations, consideration will be given to their extension with necessary modifications to pelagic varieties and shellfish.</P>
    <P>Since the addition of a second exploratory boat in June of last year, research and exploratory work has been intensified.  It is now possible to devote particular attention to our shellfish resources, the produce of which finds a lucrative market abroad. New grounds are being surveyed and the efficiency of different fishing gear is being tested.  Encouragement of shellfish farming operations has been given and will continue to be afforded to worthwhile ventures.  The recent opening by a private firm of a hatchery for the artificial breeding of shell-fish seed should be of considerable benefit in providing seed to enable existing oyster and other shellfish beds to be restocked and new beds to be cultivated.</P>
    <P>The scheme of joint co-operation with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries of the United States in specific fishery projects of mutual interest is now well under way.  Two Bureau specialists have been in Ireland for some months to establish and co-ordinate some aspects of the programme. Visits to the United States by a number of technical officers of my Department to study that country's methods at first hand are also part of the programme and the first of such visits has recently taken place.</P>
    <P>Development work on the three major fishery harbours at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dunmore East is <Col N="818" /> progressing favourably and a substantial provision is included in this year's Estimate for Public Works and Buildings for the continuation of work at these three centres throughout 1967-68. The Fishery Harbour Centres Bill now before the House will, when enacted, provide the necessary powers for the compulsory acquisition of lands required for the development of harbours at Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Killybegs, Galway and Howth.  It will provide also for the management, control and operation of these harbours.</P>
    <P>Harbour improvement works in the fisheries interest were completed during the past year at Maoil-a-Goilín and Rinn na Ratha, County Kerry; at Liscannor and Seafield (Quilty), County Clare; at Aillebrack, County Galway; at Belderg, County Mayo; and at Gola Island, Stackamore and Gortnasate, County Donegal.  Work on improvement schemes is also in progress at other fish landing places around the coast such as Ballydavid, County Kerry; Bank (Whiddy Island), Garnish (Dursey) and Hare Island, County Cork, and Porturlin and Portacloy, County Mayo.  In addition sizeable schemes have been already approved for the improvement of landing facilities at Skerries, County Dublin; Kilmore Quay, County Wexford; and Reen, County Cork.  The question of improving fish landing facilities at various other places is also being actively considered in my Department at present but I cannot at this stage indicate what the outcome may be.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year a survey team&mdash; comprising representatives of Roinn na Gaeltachta, the Office of Public Works, the county council and my Department &mdash;which was set up by my predecessor to examine and report on the need for improved landing facilities to meet present and expected needs of the fishing industry in South Kerry, completed its assignment and I am considering the team's report at present.  I have set up a similar team to make an appraisal of landing facilities on the coasts of Galway and Mayo&mdash;including the islands off those coasts.  In these surveys full regard is to be given to the present trend towards larger fishing <Col N="819" /> boats and their need for adequate flotation and berthage.</P>
    <P>The Galway-Mayo coastal survey was commenced in April last and the team has its work well advanced.  When this is completed, a similar survey will be conducted in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks on the sea fisheries side, I would like to refer briefly to the reluctance on the part of some of our fishermen to accept the arrangements which have been made to allow for reciprocity as between Twenty-six County and Six-County boats in regard to fishing in Irish waters.  These arrangements do not militate in any way against the development of our fishing industry and I would appeal once more to fishermen's organisations to use their full influence in restoring harmonious relations which are so necessary, particularly in regard to our herring fishery, in attracting foreign buyers to the port auctions and thereby helping our fishermen in obtaining the keenest prices for their landings.</P>
    <P>The overall catches for salmon in 1966 were good although not equal to the high catches of the last few years. The value, however, was well maintained. The total weight of the catch for the year by all fishing methods was 2,326,000 lb. valued at £684,825 as compared with 2,870,000 lb. in 1965 valued at £712,495 and 3,013,000 lb. in 1964 valued at £789,318.  To these figures may be added those for sea-trout which are of minor importance only.</P>
    <P>The quantity of salmon exported was 17,435 cwts. as against 19,764 cwts. in 1965.  These were valued at £813,612 as compared with £759,400 for 1965. Officers of my Department continued to keep a check on the standards of Irish salmon as exported.</P>
    <P>Conditions for angling varied according to district, time of year and incidence of salmon disease.  On the whole they were reasonably good and the number of salmon rod licences issued at 12,053 compared very favourably with the record figure of 12,805 issued in 1965 and exceeds the previous best figure of 11,628 for 1964.  The weight of salmon taken by rod and line <Col N="820" /> was 301,575 lb. as compared with 416,290 lb. in 1965.</P>
    <P>In speaking on last year's Estimate, I mentioned the Greenland salmon fishery and the programme of work initiated under the aegis of the International Commission for the North Atlantic Fisheries and in co-operation with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea of which an officer of my Department was elected President in 1966.  The programme aims at getting scientific data on which to frame proposals to preserve a proper balance in catches and escapements in so far as the Greenlandic salmon fisheries are concerned.</P>
    <P>According to figures produced by the Council catches for salmon in these fisheries in 1966 were approximately 1,300 metric tons as compared with 740 in 1965.  The 1965 figure was probably depressed owing to the good price obtaining for cod with a consequential drop in salmon prices and does not necessarily indicate that salmon were less abundant off the Greenland coast in 1965.  Scientists from Denmark, England, Scotland and Canada were engaged during the 1966 fishing season in Greenland in tagging operations with a view to finding out whether the salmon found off Greenland return to their native rivers.  Quick results from this work are not expected. A joint working group set up by ICNAF and ICES was not as yet able to come to definite conclusions on the main issues but their recommendations to Member countries should help to throw more light on the problem.  One hopeful indication so far, however, is that the Greenland netting does not seem to affect our stocks of grilse but only the larger salmon which stay for some years in the sea.</P>
    <P>It is well again to refer to the good work which the boards of conservators have done and are doing to protect and develop the fisheries in their areas. The large number of successful prosecutions for illegal fishing bears witness to the diligence with which the protection staffs of the boards carry out their duties.  Apart from illegal fishing the conservators deal with other dangers to fish life such as pollution by sewage, industrial and other concerns; <Col N="821" /> they also encourage the destruction of natural predators by offering grants for any killed off.  On the development side as distinct from protection, the conservators promote suitable works sometimes in collaboration with angling associations by arranging for the removal of obstructions to fish movement in rivers and clearing of spawning beds for better propagation.  For river improvement works of the kind indicated generous grants are available to cover most of the cost.  In any case in which technical advice is sought the engineers of my Department give every assistance in the design and execution of such works.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators are finding that the income which they receive from the sale of licences and from fishery rates is not adequate to meet their expenditure which keeps rising from year to year, largely to meet salary and wage demands and consequently they have to rely on administration grants paid from the Fund to keep solvent.  The exchequer grant to the Fund has been increased to £38,000. This sum includes provision to meet part of the cost of the reorganisation, which is contemplated, of the staffs of the boards.  Also included in the Subhead is a contingent provision for outlay in regard to possible arrangements for operation of a large-scale salmon hatchery to offset the effects of fish disease.  The Estimate as originally framed, envisaged my Department's being responsible for the cost of leasing and operation; these plans were changed subsequently and the present intention is that the hatchery in question will be operated at the expense of the owner of a large fishery in the district.</P>
    <P>Payments are made from the fund in respect of river improvement works such as referred to earlier.  Work on a major scheme at the Clifden Falls on the Owenglin River is completed; this is a fish pass which will ease the passage of salmon and sea trout over the falls in the Owenglin River in their journey to the spawning grounds in the upper reaches.</P>
    <P>Investigations are being continued at the experimental station at Glenties into the application of electricity to fishery management and exploitation. <Col N="822" /> These investigations include the development of electric fish counters, electrical fishing apparatus and the exploration of the effects of various kinds of electrical stimuli on different types of fish.</P>
    <P>The research into ulcerative dermal necrosis or salmon disease continues to be done mainly at the Veterinary Research Laboratory of my Department at Abbotstown, County Dublin. Some measure of success has been achieved from the experiments carried out to date.  It has been possible by means of a siphoning technique and also by the use of material passed through bacterial filters to transmit the disease to healthy salmon.  It also has been proved fairly conclusively that young salmon and sea-trout and rainbow trout do not contract the disease, that rainbow trout are not susceptible to it at any stage and that viable ova can be obtained even when the parent fish is diseased.  However, to date it has not been possible to isolate and identify the causative organism and further experimentation is being done in an effort to achieve this.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the investigation concerned the effects of the disease on the cell structures of the fish's body at different stages, and for this collections of tissue are being made from healthy and diseased salmon.  The Salmon Research Trust of Ireland, Inc., through one of its sponsors, Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son and Co. Ltd., has helped with the expense of the research by meeting the cost of apparatus and the secondment of a bacteriological technician to the Abbotstown laboratory.</P>
    <P>With financial aid from the ESB a mobile laboratory is being provided for on-the-site investigations into the disease and a junior Fellow, appointed by my Department, is continuing research into the fungi at the Botany Department of University College, Dublin.  A number of fungi, including that known to affect damaged freshwater fish, have already been identified. Research work on the serum proteins of healthy and diseased fish is also being prepared at University College, Cork.</P>
    <P>Veterinarians of the Six-Counties <Col N="823" /> Ministry of Agriculture are also working in close collaboration with the Abbotstown laboratory and liaison is maintained between the research workers of both staffs as well as with those in Britain and other countries. Meetings of the scientific and co-ordinating committees set up to co-ordinate research and information on the disease continue to be held. In addition, monthly press releases are issued in season which give the latest information on the incidence of the disease in affected river systems.</P>
    <P>The corps of fish inspection officers appointed last year have ensured that all salmon and sea trout exported from this country are free from disease and, in this connection, I may mention that the utmost co-operation is given by the exporters.</P>
    <P>My Department also arranged to supplement home produced stocks by the importation early this year of salmon ova of which a total of 905,000 was planted in rivers which had been affected by disease.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust in this Estimate stands at £120,000 which represents a 26 per cent increase over that for 1966-67.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity of appealing for increased membership for the Trust.  Estimated income from angling tourism has continued to show an increase and in 1966 despite the difficulties created by the shipping strike, it reached £3,737,000.  The potential for further growth is enormous when one considers the large number of anglers and the restricted angling facilities in Britain and in a number of continental countries.  The western areas, about which we are all rightly concerned, stand to benefit <Col N="824" /> most from the activities of the Trust. More than 50 per cent of the Trust's expenditure is devoted to development in the west and this expenditure has high employment content.  In addition, the spending by tourist anglers generates a welcome degree of economic activity in the western counties.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the members and to the local bodies and associations who have co-operated with the Trust and subscribed to its funds and I should like to exhort many more to follow this good example.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I am sure that Deputies will agree that the fishing industry is showing signs of progress and accordingly I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say it makes it extremely difficult.  As the Minister has said, there is obvious evidence that progress is being made in the fishing industry.  For some years past, there has been progress in the development and expansion of the industry.  I think it is only fair to realise that this progress has been maintained during the past year and to some extent perhaps accelerated.  This, I think, justifies our attitude over the years to the Government's treatment of the fishing industry.  We held very strongly that there was no confidence in the industry.  We held that it was felt that investment in it was not justified.  We always considered that there was a considerable potential in the industry for increasing the consumption of fish at home, for increasing the export of fish and for increasing the employment of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one obvious omission in the Minister's statement.  He made no reference whatever to employment.  At a time when we have nearly 68,000 people unemployed in the country, that is most surprising and disappointing. We have no figures for the number <Col N="825" /> of people employed in the industry. We have no estimate of the number of people likely to be employed in the industry if and when we develop it to its full potential.  We have not got an estimate of what the Minister believes to be the number of boats of the various sizes likely to be accommodated and the amount of fish it is expected may be landed by these boats.  I know that that is not an easy estimate to make but certainly the employment figures would be very interesting.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago, it was estimated that approximately 8,000 people were employed in the industry&mdash; 2,000 employed full-time, 4,000 employed part-time and then a couple of thousand people employed in processing. Because of the progress which has been made and because of the expansion in the processing industry, I am sure that the number of people now employed must be considerably greater than it was two years ago.  We have no figures on the matter.  I trust that, when he is replying to the debate, the Minister will give us the information we ask for.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it is obvious that the industry is progressing: it is, but again, I feel that the investment we are making in the industry is not sufficient. The increase has been represented as a fairly substantial increase. I think it is not a substantial increase. When one has regard to increased costs, increased salaries and increased overheads, very little is left for development.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the figure for the Inland Fisheries Trust. I think the previous year it received £109,000.  In the year we are discussing, it received £120,000.  That is sufficient to meet only the increased expenditure of the Inland Fisheries Trust in wages and salaries and all the other overheads.  It does not leave them anything extra, over and above, to expand the extremely useful and essential research work in relation to the development of inland fisheries of this country. Everybody agrees that there is enormous potential here.  Everybody agrees that the Inland Fisheries Trust have done wonderful work during the years they have been in existence. <Col N="826" /> Everybody agrees that they have done an immense amount of work on a shoestring. Even last year when the overall number of tourists dropped&mdash;it was blamed on the shipping strike, bad weather and other things&mdash;the important fact remained that the number of angling tourists increased considerably. This is an indication of the potential in this industry for the expansion of tourism.</P>
    <P>Looking up the recent Bord Fáilte publication, I see that the total number of angling tourists was 106,000 approximately. There were 54,500 for game fishing, 28,900 for coarse fishing and 23,000 for sea-fishing.  In each of these three branches, there is scope for enormous expansion.  Many of the people who come here for a fishing holiday are not very particular about the type of fish, as long as they have fish.  Any sort of coarse fish will attract a large number of English visitors because in England at present they have no facilities for this type of fishing. The main attraction is brown trout, which attract the largest number of visitors.  But, as I said, these three branches provide enormous scope for the improvement of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the publication of the Inland Fisheries Trust and I am extremely impressed by the amount of work they have on hands and what they have accomplished during the years they have been in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something I should like to recommend to many more people.  There are many people <Col N="827" /> who are fishing continuously, enjoying everything that goes with it, and still refusing to become members.  In many cases it is carelessness more than anything else.  They often succeed in increasing the membership but it slips back again because people forget to renew their membership.  Nothing can be done about it except to continue to appeal to people to take the interest they should be taking.  It requires only a small sum to become a member but the accumulated sum means a lot to the Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed this Estimate previously, we were told there were 31 new boats and four secondhand boats at sea.  We seem to be maintaining this rate of expansion in putting new boats on the sea.  This year there are 36 new boats and two stern trawlers. This should increase our catering power considerably.  This is recognised by all as the main requirement of the fishing industry.  We cannot succeed until we have the boats on the sea manned by skilled fishermen.  I am glad to note from the Minister that everything possible is being done to attract young men to the fishing industry. It should be pointed out that much of the hazard associated with fishing has been gradually removed.  We have more modern and safer boats.  We have better gear.  The life is less hazardous and should be more acceptable.  That is not to say it is in any way a soft or easy life.  There are many people who just do not want an easy life.  They are prepared to put up with the tough standards expected in the fishing industry, providing the reward is good.  The recent tragedies across the water remind us that the hazards have not been removed, but I hope these were due to exceptional weather conditions. The forecasting service here is recognised as an excellent one of great benefit to the fishermen.  I may have mentioned when speaking on the Harbour Development Bill that I had the pleasure of going for a day's fishing on a trawler from Dingle.  They appreciated how reliable the weather forecasting is and what a service it is for them.  They very much appreciated the equipment now available for <Col N="828" /> the location of fish and for warning them of serious hazards such as rocks.</P>
    <P>One of the things that impressed me on that ship was that these people had a long, hard day, during which they had to endure the hazards of sea and weather, but there was no great fortune for them at the end of it.  The income was reasonable, provided they could go out every day and earn it. From my experience of that day's fishing, which I was assured was an average day's fishing, unless they are able to get out continuously, there is no great fortune in it.  It may be that Dingle is not the best location for getting a high income from a fishing-boat. They felt they just had sufficient to carry on and to induce them to stay in the business, but nothing more. They complained bitterly of the fact that no cold-storage facilities were available to them.  I know this is something that was recommended as far back as 1962 when these defects were pointed out.  It means they have to get rid of the fish, even if the market is poor.  If conditions for getting the fish away are not good, they still must make the effort and get rid of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the quality standards coming into operation on 1st April.  Some time ago one of the biggest fish exporting firms in the country objected strongly to public statements made in relation to the observance of quality standards. They said these statements might imply that they, as an exporting firm, were not already observing the highest possible standards.  They felt it might affect them in the export of their fishery products, mainly to Australia. I was very impressed by the standards of cleanliness I saw during my trawler trip: everything was spotless.  The boat itself was completely washed before the fish were hauled in.  When the gutting of the fish took place and the fish were boxed, they were washed in the boxes and the deck was again washed. The grading was good and the boxing was good.  I do not think anybody could complain of the way in which the fish were handled on that boat, and I would say that if the standards everywhere else compared with what I saw there, people certainly would have <Col N="829" /> nothing to complain of.  The one defect I saw there was the lack of icing and cold storage facilities.  If they have not yet got these facilities, that should be one of the first things we should see to in the various ports throughout the country.  In warm weather, particularly in relation to exports, it is impossible to keep fish anyway right unless these facilities are available.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister made no mention whatever of the setting up of the fish meal factory on the east coast.  This is something that has been talked about for some two or three years.  About two years ago, this matter was taken up in a very business-like way by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The necessary research was done, and all the evidence indicated that there was an ample supply of suitable fish on the east coast to maintain a factory and make it viable.  All the evidence was lying there for a year or so before it was possible to get somebody to decide to undertake this venture.  Personally I thought this information, this convincing information that we had the raw material, was lying there so long that I thought the State itself should nearly have stepped in and done something about it.  But six months ago or so, we had an announcement about a factory being started up in Mornington.</P>
    <P>I am informed that no start has been made in that factory in Mornington. I do not know whether or not that is right and perhaps the Minister would comment on it when replying.  There were objections raised by some of the residents who are more interested in developing Mornington as a tourist area rather than as an industrial area of this kind, an industrial area that might perhaps produce some objectionable smell that might be objected to by visitors. It used not to be possible to have a fishmeal factory without having that sort of nuisance arising from it, but if it is not possible to set up at Mornington, I am told there are other sites available where people would be glad to get the factory.  If the factory is not to be built in Mornington, if the objections are sufficiently serious as to deter the people there from embarking on it, every encouragement should be given <Col N="830" /> to this firm to set up somewhere else on the east coast.</P>
    <P>Questions from time to time during the year revealed that we are still importing threequarters of a million pounds worth of fishmeal.  In view of the fact that the cost of this fishmeal has increased still further as a result of devaluation, it makes it all the more urgent that we should pursue with all possible speed the production of our own fishmeal.  We have the potential here and the raw material, and I think it is right to say that we also have a sufficient number of people prepared to engage in this type of fishing as a worthwhile effort.</P>
    <P>There were four or five boats in this business 12 months ago, and at that time the fish was going to Killybegs, the transport being subsidised.  They found this operation sufficiently worthwhile to induce them to promise to engage about 50 boats in this type of fishing on the east coast.  I do not know whether all this has since been organised and whether the Minister knows that the necessary number of people are there to engage in it.  Perhaps all these arrangements are made, but I found it surprising that as important an ancillary industry to fishing as this industry is was not referred to by the Minister, first, because of the possibility of reducing imports of fishmeal; and secondly, because of the employment it would give and the effect it would have on the industry in general.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the complaints I got when I was down on the Corrib, and I am sure Deputy Molloy knows something about the situation there. The Minister did not say whether or not any grant was given to the fishing organisations on the Corrib.  They were looking for something in the region of £16,000 to develop their hatchery there and to provide a couple of rearing ponds.  They felt that if they got it in stages, it would ease them out of the difficulties they were in, if they got even £4,000 the first year to enable them to improve the hatcheries and to put up one pond and complete the job at a later stage when more money was available.  The Minister does not <Col N="831" /> say if this money has since been provided or if these difficulties have been overcome.  The estimate given to me at the time was that they required something like 300,000 fingerlings per year to restock the lake; this is quite an amount of fingerlings and I hope it has been possible to meet the requirements.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 240 uneconomic holders in this area, small farmers with boats which they hire out to visitors in order to supplement their income.  This is of considerable importance to them and they complained, rightly or wrongly, at the time that sufficient interest was not being taken in keeping down predators and one thing or another in the lake.  They felt that much more could be done, because it was a developing tourist area and there were a number of hotels there with accommodation for quite a number of tourists.</P>
    <P>Salmon fishing seems to be the only activity that did not show an increase in income.  Salmon fishing was disappointing mainly because of the salmon disease, and it is regrettable that no great progress appears to have been made in determining the cause of the disease or in deciding whether or not anything can be done to overcome it in future.  However, I think it is right to say that the incidence of the disease in the rivers is very much less and giving very much less trouble than it was this time last year and earlier.</P>
    <P>The number of boys being brought into training is one of the most encouraging figures the Minister has given.  Heretofore the number coming forward each year was in the region of 40 people, or perhaps fewer.  The Minister says that as a result of the recent advertisements, 100 young people are coming forward for training. I do not know what new methods have been adopted to induce people to come in.  Is it because interest in fishing generally has been aroused due to all the talk there is about fishing, and due to the propaganda in relation to the improved boats, gear and comforts, and perhaps a better income? Everything possible should be done to <Col N="832" /> make the life more attractive, because it is certainly a hazardous life and may be regarded by many people as an uncomfortable way of living.  Anything that can be done to reduce the risks and improve the prospects of the people engaged in this industry is extremely important.  That is the only way people will be induced to play their part.  The potential is quite considerable. We have only scratched the surface as yet.</P>
    <P>During the year we got a loan from France of £5 million, I think, which looked at the time to have fairly favourable terms.  I presume the terms of that borrowing were also affected by devaluation, and that they are not now as attractive as they originally were. Devaluation itself can be a considerable help to this industry because, so far as I know, approximately 50 per cent of our exports go to EEC countries.  We should have a considerable advantage in those countries.  In fact, we should also have an advantage in the British market because they have to import fish from EEC countries and consequently the price on the British market would also be enhanced.  If devaluation hit us in relation to the loan, we should be able to recoup that due to the increased price we should get in countries that have not devalued.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say anything about fishery protection.  I have seen in a number of reports during the year that our naval service, our corvettes, are totally inadequate to do the job. Most people think they have run through most of their useful lives and are practically useless at present, that helicopters should be used and that our corvettes should be replaced by smaller and faster vessels.</P>

      <P>It may be that a helicopter is too expensive for this purpose. I do not know.  I do not know what it would cost to give adequate protection to our fishing waters through a helicopter service warning the naval vessels, <Col N="833" /> but it is something which should be considered very seriously.  There is no point in our getting possession of increased fishing limits and not being able to protect and preserve them for ourselves.  I am not qualified to say what is the best form of protection, but if it is possible and worthwhile in other countries we should look at it in that light and see what can be done here.</P>
      <P>Recently I saw that the export figure for fishery products from Denmark was £45 million.  That is an amazing figure.  That is why I say I should like to hear from the Minister what our eventual estimated prospects are when the industry is developed and expanded to the extent we would all like to have it developed.</P>
      <P>I saw some criticism of the fact&mdash; it may be right or it may be wrong&mdash; that the first two boats we bought in France had central heating but that the central heating was defective, and that the second two boats have no central heating at all.  We are starting late in this business and we have the opportunity to buy nothing but the best, the safest, the most comfortable and the most up-to-date gear for loading and unloading.  Apparently it is very important to have watertight bulkheads.  In this way you can have a pump for loading and unloading and that is a very fast way to load and unload.  I said before that for at least two years I complained that on the whole of the east coast there was not one unloader.  The fishermen were looking for such an unloader which would cost in the region of £2,000.  Still there is no unloader there which indicates that the investment in the fishing industry is quite inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time ago we had a discussion on the taking over by the State of the major fishery harbours, and provision being made for their development and expansion.  I said at the time that in the state of the fishing industry I thought that was perhaps a good and a desirable move, but that is something I should not like to see the State remaining in when they have taken the necessary powers to acquire compulsorily whatever area they require adjoining the harbours for development purposes.  When the job is working <Col N="834" /> well an effort should be made to hand it over to a well organised co-operative society.</P>
    <P>One of the strong recommendations in the 1962 American report was that co-operation should be developed to the fullest possible extent.  They indicated what this could do for fishermen in increased prices, the location of better markets and the supply position generally.  At present co-operation is not being encouraged.  There is not much point in having the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society unless they are brought into every form of co-operation. They are well able to do this kind of thing.  They are well able to organise fishermen and bring them together into a type of co-operative movement which would be so advisable for the industry.</P>
    <P>The position as I know it is that they are not able to pay the people they require to do this work.  A report was secured from the IAOS some considerable time ago.  Recommendations were made but the report is just lying there and nothing is being done.  You will never get fishermen to work together on a co-operative basis, as they should, unless you have some sort of outside body dealing with the business end of it and keeping them continuously encouraged along those lines.  It would take a while to do that, but we could not start too soon.</P>
    <P>I find it confusing dealing with figures which are two years old.  My information is that in spite of the fact that we increased the catching power quite considerably and landings were up, exports were not up in 1967.  I do not know whether that is true.  The figure we are given is for 1966 but exports for 1967 were not up very substantially.  In fact, they were only slightly up.  It is hard to understand this.  It may be that human consumption of fish has increased quite considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Five per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Five per cent in 1966, but it must indicate a further increase in 1967 because, and there is no doubt about this, landings have increased in almost every sector of the industry <Col N="835" /> and the fish must have gone somewhere.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to see a report in some of the fishing papers in relation to a 250 ton catch of herring; the comment made was that this in some measure might be due to the fact that these particular people had a technician from the French Fisheries Research Institute on board.  Is this something tied up with the French boats?  Are we getting some technical assistance to ensure that we will buy more boats? If we are getting such expert technical assistance it is something worthwhile and something that should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>With regard to the development of the major harbours, there is a general feeling that, because there is so much talk about the major harbours, the smaller harbours may be overlooked. Such an evolution would be very serious.  Towards the end of his speech the Minister mentioned that a number of small ports were being developed and better facilities generally being provided.  It would be a great mistake to let the development of the major harbours absorb all the available money to the detriment of the development of the smaller harbours which have so much to contribute to the fishing industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to Skerries as one of the ports for which approval has been given for development.  That development is long overdue.  I trust it will go ahead with all possible speed. I have heard it said that Killybegs is not going ahead from the point of view of development.  Harbour development there is much too slow <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other developments which are taking place and the demands made upon the harbour.  Howth is crying out for development. Apparently there are difficulties there because of rock.  It is an astonishing experience to go out there and watch what the fishermen have to go through.  There is no space for them to pull in and unload and the practice is to unload from one boat to the next in line, and so on.  Very often the boats are four deep.  That constitutes a shocking hardship.  As well as that, those engaged in fishing are spending <Col N="836" /> as much time unloading as they are catching fish.</P>
    <P>The overall picture in the industry generally is encouraging.  Development is taking place in the right direction. Perhaps development is not as fast as it should be.  It may not be possible to get the people to man the boats and harbours and do the necessary processing when fish is landed.  We have had a late start but we should be able to take advantage of the situation now by getting up-to-date, first-class facilities.  Since we have come late into the field we should buy nothing but the best and we should provide nothing but the best.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to appeal once more for more money and more encouragement for the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The increase is quite inadequate. It will not enable the Trust to embark on any new research or development. It will simply be enabled to carry on at the same pace.  That pace could be greatly accelerated if the necessary money were forthcoming to enable the Trust to employ the staff they need to do the vitally essential research and development work required, if our purpose is to attract more tourists and get more income from our inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to express a certain disappointment that this Fisheries Estimate comes to be discussed at such a late hour on Thursday afternoon.  I know these matters cannot always be arranged beforehand because they depend on the length of time preceding business takes.  From the point of view of the fishing industry it is, however, a pity there are so few in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a lengthy debate on the fishing industry at least once a year.  This Estimate provides the only opportunity those of us interested in fishing get in order to make our arguments in support of the industry.  I know there are many Deputies&mdash;I am the only Deputy from the west here at the moment&mdash;who <Col N="837" /> would have liked an opportunity of speaking on this Estimate.  I am greatly inconveniencing myself in speaking at the moment but I shall not speak for very long.</P>
      <P>I have said on earlier occasions that I believe the industry has been underfinanced all down through the years. That statement still stands.  I realise the difficulties involved.  One cannot just pour capital into an industry unless there is some prospect of productive schemes.  The most important development in the fishing industry now is increasing training facilities and bringing our young fishermen up to a standard at which they will be fully competent to handle their boats.  I have every confidence that, if the demand is there, the Government will come in behind such men and ensure that boats are available for them.  As far as the Government are concerned, I know that everything possible will be done to ensure there is no unavoidable delay. But there must be progressive schemes and there must be progressive men making demands.</P>
      <P>I know that many of the boats given out by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were not altogether successful and many of the men who got them fell down on the repayments.  There must be an assurance before boats are given out that those who get them will be competent and will be able to make the repayments as they fall due.  I am happy to say that many skippers&mdash;a good number of them on the west coast have been successful and have repaid the loans well within the stipulated period, thereby qualifying for the special bonus.  That is a good thing. The more training we give the men the greater will be the confidence in the industry and the better the prospect of leaders growing up in the industry.  I know the Government will make the money and facilities available if the men are there.  Progress is being made, even though it may be somewhat slow. I hope the pace will increase in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a major fishery harbour was mentioned a couple of weeks ago and I asked the Minister if he would refute a statement, or a rumour, in Galway that there was a <Col N="838" /> possibility this major harbour development might not take place in Galway at all.  Perhaps it was an oversight but I do not think the Minister referred to it in his reply.  He did not refute the statement and I should be obliged if he would refute it personally here today.  I spoke to the Minister and to officials of his Department, and I am aware they are only too anxious to get this development off the ground. Whatever difficulties there have been in Galway I am confident will be overcome in the near future and we should like to be happy in the knowledge that when the difficulties at local level have been overcome, the Department will come in fully behind us and get work started on this major fishery harbour.</P>
    <P>There are on the coastline various fishery districts, and by a strange coincidence, the three fishery districts on the coast of West Galway have been subjected to a bye-law prohibiting fishing for salmon with drift nets.  That prohibition has been there since 1914. Since then, we have got our own native Government but for some strange reason, no attempt has been made to have the prohibition removed.  I ask the Minister for his wholehearted support for the present attempts being made to have this prohibition taken away and to allow drift net fishing in the three districts off the coast of Galway.  An application to this effect may have been lodged from the Ballinakill district and the two others will lodge theirs in the near future.</P>
    <P>This prohibition is depriving many of the fishermen, small farmer fishermen, of added income by way of salmon fishing.  At the moment they are restricted to draft nets which are a haphazard manner of trying to catch salmon.  Consequently, the number using this method has dwindled during the years because there is not any great remuneration to be got from it. We know from figures published from other salmon fishery districts on the coast that a sizeable amount of money is being circulated to small salmon fishermen from sales of salmon caught with drift nets.  The figure runs from £120,000 to £130,000 annually and the lowest figure has been £70,000.  The <Col N="839" /> figure for draft net fishing, to which our people have been confined since 1914, is only £6,000 or £7,000 per annum. That is the figure officially recorded by the Department.</P>
    <P>We are to make an all-out effort on the Galway coast to have abolished this bye-law, which prohibits our fishermen from using drift nets for the catching of salmon as quickly as we can and we look with confidence to the present Minister for support in this move.  He has intimate knowledge of fishing, particularly of drift net fishing. There are many such fishermen in his constituency and I am aware that he has spent many hours fishing with them.  He knows the ins and outs of what is involved and we look with confidence, therefore, to a sympathetic Minister when he is taking a decision on whether this bye-law should be abolished.</P>
    <P>The allocation to the Inland Fisheries Trust has been increased by 26 per cent.  It is a substantial amount of money, £120,000, which will help to do a lot of good work.  It may not be all the Trust would like to have to help them to do the work they are capable of doing.  Certainly, they will not be able to do all that is needed to be done with that amount.  I suggest to the Inland Fisheries Trust that they must themselves make an all-out effort to get every angler in the country to become a member.  It is for that reason that I interrupted Deputy Clinton.  Only a small percentage of the people directly benefiting from the work of the Trust are members and it is a poor reflection on the fishermen of this country, reputed to be the best sportsmen in the land, that they do not dip their hands in their pockets and come up with the small subscriptions which membership of the Trust entails.  If they did, it would provide a vast sum for the development of inland fishing.  However, for some strange reason, they have been reluctant to give their support to the Trust.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is purely through ignorance that they have withheld support.  One would expect better from fishermen.  I attended the annual <Col N="840" /> meeting of the Trust last year and I had hoped they might appeal to all the angling clubs in the country to suggest, in turn, to their members when they were paying their annual subscriptions to their local clubs to include subscriptions to the Inland Fisheries Trust so that the secretary of each local angling club could then forward the Trust subscriptions to headquarters. In that way the local angling clubs would be helping the Trust to render very good service.  This could be made a rule in each club&mdash;that when local members were paying their 5/- or 10/-each year to the local club, they would add the small subscription demanded for membership of the Trust.</P>
    <P>It is little use crying continuously to the Government to provide money.  It has become obvious that anywhere the Government see effort and enterprise, they will back it with finance; but if the anglers will not support the Inland Fisheries Trust, who have been doing such good work for their benefit, they cannot expect the Government to go head-over-heels giving them assistance. It is a two-way bite.  If the Trust sell themselves to the people who should be supporting them, the Government will not be far behind in bridging the gap.</P>

      <P>Many of the anglers on Lough Corrib realise that the policy the Trust are following is in the interest of trout fishing on the Corrib and they are prepared to support it.  They feel that the line of action by which the Trust plan to help to develop the natural spawning beds&mdash;many of them believe in the hatchery&mdash;is the best line of action to take.  There is support for the Trust in that sphere of their operations. The Minister, in his wisdom, has decided that those Corrib fishermen interested in the hatchery can continue to run that hatchery.  It was always done voluntarily, run by the angling clubs.  The Minister has decided he will continue to issue a licence for the hatchery as long as the anglers want it. There is not any great problem there now.</P>
      <P>I should like to see all our fishing nationalised, all the rivers and lakes of Ireland run for and owned by the people of Ireland.  There are terrible difficulties involved in bringing about that situation.  I should imagine that the managers would be very sympathetic to that point of view, were it not for the great difficulties involved.</P>
      <P>Under our present Constitution we are obliged to compensate for any property acquired by the State.  We cannot walk in and say we are taking over this for fisheries and not compensate the people who have the ownership of it at any particular time.  If one were to compensate all of the owners of lakes and rivers in private hands at the moment it would run into millions and millions and in many cases there would be long legal battles to determine title to many of these fisheries, which would be costly.</P>
      <P>That is not something which we can hope to see in the near future.  I would encourage the Minister to look into this where possible.  This is part of the work the Trust are doing, acquiring private fisheries where they are on the market, so that we hope to make some progress along the road towards eventual nationalisation of all of our fishing waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister in replying to mention the Galway City Vocational Education Committee for <Col N="842" /> the work they are doing in the training of fishermen.  It is also proposed to erect in Galway a research station. We have an active fishing fleet; we have progressive fishermen who are making a good living from fishing and all that we want are good facilities for landing the fish and harbouring the boats.  We hope to see great progress when we get our fishery harbour off the ground.  I look forward to the day when work commences on that job and I do hope that before Estimate time arrives next year Galway will have made its mark as the major fishing port in the whole of Ireland.</P>

We are pleased with the facilities Roinn na Gaeltachta have given to our fishermen.  Work on a major harbour improvements scheme has just been commenced at Kilronan Harbour in the Aran Islands.  This will cost £92,000 and fishing is the mainstay of the people of the Aran Islands.  It was a very progressive step on the part of the Government to develop this narrow strip of fishing for them.  I expect that when we come to this Estimate next year the fishing industry, both sea fishing and inland fishing, will again have taken another major jump forward on the road to progress and prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always agreed with the sentiments of Deputy Molloy in that I should always like to see all the fisheries vested in the people. Deputy Molloy says that it would involve immense capital expenditure. There is one aspect the Minister should look into.  There are in various parts of the country whole proprietories of fishing which have been substantially abandoned by the owners.  I think the Marquess of Conyngham had private fisheries in County Donegal which he has substantially abandoned and which are now public fisheries.  I think where a proprietor of game fishing rights abandons those rights, then the water <Col N="843" /> becomes public.  We could with propriety vest such abandoned fisheries in the Inland Fisheries Trust in order to maintain protection of them and suitable development.  This is a matter into which the Minister might well look.</P>
      <P>I remember when I was Minister for Fisheries, I asked the technical staff of the Department to investigate the possibility of establishing new oyster beds.  That is 12 years ago.  A start was made with that project in Killary Harbour. I was very much struck by the marked success that attended the Dutch in their establishment of oyster beds, not only in Holland but on the Cornish coast.  It is much more difficult to establish oyster beds than people realise but since the time when I was urging the technical staff to interest themselves in the operation of oyster beds when oysters were selling at about 2/6 per dozen at the point of landing the same oysters today are making about 7/6 per dozen.</P>
      <P>Any investigation we made 12 years ago in establishing oyster beds would have paid for itself ten times over since. I should imagine that the demand for oysters is rising both here, in Great Britain and on the Continent and the supply tends to dwindle.  I know the technical difficulties are considerable but I would be glad to know from the Minister for Fisheries when he is concluding what happened to our efforts in Killary Bay and if any subsequent efforts have been made to establish new oyster beds in suitable locations on the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister in the problem he has on his hands with the salmon disease.  I asked him on one occasion before had the possibility been examined as to whether lampreys which frequent the estuaries of the rivers were or were not vectors of the virus responsible for the disease.  So far as I have been able to hear there is one phenomenon common to this disease; you do not find it in fish caught in the sea.  Once they pass the estuary they turn up with the disease in the river.  So far as I know there is only one factor common to the estuaries of nearly all our salmon rivers and that is the presence of lampreys. <Col N="844" /> Why do we not interest ourselves to know that lampreys attach themselves to fish and remain attached until they satisfy themselves from sucking the blood of the fish proceeding up river?  It has recently transpired in the course of research that whatever the cause of or factor in fish disease, it is possible for fish to communicate it to other fish in the same fresh water.  Where you have a situation that no fish enter the estuary from the sea with the disease and pass from the estuary to the fresh water, the disease turns up and appears to spread. It is an interesting thought that one might reasonably look into the estuary as the source of the disease and to inquire if common inhabitants of all estuaries might not be the vectors of a hitherto unrecognised virus.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have studied the Minister's statement carefully will have noticed that he spoke of the filters at present being used in research at Abbotstown failing to isolate any bacteria which could be held responsible for this disease.  I should be glad to know from the Minister&mdash;I do not know if he has had an opportunity to inquire about this&mdash;if Abbotstown is equipped with filters sufficiently fine to isolate viruses, because if they are not, they might just as well not be pursuing research at Abbotstown into this disease, which seems almost certainly attributable to some kind of virus rather than to a bacillus.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to know from the Minister what is the future of the available supply of lobster and crayfish off our shores.  There was raging in the Department and outside it when I was there, a continual debate as to what measures were necessary to conserve the supplies of lobster available. Many took the view strongly that the taking of what are called berried lobsters was very inimical to the expansion of the lobster population. Most technical authorities took the diametrically opposite view and said that it did not really matter, but that what was vital was to prevent people taking small lobsters.  We took the view that the proper thing was to enforce a law against the purchase or sale of small lobsters.  I know we all <Col N="845" /> shared the appreciation that as the demand in France for lobsters and crayfish rose, and the demand also in Britain, that our lobster grounds would be overfished and might actually be destroyed.  I should be glad to know from the Minister what is the present position in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to mention something that to most people is quite provoking, that is, the problem of pollution of rivers and lakes.  Unless you see what industrial pollution of a waterway really means when it gets going, it is very hard to conceive the true meaning of it.  Few Deputies have ever stood upon the shores of a dead lake but anybody who has visited the city of Chicago and the shores of Lake Erie found themselves standing on the shores of a great lake in which there is no life of any kind.  Every form of life has been destroyed by pollution.  That is rather a grim situation.  To put that to rights would probably take several generations, but there is an intermediate stage. Pretty close to Lake Erie lies Lake Michigan which is subject to a very marked degree of pollution, but in the case of Lake Michigan, the pollution has been kept above a certain minimum which is tolerable on account of the fact that the city of Chicago drew a large part of its water supply from Michigan.  But even in a lake which is the source of a large part of the potable water supply of the city of Chicago, pollution has reached such an extraordinary degree that the biological balance of the lake has been upset, with the result that there has come up from the St. Lawrence seaway a variety of fish whose tolerance of pollution is far higher than that of the strains of fish that were naturally indigenous to Lake Michigan waters.  These fish that have come up the St. Lawrence are strangely called alewives and heretofore they filtered into Lake Michigan in relatively small numbers, and it was on them very largely and on the fry that the indigenous fish lived.  But with the disappearance of the indigenous fish, the alewives multiplied to such an extraordinary extent that they have created a very grave hygiene problem for the Cook County administration by dying in millions along the <Col N="846" /> shores of Lake Michigan in certain weather conditions.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the city of Chicago stretches some 20 miles along the shores of Lake Michigan and they are now faced with the fact that they have a band of dead alewives two feet high and three yards wide stretching for seven or eight miles rotting in the sun along the border of the city of Chicago.  That is what pollution means. People are inclined to shrug their shoulders and say that cannot happen here.  That has happened here.  That is practically the state of affairs obtaining from Church Street Bridge down to the estuary of the Liffey.  That stretch of river has become practically a dead river.  If the present scale of pollution is to continue, all the river will become dead river from the point of view of sea trout and salmon because no fish will be able to get up from the estuary to Kingsbridge, the river is so far polluted already.</P>
    <P>That state of pollution is a fairly remote hazard in the tourist centres in the country, Connemara, Erris, Donegal, Kerry, Clare and elsewhere but, remote as it may appear to be, now is the time to bring it under control before it develops into a very serious problem for the whole inland fishery business as well as the salmon export trade.  I need hardly say that the implications of that on the tourist industry would be quite catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to talk about is the whole question of trawling.  I never sit here listening to people talking about trawling that I do not find it hard to maintain patience.  When I was Minister for Fisheries, two Icelandic firms offered to come here and establish a trawling industry based on Ireland. They wanted no subsidies, no help, except access to a port on our shores and the right to recruit labour here.  I threw them both out.  That was 15 or 16 years ago and I threw them out. I urged the Government to withhold the licences they sought because I felt the type of employment offered by the type of trawler the Icelandic interests were concerned with were not the type I wanted to see our people engaged in at all.  Of course, we are living now in a period 16 years later but the kind <Col N="847" /> of trawling industry then projected for here was based on what were then the most modern deep sea trawlers available. Now, these are the trawlers from Hull that have capsised and sunk in the Atlantic storms in the course of the past week or ten days.</P>
    <P>What a lot of people in this House do not realise is that if you talk of a trawling industry, you must talk in terms of fishing in the competitive waters of the North Atlantic.  Now, 15 or 16 years ago, most of the trawlers plying from Hull and Grimsby and the East Anglian fishing ports, were built at that period.  It is now becoming quite apparent that they are finding it more and more difficult to find men to go to sea in them.  The life is unspeakably hard and the value set upon life, so far as the fishing men are concerned, is very low and they are required, in order to earn a living, to go into those waters in conditions which put the life of every man on board in imminent hazard.  I do not believe in promoting industries of that kind.  That may be an old-fashioned view, but I do not believe we are entitled to send men who have wives, who are the fathers of young children, into imminent danger of death in order to earn a bit of money out of fishing.</P>
    <P>Of course, now we have moved into a new period and the only trawlers of that type plying extensively in what are described as North Atlantic waters are British trawlers.  The reason is that the British trawling companies although entitled to some subsidisation from their Government, are relatively poor enterprises.  They have been losing money for years and have been hanging on by the skin of their teeth and trying to fish these waters with 15-year-old boats.  The modern ocean-going trawler costs the better part of £1 million.  When you talk about centrally-heated trawlers which are safe for the men who man them and remain constantly at sea, you are talking about ships of very large displacements which are, in fact, floating factory ships and which catch fish on an entirely new and different principle which was, I think, pioneered by the Russians and which now has been <Col N="848" /> taken up by the Norwegians and the Danes.  The question is whether it is an industry which has any future interest for us.</P>
    <P>If you are going to haul in fish for consumption in Vienna, Berlin or Paris, you have to ask yourself the question: is it sensible to catch the fish in the North Atlantic, haul it to Dublin and then proceed to ship it from Dublin to Paris, Vienna, Berlin or Copenhagen?  If you are bringing fish to Copenhagen or to the Dutch ports, or to Norwegian ports, you are putting it on a train and then it is going to its destination, but if you are bringing it here for subsequent export, then you have to bear in mind that the transport costs on fish are going to make it extremely difficult to compete with continental fleets with modern equipment.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear if there is any economic prospect for a trawler industry based on the modern quasifactory ship which is now being sent into those waters.  These ships will provide reasonable safety and reasonable comfort for the men and will produce catches which are commensurate with the capital involved, but if they are going to fish into Irish waters, which they need not necessarily do&mdash; but if they are&mdash;the whole question of the subsequent transport costs would arise and put the whole matter in doubt.  It is a matter on which the Minister should inform himself and he should tell the House for the purpose of clarifying Deputies' minds, what the real problems are in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am weary listening to Deputies clamouring about why it is that the Norwegian fishing fleets can fish so profitably for demersal fish in their own territorial waters and why we cannot.  They can never take the trouble to find out.  I remember getting a map put up in the hall down there in order to try to show Deputies what the position is.  The rich deposits of demersal fish are to be found on the Continental Shelf.  The inescapable fact of life is that the Continental Shelf comes down within six miles of the entire coast of Scandinavia and swings out to 150 miles west of the Irish coast.  The <Col N="849" /> reason the Spanish trawlers are fishing 100 miles south of Ireland and run into Castletownberehaven when they are warned of a coming storm, is that they are out on the Continental Shelf which is in international waters, fishing for the demersal fish which is readily available in the much richer waters off Scandinavia.  The waters in which the Spaniards fish, if they are looking for demersal fish, is to the west and south of this country, in international waters, whereas the Scandinavian's fishing grounds are within their own waters which they can effectively control.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is concluding, I should be glad if he would say a few words about the oyster beds, and also on the question of the equipment in Abbotstown, in regard to the detection of the causes of the salmon disease which continues to harrass us; also whether he is satisfied that the available supplies of lobsters and crayfish are being maintained and expanded or are capable of being exhausted, and lastly, but by no means least, what steps he hopes to be able to take, in consultation with his other interested colleagues in the Government, with regard to the question of pollution.  Here it must be borne in mind that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is always fighting a considerable battle against industrial interests, local government interests and even sometimes agricultural interests, to protect waters from pollution, that is, creamery pollution and industrial effluent.  There used to be the problem of the effluent of the flax but flax has very largely disappeared now.</P>

      <P>No, peat is not an effluent in that sense.  It is not to the same extent a poison.  It may make waters unfishable while active work is proceeding on the development of the bog, but I never heard it suggested that peat would poison a river, in the same sense that chemical effluents or industrial waste can turn a given stretch of water into what is technically known as dead water.  There is, of course, the problem of rivers which are contiguous to developing bogs but all these are problems the Minister for Agriculture has to <Col N="850" /> work out with his colleagues.  He is entitled to get from this House that measure of support which entitles him to say: &ldquo;I am being pressed on this question of water pollution in the House and we ought, as a Government, to be prepared to give a satisfactory answer to a reasonable case which is being pressed upon me&rdquo;, and meet the challenge that unless something effective is done, a valuable amenity in the country could be utterly destroyed.</P>

      <P>Taking matters rather at random the question of oysters was raised by Deputy Dillon and the Killary Harbour project which he mentioned as having been initiated 12 years ago.  I am afraid I cannot give the Deputy any worthwhile information on this but we got a very preliminary report on another estuary which we thought might be capable of being developed, and it is not at all encouraging, in that it would appear as if costs and technicalities would seem to stand in the way of an immediate effort.  However, I have done this in respect of another harbour and together with what I can find out about Killary Harbour, it may well be that there may be something capable of being done, but generally the information on this sort of exploitation is not so promising, unless there is some breakthrough or information I have not yet got.  However, I am interested and will follow it up, and I shall communicate with the Deputy on the Killary Harbour project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution of rivers was also mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  I want to say that as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, I am very concerned about this matter.  I was fully aware of these dangers also in my term in Local Government and indeed there has been an awareness over a number of years, particularly recent years, in several Departments concerned with this problem. The most recent evidence of this was the symposium held in Belfield&mdash; I think it was opened by my colleague, the Minister for Local Government&mdash; during which a useful exchange of views took place.  I, on my part, will continue to follow this matter because I realise the ever-growing dangers of this particular aspect of the matter, <Col N="851" /> to see whether, in conjunction with other Ministers, there are particular steps that I must take or they must take.  All concerned in the various Government Departments will take whatever steps appear to be necessary to try to avoid the damaging pollution such as has occurred in other countries as they have developed, particularly industrially.</P>
    <P>With regard to abandoned fisheries, also mentioned by Deputy Dillon, we are not fully aware of the extent of this problem.  What we are doing is that through the boards of conservators, we are inquiring as to whether these circumstances obtain and the dimensions of the actual fisheries, and having got that information, which I hope will be quite soon, we will then have a look to see what we should or could or can or will do about it.</P>
    <P>The salmon disease of UDN and the part played by lamprey is a matter to which special attention is being given in the investigations into the disease generally, together with all other parasites, and there are quite a number of them in the sea and in fresh water.  However, at this point I would say that no evidence has emerged as yet to suggest that the lamprey is a carrier of a possible virus or that it is carrying any virus that is a positive organism in the spread of this disease.  In so far as the equipment at Abbotstown is concerned, my information is that the filters in the laboratory there are of the requisite fineness to be useful for the purpose in question.  This is what I am advised and I think we can take it that this is so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the undersized lobsters being taken, the answer is that the fishery officers of my Department regularly inspect the catches to try to find those people who may be taking the undersized lobsters to prevent them from doing so.  &ldquo;Prevent&rdquo; is a better word because this is what we would like to do.  Rather than catch <Col N="852" /> people having taken such undersized lobsters, we would prefer, by having it known that our officers are likely to call at any time, that they just do not take them and where they catch them, that they return them to the water.  That is being done systematically and will continue to be done, and if there is any evidence that anybody can present to us that would seem to indicate that we are not carrying out this sort of inspection sufficiently often or sufficiently regularly in any particular part of the country, we would step it up in such an event. However, at the moment, I am satisfied that our fishery officers are regularly making these checks and that this check is working pretty well in so far as preventing or discouraging the taking of undersized lobster is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned the matter of drift-netting and the bye-laws existing for many years ago prohibiting, in three districts along the Galway coast, drift-netting for salmon.  This is a matter which we are investigating at the moment and it undoubtedly is one of quite large significance in that it could undoubtedly and must have been presumed to have quite an impact on the catching of salmon at this particular part of the coast.  What we will be doing here is that probably a number of public inquiries will be held as to the possibility of changing the bye-laws in the three different areas along the Galway and Connemara coast.  Public inquiries will, I think, have to be instituted in order to ascertain as nearly as we can whether or not any relaxing or abandonment in whole or in part of these old bye-laws prohibiting drift-netting could be contemplated. I am fully aware of this matter and we are progressing by way of investigation which I think ultimately will culminate in an inquiry or a number of inquiries, to guide us as to what we should do.</P>
    <P>There was also mention of the membership and the contributions of those who benefit from the activities of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I feel it is true to say that those who benefit to a large degree do not seem to recognise the work and the help that has <Col N="853" /> been given to them by the activities of the Trust.  As I said in my introductory remarks, I hope that many more people will participate in helping the Trust by becoming members. Deputy Clinton may have been right to a degree when he said&mdash;I do not think ignorance was the word used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that carelessness, lack of appreciation, lack of thought, probably brings about this situation that many of those who are benefiting directly or indirectly from the work of the Trust do not seem to be appreciative of it and perhaps, as has been suggested, the Trust might do something about this by trying to inform the public or by doing a public relations job with a view to encouraging the public.</P>

      <P>Possibly there could be a renewed effort in that way.  Any assistance we can give them we will be only too glad to give.</P>
      <P>In regard to Galway Harbour, I want to say if I omitted to refer to it at an earlier stage that was in no way to back up the rumours that have apparently been spread around Galway that we have no intention of doing anything about Galway under the major harbours Bill when it becomes an Act. It is our full intention to go ahead with the development in Galway.  Anyone who has any other idea is misleading himself, for whatever reason I do not know.  In regard to Deputy Molloy's request that I should make this clear, I just wanted to say that our intentions are to go ahead with Galway so soon as these problems, which are mainly of a local nature, if you like, have been ironed out, and they are in process of being ironed out at the moment.  The clearing of the lines in this direction is the only thing that stands between us and getting down to doing some real development work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke on the matter of fishery protection.  It is all too easy, of course, to say that fishery protection <Col N="854" /> is not within my sphere, that it comes under the Department of Defence. That is fully accepted by the Deputy. I would like to say that I am fully conscious of our inadequacy, particularly in the extended territorial waters which we would hope to have protection for, and as our own fishing fleet grows protection becomes an ever more important factor for the wellbeing of our fishermen.  So far as I and my Department are concerned, we are not at all unmindful of the situation.  What we can do we are doing at the moment to try to meet the situation.  Suffice it to say that we are fully alive to the fact that the protection must be improved if it is to be at all real in future.</P>
    <P>The French boats were mentioned and it was suggested that the central heating had been defective in some of them and not supplied in others.  The only thing I can say in this regard is that so far as we are led to believe, these boats are of the most modern type.  I would be surprised if the heating has become defective in any major way or in a way that could not be remedied.  I hope that this will be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>That may be the case in some small way or in some major way but I would be surprised, whether it is major or minor, if it is not put right and perhaps it has already been put right.</P>
      <P>The loan arrangements were mentioned and there was reference to some expert who is said to have been on some of the trawlers that have made some of these big catches already.  It is a fact that the arrangement does carry with it an undertaking that whatever technical assistance we might require in the operation of the boats would be forthcoming and would be provided by these people with whom An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have done this deal.  This is a useful service in connection with the loan and purchase scheme that has been negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Loch Corrib was mentioned and the demand or request for help towards a hatchery at Oughterard.  We have <Col N="855" /> had this matter before us in the Department recently.  The situation is that the minimum work to be done in connection with the request we have had and examined would cost about £17,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>£17,000 is regarded as a minimum for the work that should be done and our examination would show that having spent the £17,000, the resultant output of fry would not be of any material benefit to the large system of waters in question.  We feel that this sort of money would be far better and more usefully spent, and with greater benefit to all concerned, including the waters in these areas, if it were devoted to the Inland Fisheries Trust programme.  This is what we have said in reply to these requests and there, for the moment at any rate, the matter rests.</P>

      <P>Cold storage facilities have also been mentioned.  The House will be aware that there has been quite an advance made in this direction, that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, whether directly or through co-ops or through private operators, have been trying and will continue to try to provide such storage and to encourage its provision, and also of ice plants.  We are very conscious of the need for this.  This matter is proceeding very well.  It is a very necessary facility and will be very useful to fishermen in the future.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned that the contribution from the Department and the Government to the Inland Fisheries Trust has been somewhat increased but is not enough.  All I will say is that I am not talking about the 1968/69 Estimates at the moment but it will be more in that year and we will come to discuss that at a later date, but I hope not as late a date afterwards as this Estimate is.</P>

The figures are subject to the qualifications stated on pages 21 and 22 of Economic Statistics, Budget 1964 and, in addition the estimates for the earlier years, are affected by the fact that following the change in rates of social insurance stamps introduced in January, 1964 sales of stamps in respect of late stamping for male agricultural workers can only very tentatively be distinguished from sales in respect of certain categories of voluntary contributors. Because of these limitations the derived estimates may not be strictly comparable and are not dependable in assessing year to year fluctuations in the level of agricultural employment.</P>
