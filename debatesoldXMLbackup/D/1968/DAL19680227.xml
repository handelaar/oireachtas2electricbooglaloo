      <P>I would refer the Deputy to what I said about these proposals in my reply to questions on the 20th instant.  It will be necessary to await further elaboration of the proposals and the attitude to them of the other Governments concerned before expressing a view on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he considers that Ireland can initiate any movement to bring about an end to hostilities in Vietnam; and, if so, if he will take all possible steps in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only hope I see of a final and stable conclusion to the hostilities in Vietnam is that the Vietnamese and those Great Powers involved directly or indirectly should agree that it is in the interest of the sorely afflicted Vietnamese people and of world peace that a cease fire on land, sea and in the air should be arranged to allow negotiations to begin as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The negotiation of an agreement to bring about lasting peace would be greatly helped if it were to be announced now that the agreement arrived at would be guaranteed by France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States and, if possible, by the Peoples Republic of China and the United Nations.  To be really effective and lasting, and to ease the dangerous tension between the Great Powers, a peace settlement in Vietnam should, I believe, form part of an area of peace and limited armaments agreement between a group of countries in South-East Asia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often outlined the principal elements upon which I suggest an area of peace should be based: that the group would agree to settle their differences peacefully, to limit their armaments to police level, to declare their neutrality, and to exclude all military bases from their territories on the conditions that each and all of them would be guaranteed against aggression <Col N="1765" /> by the United Nations including the Great Powers.</P>
    <P>I first put forward the suggestion for the organisation of areas of peace at the General Assembly of the United Nations in referring to the situation which existed in the Middle-East in 1958 when Great Powers sought to make use of the rivalry and bitterness between the States of the region in order to achieve power and influence in the area.</P>
    <P>Since 1960, I have advocated that the solution suggested for the Middle-East should be applied to South-East Asia including Vietnam, and it has received public approval by some of the states in the area.  I intend to keep pressing as best I can for its full implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste care to express a view on the opinion of U Thant that both sides could be brought to the conference table if the bombing of North Vietnam were stopped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for U Thant.  He may have knowledge of the situation in South-East Asia that I have not got.  We have to use our own judgment on this matter.  In my belief, the programme I have outlined would give lasting peace and not a mere ephemeral cease fire which, as everyone can see from events in Vietnam in recent years, is very likely to be broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste gives us his view that U Thant may have some information that is not readily available to him and to other people.  The Tánaiste will remember that U Thant arrived at this view after visits to various important cities in Europe and in Asia?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste does not believe that this would be a solution in present circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if there were to be a one-sided cease-fire, it <Col N="1766" /> could not last for long and that the Vietnamese people would go on suffering until we can get an agreement and, also, we want pressure upon the North Vietnamese people from the people who are helping to prolong this war by supplying arms and other facilities to them.  In my belief, they have the key to the solution in their hands if they want to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste also aware that the view expressed by U Thant with regard to the possibility of bringing the two sides to the conference table after the cessation of bombing of North Vietnam is also the view expressed in recent months by Pope Paul?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misled by the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> yesterday.  It is not true that the Pope asked for the simple cessation of bombing.  I have here all the statements which His Holiness made on this issue right from very early on and in one of them, which is typical of the others, he made reference to the Christmas truce in 1966 and he said:</P>
      <P>Now it is hoped that both parties to the conflict might prolong this truce and from this pause in hostilities it might be possible to proceed to fair negotiations, the only way to arrive at peace in liberty and justice. Once again this makes evident the real strategic point of this sorrowful and paradoxical situation&mdash;man's heart.  Goodwill holds the key to peace.  The difficulty is born of the fact that this key must be turned at the same time by the responsible leaders of both sides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, and finally, the cessation of all hostilities would be the admirable solution but may I come back, for the purpose of bringing both sides to the conference table, to my original point?  It was the view of U Thant as expressed in recent weeks, no matter what anybody else might say, that if the bombing of North Vietnam would cease, there was a possibility of bringing the two sides to the conference table.  I think our Government, through the Tánaiste, should certainly consider this in order to make the first move to finish this awful and dirty war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Deputy realises the seriousness of the situation in Vietnam and in the area. There are a number of countries in that area who are very afraid of what happened to Tibet happening to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the truth of the matter.  I have pretty long experience of studying war and revolutions, sometimes engaging in them, and I do not believe that a truce will last unless it is a real cessation of hostilities in the air and on land and on the sea, and I believe that if the Soviet Union would only press upon the North Vietnamese to agree to a complete cessation of hostilities, negotiations would start which, we hope, would lead to a lasting peace and not just a partial cease-fire that might be broken within 24 hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish delegation has consistently supported condemnation by the United Nations of South Africa's racialist apartheid policies&mdash; policies which we regard as morally wrong, a denial of human rights and crime against humanity.  The most recent resolution of this kind was passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 23rd November, 1967.  Ireland and a very large majority of members voted for this resolution.</P>
      <P>The Government have also imposed an embargo on the exportation of arms to South Africa following the Security Council resolutions of 7th August and 4th December, 1963 and 18th June, 1964 and are contributing to the United Nations Funds for the alleviation of distress and education of the victims of apartheid.</P>
      <P>Further the Government have made representations to the Government of the Republic of South Africa not to proceed with the trial of prisoners from South-West Africa and to release them forthwith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have imposed an embargo on the exportation of arms but I do not know what arms this country produces.  That embargo would not count for a great deal.  Most certainly, we have not agreed to enforce economic sanctions against South Africa.  Would the Minister give any <Col N="1769" /> view as to why this country refused to join the numerous Scandinavian and African countries who have agreed on economic sanctions against this racialist regime in South Africa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever effect sanctions would have if imposed on the authority of the Security Council, they would have none at all if imposed by the General Assembly, and I am very doubtful as to the effectiveness of economic sanctions on a country that is well developed and that is pretty self-sufficient economically.  It would be very easy to vote for sanctions if we thought they would be effective.  It would be wrong to vote for sanctions imposed by a body that had not the power to see that they were carried out. The Security Council has the power to see that its sanctions are carried out and they did in one case authorise the British to stop by force on sea the petrol flow into Rhodesia.  We have had plenty of experience of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of sanctions since Ethiopia and all that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to my comprehensive statement on road freight transport policy when introducing the Estimate for my Department on 9th November, 1967.  On <Col N="1771" /> that occasion I told the House that a long term review of road freight transport policy was being undertaken in my Department.  I pointed out that some considerable time must elapse before any far reaching changes in policy could be contemplated but that in the meantime, the statutory provisions relating to the licensing of road haulage for reward would be administered as liberally as possible.  In pursuance of that undertaking, I have since extended the licences of more than 300 hauliers to enable them to carry livestock anywhere within the State.  I am at present considering what further concessions may be permissible, within the framework of existing legislation, to enable hauliers to operate more effectively in present conditions.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to wind up the road freight section of CIE nor are there any grounds for the fears that have been expressed of large-scale redundancy in CIE.  Cross-Border road freight haulage has been greatly liberalised since 1966 without any ill-effects on CIE employment.</P>
    <P>As I have already told the House in reply to questions on 31st January, 1968, I have under examination applications by certain Irish shipping companies under section 12 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, which provides for the grant of merchandise licences to shipping companies.  In dealing with these applications I will take into account the views of CIE and of the trade unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is widespread discontent and anxiety felt by 20,000 workers employed by CIE at the present time, 300 of whom are employed in Athlone and 200 in Mullingar?  Surely he realises that if he goes any further with his liberalisation policy, it is bound to affect the livelihood of those workers?  Can he give us any guarantee that there will not be large-scale redundancy, that these workers will not lose their positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that to the House.  There are some thousands of licensed carriers who have made representations for <Col N="1772" /> greater liberalisation; there is a very large number of people employed in the CIE road freight section; and there are also the interests of the exporters and the people they employ, who want to have the most efficient transport.  It it my duty to reconcile the interests of all three to the best advantage.  As I have already said, I am meeting the trade unions interested in the road freight section of CIE in order to hear their views on this matter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the suggestion in these questions that there is already some form of concealed surveillance and censorship of RTE programmes.</P>
      <P>I spoke at length during the occasion of the Estimate on what I felt was a generally desirable policy for RTE. There was no disagreement from any quarter.  I enlarged upon my statement in two speeches made later and there was no complaint from any quarter.</P>
      <P>In discussing the annual report of RTE on future development with the Chairman and in one conference with the Board, I have emphasised the importance of maintaining a balanced challenging current affairs programme with a constructive content giving full information on policy as enacted in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Any representations I receive on RTE on the subject of programmes I transmit to the Chairman.  I have taken no action whatever to restrain the discussion of current affairs or to compel RTE to alter the character of programmes so that the interest of any one party would be given undue prominence.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that I have asked RTE to consult the Department of External Affairs on programmes undertaken in sensitive areas just as they should seek information from Government Departments when discussing matters involving administrative action which of course is the practice elsewhere.  I have at no time suggested any structural changes in the RTE organisation.</P>
      <P>Additionally, section 31 of the Act empowers the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to issue written directives with which the Authority must comply, but the House is aware that this power has never been used.</P>

      <P>The period of contract is four years from February, 1965.  The contractors are confident that, given a continuance of the present rate of progress, the works will be completed in accordance with the terms of contract. To date, more than 2,000 of the 3,021 dwellings in the contract have been structually completed, of which 1,541 have been handed over to the corporation, excluding dwellings now being prepared for handing over.  The rate of construction achieved in recent months is greater than the original target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make extra money available to provide work for smallholders in the congested areas and in the Gaeltacht, as they are extremely hard hit, and cannot maintain themselves and their families unless work is found for them and as employment on accommodation road schemes and drainage on an extensive scale is the answer to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the position is as stated by the Deputy.  I would refer him to the reply given by the Taoiseach to Question No. 13 on 31st January, 1968, which described the comprehensive work being done by the Government for the development of employment and income in the 12 counties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that an <i>ad hoc</i> programme of employment schemes of the kind referred to by the Deputy is the only answer to the problem of the <Col N="1784" /> western areas.  On the contrary, to the extent to which such schemes drew funds away form the Government's comprehensive development programme for the West, they would be a deterrent to real progress.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support proposals for accommodation and bog roads and minor drainage works which are worthwhile in themselves and likely to provide long-term benefits to landholders in the working of their holdings.  The value of the schemes of this type authorised to-date this year in the 12 counties is £296,909, an increase of over £119,000 compared with last year.  The amount of money available for this purpose next year has not yet been decided.</P>

      <P>Every boy who reaches the age of 15 and passed in certain subjects in either the day group certificate examination or the intermediate certificate examination in 1967 became eligible to enter apprenticeship.  However, passes in different subjects have been specified for different trades so it is not possible to state the total number of boys who became eligible for apprenticeship during 1967.  Even if this information were available it would be of little value because there is no way of knowing how many of the total number of eligible boys wish to become apprentices.</P>

      <P>The Factories Acts have no application to &ldquo;Wet-Time&rdquo;<Col N="1792" /> insurance nor does an employer's obligations in relation to such insurance depend on the employee's place of work.  Briefly, the position is that under the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Acts, known as the &ldquo;Wet-Time&rdquo; Acts, all manual workers of 16 years of age and over who are employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship in the building, civil engineering, or painting trades must, unless the employment is specifically excluded, be insured under the Acts.  Questions of insurability for &ldquo;Wet-Time&rdquo; purposes are dealt with under the system of deciding officers and appeals officers set up under the Social Welfare Acts. The factors affecting insurability can vary greatly from case to case and in the case which the Deputy has in mind it would be advisable for the employer if he is in doubt to apply to my Department for a formal decision in the matter.</P>

There has been a good deal of misrepresentation in this regard and I want to say, first of all, that the propriety of members of the Committee disclosing or purporting to disclose what went on inside the Committee is open to some question.  For example, should I discuss publicly the attitude taken by Deputy Sweetman in regard to single seat constituency as disclosed in free discussions in the Committee?  I do not think I should. I want to assert, firstly, that no spokesman on behalf of the Government has said or implied that the proposals brought forward by the Government arose out of the report of the Committee. Secondly, I want to say every member of the Committee knows that that is the position because I indicated to the Committee that such proposals were likely to be under consideration and I made strenuous efforts to have the report brought forward.  Thirdly, and most important.  I assert that neither Deputy Seán Lemass nor any other Fianna Fáil member of that Committee at any stage stated that he was against the straight vote.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that <Col N="1794" /> report, may I say this to the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  The minutes of the tenth meeting of that Committee which contain a paragraph following a statement by Deputy Seán Lemass, a statement acquiesced in by the Minister as chairman of the Committee, showed that what I said was true and what the Minister said is not true.  I challenge him to publish the minutes of the tenth meeting.</P>

What Deputy Sweetman is trying to do is to mislead the people into thinking that Deputy Seán Lemass or anybody else said he was against the straight vote when in fact what he was trying to say was that Deputy Seán Lemass may have expressed some views about the political advisability at that particular time of the straight vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the nature, extent and frequency of tests to ascertain the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea and the fish caught there; the average level <Col N="1795" /> of radioactivity in each of the last five years; and what he would consider a significant level requiring a cessation by Britain of dumping radioactive waste in the sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me a series of questions which if I were to attempt to answer in detail I would serve only to bewilder the House with a mass of highly technical data.</P>
      <P>The position, in brief, is that tests of sea-water samples taken from the Irish coastal waters indicate that at no time has the level of radioactivity in those waters exceeded the range of background radioactivity which might be expected to be found in sea-water, anywhere.  Therefore, there exists no hazard to health from this source.  Routine testing will continue and the position will be kept under constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's assessment of the technical and scientific ability of the Members of this House is probably much below what in fact the standard of Deputies is, I would ask him to tell us now the frequency of these tests.  One matter can be answered quite simply.  What was the last level of radioactivity ascertained?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared <Col N="1796" /> to give any further information because I think Deputy Ryan is trying to create the impression in the public mind that there is in fact a health hazard, that the level of radioactivity might possibly cause concern in the public mind.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister apprehends that there is a possibility of public disquiet being created, surely there is no more effective way of achieving this purpose than for the Minister to decline to give a specific figure?  If the Minister tells us he has a figure for December, 1967, and for January, 1968, and he warns us there are very difficult technical questions involved, if there is any way of creating public disquiet, it is to say: &ldquo;These are figures I am not prepared to reveal.&rdquo;  If he really wants to allay unnecessary public disquiet, I would urge on the Minister to give these figures, subject to the warning he has given that this is a very highly technical matter and requires technical competence fully to apprehend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

I am prepared to give to Deputy Ryan, who put down the question, or to anybody else who wishes to have them, any figures available to my Department and also the benefit of any technical advice in a field which I certainly do not understand and which I suggest 95 per cent of the House do not understand.  The other facility Deputy Ryan, Deputy Dillon or anybody in the Opposition may have, but without notice I am not prepared to disclose any figures which mean nothing to ordinary members of the public.</P>

      <P>We had some discussion the other day in relation to the power of delegation contained for the Revenue Commissioners in section No.2.  I am worried about that power of delegation for a variety of reasons, one being, as I see it, that a delegated officer may have the right to put a taxpayer to a great deal of difficulty and expense and virtual impossibility of completing returns in some cases under the provisions of section 4 of the Bill.  It is rather funny that we should have, contemporaneously with that, an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> dealing with a little old lady called Miss Gaye.  I do not know whether the Minister has yet made the acquaintance of Miss Gaye but anyway it is quite clear from this article written by two people&mdash;one of whom, I know, is a member of the Minister's profession: I am not quite certain whether both are&mdash;in which they are dealing with the effect of the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; in the Income Tax Act, that these two eminent gentlemen accept the case that was put from this side of the House on Committee Stage in relation to the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; in section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> It seems that the method by which certain matters are dealt with by section 4 can be dealt with not by the Revenue Commissioners themselves but, by virtue of the provision of section 2 of the Act, by a person of a very much lesser rank.  Indeed, the Minister indicated the other day one of the reasons he wanted section 2 in its present form was to provide that it need not be a person at all to whom this power was delegated, that it could be a computer.  If the Minister were still in private practice, he would know that many taxpayers have&mdash;perhaps in the teething troubles of the computer, I do not argue about that&mdash;as a result of the malpractices of the computer, received assessments in the last couple of years that are quite off beam and far more have received demands that are quite off beam.</P>

      <P>I can see the computer pays as little attention to you as the people will pay on the referendum in the summer because I got a demand from a client done by a computer this morning which is all wrong.  It is upside down, backwards and forwards, and completely removed from the facts of the case.  I am not surprised that those things are happening because we all know that a machine is as good and no better than the man who operates it.  If the operator on the machine is not able satisfactorily to operate it, then we get crazy results coming out.  It is not the right way to go about the serious matter of exercising the discretionary power that is in certain circumstances vested in the Revenue Commissioners by having it so that the delegation can be in those general terms without any restriction of grading or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was more particularly anxious to raise on this the question of neglect, whilst accepting of course the corporate undertaking of the Minister that if it were found that the time limit section involved a genuine mistake, then new amending legislation would be introduced.  I accept, of course, <Col N="1803" /> without question such undertaking, but it is also well known to the Minister that many people are not in a position to fight an assessment by an inspector of taxes and are not in a position to know to whom to go to deal with such a matter and in consequence mistaken interpretation of section 14 will certainly arise if there is intention of delegation under this section.</P>
    <P>I admit frankly I am not interested in whether this tabling is a statutory tabling or a non-statutory presentation. I am perfectly happy to accept the Minister's assurance that any general delegation, as is provided under this section, will be laid before the Dáil without having it implicit in the section itself.  The reason I do that particularly is that I am certain if it has to be laid before the Dáil, the fact of the Revenue Commissioners knowing that their Minister may have to stand over that delegation will have the certain effect of making sure that no delegation will be made to a lower official than is desirable.  As I say, I am particularly interested in this because of the manner in which section 4 will be interpreted.  I commend to the Minister the case of little Miss Gaye and the wrong done to her by a gentleman called Barney.</P>

      <P>I really feel that this limitation which Deputy Sweetman is imposing is quite unnecessary.  Indeed, it is inappropriate. The administrative functions of the Special Commissioners which are now being transferred to the Revenue Commissioners, include the making of Schedule C and Schedule D assessments to recover income tax deducted by bankers, paying agents and brokers on cashing dividends and interest warrants, coupons and so on. There is no provision in the law for the making of any other assessment to income tax by the Revenue Commissioners. Accordingly it applies over a very small and restricted area.  I do not really think that these assessments would be regarded as of any significance at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it would be imprudent of Deputy Sweetman to insist on this.  I <Col N="1804" /> understand that practical administrative considerations will require that the delegation should be to named officers, not to all officers in the specified grade. I do not think it would be appropriate to have that type of delegation laid before the Dáil.  Furthermore, I consider that we here as a parliament by statute delegate the whole care and management of the administration of revenue to the Revenue Commissioners. Surely then we can assume they will exercise the limited power of delegation which the section gives them in a very reasonable and responsible manner?  So I think this would be an inappropriate mechanism and one that is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 42 to 49 and substitute as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9 &mdash; (1)  In section 53 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the reference in paragraph (f) of Case III to income arising from possessions outside the State shall be deemed not to include a reference to any pension or similar benefit to which this section applies.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section applies to any pension or similar benefit which &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is given in respect of past services in an office or employment or is payable under provisions of the law of the country in which it arises which correspond to provisions of the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1967, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1967, or the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1967, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if it were received by a person who, for the purposes of tax of the country in which it arises, <Col N="1805" /> is resident in that country and is not resident elsewhere, would not fall to be regarded as income for those purposes.</P>
    <P>In this paragraph &lsquo;tax&rsquo; means, in relation to any country, a tax which is chargeable and payable under the law of that country and which corresponds to income tax in the State.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall have effect in relation to income tax for the year 1967-68 or for any subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mentioned this on Committee Stage. As Deputies know we decided in the first instance to exempt from Irish income tax certain specified foreign pensions, namely, pensions payable under the US Social Security Act and the US Railroad Retirement Act.  Both of those types of pensions are free of income tax in the US but it has been put to us that there are other pensions arising in other countries which are free of income tax there, so we have now decided to enlarge the scope of section 9 and to say that the exemption from Irish income tax will extend to any pension which would have been free of income tax in the country in which it arises, if the recipient continued to reside in that country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister extend that to the contributory old age pension here?  Surely it seems a little odd that recipients of any social welfare benefits are exempt from tax here until they reach 70 years of age when they become liable for tax on their old age pension, unless it is a non-contributory old age pension?  Maybe the Minister has not considered this question.  If he has not, will he now have a look at it and see if there is something he can do about it?  There are not many people involved but it seems a little out of the way that if somebody has a small income and can qualify for a contributory old age pension, both are combined and he is assessed for income tax purposes.  In view of the fact that the Minister has been generous to those other people who receive pensions outside the State, <Col N="1806" /> perhaps he will now do something for those people who receive pensions inside the State.  It does not apply to a great number of people.</P>

      <P>In page 8, after line 37, to add the following new subsection to section 12:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The stamp duties imposed by the Stamp Act, 1891, under the heading &lsquo;Conveyance or Transfer on Sale of any property&rsquo; in the First Schedule to that Act upon a marketable security not transferable by delivery shall not be chargeable in the case of a foreign loan security issued by or on behalf of a company or body of persons corporate or unincorporate formed or established in the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is about the stamp duty.  I think Deputy Sweetman owes me another glass of brandy.  The purpose of this amendment is to meet a point raised by Deputy Sweetman on Committee Stage.  This provision will ensure that foreign securities as defined in subsection (1) of section 12 will be transferable free of all stamp duty, whether the security is in bearer or registered form.  The only stamp duty which will arise in the case of foreign loan securities will be a duty of 2/6d per cent payable on issue.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where, apart from this subsection the activities of dealing in or developing land, carried on by any person, would not be regarded as activities carried on in the course of a trade within Schedule D but would be so regarded if every disposal of an interest in land included amongst those activities was a disposal of the full interest therein, then notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, the activities carried on by such person shall be deemed to be wholly a trade within Schedule D or, as the case may be, part of such a trade and the profits and gains thereof, shall be charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D accordingly.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where, but for the fact that any land which is disposed of by any person for any interest therein in the course of activities in dealing in or developing land, carried on by him had been acquired by him otherwise than with the intention of being used for the purpose of the trade of dealing in or developing land, the activities carried on by such person would, or would be deemed by the preceding subsection to be regarded as activities carried on in the course of a trade, then notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary the activities carried on by such person shall be deemed to be wholly a trade within Schedule D or, as the case may be, part of such a trade and the profits and gains thereof shall be charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the beginning, in circumstances of which the Minister is aware, this amendment was put down rather hurriedly and before it had received the polishing one would like to have done on it.  That is not at all to say that it fails to get across the point involved.  I say that so that the Minister may <Col N="1808" /> understand that I am standing on its effect rather than on the actual wording.</P>
    <P>This all goes back to the discussion on Committee Stage, that it is undesirable to introduce the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; and that the use of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; means that something the Minister quite honestly does not intend to cover will, in fact, be covered.  One of the worst dangers involved in this is that we would have an interpretation of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; such as that which was taken by Mr. Justice Rowlatt on tax cases, page 179, which the Minister can look at in due course, where he said that business was a very wide word, and it is a very wide extensive, elastic word with two distinct meanings.</P>
    <P>It is extremely bad tax legislation to include something (a) that is too elastic in definition and (b) that has two distinct meanings so that it is not clear on the face of it that either meaning is the one restricted to this section or, indeed, both meanings but it goes wider than that.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to endeavour to meet what the Minister has in mind and to do so without introducing the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; at all. As will be seen, therefore, I have utilised the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; with certain definitions of that word as it is here. I am not clear at all why the Minister stood the last day so very firmly on his opinion, though I did see towards the end of that discussion some shaking of his faith in the section as introduced by him.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to a specific instance. The word &ldquo;business&rdquo;, as I have said, has an extremely elastic meaning.  If an owner of land is selling sites piece-meal to strangers at arms length I think he is engaged in the business of dealing in land or, perhaps, held to be so engaged.  If he did not acquire the land for the purpose of dealing in it, then in the ordinary course he would not be held to be engaged in the trade of dealing in land.  However, under section 17, as it is now, it is quite clear that we may have a decision that the business can be deemed wholly to be a <Col N="1809" /> trade.  The effect of that is that unless amended it is undesirable to introduce the phrase &ldquo;the business&rdquo; at all and both of these amendments&mdash;amendment No. 5 being an alternative to the second subsection of amendment No. 4 &mdash; are phrased in an endeavour to get at what the Minister correctly wants, avoiding the danger, because of the unnecessary introduction of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;, of a situation in which something other than that anticipated, or other than that visualised, or other than that intended would be brought within the scope of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a great deal of thought to this whole matter. We have sought anxiously for some other formula that might meet the requirements we have in mind.  We have considered this question of the use of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; and looked to see whether any other word could be substituted, but we have by the circumstances of the situation been inevitably driven back to the section as it stands.</P>
      <P>I feel it meets the situation.  I do not anticipate that it will give rise to any of the difficulties of interpretation which have been suggested.  I became more and more convinced that it was the right way of tackling this problem when I studied the suggestions and solutions put forward in substitution for it particularly the most recent attempts and indeed previous attempts by Deputy Sweetman to avoid the use of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; at all.</P>
      <P>His amendment, I think, recognises the two hurdles about which we have been speaking but he tries to overcome these two hurdles in two separate provisions. It is quite clear that his draft of subsection (1) would cause a great deal of difficulty.  In fact, I doubt if it would work at all.  It is quite clear that the consequences of it would be that if a builder had one private transaction in a year, the whole profit of his normal house building and leasing operations would escape tax.  The suggested subsection (2) incorporates the word &ldquo;intention&rdquo; which of course is the thing that has caused all the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impossibility of proving intention or disproving it has started this <Col N="1810" /> whole process which has got us to this point in time.  With all due deference I feel that Deputy Sweetman's two proposals would not work and that what we have put forward does meet the situation and will work.  I do not think that the House need be unduly apprehensive about the use of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  Taking the thing as a whole, it does meet the case.  For an assessment to lie in the future, there will have to be a whole lot of things which I have mentioned before on Committee Stage.  These will ensure that the type of case we are after &mdash; the man who is making profits out of dealing in and developing land as a business &mdash; will be caught and the other type of person who is just carrying out a capital type of transaction will not be caught.</P>

      <P>On the Fifth Stage there is an old comment in relation to a certain type of legislation that would be applicable to the 1965 Act and could be said to be applicable also to this Bill.  First comes the Act imposing the tax, next comes an Act to amend the Act imposing the tax, then comes an Act to explain the Act that amended the Act imposing the tax, and next comes an Act to remedy the defects in the Act explaining the Act that amended the Act and so <i>ad infinitum.</i>  That is rather like what I am afraid we are going to have as a result of the method adopted in 1963 by the former Minister for Finance and in 1965 by the former Minister for Finance, but at least we have taken out some of that.  The 1965 Act was rather like a ship built in a dockyard which put to sea on its first voyage <Col N="1811" /> before it was realised that the rudder had been forgotten.  After every voyage some defect was revealed: it had to be caulked, then it had to be planked, then it had to get new rigging and then it had to careened, after all these expensive alterations the vessel had to be broken up and rebuilt.  In fact, this Act went through as many transformations as a butterfly's egg goes through before is emerges as a butterfly.  Part VII of the 1965 Act which we told the then Minister for Finance was rotten has been proved by the present Minister to be rotten.  It had to be taken up and thrown away.  In the words of the simile which I read the other day, it had to be broken up and rebuilt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>It proposes to alter the present statutory basis of assessing the annual rate demand by Donegal County Council on the urban district of Buncrana.</P>
      <P>A general revision of all rateable property in Buncrana was carried out in 1950 at the request of the urban district council.  The revision resulted in an increase in the total valuation of the urban district from £7,563 at the 1st March, 1950, to £11,445 at the 1st March, 1951.  The cost of services carried out by a county council for the whole county, including any urban districts in the county, is apportioned between the county health district and the urban districts by reference to the effective valuation of each area.  The share of each urban district is levied by way of an annual demand made by the county council on the district.  Since no request has been made to the Commissioner of Valuation to have the valuations of property in the rest of County Donegal comprehensively reviewed, the valuation revision in Buncrana resulted in a disproportionate increase in the county demand on that urban district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> Provisions were included in the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Acts, 1954 and 1960, to ease the effect of the valuation revision on Buncrana.  The 1954 Act provided that the county demand on Buncrana for 1954-55 would be calculated on the notional valuations which would have applied in that year if the general revision had not taken place and only normal increases in valuation had occurred since 1951.  This notional valuation was to be increased annually by a fixed amount of £330 per annum over a ten-year period, at the end of which the normal method of calculating the county demand by reference to the actual valuation would apply.  In fact, however, the normal annual increase in valuation between 1954 and 1960 fell substantially below the estimates on which the 1954 Act formula had been devised.  To meet the resultant situation, the 1960 Act provided that the county demand on Buncrana was to be calculated in respect of the year 1960-61 on the basis of 70 per cent of the net product of a rate of one penny in the £ in the urban area.  This proportion was to increase by 1 per cent of a penny in each subsequent year until, in 1990-91, the county demand would, as elsewhere, fall to be calculated on the net produce of a rate of one penny in the £.</P>
    <P>Buncrana Urban District Council have been pressing for a further revision of the method of calculating the county demand on the grounds that the present basis bears unfairly on the ratepayers in the urban district.  The council have requested that the county demands for 1968-69 and future years should be calculated on the basis of 70 per cent of the net produce of a rate of one penny in the £ in the urban area. The council's request has been fully supported by Donegal County Council. I have examined the case made by them and I am satisfied that the stabilisation of the basis of assessment of the county demand at 70 per cent of the net produce of a rate of 1d in the £, until such time as there is a general revision of the valuation of the rest of the county, would be justified and would be the only satisfactory solution to the difficulties which have arisen from the general revision of 1950.  The <Col N="1813" /> Bill provides accordingly.  The effect will be to reduce Buncrana's share of the cost of the services carried out by the county council on behalf of the entire county, including the urban areas, to what it would have been if a general revision of valuation had not taken place in Buncrana and to maintain an equitable financial relationship in the future between the various contributing areas in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the new arrangements shall apply in respect of the year beginning on the 1st April next.  The statutory period for the estimates meetings of county councils expires on the 31st March.  I mention this point to draw attention to the desirability of giving the Bill speedy consideration as it is essential, for legal reasons, that it would be enacted without delay if the revised arrangements are to apply in respect of 1968-69. The Bill has been promoted at the request of the parties most directly affected &mdash; Buncrana Urban District Council and Donegal County Council &mdash; and because the legislation is necessary to rectify an equitable situation. On that basis I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill is introduced for the purpose of undoing an injustice and rectifying an inequity which has arisen in Buncrana. Apparently, in 1950, the urban council were not satisfied that the valuations in the town were fair.  They believed some were getting away with paying less rates than they should while others were paying more rates than they should be asked to pay.  I can imagine a situation in which two adjoining householders might pay different rates on almost identical properties. The valuation of one property might be £10 while that of the next door property, because of some improvements carried out, might be £30. The urban council requested a revaluation of the town in order to correct such disparities.  The town was revalued and the valuation was increased from £7,563 on 1st March, 1950, to £11,445 in the following year.  When Buncrana came to pay its share of the general <Col N="1814" /> county charges the urban council found they were being fleeced because, of course, the rest of the county had not been revalued.  Instead of one house in Buncrana being out of line with its neighbour the town of Buncrana was out of line with the rest of the country. It is for that reason that measures such as this are necessary to rectify that situation and to restore equality.  Such a measure would not be necessary had the whole county, or the whole country, been revalued.  This measure, however, highlights the grave injustices that can occur under the present system of poor law valuation and the financing of local services.</P>
      <P>A person who built a house ten years ago and who has ceased to have the benefit of a remission of rates now finds himself contributing far more to local services than does his neighbour who receives no less services.  In every town there are people saddled with huge demands for rates, demands which they are unable to meet.  It is possible to have two identical business premises carrying different valuations simply because one has put in a modern shop front.  Because of that improvement the valuation is increased from £10 to £30. That is no exaggeration.  That sort of jump in valuation is quite frequent. Despite the new front the occupier may not do any more business than his neighbour.  Yet he is asked to pay three times as much rates.</P>
      <P>That situation was bad enough when the rates were 20/- in the £ or 30/- in the £, but now, when rates are £3 10s in the £, and steadily increasing all the time, the burden becomes intolerable. A grave injustice can occur in the case of a town like Buncrana controlled, as it is, by an urban council.  Sufficient pressure was brought to bear on the Minister to induce him to introduce this measure designed to give some relief, but what is the position of the tens of thousands of property owners throughout the country in the same position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their neighbours as Buncrana is <i>vis-à-vis</i> Letterkenny, Ballyshannon or Bundoran?  That is exactly the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can disagree seriously with the proposition I am putting to the House and I am <Col N="1815" /> glad the introduction of the Bill affords an opportunity of pointing out this type of disparity.  Of course the introduction of this Bill really does not afford an opportunity of doing so.  I believe, and I have advocated it in the past and will continue to do so, that the present system of financing local services, such as health and housing, vocational education and maintenance of main roads, is wrong, unfair and unjust and should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>That is particularly so when the system of valuation under which the money is raised is not fair, is unjust, as this Bill demonstrates.  The town of Buncrana was revalued.  Its valuation in 1950 was £7,563; it was raised by approximately £4,000 to £11,445.  Supposing that instead of dealing with the town of Buncrana, we were dealing with a valuation in Buncrana of £1,000 &mdash; one hereditament with a valuation of £1,000 &mdash; and a similar hereditament in Letterkenny of £1,000, and that for some reason or another, the rated occupier of the premises in Buncrana had drawn to him the attention of the Commissioner of Valuation, had his valuation raised in 1950 from £1,000 to £2,000, and that the man in Letterkenny succeeded in keeping quiet and had not his valuation interfered with, would not the very same injustice which is conceded in this case by the introduction of this Bill also operate between those two rated occupiers; and would the Minister in those circumstances come in here with a Bill to do justice to the one individual, the one rated occupier in Buncrana, as against the other?</P>
    <P>They are the facts as I see them. That is the alarming position disclosed by the introduction of this Bill. The day has gone when the rated occupier was a man of wealth, when only people with substantial property paid rates.  Every tenant of a local authority house in this Republic at the moment is a ratepayer whose valuation is probably between £7 and £10 or more, and who is paying rates of between £30 and £40 a year.  He should not be taxed by a system that is admittedly unfair, that is manifestly unjust, that does not hold the scales evenly between one taxpayer and <Col N="1816" /> another and that does not attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>I concede immediately that this is a big problem, but Governments are elected to deal with such problems. Therefore, I wonder when this Government will get down to the business of devising a system which will hold the scales evenly between one ratepayer and another, instead of introducing piecemeal legislation of this nature to deal with isolated cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We, of course, do not oppose the Bill.  However, it shows the danger of one local authority attempting to step out in front of everybody else, particularly a local authority within a local authority.  The person who originally suggested that this should be done, that Buncrana should attempt to revalue, was dealt with by the electorate when he next went forward for election.</P>
      <P>The main point about this is that it emphasises one problem.  I understand now that the urban council there were disbanded.  Of course that was one way of dealing with it.  However, it brings out the problem which has affected the country since the devaluation of the £20 farmer.  The Minister must be aware of cases in his own constituency in which farmers on £20 valuation, with holdings and houses in proper condition, pay £5 in rates per year while a cottier living beside one such farmer, with an acre of land or perhaps less attached to his cottage, is paying £20 a year on the cottage.  It makes one wonder whether this thing can ever be straightened out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking of the country, apart from the town.  The small businessman or householder in a town seems to be in a worse position in regard to rates. Therefore, I should like to find out from the Minister what has happened about all the proposals the Government had to do something about the system of local taxation.  They should have now reached some kind of finality.  Though it is true that there is a rebate of a kind during ten years on a new house, nevertheless the man who has a decent house and tries to keep it in good repair has to pay high rates.  I wonder whether this question <Col N="1817" /> has been considered at all by the Government.  After all, what has happened in Buncrana happens every day.  A man who builds a new house or renovates an old one has a very high rate struck, whereas a neighbour beside him whose house has been kept in good order during a period of years pays only a fraction of the rates struck on the other man.  Are the Government doing something about it?</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Fitzpatrick's hypothesis of a new revaluation of the entire country.  The last general valuation was carried out in 1857 by Griffith's outfit and though he at the time did a reasonably good job of it, things are different now.  Is it not a fact that if there were a general valuation now, we should have much higher valuations placed on most properties and a very much reduced county rate?  Whether that would please anybody is a matter we cannot debate today.</P>
    <P>There is just the one point.  I should like the Minister to let me know if, in fact, there is any proposal to do something about local government taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this Bill because it lessens the burden of the rates on the town of Buncrana.  While I freely admit that this is a very complex business, nevertheless I feel a certain pride in the fact that in 1950, a number of councillors in the Buncrana Urban District Council &mdash; people who could be described as at the bottom of the political ladder &mdash; were far-seeing enough to draw attention to the fact that this system of taxation in this country is wrong, antiquated and needs to be overhauled.  They made their protest, for various reasons.  Some of them, on their own initiative and enterprise, reconstructed the old premises into what appeared to be modern or up-to-date premises at that time, by having them tiled or giving them vitreolite fronts or black glass fronts, and so on. These were the only variations carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe a shop window enlarged or a <Col N="1818" /> new entrance was made to the business premises but there was no general structural overhaul of the property whatsoever. These individuals improved the appearance of their premises thereby creating a better impression in a tourist seaside resort.  The rate collector or the official responsible, in the course of his duties under the law of this land, reported the matter to the secretary of the county council who, in turn, is obliged by law to pass on the information to the Valuations Office here in Dublin.  These people, then, because of their enterprise, found that their valuations were increased.  It drove them to the point of asking for a revision of valuations of the entire town.</P>
    <P>I must admit that, in the past when I visited Buncrana, I was not particularly interested in the rates of the town but, now that I am, I can take a certain amount of pride in the fact that those men set out, in 1950, on a lone battle of protest to the Government that this system of taxation is, in the extreme, wrong.  The only thanks they got for their trouble was that their valuations were increased from £7,000-odd in 1950 to £11,000-odd in 1951.  In other words, the iron fist method was used to crush any protest, no matter how legitimate the claim might be.  The iron fist method was used to crush any further attempt by Buncrana or any urban district council to say to the Minister and to the Government that the system in this respect is wrong.</P>
    <P>Now, people in very high places are beginning to take note that the rating system is wrong.  Health should be a national charge.  Select any volume of Dáil Debates which contains speeches by former members of the Fianna Fáil Government who held office as Minister for Health when different Bills were brought into this House and read them.  I am thinking particularly of speeches by Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health in 1953.  He said then that the Health Bill, when enacted, would not cost more than 2/- in the £.  I am not familiar with the exact proportion of the rates which health is costing in Donegal but it must be in excess of 2/- in the £.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and the Minister may agree to differ on this particular point.  No matter whether or not the Minister agrees with this, the naked truth is that, as far back as 1950, members of Buncrana Urban District Council saw that the rating system was wrong.  Now, in 1968, we have people in very high places in Government telling us that it is wrong and that something must be done about it.  I want to know when action will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick says, this is a very serious problem.  It is one that will not easily be answered.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick also says, one of the reasons <Col N="1820" /> Governments are elected is to solve serious problems.  No definite approach has been made in my time in this House by any Minister for Local Government to attempt to settle this problem.  Indeed, not alone has health been accountable for extra rates in the county health district of Donegal in general but, now, in maritime counties such as Donegal, we face the extra burden involved in contending with coast erosion and drainage.  While we welcome these things and will give every assistance to the Government which they require, nevertheless extra taxation must be collected for whatever steps may be necessary in relation to coast erosion and drainage.  We welcome such corrective action because we have been crying out for it for a long time.  Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that this expenditure, which should be a 100 per cent State grant and certainly not less than 75 per cent, is a complete charge on the local rates.</P>
    <P>Late as it may be, I feel the Minister for Local Government must be thanked for the interest he is taking in the Buncrana rating area.  I trust that, in his spare time, he will read some of the remarks I have made and take note of them.</P>

      <P>Were it not for the fact that the members of Buncrana Urban District Council in 1950 &mdash; upon whom Deputy Harte looks back with pride &mdash; requested a general revision of all rateable property there, without examining the consequences, we should not be dealing with this Bill here at all.  I think the remainder of the debate relating to valuations and rates in general is irrelevant.  In 1950, the urban district councillors of Buncrana made a serious blunder inasmuch as they should not have moved for a general revision of all valuations within their area without first consulting the remainder of the county so that the valuations of the whole county would be revised at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies know, an inter-departmental committee has been examining the whole question of local finance and taxation.  Two reports have already been published.  The third report is almost ready to be published <Col N="1821" /> and the fourth report, which will be the final report, is in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>In publishing these reports, the Government made it clear that they were not committed to the suggestions in them but that the reports were being published for the purpose of stimulating informed and constructive criticism. This Government have never pretended that there is any quick or easy solution to the problems of local finance.  It is a complex subject.  We believe that this thorough investigation was a necessary preliminary to the formulation of comprehensive proposals for improvement.  It should be made clear that the Government are not committed to the suggestions that have been made so far.  We are looking for comments on these proposals.  As I have said, the remainder of the committee's reports will be available for the public information within a very short period.  I think that this is a wise way to approach the problem, which is a difficult and complex one.</P>
      <P>I am quite in agreement that the present system of raising local taxation is by no means an ideal one.  It is not such an easy thing to decide what would be an ideal system but it is quite clear that the total amount of money required will have to be raised in some way or other from the people, so that any changes that are decided upon, if they result in some people paying less will also mean that other people will pay more.  It is futile for Deputies to suggest that some painless way of financing all these services can be arrived at.  It may be that the decisions that are eventually taken will result in some people having to pay less, but, if that is so, others, obviously, will have to pay more.</P>
      <P>I should point out to Deputy Fitzpatrick that it is not correct to say that this deals solely with the question of relief from health charges.</P>

      <P>I should point out to Deputies that the proportion of these charges which is met by the State has been increasing consistently in recent years.  In the current year, 52 per cent of expenditure will be met from State grants, 32 per cent from rates and 16 per cent from miscellaneous receipts which are mainly such things as rents from local authority houses.  As I have said, the percentage met by the Exchequer has been consistently rising. In 1938-39, the percentage was 39.2; it was 42.6 in 1956-57; 50, approximately, in 1966-67 and it is now 52.  At the same time, the percentage met from the rates has fallen from 56 in 1938-39 to 39.7 in 1956-57; 34 in 1966-67 and to approximately 32 in 1967-68.  It is clear, therefore, that in the interim, while we are waiting for the committee to report, an increasing percentage of the total expenditure is, in fact, being met by the Exchequer, which means that it is being met by central taxation rather than by rates.  In County Donegal, State grants met, in fact, 70.4 per cent of the expenditure.</P>

      <P>I announced in the House in June last that the Government had decided that the grants operated by the Special Employments Schemes Section of my Department for farmers' roads, bog roads and minor drainage works would in future be administered under a single scheme and that the county councils were being asked to administer that scheme, subject to the general control of my Department. Since then the county councils have been advised of the details of the new scheme and, with very few exceptions, have indicated their willingness to operate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to grant the county councils the necessary powers to implement the new arrangements, and in effect to carry out the schemes formerly administered as the Bog Development, Minor Employment and Rural Improvement Schemes by the Special Employment Schemes Office, which recently became the Special Employment Schemes Section of my Department.  The Bill itself is a relatively simple measure.  Section 2 confers the power of a county council to enter into an agreement with landholders for the construction or improvement of accommodation roads and bog roads and for the execution <Col N="1824" /> of minor drainage schemes to serve land or bogs.  Section 3 provides that the expense of the work will be shared between the State and the benefiting landholders.  Section 4 authorises the making of State grants to the county councils for the purpose of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>I have already, in the course of my reply on 6th February to the debate on the Estimate for my Department, outlined the main features of the new scheme.  To facilitate Deputies I shall repeat the main points.</P>
    <P>It will be known as the Local Improvements Scheme and will operate as a single contributory scheme.  This is a logical step as all the three existing schemes deal with the same type of work.  The new arrangement will make it easier to administer the scheme and should help to reduce the costs of administration, thus ensuring that more of the available money is devoted to the works themselves.  It will also help to ensure that grants are allocated for the most necessary works.  To facilitate participation in the scheme by landholders in the congested Western areas reduced rates of local contribution will apply in cases where the average valuation of the landholders is low.  Thus, the maximum rate will be 2½ per cent in the case of valuations under £5, compared with 10 per cent under the Rural Improvements Scheme in the past.</P>
    <P>A bulk allocation will be made each year to each county council.  Out of this the council will make grants for individual schemes coming within the scope of the Bill, which, as I have indicated, means schemes such as the Special Employment Schemes Office carried out in the past.  The council will select the schemes to be done in the year, enter into agreements with the landholders, collect their contributions and then execute the schemes. Priority in the recruitment of workmen will be accorded to suitable unemployed men registered at the Employment Exchanges.  Councils have also been requested to give priority on the new scheme to gangers and other supervisory officials formerly employed by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Gangers and others with the <Col N="1825" /> requisite service under the Special Employment Schemes Office will be paid the allowances for which they are eligible under the Superannuation Acts or the Redundancy Payments Act.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the cost of the new scheme will be met by the State grant plus the landholders' contributions. In calculating the cost the county council will be entitled to include a percentage charge in respect of administrative expenses.  Of course, the lower this is, the more of the available money that will be devoted to the actual works.  I should say that a prime consideration in transferring the schemes to county councils is the fact that the maintenance of a separate organisation engaged exclusively on carrying out so many scattered, small schemes involved high overhead costs.  It is hoped that substantial economies will be effected under this head by using the existing county council organisation.  We shall keep this aspect of costs specially under review.  I may say that the scheme will not involve any responsibility on the part of the county council for future maintenance.</P>
    <P>In addition to carrying out the Bog Development, Minor Employment and Rural Improvement Schemes, the Special Employment Schemes Office acted as agents for Roinn na Gaeltachta in respect of grants allocated by that Department for accommodation roads in the Gaeltacht, and for the Department of Transport and Power in respect of grants for road and drainage works serving bogs used for the production of turf for the hand-won turf fired electricity generating stations in Counties Donegal, Galway, Clare and Kerry.  It is intended that the county councils will act in the future for these Departments, and the Bill has been drafted accordingly.  The Ministers concerned will make allocations to the county councils to enable them to do the necessary works.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, practically all the county councils have indicated their willingness to operate the Local Improvements Scheme and I am sure that the very few remaining will shortly agree.  I wish to pay a tribute to the <Col N="1826" /> good sense and public spirit shown by the councils in this matter.  The Local Improvements Scheme, like its predecessors, is designed to improve the conditions under which the farming community live and work.  These schemes have proved particularly valuable to the smallholders in the West; indeed in the current year the great bulk of the allocations for the three schemes combined went to the West.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in commending the Bill to the House.  I should add that, in order to avoid a break in continuity, it is necessary to have the Bill enacted by 1st April, when the county councils take over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill deals with lanes or secondary roads and small drainage schemes. These two matters affect vitally the enjoyment of life by great numbers of people residing in rural Ireland.  In my opinion, the next greatest necessity to people living in rural Ireland, after housing, is to have a reasonable means of access to their houses.</P>
      <P>There are many people living in what in my constituency are called lanes who find it practically impossible to get, with any degree of comfort, from their houses to the main roads.  I know of many cases where women going to the town, going to church or going anywhere else along the main road, wear wellington boots out as far as the main road, and then leave those wellington boots in a neighbour's house on the main road and put on the type of footwear which they like to wear on the way to where they are going.  They have to do that because it is utterly impossible to walk the lanes without walking in inches of mud and water.  I know how strongly people feel about the fact that they are being treated as second-rate citizens living in these inaccessible places.  They are quite happy to live in these places, because that is their tradition as country people; they do not like living in towns, but they do feel badly about the fact that they cannot walk these lanes with any degree of comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the pedestrians.  People who have to drive motorcars up to these houses, whether they are the <Col N="1827" /> owners of the houses, or whether they are members of the clergy, veterinary surgeons, members of the medical profession, employees of cattle breeding societies, all these people find it very difficult if not impossible to drive in these lanes.  Furthermore, if a farmer buys a tractor and he is living on a lane that is used by himself and three or four other people, a couple of whom may also be using tractors, the lane becomes badly cut up and gets into an indescribable condition; yet because it is shared as a common lane by a number of people, it is the responsibility of nobody in particular. Some of them may want to repair it; others of them may not.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the examples I should like to put before the House.  I think one has to have been brought up in the country to feel strongly about these things.  One has to know country people and to be in close contact with them to know their feelings about the difficulty of travelling along these roads or lanes which serve a number of houses and which are the responsibility of nobody in particular.  I have emphasised the position regarding lanes more than the position regarding drainage, because lanes affect the everyday life of the people who are living there particularly the women and children in the house.  The question of drainage of the small rivers and these local schemes is also very important because lack of drainage is causing the flooding of valuable lands and small holdings.</P>
    <P>If I thought the introduction of this Bill was something new and something that would solve these problems, I would extend a céad míle fáilte to it, and I would deal with it in a matter of minutes and sit down, but unfortunately I am not satisfied that this measure which is nothing new, which really is a passing of the buck of the rural improvement schemes further along the line is a genuine effort to clean up or deal with these crying out grievances.</P>
    <P>Up to a couple of years ago the scheme known as the rural improvement scheme was dealt with by the Minister for Finance through his Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the <Col N="1828" /> Board of Works.  We all know that in August of 1965 the Department, for all practical purposes, discontinued receiving or accepting applications under that scheme.  We were then told that the rural improvement schemes and the other schemes which were operated in conjunction with it&mdash;minor relief schemes and bog road schemes&mdash;were being transferred from the Department of Finance to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>We all hoped that the Minister for Local Government being in closer touch with rural Ireland than the Minister for Finance, there would be a greater appreciation of the difficulties about which I spoke and a more generous approach to the solving of those difficulties.  Far from a speeding up of the works supposed to be covered by this Bill&mdash;the repair of boreens, byroads and lanes, and also drainage&mdash;there was no improvement whatever.  As a matter of fact, things seemed to slow down further.  Last year when any Deputy made representations, he was told that as from 1st April next the scheme was being handed over to the local authorities to be dealt with by them.</P>
    <P>Again, I suppose, we hoped there would be some improvement, and we commenced writing to our local authorities.  So many applications were the local authorities receiving that they stencilled a reply stating that they were receiving a great number of applications which had been allowed to accumulate in the Department of Local Government, and I suppose in the Department of Finance, and that it was not possible for any county council to say when an application sent in now would be dealt with because there was such a heavy list of arrears.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have not much faith in this further transfer of this scheme from the Department of Local Government to the county councils, it having already being transferred from the Department of Finance to the Department of Local Government.  I say that because the scheme is to be operated under sections 3 and 4 by finance supplied by the Department of Local Government with some local contributions. I should like to ask the Minister <Col N="1829" /> is he prepared to be more generous now in 1968-69 than he was in 1967-68 and than the Minister for Finance was in 1966-67 and the previous year.  I do not think he is.  The Minister said that bulk allocations will be made each year to each county council.  My information is that the provisional sum which has been allocated to the Cavan County Council in this year is £14,000. I put this to the Minister by way of a supplementary question within the past week or two and he did not seem to contradict it.  The sum is £14,000 not-withstanding the fact that a sum of £30,000 approximately was spent in the past 12 months.  If this is a measure of the grants to be given to the various local authorities under this Bill, I have not much faith in it.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that this measure seems to be a poor imitation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, which was introduced and operated by the Government at that time and which was discontinued or allowed to dry up by the present Government on their return to power. This is a poor imitation of that measure because the Local Authorities (Works) Act allowed the local authorities to do the type of work covered by this Bill. Provision was made in the Estimates for grants to the local authorities, but irrespective of the grants, they could go ahead and raise money to repair lanes and roads which they did not take in charge, and do drainage for which they were not directly responsible out of money provided by the rates.  There is no such provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is confined in its operation, so far as I can see, to such works as can be carried out under the grant which will come from the Department of Local Government, with the assistance of local contributions.  As I say, for Cavan County Council, the provisional figure is £14,000.  The county council, out of the grant, will have to defrav the cost of the administration of the scheme.  I do not know whether the Minister will contradict me or not but I am told that practically all local authorities say that the suggested figure of 10 per cent of the grant, which the <Col N="1830" /> Minister says is sufficient to operate the scheme, is totally inadequate because the local authorities will have to investigate many more schemes than will eventually be done.  I am told that local authorities are not satisfied that they will be able to administer the scheme within the suggested 10 per cent.  That means that the grant will be eaten into in the payment of expenses.  I am convinced that this Bill is merely an effort to farm out the administration of the Rural Improvements Scheme on local authorities and to relieve the Department of Local Government and the Exchequer in general of the expense of running that scheme.  If the measure of the grant that I have suggested, as applied to County Cavan, is an indication of the type of grant that is being given to the remainder of the country then we would be foolish indeed to be over-optimistic about this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted to me in the House a short time ago that 80 cases which had not been dealt with in his Department were being handed over to Cavan County Council to be dealt with as from the 1st April.  I can tell him that in addition to those 80 something like 40 or 50 others have been received in the county council offices since this scheme was announced.  I can also tell him that, without making any allowance for administration, the £14,000, with a small contribution which the smallholders of Cavan would be entitled to pay, would not deal with more than 20 cases in the next 12 months.  Unless the Minister drastically revises his provision by way of grants it means that even with costs remaining as at present it would take four or five years to clean up the arrears of applications which have accumulated, never mind dealing with current cases.</P>
    <P>In the light of my experience since I became a member of the Oireachtas and particularly in the light of my experience in dealing with constituents in a constituency which is blistered with this type of scourge&mdash;that is all I can call it&mdash;in the last four years I shall have to await the first year of operation of this scheme and in particular I shall have to await the announcement of final grants for the year 1968-69 before I am in a position to say more about <Col N="1831" /> this measure than that I am not very hopeful of it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to take the opportunity to deal with a few problems that have arisen under these rural improvements schemes down the years.  You have five people, say, living in a lane and three or four of them are very anxious to get the lane repaired under a grant and co-operate with each other and with the Department operating the grant because they are progressive and want to make life a little more bearable for themselves and their families, but the other one or two, for some reason or other, whether cussedness or not, or because they do not want to agree with their neighbours or because they do not want to spend the money or because they are awkward people, will not co-operate in any way to get the work done.</P>
    <P>They will not take off a gate even where a gate is unnecessary; they will not allow a few yards of their land to be removed to increase the width of the road or lane or take off a bad turn.  I believe power should be taken in this measure to make it compulsory on a minority to comply with the scheme which is for the benefit of the majority as well as for the benefit of the minority themselves.  The behaviour of such people is unchristian; many of them do it I believe out of badness and they have no higher motives than that they would not satisfy their neighbours or the other people living in the lane by having it cleaned up.  As far as I know at present, unless all the people in the lane sign to comply with the minimum requirements of the Department, whatever they are, the work is not done.  I say that statutory power should be taken here to do it and do it with the minimum of red tape and delay. Adequate protection should, of course, be given so that the rights of these people will not be abused but they should have a very quick and very short appeal to the district court, as was done in the Local Authorities (Works) Act, where compensation was to be assessed and get the matter over and done with.  The next thing I want to deal with is somewhat similar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am coming to the contributory people now.  I have been dealing with the fellow who would not allow the lane to be touched and I now want to deal with the point raised by the Parliamentary Secretary.  This is a contributory scheme and so was the rural improvements scheme which it replaces.  That meant that where six or seven people living in one of these lanes were having it repaired, when the scheme went up to the Department an inspector came down and costed the scheme with regard to the poor law valuation of all the inhabitants of the lane.  He went back and, as a result of his report, a certain small contribution was put on each rated occupier in that lane.  To give fair play where it is due, the contribution was not excessive. We all had the hard case where a person could not pay but by and large the local contribution was reasonable.  The point, however, is that again you had four or five people in the lane who were prepared to pay the contribution but two or three others would not pay.  I regret to have to say it was not always the person who could not pay who did not pay.  If a person did not pay because he could not pay, very often the others would not mind paying up the difference and indeed the Department very often relaxed the general contribution.  But, as I say, in quite a number of cases, people would not pay because they would not satisfy the other people to have the lane done, because they did not want it done themselves or because they were indifferent.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a local contribution levy under the scheme&mdash;and as far as I can see, section 2 provides for a contribution&mdash;it should not be levied in mid-air as it is at present.  It should be levied on the rates of the people living in the lanes in proportion to their valuation, with power to the county council in cases of individual hardship to reduce or limit the contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making that suggestion to the Minister because I know from my experience that the failure of rated <Col N="1833" /> occupiers to pay this contribution has meant in many cases that the work has not gone ahead and the majority are deprived of benefits which would otherwise be conferred upon them.  It is no answer to say: &ldquo;Why do not the people who want to get it done pay up all the contributions?&rdquo;  The answer to that is that very often that is done where a poor person is unable to pay. But, even at the risk of cutting off their nose to spite their face, they will not contribute for somebody who is going to reap as much benefit as they are and who can well afford to pay the contribution.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say at this stage. With those suggestions for its improvement, I am prepared to give the Bill a trial for 12 months.  If at the end of 12 months there has been a speeding up of the clearing up of this scourge in my constituency I will, in common with the rest of the country, be the first to stand up and thank the Minister and congratulate him, if he is still in office.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the Minister for some considerable time in respect of this measure.  The reasons must be quite obvious.  It is a great pity that when the Minister was drawing up proposals designed to deal effectively with the taking in charge of these roads off the beaten track, boreens and bogroads and minor drainage schemes, he did not bring in legislation in a form which would have really effective results.  This is an ill-conceived piece of legislation designed to fob off responsibility from the Board of Works to the local authorities.  It is being done primarily because the rural improvements scheme office as we know it can hardly be said to be operating at all in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various works they usually performed had come to a grinding halt as the result of the inability of the Department of Finance to make available the necessary capital for the purpose of <Col N="1834" /> assisting people to repair roads and do the many other things contained in this measure.  A stage had been reached when we were told that no useful purpose would be served by the reception of any further requests for assistance by way of taking in charge of roads because of the long list of schemes to be dealt with&mdash;schemes which the Employment Schemes Office could not deal with for a number of years to come.  Applicants were told quite definitely that it was futile for them to apply because of the lack of financial accommodation.</P>
    <P>I can well understand therefore that the various schemes administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office were a source of great embarrassment to the Government and that they had to find a quick way out.  The quick way out was to transfer the work carried out by that Office to the county councils.  When the county councils were informed of this transfer of responsibility, it was met with a very cool reception, to say the least. My council was most unwilling to acquiesce in this directive, primarily because it was not being properly funded for the purpose.  The allocation of moneys for this purpose was totally inadequate.  It involved an extra charge on the local authority which they could ill afford to meet.  It is well known that the various schemes to which I refer are schemes which county councils find great difficulty in coping with and down through the years they have relied on State aid for this purpose.  These are schemes which simply could not be carried out from the rates, so to speak, from the council's own revenue.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to pay a tribute to the Special Employment Schemes Office for the great work they achieved in this regard.  They had built up an excellent work force and a very competent engineering section.  It is to their credit that they provided many of our people, especially in isolated rural areas, with such much-needed amenities as decent passageways to their houses or farms, drainage of land and construction of bridges and so on.</P>
    <P>I am sure it came as a great shock to the Office that they were to be disbanded <Col N="1835" /> by the Government and that this new device was being contrived to transfer responsibility to the county councils.  The county councils have said that these extra responsibilities of necessity entail extra costs, and most probably will result in the appointment of at least one additional engineer, the appointment of additional engineers at a time when it is alleged that many of these engineers are becoming more and more redundant because of the inability of county councils to proceed with very many major work schemes, particularly in the sphere of piped water supplies, major schemes of road works and piped water supplies for which money is not being provided by the Government.  It is appreciated that many of our engineering staff have been unemployed for some years past by reason of the stagnation which has taken place in respect of these major schemes.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment last week, I was dealing with the false, slanderous allegations made by Deputy Cluskey here and which were so widely and maliciously publicised. I had not concluded dealing with the first of the two specific cases with which Deputy Cluskey dealt.  I was dealing with the false allegations he made in regard to the housing scheme at Kilbarrack.  The facts which I outlined were briefly that in June, 1962 this firm of builders applied for permission to develop 95 acres at Kilbarrack for private housing.  Permission to carry out this development was refused in August, 1962 by the planning authority, on the ground that the lands in question were required for municipal housing.  The firm of builders in question appealed to the Minister for Local Government on the ground, mainly, that this land had been purchased <Col N="1836" /> over a year previously, that it was intended to provide up to 1,000 low cost houses on the site, that these would be similar to the type of houses that the corporation would provide and that they would cater for the same type of person as the corporation houses would have applied to.</P>
      <P>It was also contended by the private firm of builders that their building proposals were ready to start, whereas it was represented that it would be some years before the corporation would be in a position to commence their operations if permission was not granted.  I told the House that these arguments impressed the Minister at the time and that the appeal was allowed on 7th May, 1963, almost one year after the application for planning permission was made to the corporation, so that a year was lost with that process and that despite the fact that this planning permission had been granted in May, 1963, in July, 1963 the corporation made a compulsory purchase order on these 95 acres and other lands in the area and that this compulsory purchase order further prevented the development of this land which could have gone on.  Obviously the principle had been decided in May, 1963, and for this reason the compulsory purchase order was not confirmed by the Minister for this particular parcel of land, except for a small portion of it in respect of which the compulsory purchase order was confirmed. However, the compulsory purchase order was confirmed in respect of a further 228 acres in the area which was adjoining this particular site.  I also pointed out that the municipal housing on the land in respect of which the compulsory purchase order was confirmed has not started yet but that the development which was held up from 1962, due to all this process, has been in progress now since 1966 and that it is practically certain that the entire 900 houses which it is intended to erect on this site will be finished in this year.</P>

In view of that it seems clear that if the Minister for Local <Col N="1840" /> Government in May, 1963 had not made his decision on this planning appeal and if after that, he had decided to confirm the compulsory purchase order in respect of this land 900 fewer houses would be built at this time.  That would, of course, mean that there would be 900 families without houses who will have them by the end of this year and those would be added to the corporation's waiting list.  It seems clear to me that that is what is annoying Opposition Deputies.  They would like to see the corporation's waiting list even bigger than it is.</P>

      <P>This is clear evidence of the need that is filled by private builders who are represented here by the Opposition as being modern supercriminals. This private housing in the major corporation housing development of Edenmore and Kilbarrack will make a more balanced community, which is the basic aim in the planning of residential areas.  Deputy Cluskey went on further falsely to allege that those houses which are almost all built and occupied have recently been offered to the corporation by private developers. This is not true.  The area affected by this, on the merits or demerits of which I do not intend to comment, is a completely different one as Deputy Cluskey is personally well aware as a member of the local authority but knowing the truth, knowing what he says is false, he decided to make this false allegation and for the same malicious reason the <i>Irish Times</i> decided to publish the falsehood and also decided to suppress the truth when it was made known.</P>

Deputy L'Estrange came in and made a further allegation, which he knows to be false, when he alleged that my predecessor as Minister for Local Government is living in one of those <Col N="1841" /> houses.  That is untrue as Deputy L'Estrange knows.  He knows when he says it that it is untrue and he knows also that he has the newspapers which will report that and which will not report the true facts.  He has made that allegation as part of this campaign, as part of the decision by his Party. Deputy Blaney was living there before those houses started.  He is living more than a mile away from the situation and Deputy L'Estrange knows that, but because of the filthiness of his mind, he made this allegation.</P>

      <P>As I say, this is just a campaign against the Fianna Fáil Party.  Part of Deputy Cluskey's reasons for raising this was to attack individuals outside the House and I know the Opposition are even trying to brand everybody who engages in business in the provision of houses as being essentially evil.  So far as this Government are concerned, we have always shown ourselves to be ready to undertake any task that seems appropriate by public enterprise, but that does not mean that private enterprise has been outlawed as some Deputies would like it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think private builders have an important contribution to make to the solution of the housing problem.  A <Col N="1843" /> considerable proportion of our present housing stock has been provided in this manner.  Even in so far as local authority housing is concerned, I have not found, and neither has any other Minister for Local Government, any way of having local authority houses built except by the employment of building firms.  I appreciate the fact that these people are not in the business for the good of their health.  They make money out of it and they make it whether they are building for local authorities or building for themselves.</P>
    <P>I do say the business of building houses is at least as honourable a way of business as any other I know of. House building provides a great deal of employment.  Employment content is good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know of a number of firms who put a considerable amount of money into research in order to improve standards, reduce costs and increase the rate of production of houses.  I am glad to say the Government have recently decided to make provision for technical assistance in this regard.  Some people have done well in this business because of the manner in which the Government have been able to guide the nation's finances wisely.</P>

I am surprised that Deputies L'Estrange and Belton should even have such nerve <Col N="1844" /> although it is 11 years since.  You cannot deny that quite a substantial number of private builders went into bankruptcy as a result of the economic collapse that indicated the end of the last Coalition Government.  Some people seem to think that was a good thing but the trouble was that in addition to getting rid of builders in comparatively small numbers, they also got rid of the building workers in thousands.</P>

It could not have been done otherwise.  It is to a great extent due to the fact that we have so many people engaged in the private building of houses that we will this year reach the target of 12,000 houses per year which we set ourselves to reach by 1970.</P>

      <P>All Deputy L'Estrange wants to do is delay the debate.  This of course is the interpretation put on &ldquo;freedom of speech&rdquo; by the <i>Irish Times</i>, freedom to spread as many dirty falsehoods as possible and freedom to suppress the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a lot of talk about petrol stations, which is apparently a new dirty word.  At the same time, it so happens that these things are essential for modern methods of transport.  As far as I can see&mdash;I do not know whether this is true or not&mdash;it seems that the majority of cases for permission to erect petrol stations are refused. Certainly a great number of appeals come before the Minister and the majority of appeals are also refused. It seems to me also that some at least are the standard objections, the usual type of objections, that could with a certain amount of force be applied to practically all such applications.  For instance, there is the question of traffic hazard.  Obviously there is an <Col N="1846" /> increase in traffic hazard arising from every new means of access to a traffic artery and a petrol-filling station, of its very nature, involves a higher rate of ingress and egress to the site than most other things, so that obviously there is an increase in traffic hazard attaching to every new petrol station. Similarly, the objection that the establishment of a new petrol station will result in some disfigurement of the area can be applied in nearly every case.  It is really a matter of opinion. Some people apparently are of the opinion that it is not possible to do anything with these things, that they are incapable of being made anything but an eyesore and a blot on the landscape, while other people, including those who submit the applications, think that if they are well designed, they can be made attractive in certain situations.  Obviously the complaint that a petrol station will disfigure the neighbourhood and devalue property is one that can be made in the case of every single application.</P>
    <P>There is one view that a petrol station is completely unacceptable in a residential area, whereas other people would put the case that, so far from being unacceptable in an area where almost every householder has a car, petrol stations are almost an essential amenity there.  One thing is certain, however, and that is, they cannot be done without in modern times. The question is how many of them should there be and I have no way of deciding that.  It is a fact that may arise in some cases that some of the objections to these things may come from people whose business will suffer competition if the particular application is allowed.  There has been something of a campaign lately to establish the position whereby the local planning authority should have the sole say in matters such as this.  Most people will see, if this position were to obtain, that, particularly in some of the smaller local authorities, established business interests might be able to exert undue pressure on decisions in this regard. However, I will have more to say about this later.</P>
    <P>I said that as a result of this debate, I would find it necessary to make it <Col N="1847" /> clear that more Ministers than one have reversed planning decisions made by planning authorities, although the number of such appeals has, of course, only grown to any considerable amount since the passing of the Planning Act. There were appeals before that and other Ministers have dealt with such appeals.  Before I go on to deal with another of the cases mentioned here by Opposition Deputies, I want to produce a case in which something like this happened.  It was a case dealt with, not by my immediate predecessor but by a Minister for Local Government under the Coalition Government.  This is a case which also happens to deal with a square, an application in Kenilworth Square where Dublin Corporation on 5th December, 1956 refused permission for the erection of a filling and servicing station and repair garage on the site of No. 44 Kenilworth Square South, at the junction of Kenilworth Square and Rathgar Avenue.  There was an appeal submitted in this case which involved the site of a house which had been allowed to fall into disrepair in an area in which houses are, in general, reasonably well maintained.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Dillon described the type of activity which allows this to happen as Rachmanism.  At column 1774, Volume 231, of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>We have our own system of Rachmans in this city, but they did not bring in any bands with tin whistles or bugles or drums.  They let the rats come in.  They let the rain come in.  They let the houses sink into such a state of dereliction that they succeeded in getting the corporation eventually to say that the houses were then structurally dangerous, whereupon, they could evict all the people in them.  That was not the end of the story.  Here is where their procedure differs from that of Rachman.  Rachman wanted to reset the houses to unsophisticated immigrant labour, but what our Dublin Rachman wanted to do was to get a big Georgian house declared unfit for human habitation so that he could knock it down and then go to the <Col N="1848" /> corporation planning authority and say: &ldquo;Either you let me sell this site for development as office buildings or you can blooming well go and cut the grass on it yourself because I am going to leave it as a derelict site.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, in this particular case, it was not an office building but a type of development which, as far as I can gather, is looked upon as even more disreputable than an office building.</P>

      <P>No, we will come to Mount Pleasant.  This is Kenilworth Square.  One would never think that a Fine Gael Minister had actually interfered with the integrity of a square, but this is what happened.  Apparently Deputy Dillon believes that this type of activity is rife here and he blames this Government for instituting it, but in view of the fact that this particular incident I am dealing with occurred under Deputy P. O'Donnell, it might be more accurate to say that it was instituted by the Coalition Government. In fact, that may have been even before Rachman himself.  Maybe it was from Deputy P. O'Donnell he got his idea.</P>

In that petition the residents also voiced very strong objection to any permission being given to the opening of any filling station, garage, repair shop, etc., in the vicinity because the area was purely residential in character and any such usage would affect the amenities of their houses and of the area.  I should, I think, read the <Col N="1850" /> petition for the benefit of Deputy L'Estrange:</P>
      <P>We, the undersigned residents of Rathgar Avenue (North) protest emphatically against the utilisation of the private garage at the rere of 42 Kenilworth Square as a public garage and repair shop.  This garage, which opens on to the east side of Rathgar Avenue, is situated less than 10 yards from the junction with Kenilworth Square (which is on the 47 Bus route).  The road in the vicinity is only about 30 feet wide, and the garage in question is situated at a bend in the road.</P>
      <P>We would point out that within the past year the Dublin Corporation has notified us that under the Town Plan several feet of our respective front gardens on the west side of the Avenue may be taken for the purpose of widening this road.</P>
      <P>Since this workshop garage was opened cars and lorries are parked along the east side of the Avenue at this point almost constantly all day and to a late hour at night.</P>
      <P>When private cars are stopped in the vicinity, even for a few minutes, a most dangerous bottleneck is created.</P>
      <P>Fast traffic on this Avenue has increased, possibly four-fold during the past few years, and we greatly fear that a serious accident will occur. In our opinion these circumstances constitute a very serious danger to residents, to children and elderly people, and to the public generally.</P>
      <P>We would also strongly object to permission being given in the future for the opening of any shop, workshop, filling station, garage or other business undertaking along the eastern side of Rathgar Avenue, between Garville Avenue and the northern end of Rathgar Avenue.</P>
      <P>We object to this on the above grounds, but particularly because this is a purely residential area and any such uses of these premises would adversely affect the valuation of our houses, and the amenities of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is ample shopping and <Col N="1851" /> garage accommodation at both ends of Rathgar Avenue.</P>
    <P>This was signed by a number of residents.  Now, this site was described as being located in a pleasant, mellow residential area and the proposed structure was regarded as being highly discordant and one which would constitute an injury to amenity in this particular location.  There were plenty of facilities of the type proposed in the neighbourhood, as was confirmed by the petition from the residents, and, as I say, the local authority rejected the application on these grounds.</P>
    <P>On 17th December, 1956, the secretary of the committee of the Kenilworth Square Residents Association wrote to the Department protesting against the proposed development and suggesting that the Minister might receive a deputation.  Without any deputation being received, permission was granted on 15th January, 1957. The order was made by the Minister on 1st February, 1957.  The peculiar thing was that, as soon as the Minister's decision became known, the residents protested and asked that it should be reversed; they were informed that the decision was final and could not be reversed.  Although there was this local opposition to this proposal, the really odd feature is that there was no newspaper publicity about it until detailed plans were lodged.  As Deputies will appreciate, that was naturally some time afterwards and, as Deputies may remember, a change of Government had occurred in the meantime.  As soon as the detailed plans were lodged, the principle of the matter having been decided by Deputy P. O'Donnell, we had publicity; we had publicity when it became possible to represent this as having been done by the Fianna Fáil Government.  There was an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 9th January, 1960, with the captions: &ldquo;Mystery of Rathgar Site for Garage.  Residents again up in arms.&rdquo;  That was an effort at trying to pin this on to the Fianna Fáil Government, whereas, in actual fact, the decision was made by Deputy P. O'Donnell.</P>

      <P>I come now to the second instance which I dealt with on my Estimate, that is, the granting of planning permission in respect of a proposal for a petrol station at Mount Pleasant Square.  I dealt with it already and I do not think there is any great need to deal with it at length again.</P>
      <P>However, I must point out, first of all, that this is a privately-owned open space, that it is not and never has been available for the use and enjoyment of the public.  It is owned by a local tennis club, privately.  They have their own tennis courts and a pavilion which has been partly destroyed by fire which it was alleged was started by vandals. The area is surrounded by trees and bushes.  It is fenced by means of iron railings which are further reinforced in part by a wooden fence, apparently for the purpose of preventing people from looking in.  The houses surrounding it appear to be let out mainly in flats.  I agree, I have already said so, that it provides a certain amount of amenity for the people who have not got access to it but that aspect of the amenity has been exaggerated greatly.  It also provides a fairly substantial amenity for the people who own it, the local tennis club, and apparently it also provides an amenity for people who have garbage to dump there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The owners of this <Col N="1854" /> site pointed out that they had received notice from the sanitary authority to abate the nuisance caused by the dumping of rubbish over the railings. They maintained they found it impossible to erect adequate defences against this and against vandalism and they pointed to the fact that there was currently a claim against the local authority in the amount of £400 in respect of damage to the pavilion.  They claimed also that they were not able to provide the amenities required by their members, that they had tried by every means to raise money and that the disposal of part of the property for a commercial purpose was the only manner in which they could develop this area in the way they required to develop it.</P>
      <P>I agree there will be some loss of public amenity due to the fact that the total amount of open space there will be reduced, but it is not correct to imply, as has been implied here, that the whole of the area will be occupied by this development.  It will be only a small portion.  There will be some reduction of amenity but it will be comparatively small and it will be partly compensated for by the removal of an existing hoarding which can hardly be said to be a visual amenity of any great value in the area.  The removal of that will compensate partly for the loss of a comparatively small portion of the open space.</P>
      <P>As against that there will be a gain in practical amenity for the owners and the members of the club.  This matter has been used as part of a smear campaign but personally I am satisfied, taking everything into account, that there will be an overall improvement in total amenity in respect of this open space.  The conditions attached to the granting of permission were that detailed plans should be submitted for approval and should include a revised layout, which should indicate any advertisement or advertising structure to be erected in the development.  The conditions also provided for the removal of the existing advertisement structure on the frontage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be better if I did it all at the one time.  Deputy L'Estrange has been making these allegations and perhaps, therefore, it would be appropriate to deal with the question of another petrol station, another of those iniquitous things dealt with by Deputy P. O'Donnell when he was Minister for Local Government.  I refer to a filling station at the junction of Leinster Road West and Harold's Cross Road&mdash;an appeal in which Deputy P. O'Donnell was so undemocratic as to turn down the decision that had been made by the planning authority.  Dublin Corporation had refused permission for the building of a filling station on that site on 8th December, 1954.  The reasons given were that the site was in advance of the building line along the frontage of Harold's Cross Road and that increased congestion and traffic danger would be created due to the location of the site at a road junction.  The planning officer's report was fairly strong.</P>
      <P>Approval was refused by the planning authority to the proposal for a filling station at the junction of Leinster Road West and Harold's Cross Road, Dublin. The planning authority observed that Harold's Cross Road carries an increasing volume of arterial traffic and at this point congestion is not uncommon due to the parking of vehicles in the vicinity of shops along the west side of the road and the church and cinema nearby.  Traffic hazards are further aggravated by the unsatisfactory approach to the four existing petrol pumps at Doherty's Garage directly opposite this site.  These pumps are sited on the back of the footpath at the entrance to the service garage which is on a shopping frontage.  The proposal involves the erection of an office, store and petrol pumps beyond the building line of the three houses, 225. 227 and 229 Harold's Cross Road.  The site is opposite an existing garage and is in close proximity to the Holy Rosary Church and to a parochial hall.  The proposal is very objectionable from a traffic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this was rejected by the planning authority but permission was <Col N="1857" /> granted by the Minister and an order was made on 5th July, 1955, granting the permission.  I do not think the person concerned was a member of Taca. I do know he was a person in practically continuous contact with the then Minister for Local Government whom he met every second day.  Of course, I am sure he never mentioned the fact that he had a planning appeal in respect of this place before the Minister. I am sure the Minister would not listen to such a suggestion if he made it.  As I said, we have Deputy P. O'Donnell's statement that when he was Minister for Local Government, he never considered these matters himself, that he just put his name where he was told to sign it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If you believe that statement, how can you blame him for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that if we had the same type of mind as Deputy L'Estrange and his colleagues, and Deputy Cluskey, we could actually make the insinuation that the permission was granted by the Minister by reason of the close personal association between Deputy P. O'Donnell, the then Minister for Local Government, and the particular applicant in this case so that the planning authority's decision was reversed.  However, I am sure this was purely a coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it wrong, in that particular case, to give permission? The Minister did not give us his opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I did.  However, I shall tell you now.  I think I have already mentioned that the planning officer's report was to the effect that the site consisted of part of the garden attached to an existing house which was one of a group of new houses that front on Harold's Cross Road and Leinster Road West.  It pointed out that, directly opposite the junction, is Doherty's Garage which also operates petrol pumps.  It continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No &ldquo;pull in&rdquo; is provided so the servicing of vehicles must take place <Col N="1858" /> on the carriageway.  The business done by this garage seems greater than the premises can accommodate and so, vehicles are parked not only on Harold's Cross Road but also on Leinster Road West.  Having regard to these circumstances, I would consider that the traffic objection is well founded.  An extra filling station in this congested location and obtruding on the heavy Harold's Cross Road traffic would definitely be objectionable.</P>

They will become very familiar with that particular one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is one to which I shall refer.  This was a case, again, of intrusion on an open residential amenity.  In my opinion, the residents of the adjoining houses would have an objection&mdash;this being built in the garden of a house next door. Deputy P. O'Donnell decided to allow this.  He says he did not decide it.  He says he just put his name where he was told to put it.</P>

In this Bill, there is an attempt to maintain that every such reversal of the decision of the planning authority by this Government is the result of corruption whereas Deputy P. O'Donnell did it just because the Secretary gave him <Col N="1859" /> 100 appeals a day and told him where to sign his name.  However, in the case of Fianna Fáil Ministers, every single one of these is alleged to be the result of corruption, according to Deputy Corish's Party and Deputy Cosgrave's Party.</P>

      <P>With great respect to the present Minister and to all Ministers for Local Government, they cannot possibly deal with each appeal individually. On at least one day of the week there is a file of appeals handed to the Minister with the recommendation of the Department's Inspector on them and the Minister, unless he has some reason or other to examine each individual file, merely signs what an individual has put before him.</P>
      <P>So he did read the recommendation put before him where he had a particular reason for so doing.  It may be, then, as Deputy L'Estrange says, that, in fact, he made this decision himself.

      <P>In view of the opinion of Fine Gael now that the decision of these cases should be handed over to a board or boards presided over by a judge, and presumably subsidiary boards also presided over by a judge, it might be considered remarkable that Deputy P. O'Donnell, particularly when he knew that he was deciding cases without knowing anything about <Col N="1861" /> them, did not suggest at that time that these cases would be better dealt with by such a board&mdash;a judge with two technically qualified assessors with subsidiary boards, and the staff that all that implies.</P>

      <P>In the Official Report, of 26th November, 1958, Volume 171, column 1028, Deputy J.A. Costello had not a great opinion of a board presided over by a judge.  He said:</P>
      <P>...what I object to is the fantasy, the hyprocrisy, if I may say so again without offence, of trying to put it across the people that because the President is going to appoint a judge, therefore, this is an impartial tribunal which will advise on all the matters I have referred to and secure public confidence in its integrity and impartiality.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>Let me recall to Deputies that when the North were gerrymandering their constituencies, they put a judicial personage there to give an air of verisimilitude to an otherwise very unconvincing body.</P>
      <P>At column 1030 he described the person taking up the post as:</P>
      <P>...a tool of the Government in power, who is what the late Kevin O'Higgins would have called a legal careerist, who got his job on the bench because he was the lickspittle of a political Party.</P>
      <P>Do they want to remove this from the possibility of being affected by politics by the appointment of a board presided over by a person who, according to them, would be the lickspittle of a political Party?</P>

An oral hearing of the appeal was held on the site itself.  This was held on 22nd September, 1967.  I am satisfied that at this appeal it was established that from its location the house would be completely hidden from the coast road but that it would be visible from the access road which is the main access to the adjoining beach and I am of the opinion that a properly designed house could be allowed on this location without doing violence to the objectives of the planning authority.  Accordingly, <Col N="1864" /> the appeal was allowed subject to the conditions that the building to be designed would be constructed and faced with material in harmony with its surroundings, faced with natural stone, that the roof would be of low pitch construction and finished with material suitable to the weather conditions and the landscape.  The reason for that was to preserve the character of the landscape.  As far as I can gather, the detailed proposals for this have not as yet been lodged.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government, Mr. Boland, has given permission to Mr. Elfried Preger, a German, to build a holiday home on the site in the foreground, overlooking Dog's Bay in Connemara.

There was a public meeting held which was organised by the Fine Gael councillor for the area to protest against granting permission to put this small bungalow in a position where it could not be seen from the coast road, and knowing the stout manner in which local residents in cases like this attack anything that will intrude in any way upon the natural beauty of the landscape, I can well imagine the righteous indignation that prevailed at that meeting, but at the conclusion of the meeting a rather peculiar thing happened&mdash;at least I would consider it peculiar&mdash;that is, that the meeting apparently unanimously adopted a resolution requesting the planning authority to grant permission for a caravan park.  Of course, a caravan park is a thing of beauty that would add to the beauty of the landscape, whereas a small suitably designed bungalow would detract from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate I was commenting on the opportunity which the Minister missed in not providing effective legislation which would be particularly beneficial to those thousands of persons who reside in isolated rural areas and who are, as yet, denied the ordinary amenities of life such as proper roadways, sanitary services, drainage and <Col N="1869" /> the like.  The Minister decided to transfer very many of the functions carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office and the Rural Improvement Schemes Office in respect of the administration of bog development, minor employment schemes, and rural improvement schemes generally to our county councils.  That would be all right in itself, perhaps, if the Minister had made adequate provision for financing these schemes.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that many of our county councils were most reluctant to accept this new responsibility imposed upon them without making proper provision for the money required.  The Minister ought to have regard to the desirability of bringing back into effective operation the Local Authorities (Works) Act which, to my mind, catered pretty effectively for those rural problems of roads, sewerage, the erection and maintenance of bridges, the drainage of bogs, rivers, and the like.  That scheme is still in operation but the Government abandoned the provision of grants for this purpose and negatived the effectiveness of the Act by withdrawing the grants.  Very few county councils or local authorities have been able to carry out any worthwhile works under that Act ever since.</P>
      <P>Many reasons were given for the abandonment of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was suggested that money was squandered or that there was no proper supervision or maintenance. That is a very serious and unfair indictment, in my opinion, of the people responsible for the administration of schemes under that Act: the engineers, the overseers, the gangers, the men who carried out the work, and indeed the county managers concerned. To infer that works were not carried out properly or that they were carried out in a haphazard and unsatisfactory way, that there was mismanagement or misappropriation of money, is surely a very serious indictment of the officers responsible in the counties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had hoped that the Government would have a new look at the problem of providing better amenities for the people in the rural areas who are <Col N="1870" /> denied these amenities of life and who are, at the same time, expected to pay their portion of the rates for the county.  They are expected to pay pro rata with their colleagues in the towns who enjoy the modern amenities of piped water, sanitary services, lighting, good roads, footpaths and the like.  The people with whom I am now concerned are denied all those things.  They live very much in isolation. They live on mountain sides, miles up boreens, adjacent to bogs, off the beaten track, condemned to interminable isolation, with no regard for access to piped water, sanitary services and so on.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of flooding and the hardship on families who have to traverse many miles to get to the main roads, to get to schools, churches and shopping centres.  One could paint a very sad picture of life in isolation of that kind, especially in inclement weather, and of the hardship which so many thousands of rural Irish families suffer as a result of their environment: their inability to get to their places of employment, or to the social services, without having to endure very great hardship in the process because of bad roads, and so on.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities are aware that despite the best endeavours of our councils, we have been unable to do things for these people out of our own revenue.  The rising spiral of rates would not justify the added expenditure involved in doing all the things we would like to do for those people.  Consequently an obligation devolves on the State to enter into this and to provide these amenities in a more tangible form by way of more generous grants, help and advice.</P>
    <P>The Minister is deciding that these schemes should be transferred from the Office of Public Works to his Department, and then that they should be further transferred from the Special Employments Schemes Office and the Rural Improvements Schemes Office to the county councils, had a unique opportunity to provide legislation which would have due regard to the hardship I have sought to outline which is the lot of thousands of rural dwellers, and to provide positive help <Col N="1871" /> so that this task could be effectively grappled with so that within a reasonable time we would be able to provide these people with decent roadways and eliminate flooding hazards and all the other things which the rural improvements schemes section was set up to implement.</P>
    <P>Instead of giving us an effective measure which would bring amelioration to these people, the Minister has shirked his responsibility by merely passing the buck to the county councils.  It was obviously the cheap way out to pass on this responsibility to the county councils, and he has not made proper provision for the expenditure which all this work will involve. As I said earlier, I believe that the county councils cannot be expected to carry this extra burden of responsibility to provide bog development and minor schemes of various kinds&mdash; the improvement of bridges and the erection of new bridges and the like&mdash; without extra staff.  It is envisaged that this will require the employment of extra engineers, extra overseers, gangers and so on.  The ten per cent grant which the Minister offers is, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the local authorities with whom I am conversant, totally inadequate.  The Minister has found an easy way out of what was obviously an embarrassment to him in recent months.</P>
    <P>I indicated briefly and I reiterate without fear of contradiction that the rural improvements schemes section and the special employment schemes section had largely become ineffective in recent times, that they could not possibly cope with the volume of work imposed on them because of the reluctance of the Department to make the necessary capital available; that they had advised people, farmers, cottiers and rural dwellers generally, not to come to them seeking help and advice with a view to getting a grant for a roadway or the like because there was a colossal amount of arrears of work to be carried out, because there was no money there and it would take years for these arrears to be made up.  Work under local employment and rural improvements schemes came virtually to a halt and the Government were <Col N="1872" /> obliged to find some way of dealing with the problem.  They have now passed responsibility over to the county councils.  I am pleased to hear that county councils in the main have accepted this responsibility.  What else could they do?  They had no alternative. It was Hobson's choice.  The Employments Schemes Office and the rural improvements section as we know them were dissolved, abandoned, and if the local authority did not carry out the work, it would not be done.  One can well understand the hardship that would be involved in the case of these rural dwellers to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what will become of the very important staffs which were attached to the Special Employments Schemes and Rural Improvements Schemes Offices in various centres, the engineers, gangers, overseers and workers generally.  It is suggested in the Minister's statements that gangers and overseers should be given priority by the county councils in employing staffs on this work in future.  It is true that quite a substantial number of overseers and gangers who carried out this work for the Special Employment Schemes Office were in fact county council employees and there will not be much of a problem there, but in respect of the amount of redundancy involved, I should like the Minister to say what the intention is in relation, for instance, to the engineers concerned in the administration of these schemes, now that their work is being transferred to the county councils.</P>
    <P>It was explained categorically in the Minister's speech that the councils would not be responsible for the maintenance of these schemes.  I should like the Minister to clarify that because it seems to us that unless we provide for the adequate maintenance of these essential schemes, such as roadmaking, drainage and so on, the money could be said to be very largely wasted.  If the county councils are not being charged with responsibility for maintenance, who is?  Or is it seriously suggested that we merely provide a roadway, carry out a work scheme and abandon it after that?</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is still <Col N="1873" /> holding fast to the idea that local people must subscribe to these rural improvement schemes.  I had thought that with the diminishing number of these people, the time had come when they should be provided with roadways, drainage and all the things mentioned without being asked to pay this special charge.  They are ratepayers. They pay for these amenities for their fellow county men at large; especially in the urban areas, they pay for sewerage, lighting, roads, footpaths and so on and it is a bit much to expect them to make such contributions. It could be a hardship on a cottier.  It is especially hard on the very poor, the widow, the old aged person, the unemployed or the sick person&mdash;and there are many such.  We also know that it is very difficult in rural areas to secure agreement between the residents of a road in respect of a proposition like this to have a new road provided even on the assumption that the county council would take it in charge forever, when repaired by means of a grant, and maintain it.  Differences of opinion arise.  First, there are differences in the social status of the families concerned, differences in income.  You have the large farmer and the small farmer, the working-class cottier, the widow living alone, the old age pensioner, the unemployed householder and so on.  It is difficult to get agreement on a proposal like this.  It is difficult to apportion cost over the various categories of families involved.  Also, you have the problem of the cantankerous family or individual who will not co-operate but will opt out just to be difficult and thereby deprive his neighbours of much desired amenities.  I know of many schemes which are abandoned, despite the desires of most of those concerned, because of inability to secure agreement among all those involved.</P>
    <P>I thought this measure would provide an opportunity, if the State was coming to the aid of local authorities, to eliminate this primitive method of apportioning the cost among the people residing on the road concerned.  That method has been very largely abandoned <Col N="1874" /> for a long time under the policy of most county councils who operate their own policy as regards taking charge of roadways.  Minimum standards are laid down but provided a sufficient number use the road, whether residents or users for the purpose of access to their lands or property, and provided the roadway can be classed as a roadway or passageway of general utility, the county council is empowered to take it in charge without apportioning any financial obligation on the residents.  Merely by putting down a notice of motion at a council meeting, it is taken in charge and properly maintained by the council ever afterwards.  This is only right and fair and equitable in the case of people who are paying their rates and paying for all these modern amenities for their neighbours generally.  These amenities have been denied to them for a long number of years and constitute a great hardship on them in their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>Such hardship can be caused by the recurring problem of the flooding of lands, land which could be good arable land providing an asset to the community and the nation at large.  Not only is hardship involved but grave financial loss as well.  They also have to endure, perhaps, the hardship of traversing miles of rugged, slushy roadway&mdash;it is a particular hardship for little children&mdash;or may have to suffer the damage done to cars on rocky passageways riddled with potholes.  In all our counties there are roadways of this kind.  One can find better roadways on top of mountains than in some of our more important counties.  We have not been able to get around to the adequate repair and maintenance of such roads.</P>
    <P>It is to be greatly deplored that in this measure the Government have failed to give us modern legislation which would have regard to all these rural problems and have regard in the first instance to the inability of our county councils to grapple with them. Most of our county councils have been unable to do anything at all in respect of the cleaning and drainage of rivers and the elimination of the flooding of large areas of good land.  We have been <Col N="1875" /> interminably awaiting the implementation of the arterial drainage schemes. The scheme for my county is scheduled to commence in 1970.  In the meantime, the river Suir and its tributaries have not been looked at, not to mention work being done on them, by our council engineers, nor have we been able to carry out any drainage or cleaning whatever on the Suir or its tributaries because of the colossal cost involved which could not be imposed on the rates at present.</P>
    <P>This was the kind of work carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;remedial measures for dealing with acute flooding and rivers cluttered up with all kinds of foreign bodies which could be said to be a hazard to health in given areas.  Even in these extreme circumstances county councils have been unable to deal effectively with the problem and, pending the implementation of the arterial drainage schemes, they are completely helpless to ease the burden of rural dwellers in respect of what they have to endure at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to take these functions from the special employments schemes section and the rural improvements schemes section and merely transfer them to our county councils on a grant basis, which everyone knows is inadequate, was an insult to the intelligence of the rural dwellers.  I assert that this Bill does nothing whatever to bring relief to the countless thousands of rural dwellers in my own county of Tipperary and in County Waterford, a large part of which is in my constituency, and does nothing to bring nearer the taking in charge of the roads they have to traverse in mud and slush, day in, day out, in winter and summer. It does nothing whatever to ease their fear of constant and recurring flooding. It does nothing to make possible the provision of much needed bridges or drainage of any kind.  This measure holds out no hope to these people.  The Minister and the Government have failed to grasp the situation and to provide effective legislation to aid the efforts of our county councils who are only too anxious to deal with these rural problems.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of <Col N="1876" /> county councils&mdash;I happen to have the honour of being the chairman of my council in South Tipperary&mdash;have constantly coming before us deputations of rural dwellers, especially farmers, cottiers and householders, pleading with us to provide them with a decent passageway into their homes or farms, pointing out to us the colossal hardship, damage and financial loss sustained through constant flooding, calling on us to provide bridges, gullies and the like.  In the main, my council, despite its best intentions, is unable to do all these things because of lack of finance.  Only yesterday we had a strong plea from the members for the Fethard area that a grant be provided for the cleaning of the Clashawley River at Fethard town.  This river is cluttered up with timber, silt and sewage.  It is unsightly and a hazard to health in the town of Fethard.  The local development association were prepared to make available approximately £300 towards this project.  Again, the council were unable to meet the request of these very enterprising citizens of Fethard town.  Pending the implementation of arterial drainage there do not seem to be any remedial measures we can take to grapple effectively with the problems of these rural dwellers.</P>
    <P>It is with a sense of regret that we say to the Minister for Local Government that he has failed to avail of a unique opportunity of providing positive help in tangible form, that is, by way of adequate grant to local authorities to carry out all these functions he now asks them to perform and which heretofore were carried by the rural improvements schemes office.  Perhaps it is not too late to appeal to the Minister to have another look at this measure, to provide more realistic financial aid for this purpose. Certainly, Sir, it is no wonder that so many local authorities proved so unwilling to co-operate with the Minister in respect of this measure because clearly it is purely a buck-passing piece of legislation, conceived in haste, rushed through in a state of embarrassment by reason of the collapse of the rural improvements schemes section in recent years. It is no wonder that there has been no <Col N="1877" /> enthusiasm whatsoever for this measure in the country.  When one has regard to the effectiveness of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, when one looks back on the important benefit which this scheme provided for rural dwellers, one has to greatly deplore this puerile effort by the Minister of merely transferring responsibility to county councils without taking adequate steps to ensure that the necessary moneys are provided.</P>
    <P>I have said that it means extra staff, extra expenses.  Public officials in our councils are on record as saying that this is the case, that they simply cannot administer these various schemes with their existing staffs and that it does involve extra moneys.  It may well require the appointment of an extra engineer, clerks, overseers, labourers, tradesmen and the like and a ten per cent grant to meet this additional cost is totally inadequate.  With these sentiments we would hope that the Minister would reconsider this proposal and give to us in a more tangible form, a more effective measure which would bring speedy relief to those sections of our rural dwellers for whom I think it is intended.</P>
    <P>I would like to know precisely what will happen in regard to the redundant staffs attached to the Board of Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office; where the engineering section will be absorbed and the various clerical staffs that went with it and where too the overseers, gangers and the like are likely to find employment.  I know it is suggested that county councils might give first preference to those categories of workers but I also know that in certain instances, perhaps in many instances, the labouring personnel involved in these schemes were, in fact, employees of the local county council.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, Sir, that I cannot be more enthusiastic about a measure of this kind.  It has been critically examined by my council.  My colleagues on the county council represent all shades of political opinion.  The Government Party are very well represented on South Tipperary County Council.  Irrespective of political opinion, having looked at this measure <Col N="1878" /> impartially and without political bias of any kind and without any attempt to make political capital out of the measure, we were unanimous as a council, and so were our advisers from the manager and county engineer down, that this was not a good measure, that there were little or no benefits in it for our council or the people we represent.  For some months my council indicated that it was unable and unwilling to co-operate in a scheme which had so little to recommend it and which did not provide for the essential amounts of money required for its proper administration. It was only with great reluctance and in the clear knowledge that if we as a council did not carry out the responsibility contained in this transfer which has brought about the disbandment of the rural improvements schemes section that no one would carry out the work, it was in these circumstances, under duress and having little choice in the matter that my council have taken on these responsibilities but we would much prefer if we had the facilities of the Local Authorities (Works) Act which conferred on us the same powers but provided a reasonable amount of money to carry out the job.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the importance of good by-roads to serve our rural community, of the importance of the development of bog roads and also of the value to the rural community of carrying out small drainage schemes to serve a few holdings as a result of which land could be improved afterwards.  At the outset, I should like to pay tribute to the Special Employments Schemes Office for the amount of good work which they did in Kerry over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that we got reasonably good grants in Kerry from the Special Employments Schemes Office over the past few years and their workers did an excellent job on the works which they undertook and carried out.  Despite this, however, there are still many miles of by-roads which are in a terrible condition. <Col N="1879" /> I would say that there is probably more mileage of these roads in County Kerry than in any other county.  They are also there due to the fact that the county council for many reasons&mdash;some of which I shall refer to later&mdash;could not take over these roads and declared them public roads. The primary reason was that they were not up to the standard to be taken over and it would cost too much to bring them up to a proper state of repair before they could be further improved and tarred.  I feel that a very good case can be made for transferring these schemes from the Special Employments Schemes Office to the county councils.  Surely nobody could fix priorities better on these schemes than the local councillors or elected representatives? Surely when the engineers' reports are finally submitted, nobody can say with more authority what schemes should get priority than the local council?</P>
      <P>As those schemes have been operated to date, it appears, to me that there are no real priorities, that applications are probably taken in accordance with the way they are received and that it has happened that roads which serve only four or five households have been improved and repaired years before roads which served 20 to 22 households. I can see a complete change now when those schemes are taken over by the county councils.  I can see priority given to the roads which serve the most landowners and householders. I can also see money which has been spent up to now on the development of bog roads being transferred to other areas, particularly in counties in which you have not as much turf cut and harvested as previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the request which the Minister sent to the council to give priority on the new schemes to the gangers and the supervisory officials who were formerly employed on such work.  I also welcome the proposal that the priority in the improvement schemes will be given to suitable unemployed men registered in the unemployment exchanges as was the system previously under the Special Employments Schemes Office.  In that way we can feel satisfied that the men <Col N="1880" /> who have been employed on those schemes down the years and who have given good service and have obtained a certain amount of experience in this specialised line will still be available and will still be employed to carry out those schemes for the coming years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give special consideration to hauliers and contractors for the supply of gravel and material for the roads which are improved by the Special Employments Schemes Office.  It now appears to me that some of those hauliers and contractors who established pretty good business by supplying the material may find themselves having to look for alternative markets for their produce. Unless special consideration is given to their claim for priority, unless the Minister contacts the county council and asks them to give special consideration to their cases the local councils may use their own materials produced in their own quarries for their own roads.  It may, therefore, be very difficult for the people who are employed as contractors down the years to secure an alternative market for their produce.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether the selection of the scheme and the fixing of priorities will be an executive function of the county council.  It is very important that this matter should be clarified.  Personally, I consider it should be a reserved function of the county councils and that the members of the councils should fix the priorities and decide the order in which the roads are to be repaired and improved.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one aspect of those schemes which has caused much concern in quite a few areas in Kerry&mdash;the fact that one man or one landowner can hold up a worthwhile scheme by reason of the fact that he does not consent to the scheme, that he refuses to contribute and that he ensures that the scheme will not be carried out.  I know one road which serves 22 landowners and on a number of occasions the county council were approached to take over this road but due to the fact that one landowner in the very centre of this strip of road refused to agree to have this road taken over and refused to take off a gate which opened on to <Col N="1881" /> the road, down the years the county council fought shy of the proposal.</P>
    <P>I also know that applications were made on several occasions to the Special Employments Schemes Office for a grant.  The road was repaired and improved at both ends and at various points on the road but at no time was it possible to carry out a proper scheme over the whole of this road by reason of the fact that this particular landowner would not agree, would not consent and would not pay a contribution. If there is no legislation at present to deal with such a case it should be introduced as quickly as possible.  I would suggest that the Minister should give serious consideration to making such a provision in this Bill.  It is an awful state of affairs if one man can prevent 21 of his neighbours from improving their road which would benefit himself as well.  I feel the very same method could be employed by such landowners in regard to the present scheme as those taken over by the county councils.</P>
    <P>If a county council passed a resolution in regard to taking over special roads and agreed to accept liability for the maintenance of such roads and if someone objected, what are the powers and the functions of the county council in such cases?  It may be that there is legislation somewhere to cover this matter but most councils seem to be in the dark in the matter.  I would strongly recommend that the Minister would urge the councils to ensure that those schemes are carried out, in strict priority, having regard to the number of landowners and householders served by each road and also ensure that the roads which carry the heaviest traffic, which serve the largest number of landowners, are repaired and improved first.  I would strongly urge the Minister, when allocating the grants for those schemes to the councils for the coming year, to give special consideration to the western and south-western counties.  We probably have more miles of schemes on by-roads than other counties.  In channelling increased grants into these counties, a certain amount of extra employment is given at the time of year when it is <Col N="1882" /> most required, particularly in the period October to April.  The money would be very well spent in the provision of better roads to carry everincreasing traffic.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the expenditure on these schemes would be offset to a great extent by a reduction in the expenditure on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  I have no doubt that there would be a substantial saving in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit in the areas where these schemes could be vigorously undertaken, particularly during the winter months.  I cannot see any reason why the county councils should not snap at the opportunity of taking these schemes away from the Special Employments Schemes Office and other central authorities. Surely they should be delighted to have a say in the carrying out of these schemes and the fixing of priorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of staff for the operation of the schemes, I think it should not be necessary for the county council to employ an extra engineer.  I cannot see why the local county assistant engineers cannot submit a report and recommendation on the applications.  In my opinion, one clerical officer in each council could deal with the administrative side of the schemes.  The administrative costs should be low, far lower than at present and than up to now when these schemes were carried out by the Special Employments Schemes Office and controlled from a long distance.</P>
    <P>It would be an easy matter for the local assistant county engineers to supervise the works because they are travelling the roads and they could supervise the works on the roads in the performance of their normal daily duties.  In that way you would not have any extra expenditure involved in the operation of these schemes.  The fact that these schemes are handed over to the local councils should show a big improvement in the mileage repair every year.  In addition, I think more money will go into the provision of materials and the payment of wages than heretofore and less money will be needed for administrative costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> I am also glad to note that it is intended that the county councils will in future act for Roinn na Gaeltachta and for accommodation roads in the Gaeltacht and that the Department of Transport and Power will act in respect of grants for roads and the drainage of bog roads used in the production of turf, that is, hand-won turf in Donegal, Galway, Clare and Kerry.  This should save a certain amount of duplication of work as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly like to pay tribute to the staff who operate these schemes in the Special Employments Schemes Office.  Whether they operate under the Department of Finance or under the Department of Local Government, I feel it only right that we on this side of the House should pay tribute to them.  Whether it be the director of the Schemes Office or any of the people employed there, supervisors, field men, gangers, or any others, I should like it put on the record that we pay them a compliment for the good job they did with the limited amount of money available to them over the past few years.</P>
      <P>This scheme has got some shifting about for the past two years.  Up to two years, or 18 months ago, it was under the Department of Finance.  It then shifted to the Department of Local Government and now the Minister, in his wisdom, has decided to shift it to the county councils.  One can only look at and think of it as the Government taking the part of a particularly bad draughts player, making his moves without giving them any thought or without any attention to the other player.  The intention here is to limit the amount of money available for these schemes.  We all know that up to four years ago, there was, if any, little by way of waiting list in the Special Employment Schemes Office but the number of applications have poured in and there was no work being done.  The number of applications have accumulated and they have now found themselves behindhand in every county council in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a double-fold scheme.  It dealt with drainage, on the one hand, and with roads, on the other.  Some <Col N="1884" /> drainage up to a few years ago was dealt with under the LAW schemes. This scheme at that time was withdrawn by the Government, and the reason given was that the money was being squandered and badly spent. That clearly indicated that the county council concerned was not spending the money in the way the Government would like them to spend it.  Now when we come to switch this scheme, we are switching it over to the people who, the Government said a few years ago, were not capable of carrying out the LAW schemes.  I wonder what has convinced this Minister for Local Government, more than his predecessor, that the local authorities have now become capable of dealing with the expenditure of money.  I should like the Minister to refer to this.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have a question of drainage.  I represent a constituency in which no arterial drainage work has been done.  We very often hear talk about the Suck.  It is not necessary for me to talk about the Shannon or the Boyle rivers.  The politicians on the opposite side think of these only during elections or by-elections.  One can recall the famous statement made by the present Minister for Health, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, when he found time during the Roscommon by-election to get down to Castlerea.  We all read what he said on the papers the following day and we thought the Shannon would be drained in the next few hours.  As I said, if the Fianna Fáil party could suck as well as they can blow, I have no doubt it would be drained.</P>
    <P>These schemes are of a very minor nature.  They certainly serve a different purpose in the counties in which they are operated.  People often want to get small rivers cleaned and there is no scheme under which this can be done except the rural improvements scheme.  For that reason I think that in the course of the next few weeks the Minister will find that every county council will accept responsibility for this scheme and operate it.</P>
    <P>As I said before, when one compares the scheme with the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes, there <Col N="1885" /> is this danger, that those schemes gave employment to people who needed it and 90 per cent or more of the money spent went into the pockets of the labouring man and the small farmer, but when this scheme comes to be operated, the local authorities will use all the machinery they have available for road-making, and, as Deputy O'Leary said, the contractor will move in and there will be no employment available for the very small farmer.  If he is to exist at all, his income will have to be supplemented.  This was one way in which his income was supplemented previously.  The Minister has amalgamated the rural improvement scheme, the bog development schemes and the minor relief schemes and is calling the new scheme the local improvements scheme.  On the amalgamation we found that while heretofore no contribution was needed under the bog development schemes from an applicant for whatever work was to be carried out, and the same applied in the case of the minor relief schemes, under the rural improvement scheme there had to be a contribution and there has also to be a contribution under the local improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to valuations under £5 and said that the rate will be 2½ per cent but he did not refer to the average valuation of over £5 or say if it will operate in the same way as the rural improvement scheme operated.  I hope he will make some reference to this.  He also said that priority in the recruitment will be accorded to suitable unemployed men who are registered with the employment exchange.  Very often we find that where people contribute towards one of those schemes, let it be either a road or a drainage scheme, they feel they are entitled to be employed. Usually these are small farmers and people who do not register with the labour exchange.  I should like the Minister to have another look at this and embody in the Bill a clause ensuring that people who make contributions to the scheme will get employment, if they need it, and that they will be put in the same category as people registered with the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> The Minister also said that the scheme will not involve any responsibility on the county council for future maintenance.  I know that in the two counties I represent it is bound to, because the usual procedure there was when money was spent on a minor relief scheme, or a rural improvement scheme, and when the road or a cul-de-sac road was made and put in a reasonable state of repair, the people asked either Leitrim County Council or Roscommon County Council to take over the roads.  Both county councils did this at all times.  This means that the county councils will have to provide money for the maintenance of such roads and they will have to allow for this in the rates.  Perhaps other counties did not operate in this fashion but that is the way in which my two counties operated.</P>
    <P>The provisional allocation to Roscommon County Council is £15,000. They received that notification some time ago and a few days ago they received 27 or 28 applications back from the Special Employment Schemes Office.  They have also received some 14 or 15 applications from people looking for application forms in order to get a grant under the scheme.  I do not think the £15,000 will cover the number of applications, between what they have received and what they will receive in the current year.  The position is somewhat different in Leitrim. They were told they would receive £23,000 but they received from the Special Employment Schemes Office 125 applications, some of them dated back to August, 1964.  That clearly indicates the arrears involved in the scheme.  If we average out these applications at a job costing in the region of £200, we find the figure will run into £25,000 and they will not receive sufficient in this year to clear off the arrears which they have received from the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>The average cost per scheme is much higher in County Roscommon and I have no doubt they will find themselves in the same position.  I do not think it is any great boon to these county councils because instead of the Department of Local Government <Col N="1887" /> being blamed for not doing the work, the particular county council will be blamed in the county in which there is not sufficient to cover the schemes. I can see no reason other than that for the switching over of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill confers power on the county council to enter into an agreement with the landowner.  One very often finds three or four people who live on a road looking for a grant from the Special Employment Schemes Office and perhaps one man, for some unknown reason&mdash;perhaps because he dislikes his neighbours&mdash; is not prepared to give his consent or sign the prescribed form saying that he has no objection to the scheme being carried out.  The net result is that the scheme is cancelled and the money is not spent.  The Minister should give power to the local authority to carry out the scheme, irrespective of whether or not they get agreement from all the landowners concerned.  The situation is quite desperate when schemes are not carried out.  One objects, and five or six others whose lands are flooded or whose roadway is potholed must go on suffering simply because one individual holds all the others up to ransom.  The Minister should have another look at this with a view to giving power to the local authority to do the scheme, irrespective of whether or not they get consent from all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Bill and it has been pretty well debated by those who have preceded me.  I shall confine myself, therefore, to a few matters about which I am not quite clear.  The Bill replaces the various grants given under the special employment schemes and I am wondering whether one of the schemes, which was governed by the number of unemployed on a certain date in January, is covered by this new arrangement or has the Minister taken this into account at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to know whether or not the Minister has taken into consideration the fact that there was a slowing down of this work for the past few years and the amount of money allocated&mdash;I am referring now to my own area in particular&mdash;was <Col N="1888" /> down to something between £3,000 and £4,000.  Apparently the allocation will be made on last year's expenditure. As far as I know, very few people bothered applying for grants over the past two years because, as a result of public announcements here and elsewhere, they felt there was not very much money available.  The amount available for Meath was between £3,000 and £4,000 and this will represent a very small amount of work to be done this year.</P>
    <P>The amount being apportioned to the local authority for the running of the scheme is ten per cent.  I wonder how that compares with what it was costing before these schemes were transferred.  I understand that most local authorities are unable to run their own schemes under ten per cent, or anything like ten per cent.  If that is so, it seems extraordinary that they should be expected to take on a new type of work and run it at this particularly small amount.  Would the Minister have this matter examined and considered because, if what I say is correct, there will be a reluctance on the part of local authorities to take on work which will necessitate taking money out of the rates because, if they do not get it, they must naturally find it out of the rates?  We are rather lucky in Meath in as much as we have taken over and repaired over the past four or five years every lane from two houses up and declared all lanes so repaired to be public roads. That means that what is left now for repair are those lanes on which there is only one house or on which there is only agricultural land.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested to hear Deputy O'Leary talking about the fellow in the middle of the job holding up the 15 or 20 house lane because he would not agree to participate and pay his share; he would not take down a gate.  If there is a gate on a lane or if it is unfenced, the local authorities can do nothing with it.  How will that situation be affected under the new scheme?  Are some regulations laid down or can the council repair the lane even though it is not properly fenced and even though there may be gates or fences <Col N="1889" /> along the length of the lane?  The Minister may have explained this elsewhere but I have failed to find any such explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also refers to the fact that employment should be given to the gangers and other people heretofore employed on this work.  He said men should be recruited from the labour exchange.  The men have always been recruited from the labour exchange, in theory; in practice, local authorities who are about to lay off men usually do not put the men to the trouble of signing on at the exchange; they take them on to do these jobs.  I wonder how this new regulation will work because, as far as I know, a percentage payment was made to the county engineer as agent for the special employment schemes. Naturally, if he is expected in future to do this work as part of his normal work, some financial arrangement will have to be made.</P>
    <P>As far as the supervisory people are concerned, I do not know what the Minister means because gangers have always been seconded from the local authority.  The gangers were borrowed because they knew how to supervise and they knew how the work should be done.  Time and again we have had some difficulty about gangers from the point of view of superannuation. There was a slight difficulty in ensuring that they would have their pension rights guaranteed when engaged on this work.  In counties where there is a great deal of this work to be done, the situation is probably different, but in those counties I know best, the situation has been that the gangers were recruited temporarily from the local authorities.  In some areas there were special arrangements about hours because the Special Employment Schemes Office insisted on working the hours laid down, even though the local authority normally worked a different set of hours.  That is one thing that will cease when this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>The Minister says almost every local authority has agreed to work the scheme.  There is, of course, no option. If the Special Employment Schemes <Col N="1890" /> Office is closing down in Dublin, then local authorities must either operate the scheme or not operate it.  There is really no choice.  They either say they do not want to have anything to do with it or they must agree to operate it.  The Minister should make a special effort to ensure that there will be a proper allocation made to cover the cost of carrying out the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two other matters I want to mention.  It is very difficult to know what type of drainage will qualify.  Would the Minister make it clear whether the choice of work to be done is to be left exclusively to the engineers of the local authorities?  If it is, then I can understand the way in which it can be carried out.  What I want to know is if there is any further check from Departmental level.  No matter what is being laid out by the local authority engineers, we usually have somebody from Dublin having a final say.  Is there any final veto, and if so, does it lie with the Minister for Local Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few points I wish to make on the Bill, which I generally support.  When this matter arose at my county council, I was doubtful.  We thought that extra engineers and staff would be necessary to operate the Act and we wondered if we would get enough financial support to do so.  We know now that we need not have worried.  At the beginning, the Local Authorities (Works) Act did good work.  Many schemes were done in my area.  The trouble was, however, that no maintenance work was carried out afterwards, with the result that some of the good schemes done went for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that worries me about the Bill.  The Minister said that there would be no responsibility for maintenance.  That is the only objection I have.  As I have said, schemes done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act went back to their original condition because of lack of maintenance afterwards and the money spent, which did good work originally, went for nothing.  There will be a few snags here in the matter of taking over by-roads.  Some Deputies have <Col N="1891" /> said that a person living along a road can object to contributing.  A man living at the opening of a by-road might say: &ldquo;The road may be bad but I will not be passing through it so I will have no part of it&rdquo;.  There might be three or four farmers living two or three miles up the road and yet this one person living near its opening could object.  I hope the Minister will tell us how such a difficulty can be got over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned gangers and said that all the gangers employed in rural improvements schemes were from county councils.  I agree they were very good men and my information is that those men will be re-employed when this scheme comes into operation.  That is good.  I am particularly interested in the drainage schemes which will come under this Act.  Who will do the drainage and will the people who benefit have to contribute?  I have not read the Bill fully.  The Minister has said that the Bill will not involve any responsibility on the part of the county councils for future maintenance.  That is wrong because, as I have said, the Local Authorities (Works) Act provided good schemes at the beginning but they were rendered useless by lack of maintenance later on.</P>
    <P>On the question of maintenance of roads by county councils, there are roads in North Tipperary which have been taken over by the county council. They will be rolled and tarred and maintained afterwards.  They will not be affected by this because the county council have taken them over.  One Deputy said this Bill should provide particularly for places in which people are drawing unemployment benefit. That would not be fair to the rest of the country, to the people who pay rates and who produce for the good of the nation.  People who have to send milk through bad roads to the creameries will have the owners of tractors and trailers saying: &ldquo;The road is too bad&rdquo;.  They are people who help the country to a large extent and yet it has been suggested that we should not assist them but that we should assist people who are not doing anything to help themselves.  I have <Col N="1892" /> known people who refuse to travel with tractors and trailers over roads which they consider to be bad.  The people so affected are entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will prove successful, but I dislike the suggestion that county councils will not be responsible for maintenance. Councils will take over roads when they are put into good condition but will they take full responsibility for minor drainage?  Deputy Treacy spoke of drainage in South Tipperary and said a good job had been done at the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I can see, this measure assumes somewhat the role of the Local Authorities (Works) Act but when that Act was initiated we had the rural improvements scheme, the minor employments scheme and the bog development scheme.  Now we are to have them all under the one heading.  Anybody connected with a local authority knows that the money to be allocated will be far from sufficient to meet the demands. During the past two years public representatives have been approached continuously about the rural improvement, minor employment and bog development schemes and the only answer we had to give was that we were not receiving any applications. I think I am safe in mentioning the period of two years.  It was too bad we should have had to say this to our people, particularly in the west of Ireland where we have such a high mileage of accommodation roads and such a large number of small streams which develop into big rivers in stormy weather.  Now we are making the change but under the provisions of the Bill local authorities in rural areas will have to handle a large backlog of work that has been lying in Dublin, some schemes dating back to 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is time for any Government to take note of this.  The demand is there for the grants.  The necessity is there to have the work carried out. The one thing the Government should do is to try by all means to get down to those rural areas and to get those jobs done.  What do many of our people <Col N="1893" /> think when they see big schemes being carried out, costing hundreds of thousands of pounds in some cases, and emphasis being put on tourism which lasts only from about June to 1st October?  Those people are continually crying out for their applications to be dealt with.  Only now, on 1st April, can we tell them that applications will be made available but, then again, that is only getting the applications sent forward.  Those applications still outstanding in my constituency of Leitrim will have to be cleared off before we can get to the new applications.</P>
    <P>Since I came into public life, I have been a great believer in the rural improvement scheme.  I have continually been in touch with the rural improvement scheme office.  I should like to say a special word of thanks to everybody connected with that office, from the director down to the most junior clerk in it, and to the inspectors who came out and did their job and did it well.  They were always helpful and courteous and, as far as possible, did a job that satisfied everyone.  I will say this: a generous grant was given. It was a fine scheme.  Another very satisfying aspect of it was that, with a bit of co-operation, a local man got the gangership.  Furthermore, if there were not too many on the employment list, lads who contributed were lucky enough to get a bit of employment. That system after five or six years in my area, achieved an amount of useful work and the people were availing of it to the full.  I should again like to say that special word of thanks to all those people who made it such a success.</P>
    <P>This is going down now to the county councils.  We hope, and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider, after this year, to increase the allocation of money for those schemes.  Those are the people who really count.  In Sligo and Leitrim, we have a very high mileage of accommodation roads &mdash;mountainous roads, country roads, bog roads and other roads&mdash;that do not measure up to be put on the county council and, anyhow, their time has not come because we have county roads <Col N="1894" /> that have yet to be tarred and that will add extra miles.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to say that this scheme, if enough money were given for it, could make hundreds of acres, perhaps thousands of acres of land, useful for grazing, in some cases useful for tillage and, all in all, of use to the farmer who owns them.  I know some streams that are completely closed in. The stream, before, acted as a fence between two farmers but, with continuous flooding, it has grown in. People have to put up wire now whereas, before, there was no need for it. They cannot put up a fence because the stream is still running through but cattle can walk across without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that the minor scheme should never have completely been done away with. Let us take, for instance, bog roads which are far removed from farms. The time will come when some of those bog roads will need repair&mdash;some need it already.  Nobody will induce five or six or ten people down the country to contribute towards this kind of road.  When we had a meeting with the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, we pointed out this fact.  They know well that, once a couple of bad floods come, the mountain road is torn away again.  The Minister should seriously have considered allocating a small amount of money for some of those roads because he will not succeed in getting rural improvement schemes or local improvements schemes to be used in some of those mountainy districts.</P>
    <P>At this stage, after two years, there are people who can scarcely get as far as their homes.  The accommodation roads have grown in.  There are briars and bushes.  Roads can become impassable for the want of being cleaned up.  In days gone by, those roads were even laid by the Congested Districts Board without any contribution. I think that, in many cases, it is hardly fair that we, at this stage, who are willing to repair them, should be so slow to get as far as them.  On the basis of the figure given to me as the allocation of money for Leitrim, <Col N="1895" /> I can still see a long waiting list after 1st April.  For the past twelve months anyhow, we have been telling people to hold off until 1st April, 1968, when the scheme would be got going.  Those people are only waiting to get their applications in.  I wonder how long they will have to wait after that.  Wages today are pretty high.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like the Minister to bear in mind is that, where at all possible, when carrying out those schemes the raw material should in future be taken from the local quarry.  I notice a tendency by engineers&mdash;just in order to make it easy&mdash; to have a lorry driven into one of those big quarries where road material is piled up.  It would leave more money locally if the material were taken from the local quarry.  In the past, all those local quarries were used for the servicing of roads for which grants were made.</P>
    <P>If at all possible, we should not encourage the driving of lorries into a big quarry to take away road material for districts outside the locality.  Because of the steady rise in wages, the grants should be increased.  As I have said, the grants were very generous but from now on we must see to it that they will be increased.  Grants given for this purpose mean availability of steady employment.  The grants may have been sanctioned early in the year and the usual procedure was to commence work as from October. That created employment for unemployed men, for some local farmers lucky enough to be employed on the schemes and for a local ganger. The result was that money was kept in circulation.  That type of employment practically ceased in the past two years.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the demand that exists for these schemes, I should like to inform the Minister that on a few occasions that I offered to have contributions paid early in October or late September, I was told that the contributions would not be accepted, that allocation to the various schemes had already been made.  That meant that there was a big gap from late September to April.  All the work is now embodied in one scheme and I <Col N="1896" /> can assure the Minister of the demand that exists for this work.</P>
    <P>Those who contribute should be considered for employment.  If people knew that they would not be employed on a scheme, there are many who would not contribute to it and would perhaps be responsible for holding up the scheme.  The local authority should be empowered to deal with the situation where an individual is behaving unreasonably in holding up a scheme.  My experience is that if the supervisor did not get everybody concerned to sign, there would be no more about the scheme and the person who refused to sign was responsible for the withholding of, perhaps, £100 from each of seven or eight workingmen. There should be some law whereby a scheme could not be held up because of one individual.  Sligo did not avail of the scheme for the reason I believe that there was not enough money for it, that ten per cent was not sufficient for administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a pity that Sligo did not avail of the scheme because there is a bog road going up the middle of their soccer pitch.  That is a joke and Deputy McLaughlin may forget about it.</P>
      <P>It was my duty, as chairman of Louth County Council, and holding a majority there now, to decide whether or not we would accept this scheme. We accepted it on the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread and non-acceptance would have meant that some roads would not have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ten per cent allocation, which the Minister says will effect worthwhile economy, is totally inadequate.  There is the engineering work to be done. The inspectors from the SESO, which is now transferred to this new-named local improvements scheme, which is really the county council, did an enormous amount of negotiation and kept contact with the spokesman and, perhaps, the officers called to one of these reluctant people that Deputy McLaughlin spoke about, who would not subscribe.  The net result was that the engineers from the Department were, in addition to being engineers, negotiators.  Even if they went no further than the spokesman they had <Col N="1897" /> a considerable amount of negotiation to carry out and there were time-wasting procedures before the scheme was finally got through.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that many county councils find it impossible to get engineers.  I can speak for Louth County Council.  Our county engineer is finding it extremely difficult to implement the policies of the county council because of lack of engineers. Repeated advertisements have resulted in either no reply or an engineer being appointed who after a short period left to take up a position in industry or elsewhere or, possibly, a better position within the county council.  One of the problems will be the physical one of processing these schemes.</P>
    <P>The engineering work on these schemes is extremely expensive relative to the amount of money spent. It probably costs as much money to plan the work to be done on an accommodation road as to plan a stretch of main road except, perhaps, where it is major construction of the main road on uneven land.  It is obvious that the ten per cent is inadequate and will not compensate county councils for the amount of work that now has to be done by their officers.  It just means that the rates estimate for roads will be that much greater.  Alternatively, there will be proportionately less work done on other county council projects.  There will be delay or increased cost.</P>
    <P>Deputies have dwelt on the inadequacy of the allocations.  About five years ago, the late Councillor William Woods, who had been a Senator, proposed that our engineering staff be asked for a rough estimate of the cost of reconstruction to third-class county council road standard of the accommodation roads in the county used by four or more persons.  In other words, we did not go to extremes but just wanted to get an estimate that would guide the county council in regard to its policy.  The estimate was £212,000, which, if related to rates in Louth directly, apart from the subventions from the scheme, would have cost in the order of 250 pennies on the rates. It could not be done and the council <Col N="1898" /> wisely decided that the right thing to do was to advise that applicants for such schemes should bring the roads up to tarmacadam standard and at that stage the county council would take them over, make them county council roads and maintain them <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>We have done this already in respect of ten or 12 roads but on the basis of a cost five years ago of £212,000 not including tarmacadam but merely to bring the road up to third-class county council dirt road standard, it will be realised that the cost today of doing this would be, at a conservative estimate, £250,000 or £300,000.  Our allocation this year is £3,500, and of this £3,500, there is £1,864 already allotted, because three schemes were processed, and the county council decided to do these three.  However, there are 12 more applications which are unprocessed and we now have to decide which of these we will do, and it has been made clear in the Minister's speech that we are carrying the can, that we are making the selections now. We have to decide from our limited resources plus the local contribution what applications we shall deal with. This means that our effort in this regard will be restricted.  We cannot see the accommodation roads used by four, five, possibly ten families in County Louth brought to tarmacadam standard being taken over by the county council in the foreseeable future.  If there is no upsurge in the amount of money allotted for these accommodation roads, then the situation is practically hopeless.</P>
    <P>There was a proposal a few months ago to ask the Minister if he would allow the county to borrow £10,000 and to vote this £10,000 as a capital sum towards a similar scheme to that operated then by the SESO.  In other words, from the £10,000 loan we desire to borrow we would add to the applicant's subscription a proportionate amount based on the Minister's circular, and therefore we would extend our activities possibly three or four times.  This would, perhaps, seem a rather profligate way of approaching the problem, but if you want to give service and you have a quarter of a million pounds worth <Col N="1899" /> of work to do and the allocation of the Minister is £3,500, you can take your pick: either abuse the Minister or try to do something about it yourself. A little abuse is perhaps no harm; the Minister is used to it and I do not think it would worry him.  Apart from that, I think Louth County Council made a wise decision in asking the Minister&mdash;or is in the process of asking him; I do not know whether he has an application yet&mdash;for permission to borrow £10,000 per year and apply it to the expansion of this scheme or to an expansion of a facsimile of the scheme, because it really would not be the same scheme. I should like the Minister to deal with that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to raise is that it appears to me that there is a restriction county by county, and I do not know whether or not there was a restriction county by county in previous times.  I rather thought that it was not a restriction by county but that if my friend, Deputy McLaughlin, made an application on behalf of his neighbour who lived down the lane, and if I made an application on behalf of a constituent, what would have happened was that if his application arrived the day before mine his would be dealt with first on the basis of a waiting list.  That was not a restriction county by county but was a countrywide restriction.  I should like to be informed whether or not there was a county by county restriction or whether this is a new departure.</P>
    <P>What I want to know from the Minister now is whether or not in regard to new schemes the Minister's circular in relation to old schemes holds.  I want to use an example.  There is a lane in Louth&mdash;the Minister will smile at this if he ever smiled&mdash;in which there are four cottiers and at each end of it two substantial farmers. The substantial farmer at the inner end of the cul-de-sac certainly would get extreme benefit for his motor car, himself and everybody else going up and down the lane; but the farmer at the other end of it would not be that much affected because he could walk <Col N="1900" /> with a dry foot on to the public road and if he wanted to go down on to the land to look at his cattle or to do agricultural work he could wear wellington boots, and his sons and nephews could go down on the tractor, trailer, plough or whatever it was.</P>
    <P>However, in the course of my political duties I interviewed one of this man's nephews and the local teacher, and explained to them in detail all the workings of the SESO scheme, told them how to make out the application, and named the local teacher, who was to be one of my great political supporters and workers, as the spokesman. Imagine my chagrin and my dilemma when I found on the advent of the local elections that the local teacher was the Fianna Fail candidate, and imagine worse when he was elected. However, he is still a good friend of mine, and we will forget about that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Here is a situation where two substantial farmers whose land valuation adds up to an average of £96.  This means a contribution of 50 per cent. The Minister's circular states that the local contribution must be on the basis of land valuation; this would mean there would have to be a substantial local contribution from only two substantial owners, because naturally the four cottiers would not be expected to subscribe much.  In fact the local contribution was £518.  The county council were prepared to subscribe £70, and we had £448 to get.  The two large landowners were decent enough to say to the chairman of the county council: &ldquo;We will give you £125.&rdquo;  We have a deficit now of £178 to be made up among four cottiers.  What we in Louth County Council would have desired to do and what we could do now is to count the number of beneficiaries from the scheme not as two but as six and, therefore, divide the total valuation of land not by two but by six.  This would mean, of course, according to our scheme, that the contribution from the beneficiaries would not be 50 per cent but of the order of ten per cent, because the average valuation would no longer be £96 but would be possibly of the order of £15.  We would have less money to use on schemes, because <Col N="1901" /> the contribution from us now as distinct from the Minister would be increased and the contributions from the beneficiaries would be decreased.  However, in a situation where you have a most horrible lane where, I think, 15 schoolchildren are coming up and down and where there are potholes with water to a depth of 12 inches we feel it would be proper to bring that lane up to county council road standard, and to adapt it as a county council road.  Our position in the matter is that we are restricted by this deficit of £178.  In fact, I have suggested to the local Monsignor that we should get these people to make an application to the credit union for a loan of £178 to get the job done.</P>
    <P>I would be greatly facilitated if the Minister would tell me if we are bound by the circular.  I know that if the county council drafted a scheme by themselves, they would expand it and it would be the number divided by the total valuation rather than the number of landowners.  One of the landowners has been very decent to subscribe at all because he does not benefit very much, and the other has gone as far as we could expect him to go in giving £125.  At the same time, there are unfortunate working people living on that land who are restricted because of the accident&mdash;and it is no more than an accident&mdash;that there are two landowners whose valuation added up to an average of £96.  In dealing with this matter, I have mentioned two landowners.  In fact, there are three but one is not there.  He is not near the lane and he is not involved as much as the other two, and it would be hard to expect that a contribution would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>This is a detailed approach to a particular problem which could be repeated many times in a county like Louth.  In the West, more luck to them &mdash;they get £20,000 whereas we get £3,500.  I am not complaining about that.  I am just saying that there are four cottiers on that lane and two landowners.  The landowners do not need a tarmacadam road but the unfortunate people who live on the lane do.  I am saying this in a most <Col N="1902" /> amicable fashion and not in a spirit of criticism.  I should like the Minister to tell me whether we are bound by the circular or whether he intends to issue a new circular.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what is the position about approach roads to groups of cottages.  In Louth, we have a difficulty which I suppose is the fault of county councils in the past.  We built certain groups of cottages and we did not adapt the roads around them.  We did not bring them up to any proper standard and now our legal position is that it is doubtful whether we can bring them up to the proper standard and adapt them as county council roads.  We have voted £1,000 this year towards this problem.  I should like to know if under section 2 of this Bill we can go in on these approach roads and do certain works on them.  We find it difficult to bring them up to tarmacadam standards where we desire to take them over and maintain them.  We have a policy for the next five years to try at least to surface-dress these roads and in future to bring in all the roads to groups of cottages as county roads. We hope the Minister will subscribe the ordinary percentage of the subvention.</P>
    <P>Are we bound by the Minister's circular? Can we borrow this £10,000 and apply it to an expansion of a facsimile of the scheme?  The council will now have the onerous duty of selecting those who will get priority. We have to decide whether to take those with more people on them, or whether to take those whose need is greater, or whether we will take them one by one in order of application.  I should like a lead on this from the Minister.  Is he leaving it wide open as our responsibility, or will he send us a circular instructing us how to proceed, or will he leave it in the same position as under the old circular?</P>
    <P>The other point is in regard to our legal position where we built cottages without taking over the approach road and where the cottages are now vested. This is agitating our county manager and engineers.  Indeed, we have taken counsel's advice on it.  I would be obliged if the Minister would inform <Col N="1903" /> me whether section 2 or any other section empowers us to do any works on roads which are not county council roads but which are approach roads to cottages which were our cottages but are now vested and for which the occupiers are paying over a period of years.</P>
    <P>This is of great interest to anyone involved in county council work, and has any responsibility in that regard. The policy of Louth County Council is to tarmacadam all dirt roads.  In four years, we will have no dirt roads in the county at all.  Provision has been included in the estimate for this.  I am sorry I have not got the Minister's circular with me.  I am speaking from memory.  What is the position in relation to priority for work for subscribers? I understand that the position was that a person who subscribed could apply and get priority for work while the reconstruction was going on. I should like to know what is to happen now.  Does this circular stand, or will the Minister make changes, or where are we going?</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying that I had hoped to raise a smile from the Minister when I told him what happened to me, but I did not.  I did not raise these things in a spirit of criticism, but I think the ten per cent is an inadequate amount to pay the county council.  We just cannot do it on that basis.  It would cost us far more and this Bill, of itself, is restricted.  It amazes me to find that certain county councils in the west of Ireland which receive large sums for these schemes are not co-operating.  No matter how much you disagree with the move&mdash; and personally I disagree with it&mdash;I think you cannot act as a dog in the manager if you are responsible in the matter.  You must co-operate and try to get the most for your people from Government coffers.  Is it not true that they are paying enough in taxes? If so, one should try to get as much for them in return as one is capable of getting.</P>
    <P>My last word is that I regard the amount voted as inadequate.  I regard the ten per cent being given to county councils to defray the cost of operations as inadequate and I hope there will be <Col N="1904" /> expansion.  I can see the reason for the Bill, which is simply to enable the change to take place and to allow the county councils, which are acting merely as agents, to become principals. Having said that, I would be much obliged if the Minister would give me the information I have sought, if he can do so; if he cannot, I should be obliged if somebody in his Department can give it to me in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most disappointing measure.  When it was announced that the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Bill would be introduced, we all anticipated a comprehensive measure covering large schemes, particularly in regard to drainage.  I do not know what Deputy Donegan had in mind about what the Bill would do but, to my mind it will do nothing.  It just transfers from the Special Employment Schemes Office to the local authorities the power and duty of carrying out minor jobs heretofore carried out by that Office, some works of road improvement in the case of roads serving two or more farmers, small drainage works and bog roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation for the work has not been increased.  For Cork county, I understand the allocation is £17,500. It is very peculiar that since Fianna Fáil got back into office in 1957, they have again and again refused to listen to representations made all over the country for the restoration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There is no need to remind the House of the benefits of that measure not only in improving roads but in carrying out small drainage schemes which are so essential if we are to develop farming. Every county council in Ireland and every such organisation irrespective of political affiliations, including the General Council of County Councils, made representations to the Government through the Department of Local Government for the restoration of that Act but without avail.  The feeling is&mdash;and it is unfortunate that I have to say so in the House&mdash;that because that Act was brought in by the first Inter-Party Government and because so many of the advantages I have mentioned <Col N="1905" /> already flowed from that measure, the Government have shied away from it during their 11 years of continuous office since 1957.</P>
    <P>Cork county is no different, I am sure, from any other county and at council meetings and area committee meetings, we have been besieged by farmers trying to get us to clear smaller rivers and streams to enable them to develop their land.  In common with a number of other councils, we have again and again sent requests to Dublin to have deputations received but with little or no avail. When it was found necessary to introduce a drainage Bill this year, why were not such works included?  The arterial drainage schemes are not operating in many parts of the country because of their cost, and seemingly&mdash; or so I understand&mdash;they are allocated on a political basis, and unless you have strong political pressure from a given area or possibly unless the area is favourable to the Government, it is unlikely that an arterial drainage scheme grant will be made available.</P>
    <P>We have smaller rivers which badly need attention because unless these smaller rivers are cleared, farmers cannot avail of land reclamation grants to clear smaller streams flowing through their land.  Hence, we have this outcry for a comprehensive drainage scheme to enable such small rivers and streams to be cleared.  Why is it that the Department cannot heed the widespread requests from all over the country for the restoration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act?  I know that if that Act were restored it would cost money, but I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is well aware, as a rural Deputy, that no public representative, whether Minister, Deputy or local councillor, would vote against, or voice opposition to the allocation of money for drainage of land which is so badly needed.  It is most disappointing to find that in February 1968, we have a Bill with a high-sounding name like this before the House but containing nothing.</P>
    <P>We expected more from the Minister and the Government.  Cork county is more than one-eighth of the total <Col N="1906" /> size of the State: we have many roads to be attended to and we have drainage schemes.  The sum of £17,500, the annual allocation for the year commencing on 1st April, will not go very far towards carrying out the necessary improvements.  I have agreed again and again in connection with this scheme as administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office, for the improving of small roads serving two, three or four people that the money expended under that heading was useful and most helpful in getting local householders to avail of grants to bring their roads or boreens up to a standard sufficient to qualify for taking over by the county council.  But drainage is the main problem and it is for drainage grants we are crying out in all local authorities.  This measure before the House contains little or nothing for drainage.  I do not know why the term &ldquo;drainage&rdquo; is used because it was made quite clear in the Minister's speech that there is very little scope for drainage under this Bill.  It will possibly be used to drain a few small bogs here and there.</P>
    <P>I am concerned not so much with what is in the Bill, because there is so little in it, as what is not in the Bill. Can the Minister say if grants will be available for farmers to enable them to have these rivers cleared?  In my own area 45 farmers have been held up for the past 8 or 9 years having failed to secure any Government grant under any scheme for the clearing of a river in the Skibbereen area.  The general manager of the local co-operative creamery has made several representations to the Departments dealing with drainage and memoranda have been submitted again and again to get a grant under any possible heading.  I have raised the matter in the House and the answer has been that grants cannot be given until such time as arterial grants are made in the area.  I do not know when, if ever, arterial grants are likely to be available in that area.  I am sure it will not be in our lifetime judging by the present pace.</P>
    <P>The case I have given is only one of many throughout the country.  Can the Minister say what remedy there <Col N="1907" /> is for such people?  Will he make grants available under any other heading, or has he in mind that in the not-too-distant future there should be a more comprehensive measure involving more money to enable local councils to carry out such work?  I have no doubt county councils would carry out such schemes if they were empowered to and had the money to do so, the same as they administered the Local Authorities (Works) Acts.</P>
    <P>It is most disappointing to find that the representations of local public representatives of all Parties, including those of the General Council of County Councils, should be ignored in this Bill.  We want a clear-cut statement from the Minister this evening.  We are tired of receiving deputations for drainage work and telling them we have no money or no function to help them.  We have expressed the view that we were hopeful that some legislation would be enacted.  Indeed, even without the enactment of any legislation, the Local Authorities (Works) Act is still on the books and we could have got money under that heading to enable this work to be done.  As a rural Deputy and speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, we are very disappointed that the Minister has not given heed to representations concerning drainage, particularly in a year in which he has slashed the road grants extensively.  We had a reduction of £127,800 in the road grants in Cork. When we heard of this new Bill to be introduced, covering drainage schemes as well as roads, we thought that possibly there would be a transfer of the money taken from the road grants to this work.  We withheld criticism, thinking that this may have happened.  However, even before the Bill was circulated, we knew from advance information that it was to contain little or nothing.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to protest as vehemently as possible against the dictatorial manner in which the Government are discharging their duties, particularly the Minister for Local Government.  It is unfair to the farming community to deny them the right of having their land drained.  We know they cannot be drained overnight <Col N="1908" /> but if we had a reasonable allocation for each county the work could be carried out on an order of priority determined by the local councils.  A secondary benefit, of no little importance as far as local councils were concerned, was that this type of work gave a good deal of local employment in rural areas.  Therefore, you had benefits to the farming community, to the economy and to the local workers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not adopt the dictatorial attitude he has adopted while Minister.  Unfortunately, I have had to comment on the Minister on previous occasions.  He seems to me to be very dictatorial.  This is a democratic country and we do not like dictatorial people in executive positions. The word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means he is a servant of the people.  He should bear that in mind.  He is not their lord and master, as presumably he thinks he is, but a servant of the people appointed to this executive position and he should give heed to the people's representations.  I hope the Minister will change his mind so far as the availability of grants for drainage work is concerned and also in relation to increasing grants to the local authorities to enable them to carry out such works as minor road works.  So far as voting money for such works is concerned, the Labour Party will support measures to provide the money.  We are not unmindful of the fact that drainage works cannot be carried out without money.  But we believe it is vitally essential to have drainage schemes other than arterial drainage schemes carried out&mdash;the schemes in between the small works carried out under the land reclamation schemes and arterial drainage.  The country is crying out for the implementation of such schemes and the Minister would do well to pocket his pride and restore the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have described this measure as merely passing the buck from the Department of Local Government to the local authorities and have said that there was no reason or justification for the scheme.  This is obviously wrong.  I gave very good reasons why this was <Col N="1909" /> being done.  These three schemes previously administered from a central office in Dublin were dealing with purely local matters and it appeared to the Government they would be more efficiently done and better value obtained from them if they were dealt with by people who knew local conditions. The new scheme will mean that all the schemes that it is decided to do can be selected on the basis of urgency and of the benefit that they will bring to the local community.  The three schemes that are there already dealt basically with the same types of work&mdash;accommodation and bog roads and drains&mdash;and the pooling of the schemes ensures that the grants can be allocated impartially for the most necessary work.  The local contribution is small in the case of low valuations.  It is higher according as valuations become higher but I think the fact that there is a local contribution is a test of the real need for the work to be carried out.  The distribution of minor employment schemes which was on an unemployment basis took no account of the real volume of urgent work in each area.  In some electoral divisions with high unemployment saturation point was reached and there was, in fact, a shortage of suitable work, while in other areas the employment allocation was too small to do worthwhile improvements.  Now while in the recruitment of workers priority will still be given to the unemployed registered with the employment exchanges it will be possible to do the work where it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that this unified scheme should be much more economical to administer.  I feel that this is an obvious example of practical decentralisation of administration.  The overheads should be reduced as a result. I was disappointed that so many Deputies should have adopted the attitude that the ten per cent allocation for administrative expenses was too small.  I do not think this is so at all. It is obvious that there should be some saving in administrative costs and I feel it was reasonable to ask that this scheme should be adopted on the proposed basis.  I feel that all Deputies <Col N="1910" /> and public representatives if they are really interested in getting the maximum possible amount of actual work done for the money spent should endeavour to have the schemes carried out within this ten per cent allocation for administrative costs.</P>

      <P>I do not think they do any great service to the people who will benefit from these works by making this case that the allocation for administration is too low.  It is not correct to say, as some Deputies did say, that this has been received rather resentfully by the local authorities as a whole.  In fact, generally speaking, it has been welcomed and although there was a considerable amount of representations with regard to the alleged inadequacy of the ten per cent allocation still I think most counties accepted the scheme with a good grace and there are in fact only four councils that have not yet agreed to operate the scheme.</P>

      <P>Cork, Dublin, Offaly and Sligo have not yet formally notified their agreement but it is expected that they will, in fact, agree to operate it. There are only those four and there has been no formal refusal on the part of any of them.  A number of councils did ask for an increase in the ten per cent allocation for administrative expenses and my Department have pointed out to them that one of the main reasons for amalgamating these schemes and for asking local authorities to operate them was to try and save as much as possible of the administrative expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that opposition Deputies should have adopted this attitude of trying to force up the amount of money for this very important work which is to be allocated to administrative expenses.  Since Deputy <Col N="1911" /> Donegan is obviously in such a great hurry to have this dealt with, maybe I will just gloss over a few points and instead, as he requests, drop him a note with regard to the particular points he raised.</P>
      <P>In regard to this question of the amounts that were notified provisionally to local authorities, it was made quite clear that these were based purely on the hypothesis that the amount available would be the same as this year.  As I pointed out in reply to a supplementary question here this amount has not in fact been fixed.  If there is more available, then the amounts notified to individual counties will also be increased.  Deputy Treacy, of course, as usual made the allegation that there was no money at all available for those things, that the schemes had in fact ceased.  Of course, that is not true at all.  There was a total of £350,000 made available for the three schemes this year which is an increase on the year before.  Admittedly, the amount has not got back to the figure which obtained prior to that.  Deputy Treacy described it as reluctance on the part of the Department to make the necessary capital available to them.  As I pointed out in reply to the debate on the Estimate, the Government decided that this year it would be feasible, in view of the level of economic activity in the country, to allocate to the State's capital programme a total of £109 million and of this amount for all purposes, the Department of Local Government was allocated over 25 per cent, £29 million.  I think that was a reasonable proportion to expect for Local Government purposes.  Needless to say, we could utilise more if it was available, but the Fianna Fáil Government believe in allocating money for the State's capital programme in relation to the state of the economy.  That is why we are able to keep the services going continuously at a high level of activity whereas the Coalition Government were not inclined to do that.</P>

As Opposition Deputies know, the Local Authorities (Works) Act deals with drainage only whereas this Bill deals with roads as well.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act is not appropriate to the minor drainage works which are done under this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That the Minister for Industry and Commerce may by order provide for the imposition of customs duties (to be known as provisional duties) for such period, not exceeding six months and on such goods imported into the State (being goods of a kind which, in the opinion of a commission to be known as An Coimisiún um Mí-Allmhairiú may be the subject of injurious dumping) as may be specified in the order.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the Government may by order provide for the imposition of customs duties (to be known as anti-dumping duties) on such goods imported into the State (being goods in relation to which or goods of a kind in relation to which there has been dumping or it has been established to the satisfaction of a commission to be known as An Coimisiún um Mí-Allmhairiú that there has been injurious dumping) as may be specified in the order.</P>
      <P>(3)  That the Government may by order provide for the imposition of customs duties (to be known as countervailing duties) on such goods imported into the State (being goods of a kind in relation to which it has been established to the satisfaction of the Government that another government or any other authority outside the State have given a subsidy on their production or export) as may be specified in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  That the Government may by <Col N="1915" /> order provide for the imposition of a levy on goods dumped in the State before the making of the order where they are satisfied it is necessary to do so to prevent a recurrence of the dumping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course these orders are the result of the position as we find it and it is necessary that we have this anti-dumping legislation. The Minister must assume responsibility until the Commission sits, and he seeks responsibility for six months. The various paragraphs of the motion cover the different situations that might arise.  We on this side of the House have no objection to giving the Minister this power.  We want to say, however, that it is an indication of the difficulty that lies before us, that the defence of jobs will be far more important than new ones.  That is not to say that we should not be high-powered in our approach and should not make every endeavour to create new jobs.</P>
      <P>While there will be changes in employment and people will have to move, one of the big problems will be to keep the jobs we have.  In the background of all this is the fact that it is not clear at all that our system of adaptation grants has been successful. It is now clear that the money has been given to people who have been in industry for years and who find it attractive enough in times of credit squeeze to avail of these adaptation grants.</P>
      <P>If you get 25 per cent of the cost, you must find the 75 per cent elsewhere from profits which are quite unavailable to some enterprises or individuals at present.  It would be unwise if these measures were passed without calling attention to the fact that there are defensive jobs, made necessary by our present structure here, a structure for which the Fianna Fáil Party and its type of structure are probably most responsible.  I agree that at the start of the industrial move in the State the paramount aim was to provide jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Donegan admit that the <Col N="1916" /> industrial movement began with Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I called a House and brought Deputy Carty's minions from their various haunts but he might note that I did not interrupt his Minister. In fact, my questions were courteous. He may also notice that the Minister and I are almost always courteous to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>And so am I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Carty would cease interrupting, I could deal with the matter myself.</P>

      <P>I was helping you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would deal with it more efficiently than Deputy Carty. Fianna Fáil have been in power but the battle to sustain industry took up a long time in the 1922-32 era.  The legislation governing the establishment of industry is of consequence.  I agree that Fianna Fáil had no choice at the start&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will develop it for Deputy Carty in a moment.  Willy-nilly Fianna Fáil had to find jobs and now it has to be said that our industry is not at the stage when it can compete in conditions of free trade and, therefore, this anti-dumping legislation is necessary.  However, such legislation will not succeed because there are too many ways of giving a hand-back.  It never succeeded, as anyone in commerce and trade knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly to reply, it is intended to cover all goods if they are <Col N="1917" /> dumped within the definition of the Act.  I want to reply to Deputy Donegan and say two things.  We in Fianna Fáil are very proud of the fact that we are responsible for industry and the structure of industry in this country.</P>
