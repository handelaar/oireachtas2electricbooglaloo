      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state how many labourers' cottages have been erected under the Housing Acts within the past four years by the Clare Board of Health in respect of each of the three schemes initiated by the Clare Board of Health and sanctioned by his Department.</P>

      <P>The Clare Board of Health has, since 1st April, 1932, erected 126 cottages under the Labourers Acts, of which 24 were erected under their first scheme, 71 under their second scheme, and 31 under their third scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the board of health had considerable difficulty in getting contractors for many of their cottages.  There are at present 179 cottages in the course of construction, and I understand that, in order to get over the difficulties about contractors, the board are now preparing a scheme for construction of a number of their cottages by direct labour.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was informed on 27th May that the Clare Board of Health and Public Assistance had requested their engineers to furnish specifications and estimates for repairs to all cottages in their districts. I am not aware of the total amount estimated by the board as necessary to put the cottages into proper habitable repair.  I am continually reminding the board of their duty to keep the cottages in repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that three applicants for labourers' cottages, namely, Michael Finucane and Michael Stack, of Tieraclea, Tarbert, County Kerry, and Michael Mulvihill, of Doonard, Tarbert, gave evidence before an inquiry in reference to the building of cottages in North Kerry, and, if so, will he state why it is that these applications are not granted in view of the fact that their present dwellings houses are in a dilapidated condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The three persons mentioned were applicants for cottages on lands proposed to be acquired compulsorily by the Kerry Board of Health and Public Assistance and which formed the subject of a public local inquiry held by one of my inspectors.  Michael Mulvihill <Col N="1007" /> gave evidence at the inquiry.  Messrs. Stack and Finucane did not.  Two of the three sites applied for were excluded from the confirming order.  The site applied for by Michael Finucane was confirmed.  The board of health were advised to secure alternative sites for Michael Mulvihill and Michael Stack.  The alternative sites have not been acquired nor has a cottage yet been erected for Michael Finucane on the site which the board of health have been authorised to acquire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question concerns the arrears of rent in the Listowel No. 1 rural district.  The arrears here at the 31st May amounted to £931.  It is not a fact that the arrears in the Listowel No. 1 rural district are the lowest in the whole county.  Arrears of lesser sums exist in ten other rural districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he received a request from Wicklow County Council for a grant to repair and steam-roll the Avoca-Redcross road; whether he is aware that the county council are prepared to defray half the cost of the work in question; whether he is aware that the proposal is based on the grounds that the road is urgently needed in the district and that there is a large number of unemployed men in the area concerned who cannot find other work although deprived of unemployment assistance by the operation of the Employment Period Orders and whether in the circumstances he is prepared <Col N="1008" /> to sanction the proposal of the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The request referred to has been received by me. The works proposed are estimated to cost £4,000 and the county council propose to raise a loan of £2,000 to meet half of the cost.  As, however, the county council are in financial difficulties owing to their failure to make adequate provision in their estimates, I am unable at present to entertain any proposals involving an increase in the council's loan indebtedness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state why disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts was withheld from 15th January, 1936, to March, 1936, from Martin Skerritt (Ref. E.5624/36), 39 Connolly Villas, Ennis, County Clare, notwithstanding the fact that doctor's certificates were sent to the Unified Insurance Society covering the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Skerritt was paid sickness benefit for the statutory period of 26 weeks up to the 15th January, 1936, but as less than 104 weekly contributions had then been paid he was not entitled to disablement benefit in accordance with the provisions of the Acts.  The society states that the qualifying contributions were not paid until the 30th March, 1936, from which date disablement benefit was paid.  No benefit is payable for the period 16th January to 29th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An insured person in respect of whom less than 104 contributions have been paid is entitled to make payment sufficient to bring the number up to 104, provided that he proves to the society that he is ordinarily and mainly dependent for his livelihood on his earnings from employment within the meaning of the National Health Insurance Acts, and, if his unemployment arises from incapacity for work due to a specific disease or disablement, he also proves that such disease or disablement is not a recurrence or continuance of a disease or disablement from which he may have suffered <Col N="1009" /> within the 12 months immediately preceding the date of his entry into insurance.</P>
    <P>In the investigations necessary to establish Mr. Skerritt's title to pay the additional contributions, the society ascertained that he had a pension from the British Army, which fact prolonged the inquiries.  His recent entry into insurance in September, 1932, also required investigation as to possible insurable employment prior thereto. The society was not in a position to determine his right to pay the additional contributions until the 27th March, 1936.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider from January 15th to March 30th a reasonable length of time to occupy in making a certain number of inquiries, which could well be made and discoveries effected in a week?  Will the Minister look into the file personally?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the fact that the existing programme for primary schools requires the work in infant classes to be entirely in Irish only where the teachers are sufficiently qualified, it is intended that regard should be had to the capacity of the infants outside the Gaeltacht to absorb instruction through the medium of a language which they do not understand; and, if so, whether he will direct teachers to instruct such children through the medium of their home language, and at the same time impart to them elementary instruction in the Irish language as part of the programme.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 5, page 10, of the report of the National Programme Conference, 1925/26, on which the existing programme for infants is based.  The members of the conference agreed on the supreme importance of giving effect as far as possible to the principle of teaching the infant classes through the medium of Irish, and in confirmation of their belief received authoritative evidence. There is no question of absorbing instruction through the medium, of Irish.  As explained in my reply to the Deputy's question on the 12th February, 1936, neither reading nor writing in Irish or English is prescribed in the programme for infants; the main work of the teacher of infants' classes is language teaching (oral), and the kindergarten occupations, drawing, songs, games, etc., which constitute the rest of the work, are used largely as ancillary to the language lessons.  The results of the work done entirely in Irish in infants' classes, by qualified teachers, confirm the principles enunciated by the National Programme Conference, based on the evidence which they received.  In the circumstances it is not proposed to make any alteration <Col N="1014" /> in the existing programme for infants' classes.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when this Estimate was before the House, Deputy Mrs. Concannon gave certain particulars with regard to the number of students attending university courses through the medium of Irish in Galway College and drew certain deductions from these as to the extent of the courses and the high standard of the instruction given.  In view of the importance of this subject, I should like to ask the Minister whether he has had a report or whether he asked for a report from the university authorities in Galway, Cork and Dublin as to the capacity of the students going to the university from secondary schools to receive instruction through the medium of Irish in their university courses.  I ask that because from what I know of the surroundings of some of the secondary schools giving instruction through the medium of Irish, I feel that university professors, capable of giving lectures through the medium of Irish, must have a very considerable amount of difficulty in dealing with some of the material reaching them from the secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that where you have a secondary school, teaching through the medium of Irish, in which Irish is not the language used during recreation, the atmosphere of the school is such that Irish is not the normal language of the students, judged by what is the language of the pupils themselves during recreation time.  I think that is a very serious reflection on the capacity of the students to receive instruction through the medium of Irish, or, on the other hand, that it is a very great reflection on the seriousness with which the secondary school authorities regard the use of the language.  If the Minister has not had a report, or has <Col N="1018" /> not asked for a report of that kind I would ask him, in view of the amount of money that is being given to the university colleges in order to get them to do an increasing part of their work through the medium of Irish, whether he would ask for a report on the linguistic capacity, as far as Irish is concerned, of the material going to the university colleges.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the motive which lies behind the question put to me by Deputy Mulcahy, and that is to ensure that so far as possible the Irish language will be made an effective medium of speech, not merely inside the classrooms of our schools and colleges, but in all the intercourse of the students with each other.  I should like to be able to assure the Deputy that I would ask for such a report, but I am afraid that if I were to do that I should only be courting a rebuff from the university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will bear with me for a moment.  I was saying that I, as Minister for Finance, would feel precluded from asking the universities for a report of the nature he has suggested for the reason that the universities, as we have reason to know already in this House, and as I have reason to know in connection with a measure which was before the House a couple of years ago, are very jealous of what they regard as their rights and their autonomy in the matter of curricula, regulations and everything that appertains to those who are members of the student body.  Accordingly, I feel that I should be courting a rebuff if I were to ask for it.  But I have no doubt that the Minister for Education, who is primarily concerned with the propagation of Irish and the encouragement <Col N="1019" /> of the teaching of Irish in the primary and secondary schools, does everything that is possible to ensure that the students who go to the university are as well equipped as the resources and the time at the disposal of the State since 1922 have made possible, to embark on and to undertake their studies through the medium of Irish.  As the Deputy knows, they do the full intermediate course in that subject and, therefore they ought to be very well equipped indeed to take advantage of whatever facilities the university may be able to place at their disposal for the study of the curricula through the medium of the Irish language.  I am sure that in this matter I speak for the great majority of the House, both those who support the Government and for the great majority of those who, in other matters, oppose the Government, when I say that it is the desire of the legislature and the general body of the representatives of the people that the university should do everything they possibly can to foster and extend the study of Irish and the use of Irish as an educational medium.  I should like, and I am sure it will meet the Deputy's point of view, that that should go on record, and I have no doubt that those who are responsible for university education in this country will take into consideration what I believe is a very widespread desire, not confined to any Party, of most of those who represent the people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other matter raised by Deputy Mrs. Concannon, I have a great deal of sympathy with those who are appointed to lectureships through the medium of Irish in Galway College.  I think they ought not to be in any worse position than their colleagues on the academic staff but, at the same time, I am not prepared to accept the proposition that the Government must do everything in this matter and that the college should be free of all liability.  After all, we do not want to single out those who have been appointed to lectureships or chairs in the university, because of their special qualifications to teach through the medium of Irish, from the general body of the staff of <Col N="1020" /> the colleges.  We think that they are entitled to the same treatment and that the constituent colleges have exactly the same obligations towards them as they have to any other member of their body.</P>
    <P>I am not undisposed to deal fairly with the college in regard to a matter of this sort, but I must refuse to accept the full responsibility for putting those who hold these lectureships on a par with the general body of the staff. That is a matter in which the college is just as much concerned, and has at least as much responsibility, as the Government has.  Nobody can say that we have dealt niggardly with the universities or with the colleges which have shown a disposition to advance the policy of the Government in regard to Irish, and I am perfectly certain that as our precedessors were not niggardly, and as we have not been niggardly either, neither will our successors be niggardly.  But, it must be made clear to those who have the responsibility for the administration of the colleges that we feel that they should be at least as anxious as we are in this matter.  If they are really sympathetic towards what I think is the general desire of the general body of the people who provide them with all their finances, and if they really want to give effect to it, they ought to do even more than the State should in order to give effect to the general desire of the people to have the national language revived and utilised so far as possible in all concerns of everyday life.  Whenever a case has been made to the Minister for Education, in the first place, and to myself, as Minister for Finance, subsequently, I think it can be said that so far as we, and everybody with whom we are associated, have been concerned, it has received the most sympathetic consideration.  I cannot promise that we are going to relieve ourselves of the ordinary curb which reason and a prudent concern for the interests of the taxpayers in these matters impose on us, but what I do say is that we will not be unduly close-fisted whenever we see a chance of doing something reasonable to assist the colleges in this matter of Irish and of teaching through Irish; but again, I <Col N="1021" /> want to emphasise, because I do not want even the authorities of University College, Galway, to think that they are entitled to be spoon-fed, that they must open their mouths as if they were fledglings in a nest every time that this matter of Irish is mooted, that they must show that they themselves are prepared, even at the expense of the rest of the college, to make some sacrifices in order to put Irish in its proper place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to my question, I do not think that the question of the touchiness of the universities as regards their autonomy arises in this matter at all.  The universities and the university colleges are quite as much interested in the restoration of the Irish language as any Party in this House or of any section of the people in the country.  They are in this position, that they are getting into the universities the best students from the ordinary secondary schools and from the A schools.  They realise, as well as the people dealing with primary or secondary education, that the whole question of using Irish as a medium for the giving of instruction in higher education is in the experimental stage; that all that requires to be scrutinised and watched in every possible way, not from a critical point of view but from a helpful point of view.  I think that, for dealing with a matter of this sort, the Minister for Education would be the more suitable medium, but the position is that so far as this House is concerned the Minister for Finance has responsibility for the moneys voted for the universities.  This is the only opportunity we have of getting any information with regard to the universities or of linking them in any way with our discussions in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is one simply of establishing relations.  I am not asking for the setting up of any great machinery for dealing with matters that necessarily are matters rather for exchange between the academic bodies and, say, the Department of Education.  As the Minister for Education has been brought into it, and as he is present in the House, I would ask him whether he appreciates the position and whether <Col N="1022" /> he would undertake that, in future, the universities would be periodically communicated with: that there would be a regular exchange of information such as would give to him information as to the standard that was being reached in both the ordinary secondary schools and the A secondary schools&mdash;the standard of linguistic capacity that was being reached in Irish so as to enable pupils to follow the full university course through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has pointed out that it would really not be proper for him to get into touch with the universities on this matter.  I think the same consideration also applies to the Minister for Education.  The universities, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, most jealously guard their autonomy, and I think that any attempt to impose upon them any State policy would be rigorously contested. In fact, even in this House, we have had speakers from the Deputy's own Party making a very strong case against any attempt whatever by the State to interfere in matters connected with university education.  So that if the State does not interfere, but if it could be even suggested as having a desire to interfere in university matters, I certainly feel that the universities would feel aggrieved.  I have, of course, strong personal views on the matter, but I do not propose to go into them now. I suggest to the Deputy that no evidence has been brought forward to show that university students who have completed a full course in our secondary schools are not capable of following instruction through the medium of Irish.  The trouble with a good many of our students who have taken their course completely in Irish in secondary schools is that when they go to the universities they find that they are unable to pursue their studies through the medium of Irish; that facilities are not provided for them.  As regards those candidates who have not been through the full secondary course through the medium of Irish, I think that, if they have pursued the ordinary secondary course up to leaving certificate standard, they should, nevertheless, <Col N="1023" /> be sufficiently well-equipped to follow instruction through the medium of Irish where such instruction is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again protest against this attitude, that to ask the universities for information with regard to matters such as I have indicated is to attempt to interfere with their autonomy.  To do so is, I think, unfair to the universities, and is simply making a kind of complaint against the universities in order to excuse a certain amount of obscurity on the part of the Ministry in the matter of Irish.  The Minister for Education seems to level a charge against the universities that they are not as prepared as he would like them to be to give instruction through the medium of Irish and to carry on the work of the secondary schools.  If we are to accept the statement made by Deputy Mrs. Concannon on that matter, I think we must excuse completely Galway University College from that.  I would like to have some further details as to what the complaints are in this matter either in the case of Cork University College, or University College, Dublin.  The fact does remain, so far as the Minister for Education is concerned, that there are A secondary schools where the language of recreation and the language outside the classrooms is English and I think that is a reflection on the capacity of the students. As between the universities and the educational authorities here, among themselves as bodies all co-operating and working together in an administrative and a kind of research way to improve the position of Irish as a medium of instruction and as an every-day language throughout the country, I do not think it is too much to ask that there would be that co-operation between the Department of Education or the Department of Finance and the universities in this matter.</P>

I ask this question in no hostile spirit, because there is nobody inside or outside of the Dáil who would be more liberal than I in endowing the universities.  I was for many years on the governing body of the University College in Cork.  I do think it should not always be made a principle that the people who pay the piper should not have at least some voice in calling the tune.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out again what has been pointed out before, that is, that the farmers of this country for the last two years found themselves in an unprecedented position in that they had a dead-weight debt of £1,000,000 lying outside their doors in respect of rates that they have not been able to pay, and another dead-weight debt of £1,250,000 in respect of land annuities that they have been unable to pay.  We have, then, the most important class in the community, from the point of view of the economic stability of the country, reduced in the last four years to the position that they have £2,250,000 of very unaccustomed debts facing them. So far from that position improving itself, as between rates and land annuities, the debt has increased by something over £100,000, and although that increase may be a comparatively small amount, it is of dangerous significance at a time when the year-end debts have stabilised themselves in that particular way.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government indicated the other day that, in respect of rates on agricultural land, there was no prospect of the farmers being assisted by any more than the amount that is being made available to them now.  I think the Minister is taking rather too rosy a view of the position. The Government have improved the position of the farmers to some extent by the last coal-cattle pact, but that has only given the farmers back 12/- to 15/- a head on beasts on which they have been made to lose up to £6 a head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose this is the occasion upon which we could ask the Minister for Finance what is being done in connection with the new machinery that is being set up by Great Britain to deal with meat and cattle imports into Great Britain&mdash;what is being done to improve the position of the farmers in this country.  We are here voting a very substantial amount by way of relief of rates on agricultural land.  It is quite obvious from the debts I have referred to that the amounts now <Col N="1026" /> being granted, big as they are, are not adequate to meet the situation. If the Minister for Local Government says that nothing more is going to be granted this year, I would like to ask along what other lines is it anticipated that something will be done to improve the position.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot add very much to the information already given to the House, by the Vice-President and Minister for Local Government a few days ago.  In addition to that, the House has been occupied recently with a number of measures devised to improve the position of agriculturists and I have no doubt that, as a result of these measures and as a result of improving circumstances generally, local authorities will find themselves in a much better position at the close of this financial year than they were on 31st March last.  I might say that already there has been considerable improvement in the collection of land annuities. The last figures I have at my disposal indicate that on the 31st January of this year the arrears of land annuities were of the order which Deputy Mulcahy has indicated, about £1,250,000&mdash;£1,299,000 to be correct; that represented the accumulated arrears to the 31st January last.  On the 30th June that figure had been reduced to £842,000, and I have no doubt that at the end of the month it will be reduced possibly by another £60,000.</P>

      <P>On 30th June the amount was about £500,000 less, the accumulated arrears at that date being about £799,000.  I am quite prepared to admit that the position is not nearly so satisfactory as we in the Exchequer would like it to be, but it does represent a considerable improvement upon the position as it existed on the corresponding date of the previous year.  I understand that, so far as the collection of rates is concerned, there is the same story to be told, that there has been an improved collection, that the arrears are coming in, and that generally the financial <Col N="1027" /> position of the local authorities, who are the bodies immediately concerned with the grant, is also good.  I cannot say any more than that.  I do not want to paint too rosy a picture.</P>

In any event I have only to remind the House of what actually happened in connection with the Guarantee Fund, to which the local taxation grants, including this agricultural grant, are hypothecated.  In 1933-34 the net draw on the Guarantee Fund was £373,000.  In 1934-35 the net draw was £716,000, but for last year, 1935-36, the net draw had been reduced to £110,000, due of course to the improved collection of the land annuity arrears.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Deputy will always form a different conception of the position from that which I would form.  There is no use in his holding pertinaciously to his view of the situation and my trying to rebut that by question and answer or statement and counter-statement across the House.  The figures are there.  The Deputy may not agree with them; he may not agree with the conclusions which I draw from them, but they are there for the general body of the people.  I do think that; on the whole, the generality of opinion will coincide with my own, and that is that if in 1934-35 there was a net draw of £716,000 on the Guarantee Fund, and if for the year 1935-36 the amount of the draw had been reduced to £110,000, at any rate whether or not the situation was as satisfactory as we would like it to be there was a considerable improvement over 12 months.</P>

The Deputy will have an opportunity of putting his point of view, I hope, not in the House this afternoon, but elsewhere, and then the general public will know the position. I am only expressing the hope and I should say the confident belief that, when this year closes, the position will have still further improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us an idea as to the number of land annuitants that are now in arrear, because obviously, whatever way the position is going to improve, if there are men who are what Deputy Dr. <Col N="1029" /> O'Higgins describes as credit-bad in this year, it is not likely that they will pay next year?  I want the Minister to answer this question.  In view of the fact that there is a good number of tenant farmers in that position, will he between this and the next financial year consider increasing the agricultural grant to make up for that? Assuming that they are in that position, others have got to pay for them.  If their position is due to the economic situation, it is scarcely fair at this moment or in times such as these to ask their neighbours to pay for their credit-bad situation.  It is an unusual situation; the Minister will admit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the Deputy the figures he asks for, but I have paid some attention to this question of land annuity arrears, and I can say that the number of chronic defaulters would be comparatively small.  It is difficult for me to give a figure because I should have to make a mental calculation which might not be very sound, but I would say that the number of those who might be regarded as chronic defaulters does not amount to as much as 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong in that.  I think it would be nearer to 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the Deputy, but I know that the arrears of the earlier gales have been reduced to a comparatively small figure.  Of course there is a carry-over, but the mere fact, I think, that the arrears have been reduced every year since the middle of 1934 does indicate that the number of people who might be described as chronic defaulters is not so large as the Deputy thinks it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the position really this&mdash;that three years ago the arrears were £373,000; two years ago the arrears increased by £716,000. making the total arrears £1,089,000; and this year it is up again by £110,000, making up almost £1,200,000? When the Minister says the arrears are lower what he really means is that there is a smaller sum in arrear for <Col N="1030" /> the particular year than there was in arrear in the previous year, but the gross total arrear is increasing each year.  There is a relatively smaller increase, but nevertheless an increase each year over the preceding one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not controvert that statement because I have not got the figures, and the Deputy, I think, has some figures in front of him; but I think I am on safe ground in saying that the actual net accumulated arrear at 30th June this year was less than for the same date in the preceding year.  I do not want to go any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister this question?  Is 30th June a fair date to take?  The accounting dates are 31st July and 31st January.  If I were in arrear for two instalments on 31st January last, paid one of those instalments on 30th June, and am going to be in arrear on 31st July, my position is not improved, because after all we must take the accounting date. Those dates which the Minister has mentioned are particularly interesting, but so far as the Guarantee Fund is concerned the critical date is 31st January in each year, and even if, on 1st February, £500,000 were to come off the arrears, the Guarantee Fund is going to be called upon to put up that £500,000.  Would the Minister do this in addition to what I have already stated?  As the accounting date is 31st January each year, and as he gets each year before 31st March a considerable sum of money off the arrears, will he consider whether or not, in all the circumstances, some consideration ought to be paid to the farmers' needs having regard to that fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, do not ask them to pay twice.  They may be asked to pay twice in this case.  If the Minister deducts £250,000 on the 31st of January from the Agricultural Grant and that £250,000 comes in before the 1st of April off the arrears, so far as those farmers are concerned who are paying rates, and who are yet in a position to pay rates, they will pay that £250,000 for the coming year.  Now, does the Minister see my point?  My point is <Col N="1031" /> that, as from the 31st of January and the 31st of March, if a sum of money comes in, they, nevertheless, have to pay rates to that actual extent over and above what there is in credit value there in cash in the Minister's possession for them, and assuming that the £250,000 amounted to 6d. in the £ and that my valuation is £50, I am at a loss of 25/- for the year, although the money is in the Minister's pocket.</P>
    <P>I do not want to disturb the accountancy of the Land Commission or to disturb the accountancy of the Minister's Department, but I do say that in times of special stringency and of difficulty, if the money is paid in before the 31st of March, the Minister should look into the matter of seeing whether it would be possible to spread out the accounting day from the 31st of January to the 31st of March.  I quite understand that it may not be easily possible, but if there is money there it appears to me to be scarcely fair, in the first place, to be taxing them in their rates and, in the second place, to be collecting their annuities from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly look into the position which Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out to me, and I shall try to see whether, without upsetting all the canons of practice and precedent in the Department, we cannot do something to meet the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>Well, as the House is aware, the Dáil Eireann Loans Act, 1933, provided that the final date for lodging a claim should be 31st of August, 1934, and that subsequently, in view of the number of late applications which were received, it was decided, by statute, to extend the date for lodging applications to the 30th June of this year.  That Act, which extended the date, also provided that no payment should be made after the 31st of March, 1937, and that an account of the repayments, with all the necessary vouchers and records, shall be rendered to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The purpose of this Estimate is to provide the necessary staff to enable the Administration to give effect to the purposes of that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy will understand that these are estimates and, with regard to the figure of £1,000,000 which was originally given, <Col N="1033" /> of course we were not then in a position to make any very exact estimate of the number of people who might come forward for repayment.  In addition to that, I think that that figure of £1,000,000 was given in my first Budget statement and, if my memory serves me correctly, sterling was then standing at a very heavy discount to the dollar, whereas to-day it is at par. The loan is in dollars, and if sterling were at a discount, as it was in 1932 and up to the earlier months of 1933, our sterling obligations would be very much heavier than they are to-day, when sterling and the dollar are very nearly at par.  The total number of claims which we received so far are of the order of about 90,000.  I give these figures with reserve because, since the extension of the date to the 30th of June of this year, other applications may have been lodged.  However the number of applications is of the order of 90,000 and the total amount involved in those disbursements has been calculated at about $2,000,000; that is approximately £400,000.  I think that the figure of £400,000 or £450,000 will meet all our obligations in regard to that matter.</P>

Under the terms of the Act the accounts and the necessary <Col N="1035" /> vouchers have to be referred to the Comptroller and Auditor-General within a statutory period after that date.  The Deputy may take it that it is very unlikely that any applications which have been lodged within that date will not have been disposed of by 31st March, 1937, because, as Deputies are aware, the position in regard to the American Loan is very different from the position that existed in regard to the Internal Loan.  We have very complete records in America and as they have been preserved, claims can be expeditiously investigated.  As Deputy Cosgrave knows from experience, that did not, unfortunately, apply to the Internal Loan, so that very often claims presented great difficulty in their validation.  I do not think these difficulties are going to be experienced in the United States. I agree with the Deputy that it would be a graceful thing.  If it were found that claims which were the subject of dispute or examination, lodged prior to June 30th of this year, were still the subject of dispute or examination on March 31st, 1937, I feel that, we should be bound by the spirit if not by the letter of the law, to ensure that these claims would not be regarded as finally disposed of in favour of the Exchequer as against the claimants, simply by reason of the fact that the statute states that no payments shall be made after March 31st, 1937.  I can give the Deputy now a more exact figure for the total amount of the Loan subscribed&mdash;£5,200,000, approximately.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is strictly appropriate to this Vote or not, but I think the Minister for Finance, in his capacity as such, is endeavouring to hoodwink the people on a very important matter. He is co-operating generally in a policy that on the outside bears the stamp of being an industrial development policy, but which is, in fact, purely a taxation policy; a policy of taxation imposed in a very subtle and widespread way on the people, every class being unable to bear the burden.</P>

What really does it matter what finicky details of administration are dealt with wrongly or rightly in his Department, if the general effect of his policy is to impose these burdens on the people?  They are imposed as if they were for the purpose of industrial production but, not having that effect, they are simply searching the pockets of every person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous to the Minister coming into office, very elaborate promises were held out to the Civil Service about promoting greater peace in that service than there was there previous to this Government coming in.  An arbitration board was to be set up.  If my recollection is correct the people who decided on this arbitration board were the civil servants themselves, but the Ministry, one and all, from top to bottom, said ditto to that.  We have been waiting a long time for the board.  It has not turned up yet.  Perhaps the Minister could inform us when it is likely he will be able to arrive at such a decision as will give greater satisfaction to the Civil Service than appertains now.  The second point to which I direct the Minister's attention is that he proposes to spend nearly £6,000 more on his Department than was spent last year.  It is some time since I dealt with the increased cost of the Civil Service since the Minister came into office.  My recollection is that it was nearly £750,000 over and above what it was four years ago. If one were to say what the prospects are like for the current year, as compared with the intervening four years, they can be seen in the extended Estimate for the Civil Service Commission. <Col N="1038" /> That Vote has gone up by over 50 per cent. during that period.</P>
      <P>While one may enter no objection to an extension of such a service as the Civil Service if value is given for the expenditure entailed, the question arises at once: from which of the two industrial arms is any extra value coming?  If our agriculture were prosperous we might perhaps be satisfied to see an extension of the Civil Service. If our secondary industrial arm were extending we might find some compensation in that extension which would provide the extra money that is needed to provide for a more extended Civil Service.  I think it will be found that there has been no such relative extension in our productive capacity. While a greater amount of propaganda may be indulged in as to the extension of the secondary industrial arm, and while various statements may be made as to increased employment under that head, we do not find them reflected in what, after all, is the acid test in connection with the extension of employment in this country, namely, in the increased sums collected in unemployment insurance contributions. There has been an increase, but if one deducts from it the contributions traceable directly to the building industry one finds that there has been a negligible, if any, increase in other classes of employment.  At the same time our indebtedness is increasing.  It has increased under the Minister's administration and a great deal of it is dead-weight debt.  Nobody questions expenditure on such necessary developments as the social improvements that should take place in any country, but one is entitled to sound a note of warning in connection with the present situation where costs of all sorts are on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of our Civil Service is not alone increasing; indebtedness is growing at the same time and the expenditure which we are called upon to face has not yet made an impression on the purposes for which we might justify an extension of our indebtedness. Our dead-weight debt is growing. That is a matter which should be the concern of the Minister for Finance more than any other Minister of State.  His job is two-fold.  He has <Col N="1039" /> to impose taxes and collect revenue and he has to exercise the greatest possible care in the distribution and expenditure of the money collected to ensure that the public services are run efficiently and at the minimum cost. We cannot ignore the special circumstances that now obtain in this country; the fact that the agricultural industry was never in a worse plight than now, that profits from it are lower than they have been at any time in living memory, the fact that such extensions as have taken place in the industrial arm do not compensate for more than five per cent.&mdash;certainly it would be impossible for them to compensate for more than ten per cent.&mdash; of the losses incurred in the agricultural industry and the fact that the main costs of government must fall upon those whose livelihood is derived from the land and whose profits can only be realised from the land.  In these circumstances, with an increasing demand not only for the Minister's Department but for the other Departments of State, with an increasing indebtedness, with an increasing taxation, with increasing costs upon the future as well as upon the present, the Minister would be well advised to take, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, the Executive Council into his confidence and warn them of the direction in which the country is proceeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle which Deputy Cosgrave has laid down, that it is not merely my job to impose taxes and to collect them, but also so far as I can, to ensure that the expenditure of the various spending Departments does not exceed what is requisite to give effect to the policy of the Government, the policy of the Dáil to which the Government is responsible, and the policy of the country, to which the Dáil is itself in turn responsible, because we cannot dissociate the policy of the Government or the policy of the Dáil from the policy of the country.  We were returned by the electors to undertake certain things and to fulfil certain commitments to them.  I would say that we have zealously endeavoured <Col N="1040" /> to fulfil these commitments.  Every item in our election manifesto, with possibly one exception&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we have, I think, succeeded in fulfilling.  There is one matter in respect to which, because of special circumstances, we have not been able to do everything which we hoped to do, but I am not without hope that, when circumstances change and times improve, we shall succeed in doing even that.  But I think, Sir, it would be wrong for the Dáil to think that I can either efficiently control the expenditure of the spending Departments and fulfil what I regard as possibly the most important function of the Minister for Finance&mdash;to exercise that control having regard to the resources of the State&mdash;unless the office of the Minister for Finance is adequately staffed.  I think that if those who had experience of former administrations, bearing in mind the very numerous and very varied functions which my Department has to perform, look at the figures which are set out in the Estimate, they will see that we are not, bearing in mind our commitments, an extravagant Department. There is an increase in sub-head A for salaries.  That is very largely due to the fact that our Department was one of those which was established at the change of Government. It was manned by officials who came in at the lower end of their salary scales in many cases, and each year, as the annual increments of the officers of the Department fall due, the total amount required for the sub-head of Salaries, Wages and Allowances must, in the ordinary course of events, increase also.  I think it will also be seen that the increase in the numbers of the staff is a modest one.  We have to provide this year for 131 officers as against 123 last year.  It will be noted that of the total increase 25 per cent. is represented by the addition to the number of junior administrative officers, highly-qualified young men whom we are anxious to get into the Service in order that they may receive a proper training to become the future <Col N="1041" /> administrators of the various Departments of State.  Another increase will be found in the ranks of the clerical officers, where the number has gone up from 22 last year to 26.  I do not think that any person, who understands the amount of work the Department has to do, and particularly its increasing responsibility in connection with the new services which have been brought into being, will say that the increase is unjustified or unwarranted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other question which Deputy Cosgrave put to me, I would say, undoubtedly, we did indicate prior to the 1932 Election that we would be prepared to agree to an arbitration board being set up to deal with matters between the Civil Service and the Executive.  But I have to say again what I have said before, that we never gave a blank cheque to any person. The question of arbitration is a very complicated one.  We set up a most competent committee to investigate the matter in all its bearings.  That committee brought in a number of reports, one signed by the overwhelming majority of the committee, and, so far as we are concerned, it is the Government's intention to implement that at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>There is an item in this Estimate, &ldquo;JJ&mdash;Motor Cars for Frontier Patrols.&rdquo;  In the Finance Bill I believe further and better provision is made for the prevention and detection of smuggling and of all sorts of activities of that kind.  In a case of that sort everybody is prepared to stand up and denounce smuggling. Nobody has any sympathy for the smuggler when he is caught, but special circumstances relating to the Border have got to be taken into account.  For the last two or three years that Border has been the salvation of the agricultural industry in this country, and has been so utilised.  If it is to be thought that you can engage in all sorts of activities on one side, and not on the other, I think you are making a mistake. The Minister, like every other Minister for Finance, thinks that any evasion or dereliction on the part of an unfortunate taxpayer in connection with the revenue laws is a mortal offence.</P>

      <P>It is the one thing they will not forgive.  Nobody agrees with Border activities when they are discovered, but people are inclined to take a quite lenient view if the acts are not discovered.  The expenses in connection with this business here are enormous.  Would the Minister at all consider the advisability of lessening, at any rate, whatever inducement there is for that sort of activity so far as one side of the Border is concerned?  He is in a very responsible position in the Cabinet.  He is looked up to, and is expected to provide large sums of money for subsidies and things of that kind.  He has to provide extra machinery to deal with the situation arising out of what he was pleased to describe as Government policy.  Government policy has increased this illicit traffic on the Border&mdash;it is directly attributable to it.  It is impossible to have a situation in which there are enormous duties and enormous costs without activities of that sort.  Now, while spending very big sums of money to prevent breaches of the law on one <Col N="1043" /> side or the other of the Border, it might be that both Governments could, by reason of negotiations, lessen the reasons for these activities.  Let the Minister see what can be done on that subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Will he also see if it is the general policy of the Revenue Commissioners to treat as a mortal sin the bringing in of tariffed goods across the Border, unlawfully in some cases while it is allowed in others.  If we take the County Monaghan alone we find that there is one unfortunate young fellow doing nine months in jail because he brought in some sugar, I suppose on some Saturday.  There are merchants in Carrickmacross who, if they brought in sugar would be prosecuted. But there is, at least, one merchant in Carrickmacross who has <i>carte blanche,</i> either from persons connected with the Border or the revenue to bring in as much sugar as he likes. You have a position in Carrickmacross, as one Border town, where persons who deal in sugar are lying under a very definite grievance if one of their fraternity has the privilege, no matter what may happen, to get in sugar in fair quantities, from time to time, and to dispose of that sugar in the ordinary way without paying any customs duty. Therefore, I should like to ask the Minister how many cases there have been in Monaghan in which persons have been prosecuted in the last 12 months for importing stuff in that way? In how many cases has there been any prosecution or anything beyond simple seizure of the stuff and in how many cases is the whole thing being winked at?  But the fact remains you have one unfortunate fellow in jail for bringing in one small quantity of sugar, and you have the very definite grievance among traders in Monaghan when one of their fraternity is actually able to import sugar without any proceedings being taken against him.</P>

I have investigated sometimes cases in which harshness has been alleged against the Revenue Commissioners, and in others in which leniency was alleged.  I have come to the conclusion that while the Revenue Commissioners are given wide discretion, they have invariably acted as justice requires.  They have not been moved in any way by outside influences or by anything but the facts.  We have to remember, in regard to smuggling, that even though the facts may appear on the surface to be alike, they are not always the same.</P>

If the Deputy would be good enough to give me, in confidence, particulars of the case he has mentioned across the floor of the House, I shall have it investigated and put the Deputy in possession of the facts.

I made up my mind at the outset that that was the line on which I would go, and I have not departed from it.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners will advert to the discussion which has taken place here, and, if they feel they can exercise a certain amount of leniency, I am sure they will do so, but I am not going to ask them to do other than they think right.</P>

In an area where people know that some people are able to import sugar&mdash;they are trading in it, and it is quite easy to see&mdash;an ordinary person coming along from market and bringing a couple of pounds of sugar may be detected by a customs official.

      <P>The matter is rather difficult and complicated by reason of the fact that the accommodation at Dun Laoghaire is somewhat limited.  The packet boats come along one side of the jetty, while the train is waiting at the other side.  Passengers would not like to have to walk off the jetty, down to some examining station and then come back to the train.  In general, we have been urging on those concerned in the matter&mdash;the Government are not the only people concerned&mdash;that proper facilities should be provided for examination of passengers' luggage.  While the examination should be effective, we are anxious that it should be conducted with as little inconvenience as possible to the passengers.  We do not like to see our own officers working under uncomfortable conditions because, under those conditions, work is sometimes scamped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the section which it is proposed to amend will, I understand, be a serious matter for some of the theatres here in Dublin.  Heretofore <Col N="1050" /> theatres which had a charter had built up their programmes in such a way as to give almost a three-hour show.  This alteration involves a considerable amount of money for artistes whose services will not be required if the section stands as it is.  In the ordinary cinema artistes and bands and others are not now required.  I know, of course, there is under the section a refund of 50 per cent., but it will be very difficult for either of the houses concerned here in Dublin to provide first-class entertainment if they are restricted to 65 per cent. production of pictures.  If they are so confined they cannot show some of the most attractive films, as there is a tendency now to make first-class pictures run from two hours to two-and-a-half hours.  This tax is going to cost a substantial sum and it will mean, if the scheme stands as it is, that the theatre proprietors will have to recoup themselves by the dismissal of a large number of their employees. In fact, already some of the employees have been told their services will not be required after a certain date. Unless the theatres concerned keep up a certain standard of variety turns people will go to the cheaper theatres and this will result in the shrinkage of revenue in the case of the theatres with which this amendment is con-concerned. I suggest to the Minister that he ought to accept this amendment. As I have pointed out to him just now, if people go away from these large theatres in consequence of the artistes having been eliminated it will result in great loss.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the 8th May, 1931, after Mr. Blythe introduced his Budget for 1931-32, Deputy Derrig, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, congratulated Mr. Blythe on the effort he made in his Budget to endeavour to enable artistes and people of that kind to make a living in their own country.  At that time, as the Minister knows, there was a tendency to do away with bands and the personal turns of artistes, in the interest of pictures.  It was the move made by Mr. Blythe at that particular time which prevented the development of that tendency, and Deputy Derrig, on behalf of his Party, congratulated the Minister on his action.  If the <Col N="1051" /> Minister persists in his attitude it will mean that a large number of people, including the bands, will be disemployed. It will mean throwing more people on the unemployment lists, and eventually it will mean a shrinkage in the revenue received by the Minister. For that reason I suggest in the interest of everybody, including the artistes, and of even the Revenue itself, that the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to accept this amendment.  I brought in an amendment on the Committee Stage which apparently satisfied Deputy Corish, who had put down an amendment, which he withdrew.  I feel that we have gone as far as we possibly can to meet these people.  I, for one, am not a bit afraid that the theatres are going to dispense with the live show.  The half remission which we give these people fully covers all the salaries of the bands and the stage hands, as well as leaving a little over for the artistes.  In addition to that, because of the fact that they provide a live show, they have the very substantial advantage of having got their theatre patent.  If they are going to close down their live show and dispense with the band they are going to lose that theatre patent and it is worth a great deal to them.  I think that by working on the natural fears of staff and representing to them that they are to lose their employment, the latter have succeeded in getting Deputies to make a case for them here. I feel, having personally examined all the figures concerned, that this case would not bear investigation.  I want again to make it clear that the remission to the theatres which run those shows will secure and will fully cover the salaries of the members of the <Col N="1052" /> bands and of the stage hands and leave something over for covering the cost of the native artistes.  My feeling is that this concession was given on much too generous a scale originally, as no person could contemplate the situation which ultimately developed.  It was worth about £24,000 per year.  Sums were going out of this country every year in the payment of artistes from abroad.  The intention was to subsidise live entertainments given more or less by native-born artistes. While I assume that the band mainly consists of Irishmen and those who reside here, and, therefore, I would be very sorry to see it going, nevertheless we must not allow ourselves to be misled into believing that those who benefited most under the old proposals were native-born people or people who are even resident in Dublin.  Apart from this the concessions which I have made in regard to the percentage of the live show element in their programme will enable those who run cine-variety entertainments to meet the changed conditions which have arisen since 1931-32, due to the fact that feature pictures have now a longer run.  Under our proposals, if they want to run a three-hour show, they can have a picture running to 117 minutes.  If they want a shorter show, they can content themselves with a shorter feature picture.  In any event if it is borne in mind that tax concession costs the revenue so much that it pays the full cost of the band and stage hands, while leaving something over as fees for native artists, I think it will be agreed that we have acted generously and done everything that the State ought to be asked to do in order to subsidise live entertainments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, before Section 13, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1916, as amended by Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1924, shall as on and from the passing of this Act be and is hereby repealed.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, I referred to the position of the Aerated Waters Trade Board, being a member of that body.  I read a letter from the secretary giving certain particulars concerning the grievances they have in connection with the duty which has been imposed on their products.  In that letter it is stated that this duty amounts to ½d. on each ordinary half-pint bottle of soda water, and to ¼d. on lemonade and other sweetened mineral waters. The letter went on to state that the claim made by the association for the abolition of the duty is that practically every article for the production of mineral water is now taxed&mdash;sugar, flavouring essences, bottles, crown corks, and increased cost in coal, petrol, insurance on transport and workmen's compensation.  I would direct the Minister's attention to certain figures which were given to me to-day by the secretary of the Trade Board.  In 1932 the value of the output was £231,000.  This decreased in 1933 to £226,000.  In 1934 it was £230,000.  The number employed in 1932 was 996; it increased in 1933 to 1,018.  In 1934 the number was 1,076, and in this year 1,037.  The number of firms in the trade in 1927 was 169; in 1928, 170; in 1929, 143; in 1935, 129; and in 1936, 105.  It is a struggling trade at present, and its effort to keep going is somewhat handicapped by the heavy duty imposed.  When the matter was last discussed there were certain statements made, incidentally, on another portion of the Finance Bill with reference to the medicinal value of strong drinks. From inquiries that I have made, a doctor has informed me that there is only one genuine and real stimulant known to medical science, and that is tea.  Other doctors say water is a great preventative of disease, and that if you drink plenty of water and use it externally you will never be sick. What I am advocating here now is that this duty should be remitted on sweetened waters which have additional medicinal powers as compared with common water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember hearing a Deputy speak here last week of the great value of <i>uisce beatha,</i> which is sometimes called the water of life.  He said that our forefathers drank plenty of it. That probably accounts for all the trouble that we are in now.  If our <Col N="1055" /> forefathers had not consumed so much of it we might have different brains and different minds.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.  It would be of great help to this trade, which promises to be a flourishing one, especially in the South of Ireland, where its headquarters are situated.</P>

I understand that this is a proposal to reduce by 50 per cent. a customs duty in order to assist the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the effect of the amendments which he has on the Order Paper.  They would, in fact, abolish the customs duty, but they would leave native-manufactured table waters liable to the excise duty.  That is to say, they would put the home-manufactured table waters at a disadvantage as compared with the imported table waters.  I think when the Deputy arranged to submit these amendments he was under a misapprehension as to what the real position is. I had the representatives of this industry before me, and I think it can be fairly clearly established that, allowing for the vicissitudes of the weather, which have a very great effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On lots of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on lots of things, but, at any rate, they have a particular effect upon this.  If the weather is unfavourable we drink less lemonade, just as other people drink less beer, stout and porter; if the weather is favourable the consumption of these highly-esteemed temperance beverages goes up.  I do say that the one thing that is established by the figures is that over a period of years the native manufacturers of these table waters have certainly improved their position.  The Deputy started off by giving figures for 1929.  In that year the quantity of imported table waters, sweetened and unsweetened, retained for consumption, amounted to 82,000 gallons, while the quantity of home-made table waters upon which excise duty was paid was 1,211,000 gallons.  The total quantity of home-made and imported table waters retained for consumption therefore was 1,294,381 gallons.  There was a progressive decline in the quantities of imported table waters and that decline was continued until, in the year 1935, the total quantity of imported table waters <Col N="1057" /> retained for consumption in this country had diminished to 16,702 gallons; that is to say, it had been reduced to approximately 20 per cent. of what it had been in the year 1929.  As against that, the quantity of home-made table waters which were retained for consumption here had increased from 1,211,000 to 1,413,000 gallons, showing an increase of approximately 16 per cent. on a very large quantity.</P>
      <P>The position, so far as we can ascertain it, for 1935-36, is not likely to be any worse.  The importation for the nine months which ended in December, 1935, was 12,700 gallons, and the quantity retained for consumption here &mdash;I have to make a mental calculation &mdash;for the same nine months was 1,158,000 gallons.  The number of people licensed as mineral water manufacturers has declined from 167 on 31st March, 1929, to 135 who were licensed for the nine months from April to December, 1935.  That indicates that there has been an expanding trade divided amongst fewer firms.  There have been a number of amalgamations since 1929 which have enabled these firms to reduce overhead and other manufacturing expenses.  We may assume when the rate of duty is not very much larger than it was in 1931, and with a considerably increased trade and fewer people competing for that trade, that after all the profits of these manufacturers of table waters have not decreased to any significant extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Deputy has been moved to bring in these amendments by what he has been told by those who appeared before him on the trade board.  I have had a fairly exhaustive investigation made of the position, and I am satisfied that the position is no worse, notwithstanding the changes which have taken place in the meantime, than it was in 1929 or 1930, and the probability is that it is something better.  As to the real effect of the amendments which the Deputy put down, I think that they would not meet the purpose he has in view.  If they were to be adopted, they would mean that, while the Customs duties would be wiped out, the Excise duties at the rate of 4d. a gallon on sweetened and 8d. a gallon on unsweetened table <Col N="1058" /> waters imposed in 1916 would be still in force.  The position would be that home manufactured sweetened table waters would be deprived of a protective margin of duty which they enjoyed since 1924 and home-manufactured unsweetened table waters would bear a duty of 8d. a gallon, while similar imported table waters would be admitted free of duty. I do not think that is the purpose which Deputy Kelly hoped to achieve. I think it would be disastrous if we were to give effect to those amendments, and I would ask the Deputy, in view of the latter part of my statement, to withdraw them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is no alternative when the Minister makes that appeal.  It was as a result of what transpired at the trade board that I submitted these amendments. The difficulty we have on these trade boards must appeal to every member of the House and that difficulty is that we are concerned to see that the rate of wages paid is decent, especially to junior operatives in the trade.  Unless a trade is a bit prosperous some of the work which the trade boards are intended to do cannot be done and that is the difficulty. The reduction of this duty, or its total abolition, would, in the view of those who know the trade a great deal better than I do, have a very beneficial effect.  Otherwise we are faced with this, that during the coming year the rate of wages paid in this trade will be, I think, the smallest rate paid in any trade.  That is the position.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to oppose the withdrawal of the amendments in the circumstances referred to by the Minister, but I do think that the House will regret that it is not possible to discuss this matter in circumstances under which we could discuss it on its merits.  It is an interesting thing to find a person so closely connected with wage boards and the problem of wages as is Deputy Kelly submitting a proposal to the House to reduce the Customs duty on a particular article in order to permit an industry to improve and to give a decent wage.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to add at the end of Section 16 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The amendment and repeal effected by the foregoing subsections of this section shall not apply or have effect in relation to any vehicle which is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have been assembled before the 13th day of May, 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave notice that on this stage of the Bill he would move an amendment which would cover the case of a number of certificates which had been issued on and after the 13th May, 1936, under Section 7 of the Finance (Customs and Excise Duties) Act, 1933, in respect of cars the assembly of which was completed before that date, and which complied with the conditions operative at the time of the assembly. In view of the terms of Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1936, the validity of those particular certificates appeared to be open to question, and the Minister accordingly intimated on the Committee Stage of the Bill that he intended to propose an amendment to provide that certificates issued on or after the 13th May, 1936, in respect of <Col N="1060" /> cars assembled before that date should be valid.  The present amendment is designed to cover that position.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 32, Section 23, to delete the word &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;sending.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment&mdash;it is perhaps a little more than a drafting amendment &mdash;of which I gave notice on the Committee Stage in relation to Section 23 of the Finance Act, which deals with the payment of licence duty by cheque, the position being that up to the present it has been necessary to require a person who applies for a licence to pay the licence duty in cash.  That, on occasions, may subject the person who is applying for the licence to a certain amount of inconvenience.  We desire to meet that by giving statutory authority for the acceptance of payment of the licence duty by cheque in this case, but subject to certain conditions which will safeguard the Revenue, one of those conditions being that in the event of the cheque being dishonoured the person by whom such licence was granted shall, as soon as may be, after such dishonouring comes to his knowledge, send to the person to whom such licence was granted notice in writing requiring him to deliver up such licence within seven days.  We desire to substitute the word &ldquo;sending&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;receipt.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we do not wish to be at a loss if the person's cheque is dishonoured.  First of all, if the licence is issued at all the person has authority to do certain things under the licence.  Hitherto, in order to safeguard the Revenue, the custom has been that payment of the duty was only taken in cash.  Now we propose to facilitate the licensee in this case by accepting payment by cheque. If, however, the cheque should be dishonoured on presentation, obviously <Col N="1061" /> we ought to be in a position summarily to withdraw the licence, and that is the position which we wish to establish here.  I think that once the person by whom the licence was granted has sent the notice, that ought to be sufficient to validate the withdrawal of the licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we agree with the Government in taking power to accept payment by cheque.  The Minister is quite right in saying that it is sometimes a considerable inconvenience to ask people to make payment in cash.  I take it that he has taken power also to say that it is not necessary to have the cheque marked &ldquo;good,&rdquo; except, perhaps, in certain cases.  While the Government might conceivably be dealing with a person whose financial stability they were not sure about, and might require him to get the cheque marked &ldquo;good,&rdquo; in other cases where they are getting cheques from an individual two or three times a week I do not think there is any necessity for it.  There is another point which I should like to put to the Minister.  I think it is clear that the Government merely want to avoid having to prove receipt of the notice.  While I agree with the Minister that possibly the wording of this amendment is desirable, I have not much sympathy with the person who has to be written to about a dishonoured cheque.  At the same time, some difficulty might occasionally arise in the case of a person to whom a notice had been sent, but who did not receive it because it got lost or mislaid.  I just merely wish to ask the Minister to see that the matter would be all right in a case like that&mdash;which is not a very usual one&mdash;where the person could genuinely prove that he did not receive the notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point which Deputy Dockrell raises, the section as originally drafted indicated that the person was to get seven days to return this licence, including the time of posting back.  The next sub-section says that if he does not deliver it up within the proper time he is liable on summary conviction to an Excise penalty of £50.  I do not know <Col N="1062" /> by whom that is to be imposed, but at any rate some people in the country may impose a punishment of £50.  It, for the purpose of making it easier to prove that a notice has been sent out, the word &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; is being changed to &ldquo;sending,&rdquo; the seven days ought to be extended to ten days, because this is, in fact, reducing probably by three days in some cases the period of time available for the return.  I, therefore, think that the least concession which ought to be given would be to increase the seven days to ten days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Dockrell, I think he may be under a misapprehension.  This will legalise the payment of licence duty only by cheque.  The section does not affect the payment of Customs or Excise duties; they would continue to be paid in the ordinary way.  It is only in a case where a person applies for a licence that payment of the duty will be accepted by cheque.  Of course, I should like to point out that the purpose of insisting on the giving up of the licence is to prevent the person who holds it from making a wrongful use of it&mdash; possibly, not to the detriment of the State, but to the detriment of some other citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he not consider <Col N="1063" /> what one might call extending the powers of the Government in connection with these cheques?  because, undoubtedly, where the Government are in a perfectly safe position, I do not think they should seek to impose any different conditions on the ordinary trading community from what they would be if they themselves were trading.  I perfectly accept the position that they should not have to undergo any risks.  At the same time, in most of these transactions the risks are absolutely negligible and a certain amount of inconvenience is imposed on the trading community.  I should like to ask the Minister to look into that in a general way with a view to seeing how far he could extend the use of cheques to these transactions without decreasing in any way the position that the Government wish to be in, of being sure of their money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point which Deputy Dockrell has raised is a very much wider one than could be discussed here, because one difficulty is that you must treat all taxpayers alike, and you could not give a facility to one person, whose credit and probity were known, and not extend the same facility to some person who was less credit-worthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is provided, Sir, in the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts, 1934 and 1935, that the Acts will expire on 31st December next.  The Acts were designed to provide additional outlets for surplus stocks of cattle which had accumulated as a result of adverse market conditions. One such outlet was afforded by the provisions, firstly, in Part IX of the Principal Act for the distribution of beef free, and later, in the Amendment Act, for the sale of beef at a prescribed price, to recipients.  Considerable reductions have been made in stocks as a result of improved markets, and the steps taken under the Acts, and the necessity for the beef distribution scheme as an agricultural measure has to a great extent disappeared.  Power is, therefore, sought to enable the scheme to be determined at any time before the 31st December, 1936, if the Executive Council so decide.  I might mention, in passing, however, that although the necessity for the distribution of cheap beef or free beef has disappeared as an agricultural measure, a new scheme was foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, under which meat will be distributed more as a social measure when this scheme is discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the cessation of the beef distribution scheme, the operation of certain other Parts of the Principal Act which are complementary to Part IX may also cease; for instance.  Part II, registration of premises; Part III, levy on cattle and sheep slaughtered for home consumption; Part IV, restrictions on the slaughter of cattle and sheep, and Part V, restrictions on the price of cattle and sheep.  Similar power of determination is sought regarding these Parts and also regarding the provisions &mdash;with the exception of Section 17, which dealt with the manufacture of meat&mdash;of the Amendment Act of 1935, which are either amendments or extensions <Col N="1065" /> of the powers given under Parts II, III, IV, V and IX of the Principal Act.  Section 5 of this Bill preserves the power to institute proceedings and to continue proceedings already taken and to recover levy which may have become due at the expiry or at the cesser by Order of the Executive Council of any part of the Principal Act or any provision of the Amending Act.</P>
    <P>Under Parts VII and VIII of the Principal Act agreements have been made with the Roscrea Meat Company, Ltd., and the Irish Co-operative Meat, Ltd., of Waterford, for dealing, in the first case, with old cows, and, in the second case, for canning meat and the manufacture of meat extracts and so on.  These agreements will not expire in the case of Boscrea, until 1939, and in the case of the Waterford Company until 1940, and it will be necessary, therefore, to continue in operation Parts VII and VIII of the Principal Act.  It is proposed in this Bill that these Parts, and Section 17 of the Amending Act which amends Part VII of the Principal Act, shall remain in operation until the Oireachtas otherwise determines.  It is proposed also to retain the powers, given in Part VI of the Principal Act, to restrict export of cattle and sheep.  These powers have not been used, but it is felt that it might become necessary, owing to the changing conditions in continental markets and so on, to use these powers at any time.  The inspection powers sought in Section 7 of the Bill are required for the purpose of ensuring that persons will not carry on the manufacture of cattle and sheep products without a licence under Part VII of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill requires any further explanation.  Whatever views Deputies may have on it, the Bill is at least rather simple to follow and to find out what the provisions are.  I should like however, to give some few figures on the working of these Acts since they first came into operation.  It was estimated that a sum of £100,000 would be payable in respect of levy during the financial year, 1934-35.  This was a slight over-estimate, the actual figure being £98,328.  During that period the <Col N="1066" /> numbers of animals slaughtered were: Cattle, 58,878; calves, 2,292; sheep, 157,345.</P>
    <P>In the following year it was estimated that we would have an income of £285,000 from the levy, but this was also an under-estimation to the extent of £9,000.  In the financial year 1935-36 there were 167,839 cattle slaughtered, 9,503 calves, 469,691 sheep, and 59,433 lambs, for the year.  With regard to the elimination scheme of old cows which were sent to the factory at Roscrea, the number of cattle collected from 29th July, 1935, to 31st March, 1936, was 23,344, and the number collected in this financial year, from 1st April, 1936, to 27th June, 1936, was 10,524.  The total to the end of June was 33,868.  The Waterford canning factory was in operation to some extent during last winter, but not to the full capacity, and dealt with 2,347 cattle.  Of course that factory is capable of dealing with very many more cattle in future, but a great deal will depend on the relative price of cattle, the demand for canned beef, and the price of meat extract.  It will be dealing with more cattle this year, but at present it is hard to say what the numbers will be.  It is rather a seasonal business in this way, that cattle are not suitable until July or August, and only suitable then up to the month of January.  Under the free beef scheme for the financial year 1934-35 we distributed 10,745,044 lbs. of beef at a cost to the Exchequer of £173,629, and for the financial year 1935-36 we distributed 19,675,145 lbs. at a cost to the Exchequer of £301,380. That is a summary of the figures dealt with under this Act, and I have only to say that it is hoped when this Bill goes through the Dáil to determine some parts of the Principal Act by August 1st.  It may be possible to discontinue the levies from that date. From that time it will be possible to discharge part of the staff and to transfer the permanent officers from that business into other Departments where they may be required, so that a considerable saving may be made in administration during this year.  There will be no change, practically, in the amount of meat that will be distributed <Col N="1067" /> under the new scheme as compared with the present one, and it is estimated that it will cost in or about the same amount in future.  That is, the cost of the meat will be the same, but it will have this very big advantage, that the cost of administration will be considerably less.</P>

      <P>In page 4 to delete lines 26 to 32 inclusive and substitute the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Acts and without prejudice to the powers of refusing applications for registration conferred on him by the Acts, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, refuse an application by a person for registration in respect of any premises on either or both of the following grounds, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that such person or any other person was previously registered in respect of those premises and such registration was cancelled by the Minister under the Acts;</P>
      <P>(b)  that such person was previously registered in respect of other premises and such registration was cancelled by the Minister under the Acts.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Acts&rdquo; means the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933 to 1935;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; means registered in a register kept by the Minister under the Acts and the <Col N="1068" /> word &ldquo;registration&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 9 met with some criticism during the Committee Stage, and I undertook to try to meet the views of Deputies.  That section gives the Minister power to refuse registration in any of the registers at his discretion. The original Act set down the reasons that the Minister might give for refusing registration.  The principal reason was, if there were sufficient people registered to supply the needs of the district up to that period.  This new section was considered by some Deputies to be too sweeping, and it was thought that I might limit the reasons for refusing to the point that where a person who had been already cut off any register the Minister should have power to refuse to allow him to go on the register, or where premises had been put off the register the Minister should have power to refuse registration to such premises.  I explained then that very often it was not enough to have power to refuse a person a licence, because a son or wife or brother might come along for a licence for the same premises.  That was obviously a device to get a licence back again for the same person.  This amendment is provided to meet these objections, and it limits the Minister's power to refuse a licence to the power he already had under the original Act, that there are sufficient on the register to supply the needs of a district or that a person has already been removed from the list or premises removed from the list.</P>
