      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is in a position to state if any additional benefits in cash or in kind are being provided for the members of the Unified Society; whether he will state the number of members of approved societies entitled to additional benefits during the last five-year period and the amount of money appropriated for providing benefits during that period, and whether he will state the amount of money available for providing additional benefits during the current five-year period.</P>

      <P>No additional benefits of any kind are being provided for members of Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte since the termination on the 5th July, 1936, of the additional benefit schemes adopted by certain approved societies as a result of the third valuation.  The average number of members of such approved societies entitled to additional benefits during the five years to 5th July, 1936, is estimated at 87,000. The amount of money available for additional benefits during the five-year period was £400,217.  As the recent valuation of Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte as at December 31, 1933, disclosed a deficiency no money is available for the provision of additional benefits during the five years from 6th July, 1936.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he say if the introduction of legislation is contemplated with the object of endeavouring to provide additional benefits, of a type somewhat similar to those which have been provided in the past, during the five year period when no additional benefits will be provided for?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he in a position to state what the general trend is in the national health insurance society: that is to say, whether he believes that any deficiency existing at the end of the last quinquennial period is tending to disappear now; and, if so, does he not think that he might anticipate a surplus at the end of the present quinquennial which would enable him to extend certain sickness and disablement benefits, particularly in the form of dental benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as far as I know it, and the trend, as the Deputy suggests, is not such as would enable us to take any steps in the direction he suggests.  The valuer reported that the expenditure on women's sickness benefit was 15 per cent. higher than was anticipated, and that, as regards disablement benefit, the expenditure for men was double, and for women, four times the amount anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether his own Department contemplates doing anything, in regard to the rates of benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, which will now be reduced to the statutory minimum for the next five years, to ensure that steps will be taken to try to remedy that position and make those benefits available, since the loss to insured persons is a very serious matter indeed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Mr. Edward Coogan, Powerscourt, Enniskerry, submitted evidence of incapacity covering a period of six weeks' illness to the United Society; that he received only 15/- benefit; and if he will state the grounds on which benefit for the remainder of the period of certified illness has been withheld.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the society that payment of sickness benefit amounting to £1 15s. for two weeks and two days at the rate of 15/- per week has been made to Mr. Coogan in respect of an incapacity which commenced on the 14th April, 1936, and terminated on the 4th May, 1936.  A further claim was sent in on the 24th June, but only one certificate dated the 22nd June has been received by the society.  No payment can be made until evidence of incapacity after that date is received by the society.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Mr. Edward Coogan, Powerscourt, Enniskerry, was unable during the past seven weeks to obtain from the United Society payment of maternity benefit to which he is entitled, and whether in view of the fact that this claimant experienced no difficulty in obtaining prompt payment of benefit from his former society in respect of similar claims, he will state the reason for this long delay in deciding and paying his claim.</P>

      <P>I am informed that a claim for maternity benefit lodged with a temporary agent, acting during the illness of the regular agent, reached the society on the 11th June.  The claim was returned to the agent to have the correct form completed and to inquire as to the year of the marriage which was stated to be 1900, although according to the records the year was 1922.  When the correct form was received the year of marriage was shown as 1918 and the claim was again referred to the agent for inquiry.  The society has now obtained from Mr. Coogan the required information and a cheque is being issued to-day.</P>

      <P>Certain sections of the International Labour Convention limiting the hours of work to 48 per week in industrial undertakings are implemented by the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936. The Night Work (Bakeries) Bill, 1936, is entitled an Act to carry out and give effect to the Night Work (Bakeries) Convention, 1925.  The necessary steps towards ratification will, it is hoped, be taken at an early date.</P>
      <P>The convention concerning protection against accidents to workers employed in loading or unloading ships adopted at the International Labour Conference in 1929, was ratified on the 5th July, 1930.

      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we continue with the Committee Stage of the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, I desire, with your permission, Sir, to make a statement.  I promised the House to make a statement on the subject of transatlantic air services as soon as possible.  As has already been announced, discussions took place in Ottawa in November last between representatives of the Governments of the Saorstát, United Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland, regarding the establishment of an air service across the North Atlantic.  Arrangements were agreed upon, subject to the approval of the Governments concerned, which has now been given, to enable survey flights to be undertaken and an experimental air mail to be established as soon as possible, to be followed eventually by a mail and passenger service on a minimum schedule of two flights a week in each direction.  Discussions also took place immediately after the conference in Ottawa with representatives of the United States Government in Washington, with a view to securing the fullest measure of understanding and co-operation with the United States in the development of transatlantic flying.  As a result, understandings were reached, based upon the principle of full reciprocity, which, it is hoped, will bring about as soon as practicable the establishment of a transatlantic air service connecting the countries concerned.  The main <Col N="2360" /> details of the arrangements agreed between the respective Governments are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  A joint operating company which will be responsible for carrying on the services will be incorporated at the instance of three companies, of which one will be nominated for that purpose by the Government of Saorstát Eireann, one by the Government of the United Kingdom, and one by the Canadian Government.  The board of directors will be nine in number, of whom three, including the chairman and managing director, will be nominated by the United Kingdom company, three by the Canadian company, and there by the Saorstát company. The capital of the joint company will be subscribed and held as to 51 per cent. by the United Kingdom company, 24½ per cent. by the Candian company, and 24½ per cent. by the Saorstát company.  The control of commercial, technical and operating matters will be secured to the United Kingdom company through its majority stockholding and through the medium of the articles of association of the joint company, subject to the superior jurisdiction of the board of directors on questions of major policy.</P>
      <P>2.  In return for landing facilities to be granted to the joint company by the United States Government Pan American Airways will be granted landing facilities by the Governments of Saorstát Eireann, the United Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland; and that company will participate on a basis of reciprocity with the joint company in the operation of the services.</P>
      <P>3.  In the operation of the services all practicable preference will be given to the direct route via Saorstát Eireann; Newfoundland and Canada; but it may be necessary during an initial period to operate the services via Bermuda during the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Experimental long distance flights and other necessary investigations will be carried out in the near future. The incorporation of the joint company will involve some delay and it has been arranged that experimental flights and investigations will be conducted by Imperial Airways, Limited <Col N="2361" /> (which is the company nominated by the United Kingdom Government for the purpose of participation in the joint company).  The results of the experimental flights and investigations will be placed at the disposal of the joint company when it is established.  It is understood that Pan American Airways will also be conducting experimental flights over the same route.</P>
    <P>5.  During the experimental stage flying operations will be financed by the Government of the United Kingdom. When the joint company assumes responsibility for flying operations it will receive an annual subsidy from the several Governments on an agreed basis.  Of the total annual subsidy required, Canada will contribute 20 per cent. up to a maximum of £75,000; Saorstát Eireann, 5 per cent. up to a maximum of £12,000; and Newfoundland a sum to be agreed upon between the Newfoundland Government and the United Kingdom Government; the remainder will be made up by the United Kingdom Government.  I may add here that the Saorstát Government will also be entitled to participate in the British Commonwealth air mail scheme if and when we so desire without payment of further subsidy, but only on a postal payment on the basis of mails carried.</P>
    <P>6.  Each of the four Governments concerned has undertaken to arrange for the provision of the necessary airport, radio, and meteorological facilities for the transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>7.  Each of the four Governments concerned has also undertaken to grant the necessary landing and transit rights within its own territory to the joint company and to Pan-American Airways.  It is contemplated that unless otherwise determined by the consent of the four Governments such rights will be exclusive in respect of transatlantic air services for a period of 15 years; thereafter the question of exclusivity and the question of granting further financial assistance to the joint company will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>8.  An inter-governmental committee <Col N="2362" /> on transatlantic air services will be established consisting of four members appointed respectively by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Saorstát Eireann, and Newfoundland, to which will be referred for approval decisions or proposals of the joint company relating to transatlantic air services which may affect national policy or the relations of the Governments concerned <i>inter se</i> or with other Governments. All decisions of the inter-governmental committee will be reached by unanimous vote.</P>
    <P>The Saorstát airport, with adequate radio and meteorological equipment, will provide all necessary facilities for flying boats and land machines, and will be constructed, owned and controlled by the Saorstát Government. Supplementary Estimates making the necessary provision will be laid before the Dáil in due course. At this stage, however, I think it may be useful if I give the House a general picture of our financial commitments in connection with the scheme.</P>
    <P>The total capital outlay on the airport and on wireless and meteorological service in connection with the transatlantic air service is estimated at approximately £520,000; this includes approximately £20,000 for accommodation of a residential character for staff, for which it is intended to charge appropriate rents.  The annual charges for operation, maintenance and depreciation are estimated at £50,000; of this £40,000 is attributable to the airport proper and £10,000 to radio and meteorological services. It is, I think, generally known that the rather limited meteorological service at present in existence in the Saorstát has hitherto been maintained by the United Kingdom Government. Arrangements are being made for the transfer of this service to the control of the Saorstát Government, and it is our intention to develop it into a first-class meteorological service, and I may say incidentally at this point that the United Kingdom Government has agreed to contribute £6,000 per annum towards the cost on the basis of services rendered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2363" /> There are two further points which may be of interest to the House.  The first is that a suitable proportion of the Joint Operating Company's aircraft will be registered in the Saorstát.  The second is that the Saorstát airport will be the first European port of call for all eastbound aircraft on transatlantic services on the direct route and the last European port of call for westbound aircraft on that route.  The necessary arrangements will be made to enable traffic and passengers (when accommodation for passengers is available) to join the aircraft at the Saorstát airport.</P>

      <P>No action or other legal proceedings whatsoever, whether civil or criminal, shall be instituted in any court in Saorstát Eireann in respect of the doing of anything authorised to be done by any such officer under this section, whether such thing is done personally or by a person acting in aid of or under the direction of such officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan emphasised that that introduces a new principle into the Constitution.  It provides, apparently, that an irresponsible officer, who gives <Col N="2365" /> certain orders or takes admittedly illegal action may not be prosecuted either civilly or criminally.  That, certainly, is a principle that this House should not subscribe to.  Deputy McGilligan is very strongly against this clause, and I would like to hear from the Minister what justification there can be for the introduction of the radical proposals contained in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification is that the principle is well recognised. Section 2 of the Aerial Navigation Act, 1913, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If an aircraft flies or attempts to fly over any area prescribed under this Act for the purposes of the defence or safety of the realm, or, in the case of an aircraft coming from any place outside the United Kingdom, fails to comply with any of the conditions as to landing prescribed by an order under the last foregoing section, it shall be lawful for any officer designated for the purpose by regulations made by the Secretary of State to cause such signal as may be prescribed by those regulations, to be given, and, if after such signal has been given the aircraft fails to respond to the signal by complying with such regulations as may be made by the Secretary of State prescribing the action to be taken on such a signal being given, it shall be lawful for the officer to fire at or into such aircraft and to use any and every other means necessary to compel compliance, and every and any such officer and every other person acting in his aid and by his direction shall be and is hereby indemnified and discharged from any indictment, penalty, action, or other proceeding for so doing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The British Air Navigation Regulations provide exactly the same saver for the officer as is provided in the concluding portion of that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, as I pointed out to Deputy McGilligan when we were discussing this matter previously, the appropriate regulation in the Saorstát Regulations of 1930 is somewhat <Col N="2366" /> similar.  Regulation 60, paragraph (2) reads:</P>
    <P>No action or other legal proceedings whatsoever, whether civil or criminal, shall be instituted in any court of law or equity in Saorstát Eireann for, on account of, or in respect of any act, matter or thing authorised by the foregoing paragraph of this regulation to be done by any commissioned officer of the defence forces of Saorstát Eireann or by any other officer acting in aid of or under the direction of such officer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In any court&rdquo; in the section, I am advised, has no application to a military court.  Before an officer fires on an aircraft a number of conditions have got to be satisfied.  A certain area has got to be declared a prohibited area.  The aircraft will have to be flying towards or over the area which is a prohibited area.  Certain signals which are recognised internationally have got to be ignored and only then is an officer to be entitled to fire.  The area to be prohibited must be clearly one of great national importance, and any restriction on an officer's discretion to take the extreme action to enforce prohibition would involve very serious consequences.  If an officer has got to consider that action may be taken against him later, then he is more likely to delay in taking the necessary steps to secure compliance with the order, and his inaction may mean the suffering of damage by the State out of all proportion to the damage done by the officer's action.</P>
    <P>In the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, Section 7, designated officers are given powers to fire at a boat which is suspect after signals have been given, and a sub-section on exactly the same lines as paragraph (c) provides for their exemption from liability in the courts in respect of their action.</P>

      <P>Section 17 deals with the Warsaw Convention.  The provisions of the Warsaw Convention are set out in the First Schedule to this Bill, and, therefore, so far as they relate to this Bill they will have the force of law in Saorstát Eireann.  This convention provides for the adoption in the territories of the contracting States of uniform rules in regard to the following matters affecting the operations of air transport undertakings&mdash;(a) the issue of passenger and luggage tickets, (b) the issue of consignment notes and conditions under which the carriage of goods is undertaken, and (c) the liability of the carrier in respect to passengers' luggage and goods.  The convention <Col N="2368" /> applies to all international carriage of persons, luggage or goods performed by aircraft for reward or, in the case of an air transport undertaking, without reward.  The convention was signed at Warsaw in 1929 and came into force on the 13th February, 1933.</P>

      <P>(c) an action to enforce the liability may be brought by the personal representative of the passenger or by any person for whose benefit the liability is under paragraph (a) of this section, enforceable, but only one action shall be brought in Saorstát Eireann in respect of the death of any one passenger, and every such action by whomsoever brought shall be for the benefit of all such persons so entitled, as either are domiciled in Saorstát Eireann or, not being domiciled there, express a desire to take the benefit of the action.</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment is to extend to persons not domiciled in the Saorstát, but who are resident in the Saorstát, the benefit of any action taken to enforce the liability of the carrier in the event of the death of a passenger.

      <P>On the section, would the Minister say what is the measure of damages that will be given to the dependents of the family of a deceased civilian in respect to whom compensation is provided by the section?  Is it such measure of damages as is provided under Lord Campbell's Act or such damages for funeral expenses, pain, suffering and general incidental losses, or is it merely confined to the question of dependency?  The section does not appear to me too clear on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as laid down in the convention is that the carrier is to be liable for damages in the event of the death, wounding, or other bodily injury of the passenger.  He is liable also for the destruction, loss or damage of any registered luggage or any goods, or for any delay occasioning damage to passengers' luggage or goods.  In the case of goods, the carrier is not liable if he proves that the damage was occasioned by negligent pilotage or negligence in the handling of aircraft, or in navigation.  Then there is a certain limit to the liability of the carrier. In the case of passengers, the liability for each passenger is limited to a sum of 125,000 francs.  In the case of registered luggage and of goods, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogram.  It is limited to 5,000 francs per passenger in respect to objects in charge of the passenger himself.  That is the extent of the convention.  I do not know whether I have given sufficient information to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, perhaps, it may not be possible for the Minister to give the particular kind of information that I am looking for.  The section merely provides for damages.  There is, <Col N="2370" /> of course, a limitation in the convention as to the amount of damages. That has nothing to do with the point I am putting.  Under Lord Campbell's Act, when death results from negligence, the damages are measured by the amount of dependency on the person killed by the person bringing the action.  That is very often difficult to prove, and it is sometimes out of all proportion to the loss sustained.  In the present section, nothing is said but that damages may be awarded.  If any cases are brought under this section, there is bound to be a considerable discussion as to what the measure of damages should be.  The framework of the section follows rather closely the procedure provided by Lord Campbell's Act.  While we have control of the matter in the House, we should not allow any ambiguity to remain.  Personally, I think that the provisions of Lord Campbell's Act with reference to ordinary negligence cases are entirely too restricted, and whether it would be wise to make a change in this respect is a matter to which the Minister should give consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 18, the benefit of the liability, I am advised, is enforceable on the same lines as those on which members of the family of the deceased person may enforce a claim under Lord Campbell's Act.  It applies only to civil liability and does not apply to criminal liability.  Section 18 deals with the liability of a carrier in respect of the death of a passenger and provides that liability shall be confined, so far as international carriage is concerned, to his liability under the Warsaw Convention.  The common law rules in respect of carriage have been modified and extended by statute both in regard to sea and land carriage.  In the absence of any specific provision, it is to be assumed that the common law is to guide the aircraft owner as a carrier.  For international purposes, the carrier's liability shall be determined by the provisions of the Warsaw Convention.  It is with international carriage the present section deals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is not fair that I should cross-examine the Minister on this rather technical topic, but <Col N="2371" /> it does not appear to be clear whether or not the liability of a carrier is confined to cases where he has been proved to be guilty of negligence or whether he is to be regarded as an insurer of his passengers' life and safety.  If he is to be regarded as insurer of his passenger's life and safety, then his liability would be entirely different in law and in principle from the liability which exists where death arises as the result of negligence.  So far as I can see, the carrier's liability for damages under this Bill is not dependent on negligence.  If it were dependent on negligence, possibly the principles embodied in Lord Campbell's Act or the Fatal Accidents Acts would apply. If his liability is not based on negligence, it may be that these principles will not be applicable.  I agree that the structure of this section is based on similar provisions in the Fatal Accidents Acts, but that would not be sufficient to make the matter clear.</P>

    <P>The purpose of Section 24 is to provide a limitation on liability for damage done to third parties on the surface.  It is intended that the limitation shall not apply in circumstances where a certain degree of blame attaches to the person responsible for the damage.  It is thought that this restriction on the benefit of <Col N="2373" /> the limitation in the case of aircraft owners should be applicable in the same circumstances as it is applicable in existing merchant shipping legislation to the limitation of liability of shipping owners.  The principle in the Merchant Shipping Acts is that a person cannot lose the advantage of the limitation merely from negligence but may lose the advantage of the limitation if there is something more than mere negligence. The words used are &ldquo;actual fault or privity,&rdquo; and these are the words which we propose to insert in this section.</P>

Now, the Minister sees the point in connection with that civil owner, and places a qualified liability on that civil owner, but so militarily-minded a man is he that, when dealing with an officer of the Army, he said he was not prepared to allow any liability, good, bad or indifferent, to attach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 35, I wish to say that this is the section opening with the part of the Bill which confers upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce powers to acquire land compulsorily. Rumour has circulated that the Ministry had in mind the intention of acquiring part of the Phænix Park for use as an aerodrome.  If that idea has occurred to the Minister's mind then I think precaution should be taken in this part of the Bill to divest the Minister of any rights which he may appear to have to do any such thing.  It would be an outrage on the City of Dublin if any part of the Phænix Park were adapted for aeroplane purposes.  I would be glad if the Minister would make a statement now as to what the opinion of the Executive Council is on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As an inter-departmental committee was examining the question when I last dealt with this matter in the House.  I did not think it proper to prejudge their decision or recommendation. I can now state that the inter-departmental committee have not reported in favour of the Phænix Park as a site and, though the Government have not taken the final decision, I <Col N="2379" /> think it is most unlikely that the Phænix Park will be acquired as a site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It fills me with alarm that the Executive Council has allowed such a matter to come under the attention of an inter-departmental committee. Such a matter could not possibly be considered by an inter-departmental committee unless it was placed before them by the responsible Minister.  I think it will come as a very great shock to a number of persons that the Minister for Industry and Commerce at any time considered the possibility of allowing commercial or other interests to override the interest of the citizens of Dublin in this matter. I do not think any inter-departmental committee should have authority to discuss such a question at all.  In view of the fact that the Minister admits that this matter has been discussed on his authority, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we should take steps between now and the Report Stage, to amend this Bill so as to make sure that the Minister or any successor of his, will not have a right to take any part of the Phænix Park for the purposes of a commercial aerodrome or for any other purposes, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to ease the Deputy's mind, I should like to say that the choice of a site from the point of view of suitability was the question with which the committee dealt.  No Government Department recommended that the Phænix Park should be taken for such a purpose.</P>

      <P>Is the position not still as it was before, or as it was when this inter-departmental committee considered the Phænix Park? Even if that committee were functioning still the Phænix Park is ruled out by them.  Even though the Government rules it out now is it not a fact that as this Bill stands the Government has the power to consider and adapt the Phænix Park as a site for an aerodrome, and Deputy Dillon's point, as I take it, is that they should be ruled out altogether from taking the Phænix Park?</P>

In other words, it should be definitely ruled out in plain language in this Bill. I join with Deputy Dillon in asking the Minister to consider an amendment on those lines on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I support the suggestion that there should be no possibility of the Government's having any power in this Bill to interfere with the Phænix Park at any time for the purpose of an aerodrome.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gives an assurance that there is no present intention of interfering with the Phænix Park.  We very much appreciate that assurance.  Now we go on and say, in view of the fact that there is no present intention to interfere with the Phænix Park, that the Government should have no objection to an amendment on the Report Stage specifically excluding from the general powers conferred for compulsory acquisition in this Bill the area <Col N="2381" /> of the Phænix Park, so as to ensure that if, hereafter, this Government or their successors in office changed their mind and determined that they were going to interfere with the Phænix Park, they would have to come back to this House and pass a Bill giving them authority to deal with it.  If the Bill is left in its present state, a subsequent Government could acquire the Phænix Park without any further reference to this House.  The present Government do not want to acquire the Phænix Park. Then it cannot embarrass the present Government to accept a short amendment providing that, notwithstanding Section 35, the Minister shall have no power to acquire any part of that area known as the Phænix Park for the purposes of the Bill.  Will the Minister accept an amendment along these lines on the Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because I think the idea of acquiring the Phænix Park, when it is already the property of the Board of Works, is rather ridiculous. If the Deputy wants to prevent some future Government from taking the Phænix Park, if they so desire, I suggest that there would be ample opportunity of raising the question when that circumstance arises.</P>

      <P>That is the introductory section to Part V of the Bill, which deals with the compulsory acquisition of land for the purposes of this Bill.  The Minister now says that the acquisition of the Phænix Park cannot arise in this connection, because it is already the property of the Board of Works.  Does that mean that the Minister is advised that the Phænix Park, being the property of the Board of Works, can be used for the purposes of this Bill without any compulsory acquisition taking place?  If so, in view of the fact that the Minister informed us that it is not the Government's intention to use the Phænix Park for the purpose, will he accept an amendment on this part of the Bill setting out expressly that no part of the area known as the Phænix Park shall be used for any purpose of this Bill?  Then, if subsequently he or his successor in office desires to use the Phænix Park for the purpose of an aerodrome, whether the Board of Works own it or not, the Minister will have to come to the House and ask the leave of the House to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very nice question. The State set up a scheme under the Road Transport Act, in consideration of which certain road transport companies in this country have laid out immense sums of money in compulsorily acquiring other road transport services.  They did that on the understanding that they were to have a virtual monopoly of road transport. Now you are establishing an aerodrome under the patronage of the Minister or a local authority.  It is to be observed that this new sub-section will be passed <Col N="2388" /> after the Road Transport Act, presumably, with a view to repealing the Road Transport Act in so far as that Act conflicts with the later measure. You are going to confer on a local authority the right to operate buses to carry passengers from the centres of population to the aerodrome whence the aeroplanes fly.  What is to prevent it operating a daily service of buses between the aerodrome, the suburbs of Dublin and Cork, Galway and Belfast? I grant that it is the only air service operating in Saorstát Eireann and is, therefore, entitled to collect all the passengers it can, book them and deliver them safely at the aerodrome. If this goes through, the thing will become very much like Clery's excursions, that you will have persons travelling on the buses who have no intention whatever of availing of the air services.  People who will have no intention whatever of travelling by air will undoubtedly avail of the road transport facilities provided by the local authority.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Minister can make an order permitting a local authority to carry on this business under the Road Transport Act, but before doing so he would examine the question as to how it was going to affect the existing carriers.  I suggest to the Deputy that, under present circumstances, it is more than likely that if a local authority wishes to have this business carried on it will make arrangements with the railway company to do it.</P>

      <P>Under the existing law, the aerodrome company could go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Look here, we require certain passenger transport <Col N="2389" /> facilities to serve our aerodrome.  We have made this reasonable proposal to the Great Southern Railways or to the Dublin United Tramways Company, and we ask you to press the railway company or the tramway company to make available for us the reasonable facilities for which we ask at a reasonable fee.  The Minister could perfectly easily insist on one or other of the monopolists of Irish transport accommodating the aerodrome.&rdquo;  That is the procedure that would have to be adopted under the existing law.  If this amendment is passed it will be, I hold, a direct breach of the understanding which was enshrined in the Road Transport Act, which was that new undertakings would not be established in this country, and that the Minister would not seek powers to establish new undertakings outside the scope of the Road Transport Act.  Is it the Minister's intention and desire to go back on that arrangement?  If it is not, should not a special exception be made in regard to these ancillary servises deliberately excluding road transport passenger activities?</P>

      <P>(5)  Nothing in this section shall authorise the Minister to acquire, use, or otherwise interfere with compulsorily under this section any land which at the date of the first publication of notice of the intention of the Minister to consider the making of a special order in that behalf belongs to an electricity, gas, or water undertaker and is used or authorised to be used by such undertaker for the purpose of his undertaking.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment is to exclude land belonging to a railway undertaking from the compulsory powers of acquisition conferred on the Minister.  Sub-section (5) already excludes land belonging to an electricity, gas or water undertaking, and the exclusion in favour of railway property is in accordance with earlier legislation, but the land of a railway or any other undertaking may be acquired still by agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think that normally it should be possible if this question arises to deal with it by agreement, but it may happen that compulsory powers will be necessary.  That is as I am advised at present.  Furthermore, we do not recognise that harbour authorities are quite in the same position as railway, electricity, or other undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly see the force of that view.  Harbour authorities are circumscribed in their activities. The land is no good to them except it is adjacent to or in the harbour.  They cannot move inland. The railways can have land inland.  If harbour authorities are going to use certain land for the development of their trade as a port, I do not see any other undertaking that can put up as strong a case for being exempt from having their land compulsorily acquired as the harbour authorities. The Minister said that an agreement could be reached.  Why could not an agreement be reached in the case of a railway or a gas undertaking or in the case of water authorities?  I do not see the force of the argument at all. If the question of agreement arises and the air authorities consider certain land is very suitable, surely the question of agreement would have as much force in the circumstances of having this land excluded as in the circumstances of having it included, that is, if there is good faith between the parties.  If the Minister considers agreement can be reached in the one case, he should consider that it can be reached in the other.</P>

    <Col N="2393" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to adopt the attitude of not accepting the Minister's view.  I would like, however, that he would elaborate that view so as to show the House his reason for exempting land the property of other undertakings and not exempting land the property of harbour authorities. I can see no reason.  None is expressed in this Bill.  The case for the harbour authorities sticking to whatever land they have around a harbour is overwhelming, whereas in the case of land belonging to a railway authority, if one field is suitable for an aerodrome the railway can get suitable land anywhere round about.  In the case of the harbour authorities the area is very circumscribed.  The Minister says that if this power is not preserved to the Minister or to the local authority it may affect the development of a transatlantic airport.  There must be some reason before his mind when he says that and when he deliberately, by an amendment, excludes land the property of railways and still must maintain the right to acquire compulsorily any land the property of harbour authorities.  The land that is worth their while to possess and that is of any use to harbour authorities is very limited in extent.  Will the Minister give us any of his reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot give the Deputy any further reasons.  I think he himself will realise why it may be extremely embarrassing if in this large undertaking to which we are now setting our hands the Minister had not powers to acquire, in the event of failure to reach agreement, any land that may be necessary for such undertaking. It is absolutely essential that he should have full powers to acquire land in order to go ahead with the project as early as possible.  I do not agree with the Deputy&mdash;although, as I have said, I have a certain sympathy with his point of view&mdash;that the harbour authorities are in the same category as gas or electricity undertakings or even railways.  Gas and electricity undertakings are absolute necessities in the life of the public.  If the Government interferes with them it is doing something very serious.  I <Col N="2394" /> cannot see that interfering with the harbour authorities' land is on the same basis.  With regard to the railway companies, we are moving in accordance with previous legislation&mdash; the Acquisition of Land (Allotment) Act, the Cement Act and the Slaughter of Cattle Act.  In all those Acts there was definite exclusion in connection with railway property.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that we shall have advanced any further to meet the Deputy's point of view. Knowing that those powers may be absolutely necessary, I cannot see any circumstances in which we could accept the amendment.  We feel it is absolutely necessary that we should have full powers at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates that those services are to some extent, and will be to an increasing extent, competitors.  He is interfering for the benefit of one, and more or less embarrassing the other.  While he gives to local authorities and reserves to himself the right to be undertaking authorities in establishing those aerodromes and those aerial services, he will not give the right to the harbour authorities to establish those aerodromes and carry on those aerial services.  In those circumstances, I cannot see why the property of one trading company will not be protected from its competitor, when that trading company number one is not given the right to develop and exploit the other method of trading. I know that the harbour authorities in this country take a serious view of that, particularly the authority of the port of Dublin, which I think represents more than 50 per cent. of the trade of the country.  The port authority of Dublin supports this amendment.  I should like if the Minister would further consider it until the Report Stage, particularly because, since this amendment was drafted, there has come to light the Minister's amendment protecting the property of railways. <Col N="2395" /> That makes the case and the grievance of the Port and Docks Board of Dublin ever so much greater.  The Minister quotes exemptions in other Acts passed here.  As far as I am able to appreciate those Acts they hardly relate to parallel cases when we come to aerial navigation. The Minister is probably aware that the British Government is considering very sympathetically amendments put up to their Navigation Bill.</P>

      <P>I think if the port of Dublin authorities are very moved in their minds about this matter they ought to come and talk to the Department about it.  It is necessary that we should have those compulsory powers.  We hope at the same time&mdash;it is only where it is absolutely necessary that those powers will be exercised&mdash;that the land may be taken over by agreement, but if it cannot be taken over by agreement I think the Deputy will realise that the Government must have powers to acquire it compulsorily.  Otherwise they may be held up in a very serious way.</P>

      <P>I do not put it up as a special pleading for Dublin, but if any authority were to be consulted the authority of the port of Dublin should be consulted, because its trade easily represents more than the rest of the country.  If the Dublin port authority were not consulted, I take it from the remark of the Minister that no port or harbour authority was consulted, and I do not think that was fair.  I think they should have been consulted, and so does the Port and Docks Board. They do not think that the Minister or the Government should wait on <Col N="2396" /> them, but they hold that an opportunity of giving their views on this matter should be presented to them. The majority of that board would be much better people to put the views of the board than I am.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of slight complication. It was originally intended, in circumstances where two local authorities came together in connection with the establishment of an aerodrome, that the expense of maintaining new bridges established thereby would fall on the authorities concerned, and that the contributing authority would make a <Col N="2401" /> contribution towards the cost of maintenance. We are advised now that it is only the authority within whose functional area the bridge is constructed which could be called upon to make the contribution.  That is our advice from the Local Government Department. I think it is solely because administrative necessities demand it that that is being sought.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 46 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a local authority (in this section referred to as an undertaking authority) has established and maintains or proposes to establish and maintain an aerodrome under this Part of this Act, any authority (in this section referred to as a non-undertaking authority) which is another local authority, a conservancy authority, or a harbour authority, may agree with such undertaking authority to make to such undertaking authority, on such conditions as may be agreed upon between the two authorities and subject to the provisions of this section, a contribution towards the expenses incurred by such undertaking authority in or in relation to the establishment and maintenance of such aerodrome.</P>
      <P>(2)  An agreement under this section in relation to an aerodrome may be made by two or more non-undertaking authorities with an undertaking authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  An agreement under this section made between one or more non-undertaking authorities and an undertaking authority may incorporate a scheme for the management of the aerodrome to which the agreement relates through and by a committee of such undertaking authority, and in that case such scheme shall, where there is only one non-undertaking authority party to such agreement, <Col N="2402" /> provide that a specified number of the members of such committee shall be nominated by that non-undertaking authority or, where there are two or more non-undertaking authorities party to such agreement, provide that a number of such members specified in respect of each non-undertaking authority shall be nominated by such non-undertaking authority, and such scheme may empower such committee to do any act (including the institution of legal proceedings) in relation to the management of such aerodrome which such undertaking authority itself could lawfully do, and may provide for the application of the provisions of Section 58 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925) to such committee as if such committee were a county authority within the meaning of that section, and for the furnishing by such undertaking authority to such committee of the moneys necessary to meet their expenses.</P>
    <P>(4)  The contribution payable by a non-undertaking authority in pursuance of an agreement made under this section shall be either a fixed annual sum or a fixed proportion of the expenses of maintaining the aerodrome to which the agreement relates or partly one and partly the other, and shall be payable in such instalments and at such times as shall be set out in the agreement.</P>
    <P>(5)  No agreement made under this section shall come into force unless and until it has been sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>(6)  When an agreement made under this section between one or more non-undertaking authorities and an undertaking authority comes into force it shall be binding and enforceable against each party to such agreement, and each such party and the committee of management (if any) shall have power to do all acts and to make all payments which are provided for in such agreement or in any scheme incorporated therewith.</P>
    <P>It is thought desirable that encouragement should be given to co-operation by local authorities in providing aerodromes <Col N="2403" /> and landing grounds, and Sections 46 and 47 in the Bill at present provide that one local authority or a harbour or conservancy authority may contribute to the expenses incurred by another local authority in such work&mdash; that is Section 46&mdash;and for the setting up of a joint committee to administer the undertaking&mdash;that is Section 47. The new section effects the same purpose and is considered to be an improvement on the procedure involved. It is not intended that the Minister should compel local authorities to enter into such engagements with each other.  It is entirely permissive as to whether a particular local authority will co-operate with another authority or not.  It is provided that the joint committee which will be set up, and which is similar to the joint committee which we sometimes have in connection with mental hospitals, should be the committee of the particular authority which is undertaking the establishment of the aerodrome; but upon it there can be representatives from the contributing bodies.  It is the object of the amendment to ensure that that will be so&mdash;that the committee will be the committee of the undertaking authority, but that the other authorities or other bodies will have representation on it.</P>

    <P>Section 49, as it stands at present, provides that where the council of a county incurs expenditure in connection with the establishment of an aerodrome, these expenses may be defrayed by means of the poor rate raised equally over the whole of that county, excluding any urban districts included therein.  The intention is that exemption from the levy of the poor rate should apply only in the cases of the local authorities which have contributed or are contributing to the establishment of an aerodrome.  So that there will be no exemption from the poor rate levy except in the case of local authorities which are contributing to the establishment of the aerodrome.</P>

    <P>That sub-section clearly would prevent the submission of an amendment prohibiting the use of the Phænix Park for the purpose of an aerodrome, because the first sub-section of that section says: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the granting,&rdquo; etc., etc.</P>
    <P>Subsequently to insert an amendment providing that there was an express prohibition on the Minister from enclosing, for the purposes of this Act, lands which he was entitled to lease would conflict with Section 51, as amended, and would, therefore, be presumably out of order.  I do not know whether the Phæ;nix Park is a State land or not.  I take it that the Curragh of Kildare is State land.  The Minister says the Phæ;nix Park is vested in the Board of Works.

    <P>No action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance, by reason only of the flight of aircraft over any property at a height above the ground, which, having regard to wind, weather and all the circumstances of the case, is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of the flight, so long as the provisions of Part II of this Act and any order made under the said Part II and any regulations made by virtue of any such order are duly complied with.</P>

      <P>Before Section 52, but in Part V, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall deprive the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of any rights and remedies under the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928, or any statutory adaptation thereof or substitution therefor made by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 33 to delete the words &ldquo;the flight&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;a <i>bona fide</i> flight from one place to another&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is not to interfere in any way with flying from one place to another, but it is quite conceivable that people having residences close to an aerodrome might be subjected to considerable annoyance by trial flights, lasting only for a short time, but continually in one direction, and possibly flying very low and at odd hours of the day or night. The purpose is not to infringe on the rights of people making <i>bona fide</i> flights, but to leave ordinary householders with some rights, where they might be subjected to annoyance by a practice being made of having flights over houses at odd hours during the day or night.  I would ask the Minister if he can see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the circumstances which the Deputy has in mind are covered by the section as it stands.  &ldquo;No action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance by reason only of the flight of aircraft over any property&rdquo;.  It is considered that it would be extremely difficult to define what is <i>bona fide</i> flying and that, in any case, the section as it stands covers the difficulty which the Deputy has in mind.  No matter what definition is accepted, I think the Deputy will agree that when the question comes to be judged it will probably have to be decided on the circumstances of the particular case.  It would be almost impossible to foresee the circumstances. I think the matter can be decided, as I have said, should the question arise, under the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to suggest that my fears are absolutely groundless.  I wish he had elaborated that and that he would show in what respect a person who is subject to considerable <Col N="2412" /> annoyance by what one might describe as stunt flying over his house has redress.  I cannot see what difficulty the Minister has in finding out what <i>bona fide</i> flying is.  Surely a <i>bona fide</i> flight would be a flight from one definite place to another.  The amendment is really intended to cover persons who go up from an aerodrome and return to the same aerodrome.  If the Minister wished to safeguard the rights of the ordinary individual I think he could easily manage it.  Certainly I should like him to elaborate what remedy is open to people who are subjected to annoyance of the type to which I have called attention.  Apparently he is merely relying on the fact that those people would have to bring some one into court and prove a whole lot of facts that it would be very difficult to establish.  I feel that this is only one more instance where the ordinary citizen is being deprived of any rights he has.  I think the position of the ordinary citizen should be more clearly defined under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that stunt flying and low flying are prohibited under the existing regulations. I think also that the section as at present drafted covers the circumstances which the Deputy has in mind, but I shall look further into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me why do we, by statute, take away from a citizen the right to sue for a nuisance in respect of activities which may be carried on at an aerodrome? Suppose land were acquired near my house for an aerodrome and that aeroplanes start arriving and departing from that aerodrome.  The noise becomes intolerable and I can no longer maintain residence there.  Have I simply to draw my stumps and go away somewhere else to live?  Why should I not be entitled to sue the authority responsible for the aerodrome and to recover from that authority such compensation as a court of justice shall deem equitable?  Provision was made in the Railways Act for compensation for nuisances of certain kinds.  I do not know whether there was any provision made for compensation arising from noise but I cannot see any ground why my property should be destroyed <Col N="2413" /> by a nuisance created by an aerodrome adjoining without leaving me some remedy against the person who is responsible for that nuisance.  I cannot think of any circumstances in which a local authority would be allowed to create such a nuisance as would interfere with a person in the enjoyment of his property without that local authority being obliged to compensate for it.  Mind you, I deplore the rapidity with which this legislation is being rushed through the House.  I do not know why it is being done.  It is manifest to Deputies that this Bill is receiving no adequate consideration at all.  Any flaws in it will have to be dealt with in an amending Bill. It is not being adequately discussed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is supposed to be the code under which aeronautics will be controlled in this country for a considerable time but nobody seems to have any thought at all for what may happen in the immediate future.  It is quite possible, with the development of gyroplanes, or whatever they are called, that in ten years' time you may have aeroplanes dropping where they wish and that you will no longer have the picture of an aerodrome built up in a rural area with a long open space to provide for a gradual approach.  It is quite possible that you may have aeroplanes coming to earth in the middle of a town.  It may well be that in a comparatively confined space like Mountjoy Square you may have aeroplanes descending and ascending periodically.  Picture the position of an unfortunate householder in Mountjoy Square with upwards of 20 aeroplants descending and ascending in that square with all the noise that aeroplane engines make.  It is argued that a person who takes a house in Mountjoy Square is to have no claim for nuisance against the persons who are responsible for bringing these aeroplanes there?  Why should he be put in a different position from anybody else?  I do not think that Section 52, even with the moderate amendment suggested by Deputy Dockrell, can be justified.  I think the average citizen ought to have the right to go to court and recover compensation for any damage accruing to his property <Col N="2414" /> by reason of the activities of aeroplanes in the vicinity.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister what reason he has for maintaining that an aerodrome authority should be rendered immune by statute from the ordinary law relating to nuisance which governs the activities of the ordinary citizen of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that there is nothing to prevent the ordinary citizen recovering damages for nuisance created by reason of the flying of aircraft in unreasonable circumstances. When railway transport was first introduced this question arose.  It must have created a great deal of trouble, possibly even more than aircraft as we know it at present, from the point of view of trespass and the disturbance of amenities.  It was recognised that railway transport should be permitted in the public interest and that certain facilities should be granted to the companies who were developing it.  In the same way I see no reason why we should not grant facilities to persons who are carrying on flying in an ordinary reasonable way.  The section states that &ldquo;no action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance by reason only of the flight of aircraft over any property at a height above the ground which, having regard to wind, weather and all the circumstances of the case, is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of the flight, so long as the provision of Part II of this Act and any Order made under the said Part II and any regulations made by virtue of any such Order, are duly complied with&rdquo;. Regulations have been made from time to time and are in force.  I have indicated to the Deputy that stunt flying and flying at low altitudes are forbidden.  The Minister can, I take it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You must fly at a low altitude if you are going to land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can strengthen the regulations if he wishes. If it is necessary for him to take further steps in order to ensure that the public will be safeguarded, he can do so.  In the Deputy's absence, when <Col N="2415" /> this Bill was on its Second Stage, I explained that it was mainly a re-enactment of the provisions of the 1920 Act. This provision, like most of the other provisions, is contained in that Act, the reason being that, since the flying of aircraft even at a considerable height over a person's land or property would constitute trespass, it would be unreasonable that every person affected in this way should have the right to take an action for trespass provided the persons flying acted reasonably in every other way.  Section 9 of the 1920 Act provided that no action should lie in respect of trespass or nuisance by reason only of the flight of aircraft over any property at a reasonable height and in accordance with regulations.  In regard to air regulations in general, we are keeping pace in this Bill with the regulations and procedure in other countries but, as I have assured Deputy Dockrell, if, on examination, we find that further safeguards should be introduced we shall have no hesitation in introducing an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for that assurance, but the Minister must not imagine that, because he can make regulations to prevent people flying too low, my difficulty will be met.  He cannot make a regulation requiring an aeronaut to land from a height of 2,000 feet without first coming down.  Even a Ministerial regulation will not achieve that.  It is in the process of coming down that I imagine a nuisance may be created.  I fully see that the ordinary common law relating to nuisances might not be applicable to this case.  I do not think that we should allow a citizen to apply for an injunction to prohibit the use of an aerodrome once this House has declared that an aerodrome should be put in that place, but I should like to give that citizen a qualified remedy for nuisance entitling him to sue, not for an injunction, but for assessment of damages against the aerodrome authority.  In the complicated conditions of modern society, it is necessary to require citizens to accommodate their personal convenience to the common good, and it is regrettably <Col N="2416" /> necessary at times to ask them to remove their residences if they are not prepared to accept the new conditions which modern society imposes upon them.  Why, I ask, is a citizen, finding himself under the obligation to change his residence or leave his land, as a result of nuisance arising from the normal use of an adjoining aerodrome, not to be entitled to recover from that aerodrome authority such sum as will make it possible for him to transfer his place of residence without serious loss? I think the Minister should go that distance.  It does not matter what is in French, German or American statutes.  If a qualified remedy is not available for that nuisance in these statutes, it should be available in our statutes.  There is no use in quoting French, German or American Acts of Parliament.  If they have not got that provision, I think they are bad Acts of Parliament.  Let us pass a good Act of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>People who have not previously seen a train are, as a rule, terribly afraid that it will bring very serious consequences upon them if they find themselves in its vicinity for the first time.  People who are not acquainted with aircraft may have an unreasonable fear of such craft.  Thousands of people in all parts of the world have to do with aircraft every day, and millions of people have to live in the vicinity of aerodromes.  In this country we are going ahead with aviation development and, while we must provide all reasonable safeguards in our legislation for the population, we certainly should not go out of our way to place obstacles in the path of ordinary aviation development.  So long as aircraft is flying at a reasonable height&mdash;that is, I contend, amply safeguarded&mdash;I do not think that the ordinary citizen will have any grouse or feel that he is being interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose that the Minister had a residence on the outskirts of Dublin with a garden providing a six-feet clearance from the gable end of his house and extending some distance from his house, and that I came along, bought the adjoining <Col N="2417" /> property and set up a dirt track six feet from his drawingroom and bedroom windows.  Suppose I ran motorcycle races around the dirt track and when the Minister came out to protest I said to him: &ldquo;You are apparently unaccustomed to seeing motor-cycles. There is no danger.  I undertake that the cycles will not run into your gable, that they will go round the dirt track.&rdquo;  The Minister would reply: &ldquo;I am not in the least alarmed; I am annoyed; the noise is deafening.&rdquo;  I might advise him to get deafer eardrums. I might tell him that the horse and buggy was popular at one time and that people now ride motor bicycles.  He would repair to a solicitor, who would send a letter to me stating that if I did not abate the nuisance of which Mr. Derrig, of such a place, properly complained, proceedings would be instituted against me. If the dirt-track proprietor were foolish enough to say that he would accept service of any documents which Mr. Derrig thought fit to issue, he would find himself mulcted in heavy damages and probably have an injunction enforced against him to prevent him from using the dirt track for racing at the gable of the Minister's house.  If the Minister for Education has a right to recover damages for a nuisance of that kind, why should he not have a right to recover damages for a nuisance of an exactly similar kind from an aerodrome, which in the ordinary course is as noisy and as offensive as dirt-track racing.  I admit he should not have power to remove the aerodrome authorities by injunction, but he should have power to recover from them such sum as would compensate him for the trouble of removing from the immediate vicinage of the aerodrome.  There is no use in saying that this is the penalty of progress. Progress does not entitle us to hand over people's property to others or to take away the rights which equity and justice have conferred on citizens. It is because this section tends to do that that I object to it.</P>

I do not see any reason why the harbour authorities, if they have general powers to charge dues, cannot avail themselves of these powers in this particular case.  As we are not dealing with harbour authorities or their powers under this Bill, I do not think it quite consistent to drag them in on this issue when in fact a Harbour Bill is in preparation. That is a procedure that should not be followed.  I suggest that this matter can be rectified when the Harbour Bill comes before the Dáil.</P>

Deputy Mulcahy, <Col N="2420" /> when asking for further time for the Committee Stage, definitely promised me that we would get facilities in connection with the remaining Stages of the Bill provided that we did not take the Committee Stage until a fortnight after the Second Reading.

      <P>To tell the honest truth, I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether you pass it or not.  But the House is asked to deal with this Bill containing up to 100 sections and two long Schedules.  It was introduced in July.  It is being considered together with the Insurance Bill, the Land Bill and several other very large and complex measures and it is absurd to suggest, with an Insurance Bill and these other Bills before this House, that adequate consideration can be given to this Bill.  Nobody is in a better position to know that than the Minister himself.  The Insurance Bill has got some kind of consideration. But this Bill is going through the House without the House understanding what it means, or understanding the interests affected by it. I think that is bad for our Parliamentary institution and it is bad for the country.  What used to happen in the past was that the Stages of the Bill appropriate to this House would be given to the Minister but these Bills were then amended in the Senate.  The Senate is no longer there, so that if this Bill has to be further amended it must be amended by an amending Bill which is a very undesirable procedure.  The Government have to make up their minds that if they want Bills properly considered, they will have to give more than three weeks to the Opposition to examine them.  We know that this Bill was introduced on the 1st July.  It is only right that the House should be fixed with notice that the Opposition disowns responsibility for legislation of this kind when we have not <Col N="2421" /> had the time nor the opportunity to examine it properly.  The House has not properly considered this Bill at all.  There are only two or three members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the House just now and not one of them has the faintest notion of what is happening except that they know we are talking about aeroplanes.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us what Section 2 of the Conveyance of <Col N="2423" /> Mails Act, 1893, provides?  The section says that that Act shall apply to every service by air for the public carriage of passengers.  Perhaps the Minister would explain this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Conveyance of Mails Act, 1893, enables the General Post Office or the Postmaster-General to see that any tramway company carries on a reasonable service in regard to the conveyance of mails such as may be required from time to time. Then there are certain sections laying down, for example, the weight of mails which are to be carried, the conveyance of passengers and the remuneration for services to be fixed from time to time between the Postmaster-General and the tramway company, and so on.  It is considered that all these should apply equally to services by air.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has, I think, certain definite powers to secure the proper utilisation of any transport undertaking for the carriage of mails, should he require it.  This is simply applying these provisions under the present Bill to air transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing law the transport of mails from this country to another country is the subject of individual contracts with separate carrying companies into which the Post Office enters as a contracting party.  Is it proposed under this section to give the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the right to make regulations compelling air transport companies to carry mails on terms which he stipulates for, or is the contracting capacity of the air transport companies preserved?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 68 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which gives the Minister power to invest the sum of £1,000,000 in this enterprise. Does the Minister intend to act under this section before the next session of the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is thought that all the formalities may not be completed before the re-assembly of the Dáil, but it is also possible that the company may be set up.  The anxiety is to go ahead as speedily as possible.  The section empowers the Minister for Finance to take up shares by subscription to a maximum of £1,000,000.  That is the total nominal capital of the company. I have explained that the share capital will be called up only as and when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But would it not be necessary for the Minister to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for the purpose if he wishes to make a subscription before the Dáil reassembles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fund is the method adopted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister desires to invest the sum of £1,000,000, or a lesser sum, in the shares of this company, what is the exact procedure that will be pursued?  Will the Minister come to the House with a Supplementary Estimate, or has he some general power to issue, by fiat, money out of the Central Fund for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 73 money will be advanced from the Central Fund.  The debt will in that way be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and repayments by the company will be brought to credit as they are made.  As regards the guarantee in respect of debentures, there will be no final charge on the Central Fund unless some portion of the money advanced is not repaid by the company, in which case such sums as are outstanding shall be paid to the Central Fund out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.  The intention <Col N="2428" /> is that the invested capital should be advanced from the Central Fund. It will come up in that way in the Dáil, but there will be no estimate.  As regards the debentures, if it should happen that there is a deficiency which has to be made up by the Dáil, as provided in Section 73, then the matter of making up that deficiency will come automatically before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is the Minister's intention to borrow the money under sub-section (2)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 73 the Minister may borrow if he wishes.  On the other hand, he may advance the money out of the cash balance in the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's intention with regard to the terms on which he will authorise an issue of shares if the Government have to borrow?  The Government are at present borrowing on a 4 per cent. basis.  Unless the Government are going to give a subsidy to this company, they would have to get 5½ per cent. debentures or something of that kind from the air company.  The air company might raise the money on more advantageous terms.  Has the Minister considered that aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the cash balance in the Exchequer is sufficient, it is most likely the Minister will invest capital direct from the Exchequer balance. On the other hand, if it is not sufficient, he will have to borrow, and it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to borrow on the best terms he can secure.  I can assure the Deputy that the intention is to go ahead as soon as possible, and I think the Opposition should grant us the facilities we are now looking for in connection with the passage of the Bill into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think, when asking for authority to raise a sum of £1,000,000 either by way of borrowing or by issue from the Exchequer surplus, that he ought to tell us, when we are within two or three months of the transaction being actually completed, what the intentions of the Minister for Finance are?  The <Col N="2429" /> Minister for Finance must foresee what the position of the Central Fund will be between now and 1st October, and he ought to be able to tell us whether he proposes to borrow money or avail of funds he has at his disposal. If he intends to borrow, does he intend to borrow to Treasury bills or to raise a State loan for the purpose? If he intends to raise the money by Treasury bills, at what rate of interest can he get money in that way? If he raises it on short-term credits of that character, has he any scheme in mind for the funding of the loan hereafter? It is pretty clear that if the Minister takes a substantial share of the capital, the money will be tied up for quite a considerable time, and it would not suit the Government to depend on short-term money to finance a transaction of this type.  We ought to know the plans the Minister has in mind to meet that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention at present is that the money should be advanced out of the Exchequer cash balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That would appear to be a most businesslike proceeding, but if it be advanced out of the Exchequer cash balance it may create a situation in which the Exchequer may require to be supplemented from some other source.  The question arises whether it is to be by way of Treasury bills or if there is to be a loan.  The Minister and the Minister for Finance last year asked for co-operation in making a success of the Conversion Loan. They are in this happy position that, having criticised the action of their predecessors in office when they were in office with regard to all finance matters, they put it almost as a matter of honour on the Opposition to support them in connection with making the Conversion Loan a success last December.  Scarcely anybody who has experience of the opportunities for borrowing money in the public market now would have been agreeable to give 4 per cent. when a country like Great Britain can borrow money at 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position we are being placed in now is that we are asked to co-operate. <Col N="2430" /> We are not told what are the terms upon which the Minister's proposals are likely to emerge and if we refuse to co-operate we are told we are sabotaging the State.  If we are to have co-operation we must understand the lines of the Minister's proposals, what the sum is that the State will ultimately have to meet and what rate of interest it will have to pay for the borrowed money.  This Bill is not a Bill on which the Minister is entitled to ask for co-operation.  It is an enabling Bill in connection with which the plans are not completed.  We will be presented in the autumn with the whole matter completed so far as the Minister is concerned and we must be committed to supporting it or we will otherwise be charged with sabotaging the policy adopted by Parliament, in this case, although I think the actual instrument is the Government.  It is not a businesslike proceeding.  In recent years there has been a very remarkable drop in the interest most countries have to pay for the use of money.  In this country, where the credit was high&mdash;and the credit of the country is not rendered any higher, any stronger or more stable by reason of the speeches made by those who happen to be in the Ministry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Their successors will be called upon to pay the interest on this money.  The success of this undertaking depends on the bargain that will be made in respect of the borrowing.  The Minister has no information and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, has no information.  The financial basis of this company, which is a very important consideration, must be bound up with the interest to be paid on the money.  The House is not told the plan; it is not told the interest, the actual sum to be borrowed or the actual stage that the negotiations have entered.</P>

      <P>Did anybody ever hear such a preposterous statement?  I have read this evening a detailed statement of the commitments in which we are involved by reason of our agreement with other Governments in regard to the transatlantic air service.  I told the Deputy on the Second Reading that the share capital would be £1,000,000 and, in addition, the Minister for Finance, provided he came to the House, would have power to arrange for subsidies. I have stated to-day what the nature of these subsidies may be.  He has also power in regard to debentures. The total amount of the capital involved is £1,000,000.  In spite of the desire of the Deputy to attain a position for himself in this House as an exponent of correct financial procedure, I would like to ask him since when has it become the custom for the Minister for Finance to enter into negotiations with the Opposition or to tell them how exactly he proposes to raise the money?  Since when has the Deputy taken up that point of view?  I always understood that that was a matter entirely for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving him powers under this measure to raise certain sums of money.  I have explained to the Deputy that the intention at present <Col N="2432" /> is to advance the money out of the cash balance in the Exchequer. Should it be necessary to borrow, I think the Deputy should have sufficient confidence if not in the Minister, at least in the Department of Finance, and should have sufficient experience of them to realise that the country is going to get the best value it can, and that this money will be raised on the cheapest terms possible. I suggest, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that the Deputy is quite out of order in going into this question as to how exactly the Minister for Finance is going to raise this money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably reads the stock exchange returns now and then.  He will find that the 4 per cent. loan is standing at a premium of over 8 or 9 per cent., and that in itself is a sufficient commentary on floating a conversion loan at 4 per cent.  There is a certain level in respect of the value of money, and there was a certain extravagance in connection with the Conversion Loan at 4 per cent.  Here is a proposition in regard to £1,000,000; it is going to be raised in some way or other.  It may be taken out of the cash balance.  It may be borrowed, and it is going to be borrowed in respect of proceedings or negotiations which we were told here on the Second Reading of this Bill were not yet complete.  It is not good business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to get information, and I think the Minister gives us less than we are entitled to when he cannot see his way to inform us as to the terms upon which the Minister for Finance proposes to deal with this situation.  He asks indignantly since when has it become the practice of this House to call on the Minister for Finance to render an account of his stewardship in advance. To that the answer might be made: &ldquo;It has become the custom since the Minister for Finance has found himself called upon to appeal to the Opposition to co-operate with him in raising loans, and to say it is their patriotic duty to stand over everything and anything that he puts forward in the form of <Col N="2433" /> requests for loans of money to this State.&rdquo;  For various reasons we deemed it to be in the public interest to accede to that request when it was made.  We did give the Minister support which the Minister was good enough handsomely to acknowledge thereafter.  But the Minister ought to understand that co-operation of that character makes him liable to give this House information in order that they may feel that such co-operation as they are in a position to offer is honestly given when they are in possession of all the facts; that any recommendation they may offer in regard to any issue which the Government proposes to make on the money market is made with a full knowledge of the facts, and that they are not recommending to anybody the purchase of a pig in a poke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To depart from that aspect of this particular section, I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that Section 68 is the section which authorises the Minister to invest in the shares of this company.  I want to ask the Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce whether this investment is to be made by way of State socialism or State capitalism.  We are now becoming accustomed to State socialism or State capitalism characterising almost every activity of this Government. Does the Government propose to run this enterprise for profit, with a view to contributing that profit to the relief of the Exchequer?  If it does, it is running it on State capitalist lines, and it is surprising to observe that not a single member of the Labour Party is here to make any inquiry in regard to this matter.  Or do they propose to run it on State socialist lines?  Do they intend to run it as a public service, setting up ideal conditions of employment, regarding solvency as a matter of minor importance, giving extravagant services for the minimum rates, and calling on the Exchequer to make up any deficiency in operating costs?  The Minister must have one or other intention in his mind.  If he proposes to run it on State capitalist lines, can he give us any estimate of the profit that he expects the Exchequer to derive from this enterprise?  If he proposes to run <Col N="2434" /> it on State socialist lines, can he give us any estimate of the deficit which the Exchequer will be called upon to make up?  One thing is perfectly certain&mdash; he is either going to have a surplus for the benefit of the Exchequer or a deficit that the Exchequer will have to make up.  Can the Minister give us an estimate of either of those figures?</P>

      <P>I suggest that in discussing the question of a Dáil loan, if that is the matter which Deputies were discussing, they are not quite in order, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle.  It does not come up on this section.  I have explained to them that the present intention is to advance this money from the cash balance in the Exchequer.  The cash balance at present stands at £2,250,000.  Even if the full £1,000,000 were required at present, I think I would be safe in saying that the necessary total advance of that sum could be made from the cash balance, but I have explained that the whole of the amount of £1,000,000 may not be necessary at the present time.  To that extent, then, I think it is quite clear that we shall have sufficient money in the cash balance in the Exchequer to enable us to proceed.  The Deputy wants to know whether this is State socialism.</P>

      <P>This is a project&mdash;the Deputy apparently is not familiar with it&mdash;of an experimental character, no doubt very novel in its features. But does the Deputy seriously suggest that in connection with a project for the establishment of a transatlantic air service, when we are only entering on the experimental stage, we can tell what the losses or profits are likely to be?  It is estimated that for some years to come there may be a deficit of thousands of pounds every year, and that this will have to be made up by subsidies contributed by the contracting Governments.  It is anticipated that eventually there will be a return upon the capital invested, but I would not say that the chances are very great that within the next few years there is going to be any return, on account of the entirely experimental character of the service.  I think that it should not be approached <Col N="2435" /> from the narrow financial point of view which Deputies opposite envisage.  The setting up of a transatlantic air service is not in the same category as the setting up of a new industry; the beet industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a novel service, and our attitude in regard to it is that if it is a question whether we should come in now, as I said on the Second Reading, take advantage of whatever opportunities present themselves, and utilise those opportunities of putting our country on the map, we should do so, although it may be a costly operation.  If the alternative is that we are going to be excluded from participation in the transatlantic services, I think any Deputy in this House and our people in general would not be pleased with that prospect. We are coming in on this aviation development, and we realise that it is going to be costly, but as an independent State we are seeing to it that we are going to have our proper share in the direction and control of this project. We have safeguarded the position as far as we can, and I think our point of view that it is a good and wise policy in the national interest to take those steps and invest those moneys, even though there may not be, in the narrow financial sense, an early return, is the sound and proper way of looking at the business.  After all, in connection with the beet sugar or the electricity supply it might be argued that, from the narrow financial point of view, and a case might be made to show that the State has lost something, but as against that loss the State confers benefits on the citizens. We hope to confer benefits on our citizens through our participation in the transatlantic air services project. We hope to put our country on the map; we hope that this airport which we intend to establish will be utilised, not only by the companies over which the contracting Governments have control, but by other foreign companies, and that it will be a great centre of international air traffic.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear what the Minister has had to say.  Let me assure him that the transatlantic air scheme will never cost the citizens of this country a tithe of what the beet scheme cost.  The beet scheme costs £250,000 per annum, whereas the transatlantic air scheme, even if we had to find the whole subsidy, could never cost that amount of money.  As a matter of fact, however, the memorandum which the Minister read for us provided that our maximum contribution to the deficit will be £12,000 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  Section 68 provides for the subsidy we will have to pay in regard to this matter, and the Minister says that as an independent State we are co-operating in setting this route on foot.  I cordially approve of that, and I want to make it clear that there is no criticism whatever from the Opposition of the Government in co-operating enthusiastically in this scheme that is devised for connecting up the State of Canada with the Saorstát and the State of Great Britain.  We shall be very glad to do so, but I think that when the Minister congratulates himself that our contribution to the losses which are anticipated and which the Minister sets at hundreds of thousands of pounds for the first year&mdash;when we realise that our share of those hundreds of thousands of pounds is only going to be £12,000 per annum&mdash;we have got to realise that it is being reduced to that figure as a result of the fact that the British Government&mdash;with which, incidentally, we are at war&mdash;are prepared to find the balance, and that, but for the fact that we have this opportunity of co-operating with the other Commonwealth Governments in developing this transatlantic air line, the hundreds of thousands of pounds to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred would have to be found out of the Irish Exchequer.  Owing to the advantageous position in which we find ourselves in the British Commonwealth of Nations, we are able to secure from our colleagues in that association assistance which, according to the Minister's estimate, will amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds every year, and which enables us to secure for this State a last Atlantic terminus, east and west, of the transatlantic air service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is something that Deputy Tom Kelly, particularly, ought to turn over in his mind, brood upon, inwardly digest, and then discuss with his constituents in the City of Dublin. I would ask him, when he is considering it, to ask himself the additional question as to whether this co-operation between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations derogates in any way from the independence <Col N="2438" /> of this State to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce took such peculiar care to refer when he was dealing with this problem.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am glad to observe, does not seem to think that there is any inconsistency between the independence of this State and the Commonwealth co-operation in which he is at present engaged. That is a conversion which I welcome, and I trust it will extend to the more remote back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party, and I should be glad to think that it includes the giant intellect of Deputy Tom Kelly.</P>

It will control Aer Lingus and possibly other subsidiary companies running other services, and, finally, the national company will look after our interests generally so far as development of commercial aviation is concerned, so that the capital required, which will cover our needs with regard to the joint operating <Col N="2440" /> company, will also be utilised for developments in connection with subsidiary companies.</P>

      <P>The provision in Section 77 for a loan by the national company to Aer Lingus, Teoranta, is made to regularise the position brought about by the setting up of the Aer Lingus company prior to the setting up of the principal company, which is to provide its finances.  The Government desired that the cross-Channel services should be put into operation as soon as possible and should not await the passage of this Bill.  Aer Lingus, Teoranta, was, accordingly, set up with a nominal share capital of £100,000 to operate these services.  The House is already familiar with the joint working arrangements come to between Aer Lingus, Teoranta, and Blackpool and West Coast Air Services, Ltd.  Aer Lingus, Teoranta, is being financed at present by the issue of debentures, which have been taken up by the English company.  When this Bill is enacted and the national company set up it will be necessary for it to discharge the liabilities which Aer Lingus, Teoranta, may have incurred and which are not satisfied.  Provision has been included in the capital of the principal company for capitalising Aer Lingus, Teoranta, and the loan provided for in this section is complementary to that provision.  The actual method by which the liability will be discharged will be settled later.  There <Col N="2441" /> is a further provision in that section specifying the method in which the loan is to be repaid.  With regard to the point about the monopoly, we are satisfied that there is room in present circumstances for only one company, so far as internal traffic is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point that arises is that the Minister says quite casually that the Government is of the opinion that there is room for only one air service in this country.  We have a monopoly in sugar, a monopoly in rubber, a monopoly in wheat, a monopoly in bacon, a monopoly in air services, a monopoly in electricity, and we are rapidly reaching a stage when every enterprise in this country is going to be governed by a monopoly which, at a stroke of the pen, can be made a branch of the Civil Service. This air service is going to be virtually a monopoly of the Civil Service.  Electricity supply is already a branch of the Civil Service.  The sugar business is virtually a monopoly of the Civil Service, and, except that the powers of regulation are so wide, the milling business is practically a branch of the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>It did emerge, as I say, from a mind which closely approximates to genius, but there it is.  I direct the attention of the House to the fact that more and more of the activities of the people of this country are becoming directly or indirectly Government controlled.  We have made national health insurance directly controlled by the Government.  We are going to make industrial assurance directly controlled by the Government; we are going to make life insurance directly controlled by the Government; and I should not be at all surprised if we make fire and accident, and the entire insurance business directly controlled by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on the Air Navigation Bill and I am not going to be deflected from what I have to say in this connection.  I ask the attention of the House to the fact that wherever the Minister for Industry and Commerce intervenes the influence of State socialism presents itself, and the Fianna Fáil Party are being dragged unwittingly into a full-dress campaign of State socialism, the logical conclusion of which is that every citizen of this State will become a wage-earning servant of the bureaucracy which occupies Government Buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a tendency which I most strenuously object to and I know perfectly well that there never was a bureaucrat born who did not think he could run his own and his neighbour's business better than anybody else, but the unfortunate citizens of this State and every other State learned by painful experience that <Col N="2443" /> they make a howling mess of everything they put a finger into.  Try to persuade a bureaucrat of that and you might as well be talking to an inmate of Grangegorman or to a gargoyle on St. Patrick's Cathedral.  You make no impression on him at all. He is completely satisfied that he knows it all and so the best thing to do is to get control of whatever new departure is envisaged in the State. I admit that in the experimental stage in the development of such a thing as transatlantic air services it may be necessary for the State to put its resources into the scale.  I see no reason whatever for making the internal air transport of this country a monopoly, and I think it is a highly-undesirable principle to introduce at this juncture, particularly when it is well known to the Minister that more than one suggestion has come forward from individuals who are prepared to undertake the operation of air services in this country, and between this country and Great Britain, without substantial State assistance of any kind.  Is that not so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point that Deputy Dillon has raised, I should say that there were a number of proposals before the Department for cross-Channel services.  The English company which shares with Aer Lingus responsibility for the service at present is very satisfactory.  It has a high reputation from the point of view of experience and capacity in this class of business, and also from the financial point of view.  I am quite satisfied the proposals put up by that company were altogether superior to any other proposals which were made.  As a matter of fact, I may say that no subsidy is required at present for the <Col N="2445" /> running of the cross-Channel services, whereas, in connection with other proposals put before the Department, the promoters demanded that a subsidy should be made available.  That is one consideration.  The service is being run efficiently and properly without any subsidy from the State.  Another consideration is that we are quite satisfied that, of the applications made to us for permits the applications made by the companies at present responsible for the service were by far the most satisfactory from the point of view of dependability, prestige, and capacity to do the work.  In connection with this cross-Channel service two companies are involved, an Irish company and a British company. There has to be recognition of the fact that you must have collaboration and co-operation between the English and the Irish companies in order to carry on the service satisfactorily.  That is being done under the present arrangement. We are fully satisfied that of the proposals put up to us, the one which was accepted was by far the best.  There is no use in the Deputy talking about bureaucracy unless he is able to show the Dáil the basis upon which it is suggested that one of the other proposals was superior to this proposal.  From the financial point of view, they were inferior and, from the point of view of general suitability, they were inferior.  We are satisfied with what has been done.  If it could be shown that there should be need for other companies I have no doubt the Minister will be prepared to look into it. In connection with this service he is satisfied that at present there is no necessity for other companies.  Talk of monopoly, having regard to the fact that these other companies or promoters were looking for a subsidy, is rather peculiar.  The monopoly at present is perfectly efficient and satisfactory to the public and is not costing the State any money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It might transpire that the difference between the two proposals was that one body was honest enough to come forward with a view to starting a service if there was a subsidy, and that another body, if they were let run a service between Dublin and Bristol, would do it for nothing, but when established they would talk business and talk about a subsidy, too.  That cuts no ice.</P>

      <P>I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that Aer Lingus, Teoranta, was going to consist of a company promoted by Olley Air Transport Company or the Blackpool and West Coast Air Transport Company, that it would have certain Irish shareholders in it, but that the bulk of the capital would be held by the Olley Air Transport Company. Is the Minister sure he is right when he says that when the debentures are paid off the Olley Air Transport Company will be out of Aer Lingus, Teoranta?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is a working agreement between Aer Lingus, Teoranta, and the Olley company, and when the question of debentures is settled by the national company, which will discharge these liabilities, the national company will then finance Aer Lingus, Teoranta, <Col N="2447" /> which will be an Irish company responsible for the conduct of the service. There is no control by the Olley company of Aer Lingus, Teoranta, but there is a working agreement between the English and the Irish companies for the running of the service.</P>

It is the intention of the Minister to fix a rate of interest on these shares which will yield a profit to the company set up under this Bill, or will it act merely as a conduit pipe to transfer money they have obtained from the Government&mdash;£1,000,000&mdash;to Aer Lingus, Teoranta, at the same rate of interest as they are being charged by the Government for it?</P>

      <P>Section 93 hangs together with Section 96, which is the section providing for the grant of a licence.  Section 93 sub-section (1) provides for the renewal of the licence. <Col N="2449" /> I understood from the Minister that he demurred from the suggestion that it was the Minister's intention to create a monopoly in this business.  I observe that in Section 86, paragraph (b), the Minister may in his absolute discretion either grant or refuse any such licence, while he is bound to grant a licence to a company which is operating at the present time.  It does seem odd that the Minister binds himself to grant a licence to the existing company when, so far as I am aware, the Minister used his influence to the utmost of his capacity to discourage other persons starting prior to January 1st, 1936.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 44:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 20, before Section 25, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Every scheme submitted to the Minister under this Part of this Act save as is otherwise provided in this section shall provide in relation to the employees of the promoting companies as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that so far as practicable every existing employee of the promoting companies upon the scheme coming into force shall be transferred with all the rights and privileges in relation to salary or wages tenure and conditions of service acquired by him to the services of the amalgamated company;</P>
    <P>(b)  that every existing employee of the promoting companies for whom employment on conditions as favourable to him as those he enjoyed in the service of the promoting company is not provided by the amalgamated company shall be entitled to compensation which shall consist of a gratuity calculated at the rate of two months' salary or wages for each completed year of <Col N="2454" /> service with the promoting company by which he was last employed;</P>
    <P>(c)  every existing employee of a promoting company transferred to the amalgamated company whose employment is terminated by such companies otherwise than on the grounds of misconduct within five years of the date of amalgamation shall for the purpose of this section be treated upon such termination as if he had not been so transferred;</P>
    <P>(d)  that such gratuity shall become payable by the amalgamated company upon the scheme of amalgamation becoming operative;</P>
    <P>(e)  that in addition to any other compensation to which he may be entitled under this scheme every collecting agent of a promoting company having goodwill interest in a collecting book shall if his services are not retained by the amalgamated company be entitled to be paid by the amalgamated company by way of additional compensation a sum equal to the amount which a willing buyer would pay for the goodwill interest in such book.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister approves a scheme under this Part of this Act and it becomes apparent to him that any employee of the promoting companies will not obtain employment in the service of the amalgamated company on terms as favourable to him as those enjoyed by him in the service of the promoting company by which he was last employed the Minister shall do all or either of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  cause a provision to be inserted in every assurance licence issued by him requiring the company to which such licence is issued to give preference of employment to persons deprived of their employment by reason of the operation of the scheme of amalgamation;</P>
    <P>(b)  require the Reinsurance Company of Ireland, Limited, to give preference of employment to persons deprived of their employment <Col N="2455" /> by reason of the operation of the scheme of amalgamation;</P>
    <P>(c)  by regulation prohibit the employment by any assurance company of spare-time agents.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of this section an existing employee of a promoting company means any person employed otherwise than in a temporary capacity by such promoting company at the commencement of this Act.&mdash; (Deputy Norton).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was very exhaustively discussed last night. I do not think there is any necessity to discuss it at any greater length now, and I am not going to press the matter further beyond saying this, that compensation, whether by way of lump sum or by retention after redundancy is established, must be financed by the Exchequer unless the amalgamated company is to be put into bankruptcy. None of us want that.  There are no funds available in the five Irish companies to provide fair compensation for redundant employees under the amalgamation scheme that is envisaged.  I think the Minister ought to give us an undertaking now that when amalgamation has been put through, steps will be taken to establish by way of arbitration what members of the amalgamated staffs are in effect redundant, and that the Exchequer will thereupon undertake at least a share of whatever burdens the amalgamation will place upon the amalgamated company.  If that is not done there is no use in the Minister talking about the compensation, because giving fair compensation to the staffs that are redundant would bankrupt the companies.  None of us want that.  I want to preserve the rights of the employees and at the same time to keep this insurance going.  If you are to make the burden too heavy you will break the amalgamated company, and we all want to avoid that.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy pressing the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister give us an assurance that in considering any scheme of amalgamation he would amend the Bill in such a <Col N="2456" /> way that sanction from this House to the amalgamation proposals would be required.  In that way we might ascertain whether the proposals for amalgamation provided compensation for those employees rendered redundant. The House would then have an opportunity of seeing that the proposals, in fact, did embody compensation for the employees.  If the Minister would do that, then we could discuss the subject of amalgamation close up to the scheme of amalgamation.  If that were agreed to by the Minister some difficulties could be removed and the House could see whether it approved of the amalgamation having regard to the proposals for compensating the employees.  At the moment all we are left with is the promise of the Minister that he will do his best to get reasonable treatment for the redundant employees.  But Deputies must remember that the Minister cannot get reasonable treatment for the employees unless he is empowered by the Bill to do so.  After the speech made by him last night, I am afraid very few companies will offer compensation of their own volition. Would the Minister now say that the amalgamation will be brought before the House, so that we can see whether the employees are being reasonably treated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the amalgamation proposal should be brought before the House.  The Minister has no desire in connection with any function he may perform about these amalgamation proposals, other than to see that the employees get fair play.  At the same time the Deputy has to recognise that the business of amalgamation is a complicated and technical matter which may present very great difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will recognise that the fact that the scheme had to be brought to the House to be discussed here would mean that you are placing further obstacles in the way of the companies coming together. If you bring up the amalgamation scheme to be discussed in one particular connection, I fail to see how you can prevent other matters in connection <Col N="2457" /> with the scheme from being discussed. Presumably when the amalgamation scheme is completed each company will be fairly well satisfied that under the circumstances it has done as well as possible.  It may be that every company may not be absolutely satisfied but under the conditions at present obtaining they will feel perhaps that they have done as well as they could reasonably expect.  The Deputy wants to bring the whole amalgamation scheme before the House and have all the details of the insurance business of the different companies discussed here.  I am afraid I could not agree with that.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy put up some more reasonable proposal it might be considered. I can assure the House that the intention is to see that a fair scheme for giving compensation to the employees will be a feature of any amalgamation scheme before it can receive the sanction of the Minister. I told the House last night that personally&mdash;and I believe that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of the same opinion&mdash;having regard to all the circumstances, we should do our utmost to see that the new amalgamated company will keep on the existing employees.  I have stated in that connection that there is great redundancy in the insurance business.  But having regard to the fact that we all want to help the Irish companies and that we do not want the employees to have the feeling that they are left out in the cold, so to speak, or to feel that we are simply carrying out a rationalisation scheme merely for the reduction of expenses, I want the employees to feel that their interests will and must be considered in an amalgamation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has frequently been made that there may be some redundancy for the time being and though we may put a burden on the company at the start we have to look forward to increasing prosperity in the Irish insurance business.  I am convinced that, no matter what the employees connected with the business feel, once this Bill becomes law the Irish companies will have got an opportunity that they had not before, and that they will go ahead <Col N="2458" /> steadily: that the companies will make progress and that they will have a prestige and security that they had not before.  I think it should satisfy Deputies that I have assured them that fair treatment for the employees must be an essential feature of any scheme of which the Minister would approve.  I cannot say what the basis of compensation might be.  I know, for example, in Great Britain, that when amalgamation takes place between companies, the question of staff is generally satisfactorily dealt with.  It has been found possible to maintain all the staffs of the companies amalgamating in the new company and I think in regard to some of our companies here, at any rate, that will be possible.  I cannot say definitely that all the employees will, without qualification, be kept on but that would certainly be our aim as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will realise that it would not be reasonable to discuss the details of the amalgamation scheme in the House, and also that we cannot at this stage presume to lay down in the Bill, even if we thought it should be done, what the basis of compensation should be.  Surely we ought to leave it to the companies in the first instance in the hammering out of the scheme to put up proposals.  If they do not approach the Minister's desire in that regard, if they do not attain his standard, he will ask them to go back again and reconsider the matter.  The Deputies will have ample opportunity, because they will know what is going on in the insurance business.  They know already that a certain amount of progress has been made.  They will know when matters come to a head, when the Minister's sanction is likely to be given, and when the amalgamation scheme is completed, and I think they will have opportunities to raise the matter if they so desire.  For these reasons, and not through any lack of interest in the employees, or lack of feeling towards them, I feel that we cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion of having the amalgamation scheme submitted to the House for approval is made because of the Minister's reluctance to accept this amendment.  It is <Col N="2459" /> probably not the most desirable way of dealing with the matter, but the proposal at all events will provide more protection for the employees than the passage of this Bill containing no provision for compensating employees who will lose their employment.  If the Minister could see his way to accept this amendment it would not be necessary to make any proposals whereby the amalgamation scheme should secure sanction from the House.  It is only because of the Minister's unwillingness to accept the amendment that I make that suggestion.</P>
      <P>The Minister now says that he desires to get fair compensation and fair treatment for these employees. But my complaint, and the complaint of other Deputies who have spoken, is that the Minister, when talking to the companies, will be handcuffed in the matter of trying to wring from them any compensation for any employee. He has no legislative power to insist that the companies must provide the compensation, and he is going into these negotiations handcuffed and unable, therefore, to fight for the employees in the way he would be able to fight if he had a section providing that, in case of redundancy or disemployment, the employees would secure proper compensation from the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I will make another suggestion to the Minister on the matter. Will the Minister between now and the concluding stages of the Bill draft an amendment to provide that any employee who loses his employment, or whose position has been seriously worsened as a result of the passage of the Bill, will be enabled to submit to an arbitrator, to be appointed by the Minister or by the Chief Justice, a claim for compensation as a result of his dismissal or loss of emoluments? If the Minister will draft an amendment to provide that any person who loses his employment, or whose position has been seriously worsened, may seek compensation from an arbitrator to be appointed by the Minister or the Chief Justice, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that at least there will be some provision in the Bill entitling a dismissed employee <Col N="2460" /> to sue for compensation if his position is worsened or if he loses his employment.  In that way, an employee will have a statutory right to seek compensation, and that is much more valuable to the employee than any assurance by any Minister, no matter what the Minister's political complexion may be&mdash;an assurance which may never be possible of implementation. Will the Minister be prepared to agree to a proposal of that kind, the drafting to be in his own hands, subject to its being a reasonable amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion further.  The weakness in the Deputy's position is that he says, &ldquo;As a result of the passage of the Bill.&rdquo;  There is no compulsion on the companies to go ahead with amalgamation; that is a matter for themselves. Certain employees of the companies are bound to benefit; in fact I think a very large number of them are bound to benefit from the very fact that an amalgamated company is set up.  The Deputy does not seem to pay any attention to these considerations. The Minister has not taken power of compulsion with regard to amalgamation. The matter has been left in the hands of the companies.  They are being asked to prepare a scheme themselves. Their intention, I take it, is to come together and put up a scheme themselves.  If they are going to be handicapped by the Minister's coming in with definitely statutory provisions saying that they must do this or they must do that in connection with their amalgamation scheme, I do not think it is going to help the cause of amalgamation. I have given to the House an assurance of the Government's policy in the matter.  I am not prepared to go further than to say that, in connection with any amalgamation scheme which comes up, the Minister will go carefully into the matter of compensation or otherwise for employees, and satisfy himself that the employees are being treated as decently as can be done in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The amendment requires that an advertisement shall be inserted in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and also in two newspapers. The subject matter of the advertisement would appear to be left the same as in the original section, namely, a statement of the nature of the proposed amalgamation, a summary of the material facts, and &ldquo;a copy of every actuarial (including the independent actuarial) report and any other report furnished to the Minister with such scheme.&rdquo;  If reports of that kind have to be advertised in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in two newspapers, I imagine the cost will be pretty considerable.</P>

      <P>In page 23, before Section 38, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section the expression &ldquo;existing company&rdquo; shall mean any existing Saorstát Eireann company doing industrial insurance business and life insurance business, which has, on its last valuation made prior to the passing of this Act, or which on a valuation made in accordance with the provisions of this Act, disclosed a surplus of assets over and above the actuarial liability on its policies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, Sir.  This amendment raises the whole question of the form which the amalgamation of the companies is to take.  We have progressed very rapidly, since this Bill came before the House, on this question of amalgamation.  Recently it was <Col N="2466" /> announced that it was the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to amalgamate all companies doing industrial assurance business in Saorstát Eireann.  I am concerned primarily with the five companies doing this class of business in Saorstát Eireann, and I want to say now that unless the Minister gets some power under this or an amending Bill to effect amalgamation, satisfactory amalgamation will never come to pass.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to remedy the position of a solvent Irish insurance company which finds itself in the position, after the amalgamation carried through by the Minister's assistance under this Bill, of having on its right hand the great English industrial assurance companies, like the Prudential, the Britannic and the Pearl, competing with it for business, and on its left hand an amalgamated company consisting of the Irish companies that have been insolvent but that were now amalgamated under the Minister's wing, which had in them a large sum of Government money put there for the purpose of rendering their funds solvent, and which were issuing policies in the ordinary course of business as an amalgamated company with a Government guarantee endorsed on every policy.  In such a position no solvent independent Irish company could carry on for 12 months.  It will be sufficiently difficult for any Irish industrial company to carry on under the onerous conditions imposed on them by the Bill but if, in addition to carrying the burden of these conditions, they have to meet the competition of a Government insurance company on the one hand, and of wealthy British competitors on the other hand, it would mean that the solvent Irish insurance company would go to the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reward for having preserved solvency during the last 15 years, for having denied themselves dividends while they were putting money into the funds in order to keep the company at the highest pitch of efficiency, the reward for directors who did without fees in order to ensure that every penny profit would go back to the insurance fund to preserve its solvency, <Col N="2467" /> is that they are going to be driven to the wall, their business is to be destroyed and no compensation of any kind will be available for them, while the insolvent company that pursued a much more reckless course and put their funds into jeopardy are going to be taken under the Minister's wing and set up as an independent company, and the great British companies that have consistently followed the policy of ferocious competition with the Irish institutions are going to be left masters of the situation.</P>
    <P>I want a proviso to the effect that if the Minister approves the amalgamation scheme and establishes a solvent unit composed of what were hitherto insolvent companies, that an independent Irish company which has kept itself solvent shall be entitled as of right to claim admission to the amalgamation on terms at least as favourable as those enjoyed by any amalgamated company.  I have described the solvent companies to which I have referred as an existing company, and the amalgamated company represents the unit formed by the insolvent companies which are brought together under the Minister's patronage.  The terms under which the existing company would be entitled to enter the amalgamation are set out in the Seventh Schedule, which consists of six sections and calls for no explanation as most of it is routine except, perhaps, for paragraph (i) of subsection (6), which is there for the purpose of providing that if any external law refuses to take cognisance of the short-cut in company practice which the procedure I recommend would involve, the new amalgamated company would be entitled to use the seal and the name of any of the constituent companies in order to comply with the law of a foreign country which did not recognise the completeness of the amalgamation envisaged by this proposal.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister does not want me to go through the Seventh Schedule and comment on the various paragraphs, although it does contain some new principles in amalgamation procedure.  It would be tedious to <Col N="2468" /> deal with it at length, particularly in view of something which I desire to add.  Having carefully considered that amendment, I am satisfied that it is the best suggestion which could be offered within the framework of the existing Bill, but I recommend it only subject to this reservation&mdash;that I am now satisfied, in the situation in which we now find ourselves, that no satisfactory amalgamation could be carried out under the terms of this Bill, and that what will have to be done is to secure either that the Minister will devise a scheme himself, fixing a common rule of compensation for each of the five constituent companies, or else that the five companies must come together and devise a scheme which will have to be incorporated in an amending Bill and be carried through all stages of amalgamation by statute.</P>
    <P>If that course is not pursued it will be open&mdash;perhaps not to every shareholder, if a certain majority of the shareholders could be secured for the scheme&mdash;to each individual policy-holder to start an action against the amalgamated company to object to the scheme of amalgamation, If there were 250,000 policy-holders, it would be possible to start 250,000 separate actions in the High Court, by way of motion, to move the court to reject the scheme on 250,000 different grounds set out by the 250,000 applicants, when the amalgamated company came before the court to confirm the terms of the amalgamation.  That would make the process of amalgamation virtually impossible, if you bear in mind that the five amalgamating companies are not all <i>pari passu.</i>  One may be comparatively prosperous; the second may be reasonably prosperous; the third may be insolvent; the fourth may be almost insolvent, and the fifth may be a line-ball. The rights of each policy-holder must be considered by the court, so that substantial justice will be done to each one in the new amalgamated company which will emerge.</P>
    <P>This is a question of desperate complexity, but I feel bound, in view of the fact that I sponsored this amendment, to submit to this House two schemes in broad outline, which I believe <Col N="2469" /> would be superior to this amendment. The first would be that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would approach the five companies and direct an actuarial valuation to be made of them.  Let us assume that the first company with which he has to deal has an issued capital of £12,500, a premium income of £100,000, and a deficit on its funds of £250,000.  The Minister wants to amalgamate that company with another company which has a premium income of £100,000 and which is solvent, but without a surplus. Let us assume that the capital of that second company is also £12,500. The third company has similar capital and a similar premium income, with a surplus on its fund of £10,000.  I want the Minister to pay into the fund of No. 1 company the sum of £250,000, which will thereupon render its fund solvent, and to accept in exchange therefor 250,000 shares in the company which was, until he made his contribution, actuarially insolvent from the policy-holders' point of view.</P>
    <P>He will then find himself in the position of having three companies to deal with, one of which is solvent from the actuarial point of view, but which has capital out of all proportion to its business; the second, which is actuarially solvent, and the third which is actuarially solvent with a surplus of £10,000 on its fund.  I then want him to deal with the goodwill of those three businesses on a common basis.  It does not make very much difference what basis is accepted, so long as it is the same for all three, but one accepted basis is that the value of an industrial insurance company's goodwill is the amount of one year's premium income if the company were solvent.  That would mean that the value of the goodwill of each of those companies would be £100,000.  I want him then to float a new company, and let that new company acquire from the three companies I have already described their entire business, giving each of them 100,000 shares in exchange for the business taken over; £100,000 in respect of their goodwill plus one share for every one pound surplus on the fund ascertained in the actuarial valuation.  That would mean that No. 1 company would get <Col N="2470" /> 100,000 one pound shares; the second company would get 100,000 one pound shares, and the third company, which has a premium income of £100,000 and £10,000 surplus, would receive 110,000 shares.  Those shares, having been paid over in exchange for the companies' business, would be distributed amongst the shareholders of those three companies.  The Minister would have become the proprietor of 250,000 shares in the No. 1 company, and, therefore, when he came to distribute the 100,000 shares which the amalgamated company had given in exchange for the business of No. 1 company, the Minister would receive 2,500 shares in the amalgamated company for every 125 shares which the shareholders of No. 1 company would receive.  Do I make myself clear in that regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The shareholders of No. 2 company would receive 100,000 shares divided amongst them in proportion to their holding in No. 2 company, and the shareholders in No. 3 company would receive 110,000 shares divided amongst them in the proportion of their original holdings.  That done, the Minister would have an amalgamated company free from all liability under the Companies Act restricting it from paying dividends on its capital until the money paid in by the Minister in order to restore solvency had been redeemed, because it is to be noted that the Minister would put the money designed for the purpose of restoring solvency into a company which he there and then wound up and sold to a new company, thus ending its career, and the Companies Act&mdash;in so far as it restricted payment of dividends on capital while loans were outstanding&mdash;would not operate in regard to the new amalgamated company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister could start off with a clear field before him, to carry on the insurance business and these shares in the amalgamated company would ordinarily be quoted on the Stock Exchange and the Minister would be free either to sell them in the open market or else to make some agreement with the amalgamated <Col N="2471" /> company that so much per annum would be set aside for the redemption of so many shares as he had in his possession, if some scheme of that kind could be devised.  The all important thing, however, is that in that plan of amalgamation you could start off with a completely clean sheet in a new company.  Now, in order to do that effectively, that scheme would have to be drafted, incorporated in an amending Bill, and passed through this House by Statute, thus overriding certain rights, and it would be desirable to get an assurance from actuarial experts that the legitimate interests of all interested parties in the constituent companies would be provided for.  With that assurance the House would have to take a short cut, bearing in mind that desperate situations require desperate remedies and that, if something of the kind were not done, it would result in the collapse of companies with resultant disastrous loss to their employees and policy-holders.</P>
    <P>The second plan which, I believe, the Minister may have in mind, is to amalgamate these three companies in their existing state and to offset the surplus of No. 3 company against the deficiency of No. 1 company in the amalgamation; then, having completed that offset, to ascertain the actuarial valuation of the three amalgamated businesses, and then for the Minister to put in sufficient money to render the amalgamated company solvent. If the Minister does that, the provisions of the Companies Act may be overcome by Statute, and it might be possible to carry on the business in the ordinary way as if the difficulties created by the Companies Act did not exist.  This difficulty, however, arises: that it does not seem fair to bring the policy-holders of a company which is, not only solvent, but has a surplus, into an amalgamation with a company which has a large deficiency and to use the surplus belonging to No. 3 company in order partially to discharge the deficiency of No. 1 company. That could be partially met by <Col N="2472" /> allotting shares, in the process of amalgamation, of different classes to the different companies in accordance with their status prior to amalgamation. I could conceive of a scheme being devised whereby the interests of shareholders in these three companies might be adequately provided for&mdash;of shareholders, I say, but one has to keep constantly in mind, when dealing with amalgamation schemes of this character, that there are two classes of persons whose interests must be fairly considered.  One is the shareholders who hold the capital of the company and the other is the policy-holders who are the creditors of the company.  Very frequently their interests are entirely different, and, while you have completely safeguarded the interests of one, you may have done material injustice to the interests of the other.  I do not propose to go into greater detail in regard to the second scheme to which I have just referred, because I am convinced that in the long run the Minister must come to recognise that the only satisfactory way of carrying his amalgamation scheme through is to establish solvency in all the constituent companies first; then to carry the scheme and to start on a new page.</P>
    <P>Now, just this word in conclusion, Sir.  Some people may say, &ldquo;Why should the Minister take £250,000 and put it into a company which, in the ordinary trend of commerce, would go burst?&rdquo; The answer is this: It was made perfectly clear here by Deputy McGilligan that the Executive Council learned, not to-day nor yesterday, of the very precarious condition in which many of the Irish insurance companies were, and having become seized of that fact they asked themselves this question: &ldquo;Should we bring down the axe now and wind up these companies that are in an insolvent position, or should we rather carry on and hope for better things?&rdquo; It was pointed out that to carry on and hope for better things meant that new persons would be induced to put their money into these companies by taking out policies, that new young people starting out on their careers would be induced to take jobs <Col N="2473" /> from these companies, and that if the Government knew these companies to be insolvent they should not leave them there to serve as a trap for new policy-holders or new employees.  The Government, however, made up their minds to this fact, that, while they admitted that to be true, the disaster resultant on the winding-up of these companies would be very great and might result in substantial injustice, and also that it must be borne in mind that the great British companies were in just as bad a condition in their early days as these young companies now are in their beginnings.  However, the law was much more lax in these days when the British companies were starting than it is now, and in the light of all these considerations the Executive Council of this State made up its mind that they would allow these companies to carry on, hoping that they would improve, but with the fixed determination that if, as a result of their determining to adopt that policy, there was a subsequent catastrophe in which an Irish insurance company, which owed Irish insurers £200,000 or £300,000 went bankrupt, the Government would feel a moral responsibility to step in and say: &ldquo;Now that this has happened, we must throw our cloak about them, wind up the company, and give the policy-holders in that company 20/- for every pound they have invested.&rdquo; Now, when this Bill is on the stocks, the time has come when some such policy must be pursued.  The alternative is for the Government to find from £300,000 to £400,000 immediately and meet the claims of the policy-holders of some of these companies, or to produce the requisite funds to make these companies solvent, and, in God's good time, they will get their money back, because, if industrial insurance is run upon reasonably conservative lines, and there is adequate finance to carry them over the initial stages, industrial insurance will pay in the long run.  The Minister is now in a position to control competition and generally to fortify his own position. Therefore I say that, while at first glance it might seem to be asking too much to ask the Minister to put so formidable a sum as £250,000 into one <Col N="2474" /> of these companies in order to restore solvency, I say that in the long run it is, instead of being an extravagant demand, the only economical course open to him.  If he does not do it, he is going to lose a very much larger sum irretrievably if he intends to honour, what is unquestioned, the bond&mdash;the spirit of the bond, if not its letter&mdash;of the Government's predecessors in office.</P>
    <P>I feel that the scheme I outlined for the Minister now would save him all the money, would divert a very serious complication, and would be infinitely superior to the proposal I make here, but it would require amending legislation to carry it into effect.  The proposal I make here is, I believe, the best proposal that can be made within the framework of this Bill, and it does provide this minimum justice, that it gives security to the solvent Irish company that is prepared to submit to any investigation the Minister wishes to make, at present or at any other time. Unless the security given by this amendment is provided under the terms of this Bill, the position of the solvent Irish company is hopeless and the reward for their prudence and foresight is destruction.  I confidently ask the Minister to give them the protection I ask for in this amendment, even though he announces his intention now, by amending legislation, to carry into effect something on the lines of the amalgamation scheme I have described at some length in the course of my observations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be interesting to follow Deputy Dillon in the two schemes he outlined as being the ideal schemes for dealing with the situation, but I do not think there would be anything to be gained at this stage of the Bill by discussing them.  I think that if they were put up for discussion, and if we had some notice of the proposals, they would possibly be found to be defective in some respect or other, but, as I say, there is no profit to be derived from discussing them at the moment.  The amendment is before us and we have to deal with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon evidently recognises that the proposal in the amendment is <Col N="2475" /> not the best that can be put forward, but that it is the best that could be done under the Bill.  The amendment is defective in this way, that the assumption underlying it is that there is a fixed basis for actuarial valuation, which is not the case.  No insurance company getting an actuarial valuation carried out is bound by any fixed basis.  The decision as to what the basis is to be lies with the directors. Usually they take the advice of the actuary and decide to value on a certain basis.  That is then adopted and published as the valuation of the company. Under this Bill the Minister need not accept the actuarial basis submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about actuarial bases in general.  There is no such thing as a fixed actuarial basis, as is implied by the Deputy's amendment. The actuary can recommend to the directors any basis he likes&mdash;a particular life-table or rate per cent.&mdash;and the directors may adopt that, or they may say they want a more liberal table, or perhaps a higher percentage, in order to show a better result, and the actuary may agree to give that in his valuation.  There is, however, no fixed basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, and that is the point we have to keep in mind. That is why, I take it&mdash;I cannot say definitely&mdash;insurance legislation has avoided prescribing a certain basis.  It has been left to the Minister, or the Board of Trade, or whoever it is, to be satisfied with the basis adopted, and that is all that can be done.  Seeing that that is the position, the Deputy's amendment is impossible to carry out on that line of actuarial valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-section (2) of the amendment, the Deputy seeks to give the solvent company, as he explained in his speech, an opportunity of coming in whenever that company wishes, and that appears to me to be unfair.  If we get two companies here to amalgamate, and they become an amalgamated company, company C stands aside and says: &ldquo;I can afford to stand aside.  If they succeed I will join; if they fail, I will not join.&rdquo;  I think it would be an unfair advantage to give to what the Deputy defines here as an existing company.  I think they should either come in at the beginning or stay out.  There is, of course, apart from this Bill, a provision for amalgamation under the former insurance law &mdash;I think, the 1909 Act and that is <Col N="2477" /> open to companies that stand out from amalgamation now.  At any time, they can adopt that machinery and amalgamate. I do not know whether some of the points which Deputy Dillon has put forward will, in practice, be such formidable difficulties.  For instance, he pointed out that every policy holder might object, but I do not think that, in practice, that is likely to prove a very serious obstacle to amalgamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's criticisms of Deputy Dillon's amendment and it seems to me that he was merely criticising the details.  For instance, he said that there was no fixed basis of actuarial valuation, and that, by adopting one basis, Company A might have a surplus and Company B a deficiency, and that, taking another basis, the position might be reversed.  I should not like to contradict the Minister, but I certainly share Deputy Dillon's scepticism as to the difference being very considerable.  At the same time, it seems to me that this is one of the least difficulties or disadvantages involved in a scheme such as this.  The Minister has admitted that the position with regard to difficulties occasioned by various tables could be got over by insisting on the scheme being carried through on one particular table.  Turning to Deputy Dillon's amendment, I do not know that I am greatly in love with the whole of his suggestion.  At the same time, it is a reasonable proposal, and although I have no power to speak for the insurance companies, in the end they will probably welcome a certain measure of compulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an aspect that Deputy Dillon mentioned that I would like to enlarge on, namely, that if some suggestion on the lines of the amendment is not accepted, a difficulty to which I strongly object will be created.  One sees it occurring from time to time in connection with new industries that have been started.  It is a great hardship that a new company should be started and be helped largely by Government funds, to compete with a rival concern when the only thing that can be said against <Col N="2478" /> it is that it has conducted its business on a solvent basis and managed it on conservative lines.  That is not confined to the insurance business. It is a terrible hardship.  Sooner or later this country will reap the evil effects of rewarding people who launched out on speculative paths and got into difficulty.  Their reward for getting into that position is to be helped out by Government money. When that feeling becomes really fixed in the mind of the business community, there will soon be no solvent companies in this country. That may seem a far-fetched statement, and one that will never come about, but I must certainly protest and add my voice to that of Deputy Dillon's, in suggesting that it is most unfair and most unreasonable to leave even one old-established company, which is in a solvent position to carry on its business, to face the competition of another company that had got into difficulties and got a large grant of Government money without having to pay interest on it. I do not see how the Government can proceed to help an insurance company in any other way.  I stated on the Committee Stage that I did not see that it was going to help matters greatly to put a large sum of money into the cash box and then to invite an insurance company to embark on a fresh campaign and to turn over a new leaf.  I wish to be taken as protesting against that situation.  I suggest that in the long run probably some such scheme of amalgamation as Deputy Dillon put forward would be the easiest and cheapest solution. I can see that the Minister is obviously afraid at this stage to commit himself to saying whether Deputy Dillon's suggestion is sound or unsound. He confined himself to dealing with details of Deputy Dillon's suggestion that might be open to criticism.  The Minister should give the Department time to consider the matter, to see whether a solution of the difficulty would not lie along such lines as were suggested, and to bring forward some proposal at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going to happen?  The Minister is going to say to an insolvent company that it must wind up or amalgamate, and he has the duty of winding up an insolvent company.  The end will be that an insolvent company will amalgamate, and the Minister will have to make it solvent in order to make it possible to carry on.  They will all be in one unit. As the Minister will be by far the largest shareholder, he will have to put in a very large sum of money to make the company solvent, and will have to carry on the business in order to get some of his money back.  Therefore, you will have that amalgamated company and one or two Irish solvent companies carrying on.  They are in a perfectly sound position.  You will also have the Pearl, the Prudential, the Britannic and other big wealthy British corporations carrying on.  Heretofore an Irish solvent company could always use as an argument that they were an Irish company, that they were as solvent as any other company, and, while they might not give as good terms as others in the way of bonus, the argument that they were an Irish <Col N="2480" /> company got business from the Prudential, from the Britannic and other companies.  Now they have on their flank another Irish company, which says that it is Irish and just as solvent as the Pearl or the Prudential, and that while they might not give as good terms as these companies, they had a Government guarantee for every policy they issued.  They could say that while another company was a decent company it had not got as much money as the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister know from his experience of insurance that between the competition of big companies offering better terms and an Irish company offering the additional security of a Government guarantee, independent Irish companies would be wiped out?  I say that is an injustice.  I recognise all the difficulties that the Minister has to confront in this complex problem.  I do not want to press the amendment, but I feel that it is necessary we should make it clear that we are anxious to co-operate and to give any scheme that occurs to us into his hands so that he may make out of it something which might operate eventually to the benefit of all.  We had the principle of this Bill decided on the Second Reading. There is no use going behind that. We opposed the principle in many particulars. Having put it on record that we opposed the principle, and having been defeated in our opposition, then I think there must be amalgamation by statute.  That is the burden of the advice I have to offer the Minister.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2483" /> In page 27, at the end of Section 45 to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6)  Whenever the sum assured under a policy of industrial assurance (issued for a purpose for which industrial assurance companies may issue policies of industrial assurance under this section) does not exceed the sum of twenty-five pounds such sum shall be presumed to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>On the Recommittal Stage there was considerable discussion as to the meaning of the limitation in this section to reasonable expenses in connection with the death and funeral.  In his memorandum to the Cohen Committee, the Industrial Assurance Commissioner was quite definite that the wording of the 1923 Act, &ldquo;funeral expenses,&rdquo; required revision and he put forward four alternative wordings.  He expressed no preference for any one. The first of the four alternatives was in the exact words in the Bill.  Since it has not been considered necessary to fix an absolute limit, we think that the matter has been got over by the present provision and that the question of reasonableness will not be raised where the amount is not in excess of £25.  That does not prevent amounts over £25 being considered reasonable but under £25 they will be definitely reasonable under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I suggest that he should look again into the wording of the last line of the amendment.  I think it is open to some objection in that it does not fully carry out what the Minister intends.  The wording in the last line is &ldquo;shall be presumed.&rdquo; I suggest that the proper term is &ldquo;shall be deemed to be reasonable.&rdquo; Where you presume something to be reasonable, that presumption is liable to be rebutted.  If you deem it to be reasonable that cannot be interfered with in any way.  I suggest to the <Col N="2484" /> Minister that if the intention is as he stated, that the sum of £25 and under should be definitely regarded as reasonable, he should alter the word &ldquo;presume&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;deem&rdquo; because then his intention would be properly carried out.  If the word &ldquo;presumed&rdquo; is left in the sub-section, undoubtedly an effort will be made to rebut the presumption arising from the use of that expression.</P>

      <P>In page 27, before Section 46 (1) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Life Assurance Act, 1774, it shall be lawful for an industrial assurance company to issue policies of industrial assurance on the life of a child under the age of ten years if, but only if, such policies are issued to a parent, grandparent, step-parent, brother, or sister of such child or to an uncle or aunt of such child if such child resides with such uncle or aunt at the time when the policy is effected.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister evidently <Col N="2485" /> prefers to make a fool of himself by stating in the Bill that notwithstanding an Act passed by the British Parliament, during the time that the Irish Parliament was operating here, something is permitted to be done.  I suggest that the Act referred to never applied to this country at all.  It would be far preferable to have an express enactment stating that &ldquo;it shall be lawful notwithstanding the provisions of any Act, rule or law to the contrary,&rdquo; to effect the assurance mentioned, without reference to this particular Act.  There is, to put it mildly, considerable doubt as to whether this pre-Union statute ever did apply to this country at all.  To make the thing absolutely clear, I submit the phrase I have suggested to him would be better than the wording, &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Life Assurance Act, 1774.&rdquo;  The phrase should be &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any statute, rule or law to the contrary, it shall be lawful.&rdquo; Then we would not have appearing in one of our statutes a reference to a British statute which, so far as I have been able to ascertain, never applied to this country at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I move amendment No. 68.  I do not wish to elaborate anything said on the last Stage. These three amendments raise the point as to whether or not the proper principle is that of adjustment of age or the principle introduced into this Bill of forcing the companies to verify the age stated by applicants for policies of assurance.  We pressed on the Minister on the last occasion as strongly as in us lay that the more reasonable and more just principle was that of adjustment of age.  We pointed out that the provisions of the Bill, as they then stood, forcing the companies to verify the age of applicants within <Col N="2489" /> a period of four months, would probably work hardship.  Amendments have been put down for this stage to deal with that aspect of the question and the Minister has met the point, to some extent, in one of his own amendments.  Before dealing with that matter, I should like to reiterate briefly what was said on a previous Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We think that the proposal contained in the Bill, forcing companies to undertake the task of verifying the age stated in the proposal for a policy of industrial assurance, is not merely a hardship on the companies but is likely to lead to the inducement and encouragement of fraud.  We pressed that aspect of the question on the Minister on the last Stage of the Bill.  We said that we had no desire to do anything which would encourage fraud. The principle of adjustment of age, we pointed out, was one that allowed the companies freedom and at the same time did substantial justice to the policy-holders.  We did not plead for anything which would enable an industrial assurance company to repudiate their policy on the ground that the wrong age had been inserted in the proposal form.  What we said was that the practice which exists in England should operate here&mdash;a practice provided for not merely by statute but which existed in the case of reputable insurance companies before any statutory provision came into operation.  If a wrong age were inserted in the proposal form even deliberately and with fraudulent intent, these companies did not repudiate their policy but adjusted the amount payable on the policy to the correct age.  We think that that is the proper principle.  We think that it is a sound principle and just to both parties.  We think that there is nothing to be said for the principle that is being forced on the companies and the policy-holders by this Bill. Even with the relaxation proposed to be given in a further amendment by the Minister, we think that substantial hardship and injustice may arise.  We think that this is an inducement and an encouragement to fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out during the debate on the last Stage that if the Minister looked at the criminal records of this <Col N="2490" /> country, he would find that certain people, without any inducement from the agents of industrial assurance companies, had given the age of relatives they were proposing to insure at 55 years when, in fact, they were in receipt of the old age pension.  People of that type do not require the assistance of an agent of any assurance company to perpetrate a fraud.  They did it, in fact, without the assistance of any agent.  The case is within my experience because I directed prosecutions against them at the instance of the Department concerned&mdash;prosecutions not for returning a fraudulent age in the proposal form but for putting a wrong age in the death certificate in order to obtain money by false pretences and fraud from an assurance company.  The Minister will find numerous cases of that class in the criminal records.  I do not want that anything we do here should give encouragement to that class of person. The Minister's proposals amount to an encouragement to these people.  As I said before, once the provisions of this Bill get known, once it is known that the burden of verifying the age given by the proposer in the proposal form is upon the assurance company, you will have a deluge of fraudulent statements in the hope that so much work will be thrown upon the companies that they will not be able, in the time laid down by the statute, to ascertain whether the stated age is correct or not.  I protest against the inducement to fraud and fraudulent practice enshrined in this Bill.  There is nothing to be said for this principle as against the principle of adjustment of age, which is fair to both parties and does no injustice to either.  The principle put forward and supported by the Minister up to the present encourages fraud and allows the person to get the advantage of his fraud. It may do injustice to some of the companies who may not be in a position, within the statutory period, to ascertain whether the age given in the proposal form is the correct one or not. I want to make a protest against that principle.  We in this House ought not to encourage fraud or allow people to get the fruits of their fraud.  That is what the Minister is doing in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is seriously concerned about the companies in this matter.  What about the policy-holders? Have we not had it stated from responsible Deputies in this House who have some acquaintance with the circumstances of insured persons that they have, after they had been paying premiums for a long term of years to insurance companies, found in certain instances that these insurance companies have sought to deprive them of the moneys to which they were entitled?  I cannot believe that these people were altogether fraudulent or as fraudulent as the Deputy on the other side of the House makes out.</P>
      <P>The principle of insurance legislation should be to protect the policy-holders at all costs.  A great many of these unfortunate people do not realise the restrictions upon them, the restrictions which enable the insurance companies at certain stages to refuse to give them fair play.  The insurance companies may quote their regulations but that is poor satisfaction for the poor person who has made an investment that, as he thinks, will give him a return at a certain date.  He finds he is not able to realise that investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that there are abuses with regard to age.  The fact that it has been sought to defraud the old age pension authorities does not at all convince me that it would be possible to defraud the insurance companies so easily.  A birth certificate for every person who lives in this country at the present time can, I think, be secured and thus the age of the person can be definitely established. There may be costs placed upon the company; but if there is any question that the policy-holders are not fully protected as appears to be the fairly general belief at present, if poor people have not been fairly considered by the insurance companies when they come to raise this question of age and try to deprive the poor person of what he might legitimately expect, then we should see that the responsibility is on the insurance company, that on the question of the age of the insured <Col N="2492" /> person they should secure evidence to satisfy them.</P>
    <P>We are trying to meet the Deputy's point under amendment No. 76, if I may refer to it.  There we are increasing the period from four months to 12 months.  Then within a 12 months' period the company may have the right to adjust the terms of the policy so as to make such terms conform to the terms calculated on the true age of such person.  For that reason we are substituting 12 months for four months.  Our information is that on probably 70 per cent. of industrial assurance policies there are no claims, and that some 6) per cent. lapse within the first year.  It will not, therefore, be the case that the companies will have to secure the evidence of age&mdash;presuming that they have to do it&mdash;in every individual case.  They will only have to do it in a certain percentage of the cases.  I think amendment No. 76 should meet the Deputy's point of view.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has stated specifically that this question of the age must be determined at the outset and not disputed later on.  That cannot be questioned later.  Everybody will have got fair warning of the position.  I think amendment No. 76 will go a good way to meet the Deputy's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>If I may say so without disrespect to the Minister there was not one single word, not even one sentence of his remarks that was relevant to the observations I made on the amendment I am proposing.  Not one single word of his was relevant to what I have put before the House.  The Minister completely missed the entire point in the amendment.  He started off by suggesting that he could not believe that there was any substance in the charge I made that people were making fraudulent statements as to their age.  If the Minister will look into the records of the Attorney-General's Department from 1926 to 1932, the years when I was there, he will find the very cases that I have referred to&mdash;cases of relatives giving the age of their people at 50 to 55 years &mdash;people who subsequently turned out <Col N="2493" /> to be in receipt of old age pensions. The Minister's sentimental mind may not like to think that these things happen.  But if he will look up the criminal records of this country he will find that these things have happened in numerous instances.  I have stated that and again repeat the fact that these statements as to age were not made with the connivance and assistance of the agents.  They were not made in the innocence of their hearts by these people.</P>
      <P>We will bring the Minister up again against the real issue in this amendment. The Minister says that the policy-holders must be protected.  So must the general public.  The Minister suggested that my interest in moving this amendment was entirely in favour of the companies.  It is no such thing.  The amendment is partly in favour of the companies, but the principal and the real objection that I have to the Minister's proposal, as I stated in the last stage of this Bill, is one affecting the public interest.  The Minister thinks that the proposals contained in this Bill are for the benefit of the policy-holders; he thinks it is his duty to look after the policy-holders and to ignore the interests of the country.  Be it so; let it be taken as a fact that the Minister's duty is to look after the interests of the policy-holders.  Then I say that this proposal safeguards the interests of the policy-holders, and in addition safeguards the public interests against fraud.  The Minister's proposal in this Bill allows people who are guilty of fraud and of fraudulent practice to get the fruits of their fraud.  It looks after the interests of the fraudulent policy-holder as well as after the interests of the decent respectable person who fills up his proposal form in a proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is putting the cloak of legality around the fraudulent proposal, and I object to that.  I object to it in the public interest, and not merely in the interest of the company carrying on business here, whether that company be Irish, British or foreign. The Minister did not address his remarks to that point.  He apparently did not appreciate that.  He tried to ride off on the basis that I was advocating <Col N="2494" /> the interests of the companies. I make the Minister a present of the fact that I am advocating the interests of the companies as well, but I am doing so on this basis: that the proposals that I put forward not merely do justice to the company, but they safeguard the public interest and the interests of the policy-holders.</P>
    <P>Therefore, three interests are looked after by this proposal: (1) the interests of the public, by reason of the fact that a fraudulent person is not to be allowed to reap the fruits of his fraud; (2) the interest of the policy-holders, by reason of the fact that this proposal will allow the policy-holder to get what he is entitled to get and no more, and (3) the companies are not entitled to repudiate their policies.  They are bound to give such an amount as they would be bound to give if the correct age had been set out in the proposal. Is not that a principle of equity and justice?  It is doing justice to the policy-holders and doing justice to the company.</P>
    <P>That is the principle for which we are contending.  But the Minister thinks he is looking after the interests of the policy-holders.  He is ignoring the interests of justice and he is ignoring the interests of the companies. He is ignoring the interests of the dishonest policy-holders.  By the proposals that he is pushing through this House he is throwing the cloak of legality around the fraudulent proposer and around the people who will thereby be entitled to gain the fruits of their fraud.  We object to that on the general principles of equity.  If the Minister would address himself to the real point of this amendment we would find that he would be forced to agree with the proposals that we are putting forward, because the logic of facts would force him to come to the conclusion that we are right.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks here a few minutes ago the Minister addressed himself to every relevant issue, but he did not address one word to the real point in this amendment.  It is our experience here in this House that any proposals that are put forward from this side of the House&mdash; proposals put forward in a constructive <Col N="2495" /> spirit&mdash;have been turned down.  The proposals put forward by us have been turned down not on their merits; they have been turned down not on the facts; they have been turned down not because we did not make a case to justify them; they were turned down merely because they are our proposals.  That has been our experience.  We had a few moments ago, while the Minister was out, what was put forward as a drafting amendment. An amendment was calmly proposed by the Minister's colleague.  It was of no very great consequence, I agree, but it was justified here as if the Minister's advisers had found it out. We had pointed out the error in the drafting and in the proposals and the flaws in the Bill to the Minister on the last occasion.  He did not even acknowledge the fact that we had pointed them out, and gave a different reason from the real reason for introducing the amendment.</P>
    <P>We are standing over the proposal on principles of justice and equity and as a constructive proposition.  The principle of adjustment of age is the just principle; it is the principle that operates in England, and it is the principle that ought to operate here as against fraudulent proposals and in favour of policy-holders and in justice to the company.  I have not the slightest doubt that this amendment will not even be considered and has not been considered.  It is sufficient, as I said before, for any amendment to come from this side of the House to be turned down without any proper consideration being given to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave as one of the reasons for refusing to accept this amendment that 60 per cent. of industrial policies lapsed before 12 months had passed.  I am sorry he did not elaborate that point.  Did he mean that the insurance companies were to wait until after 12 months when the cost of verifying the age would be reduced to 40 per cent. of what it <Col N="2496" /> is at present?  If so, he is overlooking his own proposal of now giving insurance companies 12 months in which to look into it.  There is only one point I have not seen touched upon in this discussion.  I suppose it may be too expensive but, at the same time, it should not be overlooked.  Is it not possible, where the insured person would have a birth certificate, to give facilities for getting the age admitted and endorsed on the policy, or pointing out in the proposal form that if a birth certificate is produced the insurance company would have to register that on the policy?  I know the Minister will say that the amounts insured for in a great many cases are very small and that the cost would be prohibitive.  But he ought to look at the reverse side of the picture.  Deputy Costello said that he was considering the interests of the policy-holders.  I suggest that I am also considering the interests of the policy-holders, because if there are dishonest people who make proposals they will see that their policy is not allowed to lapse in the first 12 months.</P>
      <P>The next thing that occurs to me is that if the insurance companies find there is an unreasonably high cost in paying claims under certain heads they have this country and England to compare as regards results and there is an obvious remedy which none of us want to see employed, namely, to raise the rates.  That will fall on the honest and dishonest policy-holder alike.  I suggest that Deputy Costello's amendment is the proper way, namely, that the age given in the application can be adjusted afterwards.  I should also like to ask the Minister if there is any way of giving additional facilities for having the age of the assured admitted. I think he ought to look into that and, possibly, in being very sympathetic as to the position of the policy-holders he may find that he may be doing the honest policy-holder a real injustice.</P>

      <P>In connection with this amendment we might consider my amendment No. 77.  I have only one or two observations to make.  This amendment by the Minister is one that he stated a short time ago ought to satisfy me in my desire to provide resonable facilities for the companies to carry out the obligation of ascertaining and verifying the age stated in the proposal form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on the Committee Stage, I pointed out to the Minister that four months was quite an impossible period to prescribe in a statute.  Apparently he has agreed to give 12 months.  I suggest to him that the amendment that I have proposed would be the more reasonable proposal to be inserted.  The only objection that I can see to my amendment is that I am moving it myself. That, possibly, is a very cogent reason for the Minister not accepting it.  He has accepted portion of the amendment. My amendment reads &ldquo;twelve months or such further period as the Minister may allow&rdquo;.  The Minister's amendment is &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo;.  I <Col N="2499" /> want the Minister, in his own discretion, to allow a further period if a case is made out for it.  I suggest that in every case where a period has been fixed for doing a certain act under a statute amending legislation became inevitable to increase that period.  The Minister thought when he introduced this Bill and for a long time during the discussions on the Committee Stage, and he still continues to think, that four months is enough, but acting apparently on further consideration of the matter he has agreed by his amendment to increase that to 12 months.  I cannot for the life of me see why he will not take the further power that I want to give him.  I want to allow the Minister himself to extend the time on a proper case being put to him and in special circumstances.  The only reason I can see that the Minister can urge for not accepting my amendment is, as I have said already, that it is being moved from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly they would have the right to appeal to the Minister, but they would learn very quickly that, unless they were able to put up a very cogent case backed by circumstantial evidence of a very strong character, they would not be listened to in the Department, and, therefore, the Minister would not be flooded, as he apparently suggests he would be, with applications from companies to extend the time.  What I want to guard against is injustice.  I <Col N="2500" /> have already made a protest against the injustice of the principle contained in this Bill.  This is an effort on my part to allow the Minister to have power, in his own discretion, to remedy a possible injustice originated by the fraud of the proposer of the policy.</P>

The amendment was debated on the 9th of June, and the reference will be found in columns 208 and 210 in the Official Debates.  The object of the amendment was to prevent poaching by the agent of a company on the preserves of another company.

We cannot quite see why we should place this limitation on insured persons and prevent them from giving the documents to persons other than the agent of the company with which they have taken out a policy.  There seem to be fairly good reasons for applying a restriction in regard to time in the case of the retention of documents by the agent or the company, but we cannot quite understand if, of his own free will, an insured person for some purpose which may not be at all the purpose that the Deputy has in mind, gives documents to some other person, there should be a statutory obligation put on that other person to return them.  We are not satisfied that the door should be opened so widely as that to ensure that poaching of the kind to which the Deputy has referred should be stopped.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter in the proposed new section to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  Under the proposal as it stands, the knowledge of the agent of a company is imputed to the company itself, whether or not the company has any cognisance of the fraud or the misconduct referred to in the proposal.  I suggest that the Minister should consider putting in &ldquo;actual&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; in the fourth line of the first sub-section, so as to make it read: &ldquo;actual knowledge of the company&rdquo;.  Otherwise the knowledge of the agent would be imputed to the company, and I think that is neither intended nor desirable.  In the third sub-section, there are the words &ldquo;Whenever any such first-mentioned company fails to comply with the provisions <Col N="2506" /> of this section, such first-mentioned company shall be deemed to have failed to comply with the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  I suggest that before the word &ldquo;fails&rdquo; the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be inserted. Actual knowledge ought to be provided for in the case of a criminal offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2507" /> The Minister undertook to look into the difference between the words &ldquo;validity&rdquo; and &ldquo;legality&rdquo; and to consider whether the use of the word &ldquo;validity&rdquo; as in the Bill did not restrict the scope of the section in which the word occurs.  Apparently he satisfied himself that the words &ldquo;validity&rdquo; and &ldquo;legality&rdquo; have the same meaning.  It is a matter of complete indifference to me, and so perhaps the Minister might accept the amendment in that state of facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the word &ldquo;validity&rdquo; has a wider meaning than &ldquo;legality&rdquo;.  If a policy is illegal it is necessarily invalid, but a policy may be quite legal and yet invalid.</P>

I merely put down the amendment to draw his attention to the fact that his proposals may restrict the class of cases he wants to bring within the ambit of the section.

    <P>(7)  Where an appeal from a decision of the High Court under the next preceding sub-section of this section is taken to the Supreme Court by an industrial assurance company, such company shall, whatever may be the result of such appeal or the determination of the Supreme Court thereon, be liable for and pay the costs of all parties to such appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment enshrines a principle against which I wish to make an objection.  The Minister prohibited the taking of any appeals to the Supreme Court and was subsequently induced by some of the larger industrial assurance companies to permit an appeal to the Supreme Court in consideration of the industrial assurance company undertaking to pay the costs, no matter what way the verdict went.  I strongly object to this prostitution of the legal procedure of this country for the convenience of the Pearl, the Prudential, the Britannic or any other foreign insurance companies.  No foreign insurance company has a right to purchase, at the expense of depreciating the well-established rule of law in this country, access to our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts should be open to everybody on equal terms, and if the Minister, for reasons of public policy, desires to deliver the insured persons from any possibility of being levied with costs, the proper course for him to adopt is to see that in the event of an insured person losing a case in the Supreme Court in which an industrial assurance company is the appellant, the State will bear such measured costs as the Supreme Court may direct. It is entirely wrong to provide that in this execptional class of case a litigant in this country shall be permitted to enter the Supreme Court only on the undertaking to pay costs of both parties no matter what the results of the case may be.  It is a complete departure from the practice and it is done at the instance of foreign companies who do not give two hoots about the dignity or the principle underlying <Col N="2509" /> the administration of justice here.  I object most strenuously to the principle enshrined in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a safeguard for the companies that they can go to the Supreme Court?  Who is going to pay the costs?  In what way would the policy-holder be capable of meeting the expense of going to the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's first proposal was that the company should not be allowed to go to the Supreme Court at all.  Amendment No. 98 gives them access to it and there is then the condition that they pay the costs no matter what way the cause may go.  There is no precedent for such an arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>But what is the alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative is that the well-established rule of that court should be maintained; that, in the event of an appeal to the Supreme Court being taken for the purpose of settling a point of law, if that appellant be an industrial assurance company and the unsuccessful respondent be the insured party, and the Minister does not wish the insured party to be put to the expense of financing a test case in the Supreme Court, then the Minister should himself undertake to pay the measured costs of the court on the respondent's behalf, inasmuch as the appeal will have the effect of settling the law for the future in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the principle to which I object, Sir, because there should be no penalty for appealing to the highest tribunal in the land.  The big insurance companies do not give a straw about paying this penalty; they are enormously wealthy and they do not mind paying the cost, but it is a reflection on the judicial system of the country, which should not be permitted to creep in in order to convenience a wealthy insurance company.  It would not be done for a citizen of the State, and it should not be done for a citizen of the State. Money should not be able to buy access to the Supreme Court of this country which would not be available to a person who could not afford to pay <Col N="2510" /> for it.  This situation now means that if you have a poor Irish insurance company they may find themselves debarred from an appeal which is made available to a rich English company. I object to that.  It involves a principle of equality in the eyes of the law that is entirely foreign to our legal system.  It is a principle the introduction of which I strongly deplore, and which I apprehend may result in a course of action, founded on this as a precedent, which would be highly detrimental to the due administration of justice in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asks what is the alternative.  The alternative is to scrap this section altogether and allow the ordinary courts set up under our Constitution to operate in the ordinary way, instead of providing those bastard tribunals that would be held in a hole-and-corner way by non-lawyers and behind closed doors to determine the rights and liabilities as between industrial insurance companies and the policy-holders.  That is the proper alternative&mdash;scrap the section.</P>

      <P>In page 40 to delete Section 69 (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) No person (other than a director, a member of the committee of management, the secretary, an assistant secretary, treasurer, auditor, actuary, or a person employed in a professional capacity) employed by an industrial assurance company shall attend or be present at any meeting of such company.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent the committee of management of collecting societies from stopping a meeting.  It has been a common practice for those societies on the occasion of an annual meeting to fill the room with their clerical staff.  They are not lawfully, I understand, entitled to permit the attendance of their agents. Other members who are entitled to be present are excluded because of this crowding.  On some occasions the meeting is transacted solely or mainly in the presence of employees.  This amendment seeks only to make it impossible for the clerical staffs to do a thing which at the moment it is not possible for agents to do.  I think the Minister should not have any difficulty in accepting the amendment, because it aims at making more healthy the atmosphere in which the business of the society is transacted on the important occasion of those meetings.  It has been known in the past that this practice became a grave scandal.  I think that anything which would tend to make the operation of the companies more healthy ought to appeal to the Minister.  No hardship is being inflicted.</P>

      <P>Every policy, bond, certificate, or other instrument of insurance issued after the commencement of this Part of this Act to a person ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann shall, if such policy, bond, certificate or other instrument of insurance is issued in the course and as part of the carrying on in Saorstát Eireann of assurance business, be issued in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that the policies issued by licensed companies and syndicates should be Saorstát Eireann contracts. The amendment is designed to cover that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister amplify his statement as to the meaning of this amendment?  Is this purely a stamping provision or is it intended that every contract entered into with a company shall be deemed to have been entered into in the Irish Free State? I suggest to the Minister that there is a very serious ambiguity in this particular section as proposed in the amendment. There is no particular clarity about the meaning of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; of a policy, and very complicated questions as to the meaning of the word may arise if this section is passed.  As a matter of fact, I hope they will arise.  I do not know what the object of this proposal is.  Is it intended merely to ensure that the policies will be stamped here as if they <Col N="2516" /> were Irish policies, or does it go further than that, as the Minister has rather suggested, and endeavour to provide that every contract of assurance entered into with a company by a person resident in Saorstát Eireann shall be deemed to have been made as a contract in the Irish Free State?  I doubt very much if the section as drafted at the moment goes as far as the Minister suggests that it does, provided the contract is made.  Certainly, the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; is a word that is in common use in reference to dealings in connection with policies.  The phrase &ldquo;issue of a policy&rdquo; as a matter of common use.  I take it that the ordinary meaning of it would be the place from which the document originated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not clear. It is open to contention that it might mean the place where the document is delivered.  Now, in the course of certain statutory definitions of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo;&mdash;for instance, in reference to bills of exchange, copies of works under the Copyright Act and things of that kind&mdash;the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; has a special meaning.  In connection, however, with insurance policies, it is in common use, but there is no statutory or recognised meaning of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo;, and this section will undoubtedly give rise to litigation. Supposing the contract is posted or delivered to an agent, and delivered by him to the policy-holder; in either or both of those cases, is the policy issued?  We could enumerate numerous other particular combinations of facts arising out of the issue of a policy which would give rise to problems which must be, or may have to be, solved by the courts.  Now, if it be only a stamping provision, then all that can be got over merely by stamping the policy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that most of the policies of assurance at the present moment are, in fact, stamped in this country, but if the only object of this section is to ensure that the Revenue will get the necessary stamp duties on policies, I think the section is going a bit too far for that purpose.  If, on the other hand, the object is to ensure <Col N="2517" /> that contracts of assurance shall be deemed to be made in this country, then I think the section does not go far enough.  I should like the Minister to consider whether or not this section does what he intends it to do, and I should certainly like to know what the Minister intends it to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend that it should be deemed to be issued in Saorstát Eireann if it is not, in fact, issued in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister does not intend it to do, but what we want to know is what the Minister intends it to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to have them issued in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>For what purpose?  Is it merely because it would look nice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But the question of issue, surely, has some practical significance for the Minister?  I take it that this section is not merely put in for sentimental reasons in order that there will be green ribbons tied around the policy in the Free State, or green, white and yellow ribbons, if the Minister prefers it.  Has the Minister not got some practical reason for this?  If he has, will he tell us what it is?  If he has not, then let the courts construe it.  I do not know what is intended to be brought about by this section unless it is merely a stamp duty provision. If that is so, it is a matter of some little significance to the Revenue, I admit, but not of very much significance. However, if that is all that is intended, I wish the Minister would say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not believe so, and I am quite sure he does not believe so, but if there were only a question of stamp duty involved, then this amendment, in my view, would be drafted differently, because it would have to be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners and they <Col N="2518" /> would draft it in their own peculiar fashion so as to ensure that revenue was attracted to this country <i>via</i> policies.  Now, knowing the methods of the Revenue Commissioners as I do, I know that this section does not bear the stamp of the Revenue Commissioners' hand upon it, and I am not convinced&mdash;at least I am not convinced at the moment, and I did not think so when I read the amendment&mdash;that its object is merely to provide that stamp duty shall be paid on policies; and the Minister has not satisfied me yet that that is the real object of the section.  If the Minister will not tell me what the real object of the section is, of course I cannot extract it from him, but I think we ought to know at least what this amendment is designed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is designed to get companies to issue contracts here and get them stamped here as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;to have them stamped here as far as possible,&rdquo; as the Minister says.  I have already directed the attention of the Minister to the ambiguity of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo;, and now he says that the object is to have them stamped here &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo;.  Well, all I can say is that that is about as ambiguous a phrase as he could manufacture.  We are dealing here with proposals to be inserted in a Bill which will become statutory law and we must see, so far as possible, that these proposals are drafted in such terms as the people who will be affected by this statute will understand. Now, at the moment it is not possible to understand what this amendment is designed to effect.  The Minister has not said what he understands by the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo;.  I should like to hear him tell me what he or his officials think the phrase &ldquo;issue of a policy&rdquo; means, and, if their attention has been directed to the difficulties that will arise, or may arise, through the use of the ambiguous term &ldquo;issue of a policy&rdquo;, I should like to know what is the meaning of &ldquo;issue of a policy&rdquo;, or in what circumstances it will be issued.  If the Minister cannot tell me the circumstances that <Col N="2519" /> might possibly be conceived by him or his officials, I shall supply them for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>In page 48, before Section 97, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister, if and whenever he thinks proper so to do, may by order (in this section referred to as a re-insurance (prohibition) order) prohibit the re-insurance of any class of assurance business effected in Saorstát Eireann (other than life assurance business and industrial assurance business) with any assurance company or person other than an assurance company or syndicate which carries on in Saorstát Eireann assurance business of that class.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every re-insurance (prohibition) order shall come into operation on such day (not earlier than six months after the making of such order) as the Minister shall by such order appoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Whenever a re-insurance (prohibition) <Col N="2526" /> order is in operation in respect of any class of assurance business, an assurance company or syndicate shall not, subject to the provisions of this section, re-insure any of such class of assurance business which has been effected in Saorstát Eireann with any assurance company or person other than an assurance company or syndicate which carries on in Saorstát Eireann assurance business of that class.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every assurance company or syndicate which re-insures any class of assurance business which has been effected by such company or syndicate in Saorstát Eireann in contravention of the next preceding sub-section of this section shall, subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section of this section, be deemed to have failed to comply with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever, during the operation in respect of any class of assurance business of a re-insurance (prohibition) order, the Minister is satisfied that an assurance company or syndicate which carries on in Saorstát Eireann assurance business of that class, has entered into arrangements with one or more Saorstát Eireann companies which carry on in Saorstát Eireann assurance business of such class in relation to re-insurance business of such class, the Minister may grant to such assurance company or syndicate an exemption in writing exempting such assurance company or syndicate from the provisions of this section in relation to the re-insurance of its assurance business which has been effected in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister may, whenever he so thinks proper, by order, amend or revoke a re-insurance (prohibition) order.</P>
    <P>This is in fulfilment of a promise by the Minister that if proposals were put forward and operated which would achieve the purpose aimed at in Part VI of the Bill without the necessity of bringing that Part into operation, he would be prepared to consider leaving Part VI inoperative. Although a scheme has not been put <Col N="2527" /> up, if it is put up, this will give the Minister the necessary power to deal with the situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Less onerous.  The period under the age of seven is ignored and a free policy given after three years, that is, at the age of ten. This follows the Cohen Committee's recommendation.  The gist of it is that we are ignoring the period before that age of seven.  It is not until after the age of seven that the policy begins to accumulate in value.  The old procedure was that a free policy was only given five years afterwards, that is at the age of 17.  Under this Bill the period under the age of seven is ignored and a free policy given after three years, at ten.  The increase of the maximum sum from £10 to £15 increases the value of the policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

If it is true that you are increasing the burden by this amendment, I warn you, you are trying to travel too fast.  You are trying to bring small Irish companies up to the standard of solvency or extravagance which a number of similar insurance companies have attained, a standard which has, in fact, only been attained by companies of the magnitude of the Pearl, the Prudential and the Britannic.
