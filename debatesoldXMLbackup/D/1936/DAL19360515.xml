    <P>(1)  When there is due in respect of rent arising out of the occupation of <Col N="520" /> a cottage a sum exceeding the amount of the weekly rent of such cottage multiplied by thirty and the Board of Health considers it expedient to include in a purchase scheme any cottage which if no rent were due by the tenant of such cottage would be so included it shall be lawful for the Board of Health at their discretion to do either of the things following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): Before the amendment is withdrawn, there are some considerations I should like to put to the Minister with reference to what he described as qualms of conscience regarding the morals of the question.  Certain references were made to my county in regard to arrears of cottage rents, and it is only right that the position should be put as to how these arrears accrued.  It may be accepted, or it may be denied, that for <Col N="521" /> some years past, in fact a good few years past, there was an idea abroad that any money likely to find its way into the coffers of the British Government should not be paid.  Acting upon that a certain number of people did not pay their cottage rents.  I know that that was the attitude adopted by a great many people in my county, and I know it was the attitude adopted by other people besides cottage tenants.  I know that other arrears of rent accrued and that there were no great qualms on the part of those who forgave three years' rent to other people and funded the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no reason why there should be differentiation between the cottage tenants and those other people. There should be no such difference. Collateral with the list that the Minister gave us of those people who have not paid rents for their cottages in various counties, I think the Minister ought to have given us an estimate of what it would cost to put those cottages into repair.  There is a difference between the boards of health and the cottiers in arrears, because the boards of health refuse to put the cottages into a proper state of repair, and the tenants refuse to pay their rents in consequence.  I think they are justified.  There is a kind of see-saw going on as to who is responsible in this matter.  The Minister must be aware of that when he issued a letter in my county pointing out that the repairs were not at all what they should be.  For instance, one tenant had to bring the board of health into court, and I think 15 guineas was the amount of damages awarded in that particular case.  The Minister says he has qualms of conscience about giving these tenants special consideration. But before cutting them out entirely, and before concluding that they are not entitled to consideration, he should consider fully where the responsibility lies for all that propaganda, and also whether responsibility does not lie on the boards of health for allowing these cottages to get into such a state of disrepair.  The surveyor in my county pointed out to the board of health the amount it would cost to put these cottages into a proper state of repair, and the result was that he simply amazed <Col N="522" /> the board of health.  On these grounds I put it to the Minister that he should reconsider his attitude on this matter. The Minister ought not to consider that it is the cottiers who are responsible for the present condition of things, but rather, in many instances, that it is the board of health themselves that are responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the last speaker that a precedent was set in the case of the farmers getting arrears over three years remitted.  I voted against the farmers getting any remission.  I am opposed to anybody who has contracted an obligation to purchase, for ownership or otherwise, having a right to break away from his contract.  It is creating a precedent that as time goes on will know no end. I think it was one of the greatest blunders of the present Government to have remitted annuities under the Land Act of 1933.  There might be something to be said for funding, but more could be said for total remission in the conditions then and still obtaining.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan talked about arrears in Clare, and argued that there should be remission.  If there is such remission, is that remission to come out of Clare funds or national funds?  If it is to come out of national funds, then every other county with no such high percentage of arrears as exist in Clare is going to resent it, because the taxation to make up the amount due by people in Clare who have not paid their rents will not be voted by the people of Clare and will have to be paid by Dublin and other countries who have already paid their rents and rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the remission to the farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed that remission, and the Deputy supported it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am not much concerned about consistency in that matter.  The Deputy voted to have the remission given to the farmers.  I think a better case could be made for the labourers than for the farmers. As the matter now stands, other counties who have paid their way will <Col N="523" /> object, and rightly object, to whatever remission or easement in the matter is given to counties that have not paid. With regard to putting the cottages into proper repair, I think there is an obligation in this Bill that before they are taken over by the tenants, under a scheme of purchase, the local bodies have to put them into a proper state of repair.  I suppose the local bodies will see that a proper standard of repair will be fixed and that it will be an obligation on the part of the boards of health to hand over these cottages in good condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan referred to part of these arrears having occurred when there was actual reluctance on the part of the people to pay money to the British Government.  Do I understand from Deputy Hogan that part of the arrears at present outstanding on cottages in Clare arose in the time of the struggle between the Sinn Fein Government and the British Government?  If that is so, it reflects very gravely on the local authorities in Clare.  Surely a position of that kind should have been cleared up between the tenants and the landlord in the interval.  I think what Deputy Belton said about writing off arrears requires qualification.  There was no greater evil in the old landlord and tenant days than the &ldquo;hanging gale.&rdquo; I think there should be a fixed period beyond which owners of property need not tolerate the continuance of arrears. I suggest that if a person gets into arrear for a protracted period, either the tenancy should be terminated or the landlord should make up his mind that after a certain time he would not be able to recover more than a fixed sum.  I think the ordinary practice is that no one should recover more than six years' arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State and the local authorities must make up their mind that they have got to reach finality with their tenants some time.  I think that that ought to be done now.  Otherwise, this business of arrears will persecute and complicate the local administration indefinitely.  The Minister ought to notify the local authorities that he will not permit them to collect an <Col N="524" /> arrear in excess of six years and, in order to give this scheme a good start, he should recommend the funding of six years arrears and then a definite fixing of a rent within the capacity of the tenant to pay, with a proviso that where tenants of municipal houses meet with unavoidable reverses, such as unemployment, they will be exonerated from the payment of rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy ever been a member of a board of health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member at present.  Let us explain what happens. We set a cottage to a man with a wife and seven children.  That man is earning a modest income and pays his rent regularly.  He falls ill, or becomes unemployed, which may be even worse.  He has no income and he cannot get work.  The relieving officer comes to us and tells us that this man is in need of outdoor assistance.  We examine into the circumstances of his family and we satisfy ourselves that the case is a genuine one and that the family require outdoor assistance. Ten minutes later, the rent collector comes before us and asks for authority to evict that man because he cannot pay his rent.  We have just decided that that man, with his wife and family, are threatened with starvation, through no fault of their own.  Our invariable reply to the rent collector in a case where a man is genuinely suffering from an affliction for which he is not himself responsible is that we are not going to put him out on the road and that we will allow arrears of rent to accrue.  That is merely pulling the wool over our eyes because it is highly unlikely that a man with family commitments of that kind will ever be able to catch up with the rent arrears.  We ought to have power&mdash; this I admit would require a carefully devised scheme in order to avoid abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble. Put up a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a scheme operating in part of Cork County at present.  Particulars of that scheme are to be circulated.  We say that we will not allow arrears to accrue but we <Col N="525" /> do because we know we cannot collect the rent.  In that way, we get ourselves into a ridiculous position.  We have a pile of arrears which nobody is able to collect and which nobody wants to collect because there is no moral justification for collecting them. We have no proper authority for pursuing the course we all recognise that circumstances sometimes compel us to pursue.  I should sooner face that and make provision for giving people a right to continue their tenancy without paying rent in circumstances of adversity.  We should require, however, in those circumstances, a much more stringent attitude on the part of local authorities in regard to persons who are able to pay their rent and simply will not.  For that, you would want the support of public opinion. I should not hesitate to ask for the support of public opinion in evicting ruthlessly undeserving persons who culpably withheld from the local authority rent they were well able to pay if, at the same time, we had power to leave in possession a person who was unable to pay his rent through no fault of his own.  On these grounds, I think that the Minister ought to consider, in connection with this Bill, the fixing of a six years term and the wiping out of all arrears behind that.  I shall not go into the question as to whether it was the leaders of from 1918 to 1921 who advocated the withholding of rents or whether it arose out of Mr. Ruttledge's circular warning all and sundry to pay nothing to the Government in office at the time.  It would lead us into highly undesirable lines of investigation if we were obliged to go back and sort out all those matters.  Accepting the six-year term which, for good or ill, is the law governing an ordinary contract-debt, funding arrears up to that period and wiping out all arrears behind that, let the Department invite the local authorities to adopt a scheme whereunder deserving persons unable to pay their rent will be entitled, within the terms of the regulations, to receive consideration.  That done, let the Department require the local authorities to exercise a very much sterner supervision over the payment of cottage rents by those in a position <Col N="526" /> to pay and then let us start de novo. If you do that, this Bill will have made a far more valuable contribution to this housing problem than it can hope to do in its present form.  It is quite impossible to get local authorities to do this without the assistance of the Department.  Deputy Belton put the difficulty in a few words when he said &ldquo;Put up a scheme.&rdquo;  I think that all local authorities would agree with me in principle but when they come to work the matter out they find themselves at a loss.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I might hold them up to odium if they did not do their duty when they had the power to do their duty properly.  I do not think they have that power now, for lack of a scheme, and I do not think that a single local authority has the machinery or the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not the time to work out a scheme of this character. The Department is the only authority competent to foresee the kind of difficulty that would arise in the administration of such a scheme.  The Minister has his reports coming in from all parts of the country and from all kinds of local authorities operating in different areas.  I ask him to evolve a scheme along the lines I mentioned on his Estimate and to which I now refer. I ask him to recommend the local authorities to write off any arrears of more than six years, to fund the six years' arrears, and then to require local authorities to take up a much sterner attitude in regard to the collection of rents and to regard it as part of their essential duty to carry out their cottage-rent collection accurately and properly.  If they do not do that, he should consider what steps are requisite to compel them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look at what is sticking out under our noses with regard to arrears of cottage rents, we shall see that there is very little use <Col N="527" /> in making plans of a superficial character with regard to arrears.  The arrears of cottage rents on the 31st March, 1932, amounted to £34,500, of which £10,300 was due in the County of Kerry.  After two years, they had gone up by £22,000.  The Minister told the House in June that on the 31st March, 1935, £2,000 had come off that sum.  We have had no information as to how cottage rents have been paid in the meantime.  But we have had some information regarding South Tipperary which has a bearing on the question as to whether local authorities are doing their duty in connection with cottage rents.  In South Tipperary, the administration has been in the hands of a Commissioner, sent down by the Minister for Local Government to replace the local body.  His rent collector reported that he could not collect some of the cottage rents because some of the tenants are in receipt of home assistance, others are in receipt of unemployment assistance, while some are receiving a sum of 8/- per week as agricultural labourers. There is little use in talking about matters that are past if that is to be the position in regard to cottage rents in the future.  There is a question as to how much is to be wiped out for the current year.  Is that the problem for the local authorities and, if it is, what prospect is there of seeing even the current year's cottage rents paid, apart altogether from reducing the amount of arrears?  The Minister could give us some information at this stage as to how cottage rents have been paid up to the 31st March, 1936.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any information as to how cottage rents stood on the 31st March, 1936, I do not know that we are going to make very much progress by blaming anyone, or making any suggestions as to what should be done with the arrears of five, six or seven years ago, or even with the arrears of three years ago.  Whatever the arrears were in the first year of Fianna Fáil administration, they had gone up in two years by £22,000.  In 1932 they were £34,000, and of that amount Kerry was responsible for £10,300.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's remarks were all right generally, but when you come down to administration, anyone with experience of the work of the boards of health knows that what the Deputy said is all wrong.  There are many powers that boards of health and county councils have not got that I should like them to have, but the powers they have in this matter should be confined within certain definite limits, and be under the strict supervision of the Department of Local Government, regardless of the political tinge of the boards of health or of the Government of the day.  Members of boards of health are on the spot and are mixing with local people.  But they are birds of passage, having to make their own living, and they administer the business of these boards in their own time.  Even with the best intentions in the world&mdash;and without saying anything on that question we know very well that they are not animated with the best intentions&mdash; why should they make enemies of their neighbours, seeing that they are only birds of passage on these boards for a few years?  There would be substance in Deputy Dillon's argument if there was a paid manager connected with every board of health, an official appointed by statute to do his job, and caring for no one.  As to the case that Deputy Dillon depicted, that of a man out of employment, who he said should not be asked to pay rent during that time, I say the assistance that man gets should be given on the basis that he is out of employment, but that he had to pay the rent.  Give the right to no one to say that a man must not pay rent.  If necessary, increase the assistance, but make him pay the rent.  If a man earns £5 a week, and another man has nothing, it is easy to decide what is to be done.  We have to remember the pull that would be exercised in these cases. The position of the members would be intolerable.  I hope members of boards of health will never have such powers as have been suggested.  I believe in administering each service on the conditions obtaining, and administering it thoroughly.  Boards of health are also boards of assistance in some counties, but not in County Dublin, and it <Col N="529" /> would be ridiculous for a board of assistance to hand out money and for another board to take some of that money back as rent.  I would rather do that, however, than be called upon to decide whether tenants should be relieved from paying rent.  I believe in giving assistance when it is required, but in allocating that assistance I would have in mind that a tenant of a cottage would have to pay 1/-, 2/- or 3/- back as rent.  I see no other way for efficient administration, even of a well-formulated scheme.  I believe the principle I men tioned must be embodied in any such scheme.  I hope the Minister or his successors will never think of giving such discretionary powers to local authorities, the members of which are only birds of passage.</P>

      <P>This question of arrears is one of very great interest, and if Deputy Belton is correct in his view, that it would be practically impossible for local authorities to exercise discretion of the type I suggested, it is certainly time that the Minister considered seriously the introduction of a managerial system into local bodies.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the view that local authorities are quite unable to do substantial justice between their tenants on their merits. I want to put this view very strongly to the House, because I can see the attractiveness of the method adopted by Deputy Belton for keeping the rent-roll in order, that is, by giving extra relief and taking it back again by way of the rent.  Propagandists against social order are always trying to make the case that the poor are downtrodden and oppressed.  Deputy Belton or I, on our respective boards of health, have to consider, say, the case of a man with a large family, and perhaps a delicate wife, who is receiving home assistance, and Deputy Belton and I decide what is the limit of outdoor assistance he should get or what the board can afford to give. Mind you, it is likely to be a most unsatisfactory sum when you consider that himself, his wife and his family have to live on it.  Having decided on that, Deputy Belton's scheme is that we ought to add 2/- or 2/6, whatever the rent may be, to that sum and let the collector take back the 2/6 or 2/-, leaving the man with the amount of assistance that we meant him to have.  Let us suppose that the amount of assistance we determine that he should have would be 6/-, and the Deputy will realise that in many respects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not going to intervene in this discussion if amounts are to be mentioned, because I am not going to have it thrown in my face that I said that 6/- per week was sufficient for a man, his wife and his family.  Let the Deputy deal with it in an algebraic way.  Let him call the amount X, but do not put a figure upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from experience.  I can quite see that the Deputy may have had a different <Col N="532" /> experience in County Dublin, because different conditions operate here, but as a matter of fact any sum between 6/- and 10/- per week, under many rural boards of health, would be considered a very substantial sum for outdoor assistance.  If, however, the Deputy feels any delicacy on the matter, we can call the amount X and add 2/- for the rent.  X plus 2 would still be regarded as an unsatisfactory sum to maintain a man, his wife and family, and the propagandist can come along and say: &ldquo;Here is Deputy Belton, the Chairman of the Dublin Board of Assistance, extracting from a man with a wife and seven children, out of the miserable pittance of X plus 2 that he is receiving by way of outdoor assistance, the last penny of the rent due on his cottage.  Was there ever a Shylock or a tyrant more oppressive who, enjoying a fine income himself, expects an unfortunate family with its miserable income to pay rents as they fall due?&rdquo; Or he may say: &ldquo;Here is Deputy Dillon, with his fine income, wallowing in comfort.  Look at him, threatening with eviction the unfortunate man with seven or eight children who is getting only X plus 2 per week.&rdquo;  Does the Deputy think, from the social point of view or from any other point of view, that that is a desirable state of affairs?  Does he not think that such propaganda, dishonest as it may be, may carry conviction to the people at large?  Does he not think that we shall appear before the more gullible section of the community, at any rate, as tyrants from whom these people should be protected?  Should we not consider that a man so circumstanced is as much entitled to shelter as he is to water, food or fresh air, and that we believe that it is better to give the family shelter under the family roof rather than do as the Victorians did, bring them into the workhouse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Belton, an expert administrator, and I have some experience of this matter.  I sympathise with his apprehensions.  But if we are not able to overcome that difficulty, then I have no hesitation in saying that it is the Minister's duty to step in and take the function from us, either by supervision or by direct intervention and make it a reserved service for some kind of independent official.  Suppose that a board of health has accepted as a tenant a person who does not conform to the requirements of the Ministry.  We may accept that tenant, but the Minister can intervene and ask us to accept some other applicant for the cottage who corresponds to departmental requirements.  If a somewhat similar provision is not sufficient in this case, then the time is coming to withdraw the question of cottage tenancies from the purview of a local authority and put it in the hands of some kind of semi-independent official.</P>

    <P>Deputy Finlay, in his usual pleasant style of communication to this House, said that he gathered from the readiness of tenants of cottages in Laoighis to pay their rents that they must be all supporters of the Government, a most interesting conclusion for more reasons than one, because I take it that Deputy Finlay will agree that if that thesis is true, the opposite is also true, namely, that in counties in which <Col N="534" /> the rents are not paid there must be a conspiracy to overthrow the national Government and the national leader.</P>

      <P>If that be true President de Valera is in for a very troublous period because the arrears in County Clare have gone up from £4,000 to £12,000 in the last three years.  Between 1932 and 1935 in County Kerry the arrears have gone up from £7,000 to £35,000.  Has there been a landslide or is it possible that our friend is mistaken and that the fact is that the supporters of the Government are sometimes found a little remiss in the matter of paying rents, because if he goes down through the counties where the Government has an unquestionable majority, such as Clare and Kerry, he will discover to his amazement that these are the counties, and the only counties, which present a really serious problem in the matter of cottage rent arrears.  They are the only counties in which the local authorities seem to be able to make no impression on the growing tide of arrears for some time back.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should say in justice to County Clare that the figure I mentioned of £12,000 relates to another matter.  Figures of this character are difficult to follow with strict accuracy.  I wish now to correct myself, and to say that the arrears in Clare have gone up from £2,800 to £4,100, which, I admit, presents a different picture from the one that I have given.  However, in Kerry the arrears have gone up from £10,000 to £14,000.  It now seems that the figures I was quoting earlier relate to another schedule, but at the same time they indicate the trend in these two counties, and dispose of the statement made by Deputy Finlay that it is only the supporters of the Government who pay their rents, and that the supporters of Fine Gael do not.  My figures were taken from a schedule which, unfortunately, did not apply to the matter <Col N="535" /> to which I was at the moment referring. I agree that they presented a somewhat exaggerated picture, but I can assure the House that the tendency for the arrears to rise was somewhat similar to that indicated by the somewhat exaggerated figures which came under my notice at that juncture and which, I admit, did not actually represent the condition to which I was referring.</P>

In any event, I am not going to enter into a political debate on this matter because it is one that has no relation whatever to politics. The question is whether these people are entitled to get a remission of certain arrears and a funding of certain other arrears.  We can base our arguments on what has happened before.  I have stated on previous occasions&mdash;the statement has also been made by other Deputies&mdash;that there is no difference whatever between the remission of three years' annuities to the farmers and the remission of a certain amount of arrears to the tenants of labourers' cottages.  As to how the arrears accrued, there is no difference either between these two sets of people, except perhaps that the hardship is greater in the case of the cottage tenants than in that of the tenant farmers.  If there is any margin as to the side on which the greater claim for justice lies, it surely is on the side of the cottage tenants.  It was said some time or other in this House that I advocated the non-payment of cottage rents.  I never did anything of the kind, nor did I ever hear anybody <Col N="536" /> advocate the non-payment of cottage rents.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, when matters of this kind were put before me, I have always advised the tenants that as far as it was within their power at all they should pay their rents.  I have incurred some displeasure because I advocated action of that kind.  Therefore, it cannot be said that we came in here to advocate the non-payment of cottage rents.  We have come in to ask for a remission of the arrears due.  We realise that these arrears accrued because of a certain position which arose in the country when it was decided to keep from the British Government certain revenues which were going to it, and also because people went into the occupation of cottages and incurred liabilities that they were not able to meet subsequently.  In some cases you had sums varying from £5 to £9 due as rent on cottages when the tenancy of them was made available by the board of health.  We all know that a man with a wife and family is prepared to take any risk in order to get a roof over his head.  There were many who incurred a liability of £5 and £6 in order to get into a cottage, and then found that they could not discharge it, the most they were able to do being to pay the current rent.</P>

      <P>Was it the intention of the farmers to pay the rents of their holdings in respect of the three years during which arrears accrued and were then remitted?  Is a poor man who goes into a cottage to be suspect because he did not pay the rent which had accrued in respect of a former tenant?  There is no use in suggesting that this should be made a local matter.  Other remissions that have been given have not been made local matters.  They were made national matters.  You cannot put these liabilities into water-tight compartments. The arrears of cottage rents bear a very close relationship to the question of the repair of cottages.  I know myself that, in my own county, there are cottages in respect of which arrears have accrued, and they have been in a scandalous state of repair for years. There has been a see-saw argument going on between the board of health and the tenants as to who is going to put the cottages into repair, the tenants arguing that they are not going to pay the rent until the cottages are put into repair.  Whatever the reason be, the board of health is not putting the cottages in repair.</P>

      <P>The board of health have failed in two respects, first, in failing to provide cottages for the tenants who require them, and, secondly, in keeping the old cottages in repair.  In neither case is the board showing any sense of the responsibility that lies on it.  On this question of the remission of arrears, it has been said that the people who have paid their rents would not be getting fair treatment as compared to those who had not paid them. It was said that if a remission was given to those who had not paid, that would not be dealing fairly with the others who had paid.  A precisely similar situation arose in the case of the tenant farmers.  There was no remission for those who had paid their annuities, but there was for those who had not paid.  I suggest, therefore, that <Col N="538" /> you cannot have one thing for one set of people and something else for another set, the circumstances in both cases being the same.</P>
      <P>There has been no case whatever made against this, and the Minister need have no qualms of conscience as regards the morals of it.  If the morals of it were good on the previous occasion, they are good on this occasion, and, therefore, he ought to give this section of the community the same consideration as both the previous Government and this Government have given to another section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I have great sympathy with the case made by Deputy Hogan, but there is a difference between a remission or funding in the case of labourers' cottages and in the case of farmers.  In the case of farmers, the national authority has been responsible for carrying the purchase through, for the collection of the annuities and for meeting the charges consequent on the purchase.  Therefore a remission of funding in their case would not be dealt with on anything but a national basis.  In the case of the Labourers Acts, the county health area authority, whatever it may have been&mdash;the rural district council or the county board of health&mdash;was the authority responsible for borrowing the money and paying back the charges on the loan within their area and within no other area.  Therefore, if this matter is to be considered by the Minister on the basis of remission to a certain extent or of funding to another extent, I suggest to him that he should consider it on the basis of each county health area carrying their own babies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that this amendment is an extension of the principle embodied in the Minister's amendment.  From my experience of those matters I think that all boards of health are anxious, in the case of a family which has been in the house for years, that a representative of that family should get the tenancy when the house becomes vacant.  As I read this, even according to the Minister's amendment, we would be precluded from considering an application <Col N="540" /> from the son or daughter of the deceased if he or she were not living in the cottage at the time the tenant died.  That is specifically in the Minister's amendment, paragraph (ii)  of which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>On the death of the purchaser, for the purpose of the accommodation of a person, who is the widow, child or other relative of the purchaser and was resident in such cottage at such death, of such person and members of such person's family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 13 embodies all that the Minister has said, except that it does not require that this relative should be resident in the cottage at the time the old tenant died.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment of mine; it is merely an extension of his amendment.  I am thinking of one specific case where the brother of the deceased tenant was living in the cottage.  That brother was not married, and was not, generally speaking, the sort of man who would get married and settle down and keep a home.  Because of that, the deceased brother kept him in the house.  There was another brother, with a wife and four or five children, living in a hovel nearby He was an industrious, hardworking man, and wanted a house. Obviously, that man was definitely more entitled to the house than the other brother.  Under the Bill, with the Minister's amendment, we could not select the good man and we were bound to put in the other man.  I have that specific case in mind.  If the Minister wishes, I will tell him about it privately.  I think he even knows the family.  However, it is not a question of a family; it is a question of the principle which is at stake.  I would ask the Minister if he is now prepared, on the evidence I am putting up to him, to consider and accept this amendment.  I think any members of the boards of health who are members of this House will support the view I am putting forward.  In practice, you will always come up against trouble in regard to the members of a family who are looking for a cottage, and I think the board of health should be at liberty to select <Col N="541" /> the member whom they consider to be the most deserving, and would make the best tenant.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he does not see his way to accept the amendment now he should not turn it down but should consider it at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the class of person who may buy a house in the event of the actual tenant dying.  I want to ask the Minister this question.  Is it his intention, when examining the purchase scheme submitted to him for approval, to require that there shall be some restraint on alienation of the house after purchase is completed by the agricultural labourer?  I have no objection whatever to anyone buying a house from the municipal authority if he pays the municipal authority the full value of the house, but I see no reason why we should subsidise housing out of the rates&mdash;rates which are being collected from small farmers, whose weekly income is very often not in excess of £1 or 21/-, and make cottages available to a very considerable number of persons who under the modern interpretation of the Labourers Act are agricultural labourers, but who in fact are industrial workers working in rural districts, and who may themselves be earning £3 or £4 per week. Suppose you have a genuine agricultural labourer living in one of those cottages referred to in amendment No. 12, and a purchase scheme is devised whereunder he will be allowed to purchase the cottage.  In the course of time that purchase price is founded on an uneconomic rent.  It is founded on the assumption that a purchaser will not pay the full market value of the cottage to the local authority, but will pay a fictitious value, founded on the amount of rent he had been paying <Col N="542" /> heretofore, and in many cases, these rents are uneconomic inasmuch as they will not recoup the local authorities for their original outlay.</P>
      <P>While I would be prepared to stand for that if the scheme were designed to convey the cottage to the agricultural worker working on the land, and to restrain him and his family from alienating to somebody with a considerable income who would want to buy it from him, after he had completed the purchase, I strenuously object to a scheme of that kind if it is going to become possible under this amendment for the son of an agricultural labourer, who is perhaps a national school teacher, or an industrial worker earning a comparatively large weekly wage, may come into this agreement, carry it through, and wind up as the owner of the labourer's cottage for an uneconomic price. Therefore, I ask the Minister to provide that if a person, other than an agricultural labourer working on the land, becomes eligible to purchase a cottage under amendment No. 12, the terms of the purchase agreement shall be revised with a view to securing that the annuity payable by the new entrant into the contract will recoup the local authority for the total cost of the cottage, and that it will cease to have the benevolent character it had when the agricultural labourer working on the land was one of the parties to it.  It is not a very easy problem to explain.  I went into it at greater length on the Minister's Estimate, and I do not want to delay the House unduly now, but I think the Minister understands what I have in mind.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister on the reasons which influenced him to introduce what I think is quite a revolutionary principle&mdash; absolutely prohibiting the charging of a mortgage on a property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Ceallaigh Mr. O'Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties in the case of cottage tenants are peculiar. We know what might happen. The temptations will be very great to get into debt, if they could have charges readily available made upon that property.  Goodness knows who would advance the money, but, under the Act, if a person did advance money, he could not afterwards become the owner in law.  He could become the owner to a certain extent, but he could not become the occupier or tenant.  That person might claim the right to decide who should be the tenant, but the Act lays it down <Col N="546" /> specifically that the tenants are to be resticted to certain classes of people, and goodness knows what litigation might arise as between the board of health, the owner in whom the board of health vested the cottage, and the person who took the mortgage on the property.  It is to prevent anything of that kind arising that might lead to very great difficulties both for the board of health, and the cottage tenant, as well as the person who gave the mortgage, that we thought it safer for all parties concerned to take this power to prevent the cottier tenant giving way to temptation that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, Sir, the Minister is labouring under a misapprehension in this matter.  The remedy of foreclosure is practically unknown in this country.  I do not think a mortgage has been foreclosed in this country for the last 50 years.  Nobody ever expects to gain anything by going into court on the question of a mortgage.  I foresee that what may arise is that occupants of these cottages&mdash;and it cannot be too often emphasised that the occupants of these cottages very frequently are comparatively prosperous people&mdash; may contract debts which they subsequently do not want to pay.  Now, may I direct the attention of the House to Section 22 at the same time, because it has a peculiar application to Section 21? Let us say that the creditor takes action against the tenant for the recovery of a debt, and that he succeeds in court, whereupon the cottage tenant bids the creditor defiance and says: &ldquo;You may send the sheriff, for all I care.&rdquo;  The creditor is a person living in the community; he is a neighbour, and he does not want to be sending in the sheriff to collect the few sticks of furniture from the tenant; and in any case he knows that if he does so, the sheriff's fees will consume substantially more than the entire furnishing of the labourer's cottage would realise.  He has his judgment, of course, but this Section 21 takes away the only remedy that is of any use to him at all.  If Section 21 is not passed, he can move in the courts to get a judgment mortgage and have registered whatever property the tenant <Col N="547" /> purchaser has in the cottage.  If the tenant purchaser then refuses to make any proposal to pay the debt, by instalments or in any other way, at the end of whatever period the judgment mortgage runs, the mortgagee can move to have it well charged and get the tenant's right in the cottage sold on the open market and thus recover his debt.  I know that a specious argument may be made that that remedy should not be left to potential creditors of cottage occupants, but we all know that in practice it is a highly undesirable thing to make it impossible for a tenant purchaser to get credit for anything by fixing all potential creditors with notice that there is no means of recovering a debt due by the occupant.</P>
      <P>Section 22 says that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...where any instalment of the annuity is not paid on the date on which the same is payable under the statutory conditions, such instalment shall forthwith become due to such board by the owner of such cottage and may be recovered as a simple contract in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>But how can you recover if you have not got the power to fix the property with a judgment mortgage and sell out the tenant?  You can sue him and get a judgment, and then the sheriff says: &ldquo;What is the use of sending me down to a labourer's cottage for the few sticks of furniture there, when you have to pay my fee?&rdquo; Taking Sections 21 and 22 together, and leaving the shopkeeper out of consideration altogether, it seems to me that once you have signed the agreement you can tell the local authority that you will not pay, because, unless they can say, in the last analysis: &ldquo;Very well then, we will sell the property,&rdquo; there is no need to collect the rent at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On those two grounds, I suggest that Section 21 is unnecessary and dangerous. There is a third ground to which I directed the attention of this House time and time again, and that is that in a Bill of this character we are frequently tempted to make a breach in well-established principle, <Col N="548" /> and when the breach is proposed, everybody in the House is reassured that these are most exceptional circumstances, that we fully recognise that it is a departure from the rock of principle on which we hitherto stood, but that these are very exceptional circumstances, and not likely to arise again.  So surely, however, as you bring in a statutory limitation on the well-established equitable remedy of mortgage, the whole mortgage system of law is in jeopardy. Once this House proceeds to poke its nose quite casually into a most delicate and elaborate equity structure, Heaven alone knows where it will stop.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but I do say here, looking around this House, and including myself, and perhaps excluding a distinguished lawyer, like Deputy McMenamin, there is not a single man in the House whose judgment on the question of mortgages is worth two straws.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that if he is convinced&mdash;and I do not think he ought to be convinced&mdash;that a section of this kind is necessary, interference with an existing law of this character ought to be done by a special Bill brought in by the Minister for Justice with a very comprehensive discussion on the whole question, and carrying with it the full weight of the opinion of the Ministry for Justice, in order to justify an amendment of this character.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the creditor to whom Deputy Dillon referred is concerned, he would be, when this is passed, in exactly the same position as before.  He will have as much or as little power over the cottage tenant as he has at present before the Bill goes through.  Creditors know that.  They know the position at present, and I think that a cottage tenant would need to be very prosperous before any creditor in a town or neighbouring place would advance anything substantial in the way of credit to such a tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it gives the local authority and the board of health the statutory power necessary to deal with the tenant in case of any breach.  I think it gives power in the case of tenants who fail to meet their annuities.  Sub-section 2 (b) of Section 24 sets out the notice that is necessary. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...in case it is to be based on failure to comply with the statutory condition relating to payment of an instalment of the annuity payable in respect of such cottage, not less than one week's notice,</P>
      <P>and so on.  That sets out the necessary notice, but they can take the purchaser into the court, and the power is set out here giving the board of health, through the district court, power to deal with such tenants as they would deal with any other person in such contractual relations with the board of health.</P>

I have the feeling, but I am not fully qualified to elaborate it, that that makes a kind of instinctive appeal to one's sentiment, but that it is not sound, and that is why I would sooner see it done by a separate Bill introduced by the Minister for Justice which could be argued on its merits as primarily an amendment of the existing mortgage law rather than as an ancillary provision to a Housing Bill.</P>

      <P>That is Deputy McMenamin's conception.  From what the Minister tells us here, the title under this Bill is of a very peculiar character because the person remains a tenant purchaser until the last annuity is paid, so that Deputy McMenamin's conception does not quite coincide with the Minister's.  Under the Land Acts the moment the land was vested the man became owner, but he was subject to a charge in respect of rent outstanding.  The tenancy under this Act is quite different and is very materially qualified by Section 24, which leaves the man virtually a tenant almost at will up to the time of the last instalment.</P>

      <P>What Deputy McMenamin refers to is quite accurate. We are trying to make these tenant purchasers tenants in fee of their cottages and plots and it is a very difficult process.  We have seven or eight sections of the Bill endeavouring to do that, bearing in mind that it is difficult to qualify the ownership in fee, to put qualifications upon that. These plots are held by boards of health under a variety of Acts of Parliament and in a variety of ways and in order to get them freed and hand them over, when the final annuity is paid, to the cottier tenant&mdash;hand over the plot in fee&mdash;we have had very long consultations with specialists in land law as to how the various cases that have been put up to us can be met.  The whole question of transferring these cottage plots to the tenants in fee has raised many difficult points. Six or seven of these sections have had to be specially drafted to deal with the matter.  The intention is that as soon as the final instalment is paid we will hand the cottage and plot in fee to the tenant.  These various sections have been framed to enable us to do that and there are some qualifications, such as in Section 21, that have been found necessary to safeguard the position of the tenant purchaser during that period.</P>

      <P>Is it provided by Section 24 that if a person is only one week in arrears with his rent, the local authority can recover possession from him and wind up his purchase agreement? If so, is there provision in the Bill that any payments made on foot of the purchase agreements are to be refunded, or, are they to be treated as rents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 24 provides in (2) (b) that in case a board of health makes an application for recovery of the cottage owing to a breach of the statutory conditions, or where the applicant has failed to comply with the statutory conditions relating to payment of rent, one week's notice is sufficient, and proceedings may ensue.  I think we ought to know in that case what the position of the tenant purchaser would be in the event of the local authority succeeding. Will the tenant purchaser get any credit for the instalments he has paid up to then?  If he does not get credit for the instalments paid, then Section 21 becomes a delusion and a snare, because we are substituting for the right to charge a rent a new method whereby we take the land off the man and give him nothing at all for it.  The Minister will readily recognise, say, in the case of a man who had paid up his land annuities and then fell into arrears, that his tenant right would still be a very valuable consideration and it could be sold.  Apparently Section 24 means that the local authorities should treat all the instalments paid by the tenant up to that date as rent. I think the Minister ought to clarify that for us before we pass the section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must see that that is monstrous, because Section 21 now becomes an oppression and a grave injustice.  The land is vested in the tenant, and the tenant has a growing property in it.  Take the case of an ordinary tenant purchaser in the case of land, where the tenant was paying rent in lieu of annuity on a holding acquired under the Land Acts.  An Act was brought in here in 1933 to give the tenant credit for the moneys he had paid pending vesting.  Under this Bill, with all its appearance of benevolence, there is set up under Section 24 an entirely new rent recovery procedure which provides that though a man has paid 30 years out of 60 years' <Col N="555" /> rent, and then falls into arrears for one week, the board of health can intervene and put him out of the cottage, taking away his 30 years' payments&mdash;writing them down as rents. That is a positive injustice, and I do not believe for a moment that the Deputies here will accept such an arrangement, nor do I conceive how the Minister could seriously recommend it.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister really what he thinks of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Dillon suggest that the board of health should not get any of that money paid by the tenant, but that it should be returned to him and that the board should bear all the liabilities?  But the board of health has to pay the loan that has been raised to pay for this cottage.  It is doing that out of the moneys received from the tenant. Surely if the tenant purchaser is to get credit and have that money returned to him the board of health would be at a big loss.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon has in mind that if there is anything over, after the payment of liabilities by the board of health, that should go to the credit of the tenant purchaser when the cottage and plot were being resumed by the board of health.  If that is what the Deputy means there would be something in it.  But if the board of health is not to be in a position to secure that any moneys it has raised by loan or otherwise for the provision of that cottage and plot should not be met by the tenant, then the board of health would have a very heavy additional liability to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises that, on the basis of this arrangement, a man who paid 30 years' annuities for his cottage would, because of one week's arrears, lose the whole thing.  If the tenant is one week in arrears with his payments the board of health can kick him out and open a new purchase agreement with him which would run for 60 years or more.  My argument is that the tenant purchaser acquires some property in the cottage and plot, by Section 21, which has been inserted to <Col N="556" /> protect him.  I find it hard to define the nature of that property.  Section 24 confers upon the local authority the right to take that property, whatever it is, away from the tenant purchaser because of his failure for one week to pay the rent.  To my mind, that is manifestly unjust and it is in direct conflict with the whole trend of legislation and its character in this country.  Property certainly does exist for the tenant purchaser, because Section 21 has been inserted.  I protest against the proposal to give the local authority the right to rob the tenant of his purchase because of his failure in the payment of one week's rent.  Candidly, I do not see how the Minister can recommend this section to the House.  If the board of health is receiving the annuity which was agreed upon when the purchase agreement was made, then I do not see that the board has contracted any further liability during the 30 years my imagined tenant was in occupation. If the board proceeded to sell the tenant right it would be represented by its amenity value plus whatever the tenant has paid in the 30 years.  Then you can imagine a case where the new tenant comes in and goes on paying the remainder of the annuities.  In such a case it may happen that, at the end of the original agreement, one or two or three succeeding tenants would have paid off the entire sum due. This is a section on which I propose to divide the House unless the Minister says he is disposed to consider the position in the light of the facts I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this question arises: What will happen if the board of health covenant in any insurance agreement against the doing of certain things in respect of these cottages, and one of the tenants does something which the board of health undertook should not be done?  Will that not operate to invalidate the insurance policy?  For instance, let us take an extravagant covenant, that no one will light a fire in the middle of the kitchen floor or anywhere but on the hearths.  Somebody does light a fire on the kitchen floor or the pantry floor and the cottage is set on fire and burned down.  Will that breach of the covenant on the part of the tenant deprive the local authority of their right to recover against the insurance company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that very difficult questions frequently arise on matters of that kind between insurance companies and their clients. The insurance company naturally have to protect themselves.  If they discover that there has been any breach or breaches of the covenants they will try to get out of the liability.  The question then is whether the making of a fire in a room where there was not a fireplace would be a breach of the covenant.  I presume it would be a breach and the insurance company might escape liability.  Then it would be for the board of health to say whether they would out of generosity rebuild the cottage.  That is a difficulty. There may be other cases. For instance, if a person built a garage next door to a cottage and, through an accident, the cottage was burned, that might not be covered by the insurance.  At any rate, the board of health, for their own protection are bound to insure.  They will insure for their own protection.  It will not be a very big sum and they can include that in the annuity.  The tenants themselves can also insure for their own protection.  I do not know whether many of them do.  Many <Col N="558" /> difficulties might arise as to the interpretation of the covenants and whether there were breaches of them. I am afraid that the board of health could not possibly undertake to watch every cottage and see that things were not done which would be breaches of the covenants with the insurance company.  They would have very great difficulty in exercising such supervision as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What remedy would the local authority have in this case?  A very common covenant in fire insurance policies is that you are not to keep on the premises oil in drums above a certain flash point which usually excludes petrol and gasoline. Suppose the occupant of a cottage becomes a hackney car driver and instals a barrel of petrol on the premises.  The local authority knows that that destroys the security under the insurance policy and tells him that he must not keep the petrol and he says he will keep it.  What remedy have the local authority or have they any remedy?</P>

    <P>(i)  the cottage purchase annuity shall, in lieu of being paid to such board of health, be paid to the Irish Land Commission, and shall, unless previously redeemed under this paragraph, continue to be so paid until the expiration of the payment period in respect of such cottage;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the cottage purchase annuity shall be payable to the Irish Land Commission by equal half-yearly instalments on the gale days on which the land purchase annuity is, or in the case of the cesser of the land purchase annuity, before the cottage purchase annuity was payable, and the first instalment shall be payable on the first gale day after the said date of consolidation, subject, however, as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(vii)  the cottage purchase annuity may be redeemed at any time by payment to the Irish Land Commission of such sum as, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, represents the value of all the instalments thereof which have not then accrued due,</P>
    <P>(viii)  the cottage purchase annuity may be reduced by redemption of part thereof by payment to the Irish Land Commission of such sum as, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, represents the value of that part of all the instalments thereof which have not then accrued due,</P>
    <P>(ix)  all moneys received by the Irish Land Commission in respect of instalments of the cottage purchase annuity shall be disposed of in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct,</P>
    <P>(x)  all moneys received by the Irish Land Commission in <Col N="562" /> respect of the redemption of the cottage purchase annuity or any part thereof shall be paid by the Irish Land Commission to such board of health and applied by them in such manner as the Minister may direct;</P>

    <P>(f)  so long as both the cottage purchase annuity and the land purchase annuity continue to be payable, such annuities shall, for the purposes of the collection and recovery thereof, be deemed to be a consolidated annuity of an amount equal to the sum of the said two annuities;</P>
    <P>(g)  unless and until the cottage purchase annuity has been wholly redeemed, the Irish Land Commission shall, on every date subsequent to the said date of consolidation when, if such consolidating order had not been made, the owner of such cottage would have been liable to pay to such board of health an instalment of the cottage purchase annuity, be liable either to pay to such board of health or, if any debt is due to the Irish Land Commission by such board of health, to place to the credit of such board of health, the following amount, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  in case the cottage purchase annuity has been reduced by redemption, an amount which bears to the amount of such instalment the same proportion as the cottage purchase annuity after such reduction bore to the cottage purchase annuity before such reduction;</P>
    <P>(h)  the following provisions shall have effect in relation to any arrears of the cottage purchase <Col N="563" /> annuity which accrued due before the said date of consolidation,</P>
    <P>(i)  the Irish Land Commission shall not be liable to collect or pay to such board of health such arrears,</P>

    <P>(ii)  imposes on the owner of such cottage an obligation to comply with any statutory condition, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  confers any power or imposes any duty on such board of health in relation to cottages purchased under this Act, or</P>

    <P>(j)  no provision of this Act shall be construed as imposing any duty on the Irish Land Commission in relation to such cottage which is not imposed by the Land Purchase Acts as implied by this sub-section to the consolidated holding.</P>
    <P>This is one of the matters I referred to a short time ago as to the question of vesting the cottage and plot in the tenant purchaser.  This amendment has been drafted for us by the Land Commission.  It deals with the case of a tenant who will purchase his labourer's cottage and who is in possesion of, or obtains a holding of land subject to an annuity payable to the Land Commission.  In such a case the Land Commission will collect <Col N="564" /> both annuities and pay the portion relating to the cottage annuity to the board of health.  The cottage purchase annuity may be redeemed at any time, in whole or in part, by a lump sum payment.  There have been some cases&mdash;I do not know whether they are numerous or not&mdash;where tenants have been granted holdings of land.  The intention is to amalgamate the holding and the cottage and plot and hand them over to the Land Commission. They become Land Commission tenants and the Land Commission will be responsible for them, as if they were small holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this will lead to chaos.  You have now a cottage and plot held from a local authority under the peculiar tenancy described in the Bill.  The land which will be granted to the cottage tenant by the Land Commission will be held under an ordinary Land Commission title and will, presumably, be vested in the tenant. As soon as may be after he has been granted the holding under the Land Commission title, the Land Commission will proceed to collect the joint annuity, representing the annuity on the cottage and plot, plus the annuity on the land.  But the tenant holds land as owner in fee simple with the charge in favour of the Land Commission in respect of an annuity outstanding. He is, however, no more than a tenant at will of the local authority in respect of his cottage and plot, and is liable to ejection, without compensation, on any occasion on which he gets into arrears.  But you have the Land Commission collecting the rents for both plots.  Surely that is going to give rise to the wildest confusion.  There will be the difficulty of keeping the holding delimited and recognising the difference between what will be an annuity and a rent to the local authority.  Now there is a way out, but it is a way which I think will give rise to considerable inequality between tenants.  What you can do is this.  Where you have a cottage with land annexed which is subject to a purchase agreement, and the Land Commission gives the tenant a piece of land under the Land Act, the local authority might sell the <Col N="565" /> cottage and plot to the Land Commission and allow the Land Commission to fix an annuity that would provide for the cottage and plot.  If you do that you will have every cottage purchaser clamouring for a bit of land from the Land Commission on the better terms which the Land Commission provides.  Otherwise I do not see how you can work a system where the Land Commission is acting as rent collector in respect to those two different contracts in regard to what appears to be one parcel of land. Would the Minister consider the practicability of transferring the cottage and plot to the Land Commission where he is going to make the cottage tenant a Land Commission purchaser? That would simplify the situation considerably.</P>

      <P>We have gone into that and found it would not simplify the situation.  After a long discussion with the Land Commission, our advisers agreed upon this plan as one that raises the least possible number of difficulties, and made it easier for the tenant.  A variety of ways were discussed. What Deputy Dillon has in mind was discussed with the Land Commission, and after considerable discussion, correspondence and conferences, this course was adopted by the expert advisers of the three parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Incidentally, you will have the picture of a man with an acre of land with his cottage, and an annuity fixed for him which will be approximately economic.  He will then get another acre of land from the Land Commission, and will have to pay half annuity under the Land Purchase Act of 1933.  That, I imagine, will make further difficulty.  One acre of his land will bear what will look like a terrific rent as compared with what will be known as a normal annuity for the acre of land adjoining.  Would not the Minister be well advised to amalgamate such holdings and thus solve the difficulty?  If he does not do that  surely the time will come when he will have to consent to a scheme which will provide that one acre of land attached to a labourer's cottage will bear a <Col N="566" /> heavier rent than an acre of land purchased under the Land Act.  Unless he amalgamates the holdings in every case of this kind he will find himself in a very difficult position and, what is worse, he will make it more difficult still for his successor in office.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Brennan, I beg to move amendment No. 18 (a):</P>
      <P>Before Section 30 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Cottage rent collectors whose services are not required as a result of the operation of this Act, and who are not absorbed into equally remunerative employment by the board of health shall be entitled to reasonable compensation by way of pension or gratuity with the Minister's sanction and approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Deputy Brennan that he feels that fees from the collection of rents which form a very substantial part of the payment of the salaries of those officers, who act as rent collectors, will be considerably reduced as the result of the passing <Col N="567" /> of this Bill.  I would like to hear from the Minister if that is so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a reduction, to a certain extent, in their incomes, because so many of these rent collectors are paid on a percentage basis.  They are paid on a percentage of rents which will now be reduced.  The annuities will be 75 per cent. of the present rents and, therefore, the collectors' income will be reduced by 25 per cent.  None of them, however, will lose his fees or his employment.  There will be a possible reduction in the amount of salary or commission they receive in the collection of those rents, but such reduction as will be certain to arise in that way will be met by an increase in the number of cottages that will grow up in future in board of health areas.  Some collectors have had very considerable increase in revenue as a result of the increase in the number of cottages from which they collected rents during the last two or three years.  In future years I think in the case of every board of health area there will be an additional number of cottages from which rents will be collected.  In that way they will have made up to them much more than any loss that may arise as a result of the reduction of the annuities by reason of the purchase scheme.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Turf (Use and Development) Bill, 1935&mdash;Money Resolution (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Debate resumed on the following Resolution:</P>
    <P>That for carrying into effect any Act of the present session to make provision for promoting the more extensive production and consumption of turf for domestic and house hold purposes, and to make provision for divers matters ancillary to or connected with such production and consumption, including conferring on the Minister for Industry and Commerce powers to acquire land and construct transport works and conferring on the Turf Development Board, Limited, powers in connection with the matters aforesaid, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred by the Minister for Industry and Commerce being expenses which are required by the provisions of such Act to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the debate on this Resolution, Deputy Burke was speaking.  I want to oppose this Resolution because it was introduced with what appeared to me to be a thoroughly fraudulent representation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In discussing the Second Stage of the Bill in respect of which this Money Resolution is introduced, the Minister said he expected to put between 40,000 and 50,000 people working at turf-cutting and establish in this country in the turf-cutting business an industry second only in importance to the agricultural industry.  That is, in my opinion, the type of fraudulent statement which is bringing democracy into discredit the world over.  Sometimes I suspect that the Minister wants to destroy democratic institutions by talk of that character.  The more I see of him the more I feel that his mind is becoming more Hitlerlike with the passage of every week.  The Minister <Col N="569" /> knows perfectly well that 50,000 people are not going to be employed in cutting turf.  He knows perfectly well that to describe the turf-cutting industry in this country as ever likely to be the second most important industry in the country is the wildest and most irresponsible misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, it is useful to bear in mind that, up to date, we have spent about £50,000 on the development of the turf resources of the country in accordance with the Minister's new turf policy, not to speak of the very large sums spent out of the Relief Votes in building roads into the turf bogs for the purpose of facilitating the Minister's experiments. This expenditure of £50,000 was recommended to the House, in the first instance, by the Minister for Education, who was then acting temporarily in some other capacity.  He said that the reason he recommended these turf proposals to the House was that he wanted to compensate the counties of Connacht and the County of Donegal in some measure for the fact that they would not share in the sugar bounties or the wheat bounties or the great industrial wealth that was going to be created by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We spent £50,000 to provide an alternative bounty for the County of Donegal and the counties of Connacht, with the astonishing result that, comparing the production of turf in the counties of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry in the years 1931 and 1934, we find that we actually produced in these five counties in 1934 242,000 fewer tons of turf than had been produced in 1931.  It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that we are reluctant to vote an undetermined sum of money in this Money Resolution to continue experiments of that kind.  So far as the official figures reveal, two-thirds of the number of sacks and one-half of the co-operative societies' expenditure of £38,000 was laid out in the five counties to which I have referred.  Nevertheless, the production of turf fell by nearly 250,000 tons.  I suppose there was some increase in the production of turf in the County Kildare, but whether that was the primary motive <Col N="570" /> of the Minister or not, it would be difficult to know.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this question.  I am perfectly convinced that an attempt will be made hereafter to persuade the public that the Turf Bill we are now considering is designed to facilitate inquiry into the development of power from turf.  I want to say that if this Bill had in it anything designed to provide a fixed sum wherewith to try out that experiment, I should be in favour of providing the money for one reason only&mdash;not because I personally believe in the possibilities of power from turf, but because I have learned from experience in this country that any scheme which carries the recommendation of Sir John Purser Griffith is deserving of investigation. He has been interesting himself in this matter.  He has given it as his opinion that there are undeveloped potentialities in it.  That is an opinion to which I attach the highest importance, and knowing the kind of service that man has given this country, knowing that he gave his plans and his assistance whenever the occasion offered, I should be in favour of saying that whatever scheme he recommends as being in the national interest ought at least to be given a trial.  Where the trying of it would provide valuable employment to deal with the desperate unemployment situation with which we are confronted I should be very glad to see it done.</P>
    <P>No such proposal is made in the Bill to which this Money Resolution has been proposed.  We are asked to provide an indeterminate sum to do something that no one quite knows the nature of in an area which has not been delimited, and which has yet to be determined.  To that I strongly object.  The recommendation is made in terms of exaggeration and misrepresentation which are patent.  It is going to interfere very materially with consumers of coal.  No one can buy coal in future if he does not buy with it the prescribed amount of turf, when the Minister brings the Bill into operation in the areas he has not named.  Of course, a householder, when buying coal can buy turf from a member of a co-operative society set up by the Bill, get a certificate from the <Col N="571" /> society, and clear himself of any obligation to buy turf from a coal merchant. There is no use closing our eyes to the fact that this is going materially to increase the cost of fuel to the occupants of every house.  Every labourer's cottage being built has a small coal range installed, and all these people will have to buy turf with coal. They will have to dispose of the turf somewhere if they cannot use it, and if they have to do that, they will have to do so at a loss.  Heretofore, the practice was that turf-cutters, having saved the crop, came to town with a cart of turf and sold it in the street to the best bidder.  Now, there is an obligation on every householder who burns any coal to buy turf from a coal merchant, and that will virtually destroy the well-established method of disposing of the turf crop.  Many people will ask what is the exact reason for the co-operative societies.  The reason is quite plain.  It is necessary that the House and the country should know the reason: because the Fianna Fáil clubs are flagging and something has to be done to whip them up.</P>

      <P>My submission is that the Minister has designed not to set up societies to distribute turf, but to set up societies for the distribution of some of the fly-blown philosophy of Fianna Fáil.  We know the difficulty that the Government is experiencing in keeping its followers in the cumainn. They now discover that there is growing up on their left a political organisation which is providing considerable attraction for a great many of their more irresponsible supporters.  They are therefore determined to set up sideshows, and when they can no longer entertain the people with games they must proceed to entertain them with money, and they are going to set up turf societies, as they hope, as an alternative to the branches of Poblacht na hEireann.  I think that is a highly undesirable purpose for the funds of the State.  They ought not to establish corrupt branches of a political party in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is not necessary to elaborate it once the attention of the House is directed to it.  They will understand it.  It is something I deplore, and it is noteworthy to see the indignation of the Minister when the attention of the House and the country is directed to it.  The inconvenience that is going to accrue from this political authority is going to be very great, but the Minister could not be expected to understand that.  He has no contact with rural Ireland and does not understand conditions there. Anyone who understands the conditions under which the people live, who buy turf normally, will realise that to buy a cart of turf on the street, and to ask the man who sold it to travel back maybe five miles to get a certificate from the local co-operative society, and to bring it in to show that the turf was bought from them, before you can get 1 cwt. of coal from a local merchant, is going to create chaos, and not only that, but it will be generally ignored.</P>
      <P>The coal retailer is required to receive with every order for coal either a certificate of the kind I have just described or else an order for a certain statutory quantity of turf. What is going to happen in that connection is this, that the honest coal merchants who believe they have a conscientious duty to obey the law, no matter how unreasonable it is, will try to carry out the provision of the Act, while their less scrupulous competitors will pursue the same policy as was pursued during the war in regard to sugar.  In those days merchants had to sell a certain amount of brown sugar with a given amount of white sugar.  Those of them who believed in carrying out the letter of the law insisted on their customers taking their due proportion of brown sugar.</P>

      <P>I understood it was the Minister's intention to send around inspectors to compel merchants to carry into effect the regulations which he will prescribe in regard to selling with each quantity of coal a stated quantity of turf.  That must be done by an elaborate form of inspection, and it is presumably for that inspection the Money Resolution is being passed.  My submission is that that scheme will not work.  The honest coal retailer will obey the law without this compulsion, but his less scrupulous rival will not carry out the law.  He will hold himself out as a person prepared to sell coal to anybody without the due proportion of turf, provided the inspector is not in town.  On one day in the month, or in the week, the inspector will be in town, and everybody will obey the law.  For the remainder of the month the unfortunate man who believes in obeying the law will lose his customers by doing so, while the other type of merchant will sell as much coal as he wants and let the turf lie there.  Mind you, that is not only going to mean that the law-abiding merchant will lose his coal trade.  It will mean also that he will have endless quarrels with his customers, who will ask him to supply them with coal without turf.  He will refuse, and they will march off to a retailer elsewhere and get all they require.  The less scrupulous merchant will gladly oblige them.  The result will be that householders will get their supplies from the unjust retailer rather than from the scrupulous retailer.  Of course the Minister will assure us that ample precautions will be taken to prevent that, just as we were assured that ample precautions would be taken to see that the Cattle and Sheep Act would operate in this country.  Everybody knows that it did not operate. Everybody knows that it was a complete farce, because it was impossible to supervise its administration.  Similarly it will be impossible to supervise the administration of this Act.  It will not operate, and it will cause endless inconvenience.  The supervision for which we are voting money now will be wholly ineffective, and grave injustice to certain traders will ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not an astonishing thing that <Col N="577" /> the Minister can move a Money Resolution of this kind and have the effrontery to tell the House that he does not know how much he will require, that he does not know in what areas the Bill will operate, and still expect the House to give him that money?  As I say, the Minister, as he grows older, becomes more Hitlerite in his mind and has now reached the stage that he bitterly resents being asked for any information at all.  He regards it as a reflection on his noble person to suggest that he should ever render an account of his stewardship to the House of which he is a member. I think that is deplorable.  I do not expect members of the Fianna Fáil Party to resent that.  I think they rather enjoy being trampled upon just as the Minister for Agriculture allows himself to be trampled upon and buffetted by his colleagues.  The more the Minister for Agriculture is trampled upon the more he seems to like it.  However, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not be allowed to treat this House with the same contempt that he habitually displays towards the Minister for Agriculture. I demand that he should communicate to us now a reasoned estimate of what the cost of this Bill will be, an honest estimate of what advantages he thinks may accrue from the expenditure of this money, and a clear statement of where he intends to operate the Act at least in its initial stages.</P>

      <P>I am one of those backbenchers who have to sit here from day to day listening to the criticism that comes from the Opposition and hoping to get from it some constructive suggestion as to how we might remedy conditions in this country.  Deputy Dillon started off by saying that this was a purely fraudulent Bill.  A little further on in his speech he quoted from Sir John Purser Griffith, who said that turf should get a trial, and he wound up by pointing out the inconvenience the scheme would mean for the business people of the country. Yesterday, in the speeches on the Budget we heard a considerable amount of talk about the money spent on unemployment assistance and how desirable <Col N="578" /> it would be to have that money expended on productive employment, but here, when a scheme is proposed which will give plenty of employment, Deputies opposite oppose it.  I have glanced through the debates on this Bill and I find that Deputy Belton tells us that spoon-fed farmers are a curse.  Deputy Bennett objects to compulsion, but I should like to ask Deputy Bennett, if he objects to protection for Irish industries, what attitude he adopted when the question of protection for the products of Irish creameries was discussed in this House? We have had criticisms here also about the protection given to home-grown wheat.  Some of the Deputies who opposed that protection have since been honest enough to say that they were not justified in their attitude and that they had changed their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton made that statement in reference to wheat in my presence.  A lot of money has been spent on the bogs and I cannot understand why, when approval was given to the spending of that money, we cannot go a step further and protect the commodity that is produced in these bogs.  So far I do not know what standard has been attained in the production of briquettes that are being made in this country, but I saw foreign briquettes in the city during the winter, and apparently a good sale was being found for them here.  I say that the person who turns to turf has a good substitute for these briquettes. I say further that it is the patriotic duty of every Irishman to support a native industry of this kind, in which so many of our unemployed can be absorbed.  Listening to the debates for the last few days I heard a considerable amount of criticism about the amount of taxation levied on the country.  The cure put forward by Deputies on the opposite side for our difficulties in that regard is that there should be a surrender in the economic dispute with Great Britain.  I am a farmer and I think I may be taken as a fairly conservative type of farmer. I can speak in regard to the cattle trade, and I fully realise that the time <Col N="579" /> when we had the cattle boom in this country was the period when we had the largest amount of emigration.  You are faced with that situation now. Those in the bog areas are bearing a more crushing burden than those in any other area in the country.  It would be mere justice on the part of this House to try to do something for those areas in which neither beet nor wheat can be grown.  Something should be done to try and relieve the pressure there.  Deputies should look at this Bill from the national standpoint, and realise that we can grow crops and manufacture things in this country that are as good as can be produced in any country in the world.  We should not get the idea in our heads that nothing will suit us but the best English coal.  With Sir John Purser Griffith I agree that the scheme as outlined in this Bill is worth a trial.  I venture to say that in two years' time, if what is proposed here is a success, we will have some of the Deputies opposite going down the country and denying that they ever voted against this Bill.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement on the Money Resolution on the last day, I want to get some information from him. Deputy Victory said that he could not understand why we should agree to spend a certain sum of money in the bogs, and then not go any further.  I would ask him to look at the results that we have got from what we have spent.</P>

      <P>Look at the results that we have got from the money that has been spent on the bogs in the last three or four years.  If the Deputy does that he will understand why we are not prepared to go any further. What has been the net result of all the money that has been spent over the last three or four years on this turf campaign?  A reduction of over 200,000 tons in the quantity produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with one statement the Deputy made, namely, that the people in those areas where neither beet nor wheat can be produced are being crushed.  The Deputy's remedy for that situation is to pay them the magnificent sum of 11/6 per ton for turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only the minimum price.  They can get the best price that it is possible to secure afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is going to be the maximum.  The Minister told us that 11/6 per ton was a very good price for turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us that three men would produce 18 tons of turf in a week, and so far as the average bog is concerned that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be true of some bogs in the country, but I venture to suggest that it is not true of every bog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's suggestion was that three men would be able to produce 18 tons of turf in every bog in the country.  In my opinion, the output would not be anything like that in some bogs.  It is conceivable that three men, working particularly hard, would produce 20 tons of turf in the week in one bog, but that the output would not be anything like that in all the bogs.  In any event, for whatever they produce they are to get 11/6 per ton.  Is that going to remove the crushing burden that these people are bearing?  A ton of good-class turf means about two horse loads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on the bog that you are working in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the average turf that is produced.  A good creel of what is called black stone turf will almost weigh a ton, <Col N="581" /> but as regards the average hard brown turf, a good horse load weighs about half a ton.  For cutting that, drying it and saving it&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;delivering it at the railway station, or a canal bank, which may be half a mile away or eight miles away, the net price that is going to be paid is 5/6 per load.  I do not see how that is going to relieve the crushing burden on the people in the bog areas.</P>
      <P>I want to have some information from the Minister as to his statement that he is going to put 50,000 additional hands into the bogs.  The Minister, having made a great flourish with that statement, helped to provide the <i>Irish Press</i> with a great headline &mdash;that 50,000 additional people were going to be put into the turf industry. But the Minister then said in a softer voice&mdash;&ldquo;that will take a long time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am prepared to withdraw my opposition to everything in this Bill except two matters: (1) the price that is to be paid to the people who are being crushed, and (2) subject to the Minister providing suitable grates in the homes of the people so that they can burn turf.  Will he also tell the House how those engaged in the turf industry are going to absorb the unemployed in the industry if all that they are to get for the turf is 11/6 per ton?  I would like to hear Deputy Victory, who is a man of practical experience, on that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that when he said that he was talking nonsense&mdash;absolute tosh. He certainly has contempt for the intelligence of the employed if he thinks <Col N="582" /> that they are going to swallow that. It is not because they did swallow his statements on one or two occasions that they are going to continue doing that.  It would be a tremendous relief to everybody, to the unemployed, to the Minister for Finance and indeed to everyone if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would tell us how he is going to put 40,000 additional people into employment in this industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when speaking on his own Estimate some weeks ago, said that if he could find employment for an additional 40,000 persons he would have completely solved the unemployment problem in this country.  If he is able to find employment for them in this industry, look at the relief that would be to the Minister for Finance. I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take the Minister for Finance into his confidence and save him the trouble of finding the £2,500,000 that he says he needs for his employment fund.  It is only fair to the House, and it is certainly due to the unemployed, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should give as a little more information on this.  How many does he expect to be able to find work for in the bogs next year, and how many the year after?  What does he mean when he says that it will take a long time? Does he hope to have the 40,000 or 50,000 additional persons put into employment in this industry in the lifetime of the present Government, or during his own lifetime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of sweeping statements from the Minister, without any attempt whatever to show any evidence that they are serious statements. As I say, we are so accustomed to getting those sensational statements from the Minister&mdash;statements which provide those streamer headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i> nearly every morning&mdash; that it would be refreshing if he would go a little into detail and tell us how he arrived at that figure.  I would be perfectly satisfied if the Minister were able to assure the House definitely that even an additional 5,000 people would be put into the bogs in the coming year. I do not want to go into the details <Col N="583" /> of the Bill.  We will have an opportunity of doing that on the sections later on.  I am dealing only with the points which, notwithstanding what Deputy Victory says, prove our opposition to this Bill to be well founded. My principal reason for getting up was to ask the Minister for some further information about that 40,000 or 50,000.</P>

You may have an inspection carried out to-day by an inspector appointed by the Minister, by an officer appointed by the Board to-morrow, and by any member of the Gárda Síochána the <Col N="587" /> following day.  I should like the Minister to tell us why it is necessary to have not only three inspectors but three inspectors responsible and appointed by three different bodies or departments, so to speak.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take it that the Department of Industry and Commerce will function, in the main, through the Turf Development Board, and, in so far as it is practical to do it, will arrange to have its work done by the officers of the Board.</P>

      <P>My point is that in this Bill we are to have inspections by an inspector appointed by the Minister, an officer appointed by the Turf Board, or any member of the Gárda Síochána.  These inspectors may call at any time and make all investigations&mdash;inspect books, records, invoices, and so on.  Are we to be in the position that we may have an inspector appointed by the Minister to-day, an officer appointed by the Board to-morrow, and a member of the Gárda Síochána the following day? Is it necessary that there should be three sets of officers appointed by three different Departments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that when we come to the sections on which it arises.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan as to the quality of the turf, I should like to know from the Minister, if this is the appropriate place to raise it, what arrangements will be made by the Board to have adequate supervision? I want to say, here and now, that, from what I have heard, the Board certainly did a good deal to get after the abuses which arose during the first and second year, but the Minister knows as well as I do that there were abuses, and fairly widespread abuses.  When the purchase of turf is made compulsory I am afraid there will be a further tendency to <Col N="588" /> abuse, and I am not satisfied that adequate arrangements are made in the Bill or sufficient machinery provided to ensure that we are going to get turf of the quality set out in the Bill.  The Minister knows it will be almost impossible to have the supervision over the country that it would be necessary to have, not only as regards quality, but as regards weight. I do not know definitely what has been done up to the present, except in so far as we can learn from what has been happening, and I should like the Minister to say&mdash;if he is prepared to say it now or on a later section&mdash; what machinery is going to be set up to safeguard the consumer in the matter of quality and weight.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be satisfied that the Turf Development Board will exercise such supervision over the activities of the co-operative societies, as is necessary to ensure that the turf sold by them will be of good quality.  I am rather surprised that the Deputy should raise the point, having regard to the fact that the amendments to the Bill submitted by his Party are all designed to prevent that supervision being exercised.</P>

      <P>The Minister will hear all about the amendment and the reasons for it when we come to it.  We are surely not expected to be satisfied with the bald statement of the Minister that the turf board will take all the necessary precautions?  I want to know how they are going to take <Col N="589" /> precautions.  I want to know what will be the machinery.  I want to know how many inspectors will be required to cover the bog area in this country, so as to ensure that the quality that we are supposed to get will be supplied.  The Minister has not given us an idea whatever about these things. He comes in here with the Bill and makes, as I say, a sort of bald statement and expects the House to accept the Bill without substantiating his statement in any way.  The Minister must know from his own experience, and we all know, that the Department has had terrible difficulty in this matter, and that up to the present it has not been found possible to take adequate precautions to ensure that good-quality turf was supplied.  The Minister himself knows that, and I only want to ensure that the machinery that will be set up under this Bill will be adequate to prevent abuses.  I want to know from the Minister what precautions have been taken and where there is anything in the Bill to tell us what machinery will be set up in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Section 2 deals with the approved sources.  That is the section where we say that the turf sold must be turf sold by the Board&mdash;and I think the Deputy can rely on the fact that the turf sold by the Board will be turf of good quality; by a co-operative society authorised or approved by the Board to supply turf for the purposes of the provisions of this Act&mdash;and on the Board we place the obligation that they will not approve or authorise any society that is selling turf that is not up to the standard that the Board requires; and, thirdly, by a concern that is approved of by the Minister.  The only proposal to increase the number of sources and to bring in a source over which there could be no supervision is contained in the amendment moved by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the Board will not approve a <Col N="590" /> society that is not right or that is not selling turf up to the standard.  Very well.  Let us say that a society is formed and that it applies to the Board for authorisation and for a certificate, or whatever is necessary, that they are an approved source of supply.  That is an easy step.  That is the first step, but what steps are to be taken to ensure that, having been authorised by the Board, there will not be abuses?</P>

It will be stored in compounds or sheds erected by and approved by the Turf Board.  It will be subject all the time to the board's supervision.  It will be sold under the board's supervision, and if there is any complaint the turf will be sent back to the society at the society's expense, as in the past.  Adequate safeguards are provided.  Of course, I know that this amendment is only put forward as a red herring.</P>

      <P>They were not.  I said already that the board had taken steps to deal with abuses, and I admit it.  I admitted that they had taken fairly drastic steps to deal with abuses, but the extent to which they were able to check abuses is another matter.  The Minister talks about the sources of supply and about supervision of the sources.  Well, a co-operative society under this scheme might get as many as 50 orders, say, within ten days, from 50 different merchants in 50 different parts of the country.  Is an inspector to be kept there all the time to see that the turf is all right and that it is weighed into the sacks, and not merely filled into them by guesswork and put into the railway or canal barge?  Has the Minister any idea? He does not know.  I am anxious to know this, particularly in view of the fact that there are three sets of inspectors.  I want to know how many inspectors will be appointed by the board to see that this is carried out.</P>

Did he ever hear of a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; of turf? Well, they describe a turf-bank in the country as a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; of turf.  Does the Minister not know that in that &ldquo;cut&rdquo; there would be four or five qualities of turf?  How will the Board distinguish between the different qualities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not in existence for the past few years, and what has been happening?  I could give the Minister names of certain people in Deputy O'Sullivan's constituency who sent some waggon-loads of turf to Kilkenny, and when the turf reached there it was condemned and they were ordered to take it back. After bringing it that long distance they had to bring it back again, and that was a great hardship on these people.  How is the Minister going to get over that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Of course, the Minister is so hopelessly ignorant of the whole problem that he is just floundering about and does not realise the nature of the difficulties with which the Turf Board may have to contend.  Inspection there must be if you are going to have certified turf sold, but there is no necessity to make that inspection a hardship which will crush the people whom this Bill is supposed to help.  Take the persons to whom Deputy O'Leary has just referred.  They ship turf to Kilkenny, and when the turf gets to Kilkenny it is there inspected, is condemned, and has to be shipped back to them.  The result is that there is enormous cost placed on them, and a transaction out of which they hoped to make a modest profit is turned into a horrible liablility.  If provision had been made for inspection before it was shipped, this could not have happened.  The turf would have been found to be of the wrong quality and they might have lost a little, but they would not <Col N="593" /> have been involved in such a staggering loss and such a ferocious Bill as this.  I want to know from the Minister what scheme of inspection he is going to set on foot to ensure that the quality of turf sold shall correspond to the requirements of the Turf Board.  It seems to me absolutely ludicrous that this House should be asked to give a blank cheque to a man who himself admits that he has never seen a bog except when he went down in a trilby hat to preside at a turf-cutting competition in Kildare and eat a lunch cooked on a coal range there. Goodness knows, it would make anybody sick to hear this kind of thing.</P>

      <P>The Bill is here, and what provision is the Minister going to make with regard to inspection?  I want to know from the Minister what burdens will be placed on the backs of the people in respect of the salaries of inspectors.  I want to save the people from the consequences of the Minister's own incompetence and ineptitude.  It must be remembered that we had the Cattle and Sheep Bill and that a horde of inspectors was created as a result of it, who are now going around the country at £2 10s. 0d. a week sucking their fingers and with nothing to do.  We have not heard what is to be done with them.  The Minister asks leave to create another host of inspectors.  We do not know what their functions are, what the nature of their work is going to be, where they are going to be employed, when, how or how many, and we are asked to give the Minister authority to proceed.  Such conduct reduces the proceedings here to a farce.</P>

Deputy Victory emphasised that those resident in the bog areas, the people seeking a livelihood out of cutting turf, are bearing a more crushing burden than the people in any other area in the country.</P>

It is up to the Minister to reassure us that whatever system he devises in order to ensure that the turf will be the kind of turf that the Turf Development Board requires, it will not be administered in such a way as gravely to inconvenience the people producing the turf.  He has failed to do that, because he has not the relevant information.</P>

    <P>I wonder has the Minister realised that a great deal of the time which he apparently thinks is being wasted on this Bill is due entirely to his own conduct, to his repeated refusals to give the slightest information about this Bill from the administrative point of view?  I do not profess that the <Col N="597" /> actual words in the amendment I propose cover fully my purpose.  It is the general principle I am interested in. I raised the point on the Second Reading as to the damage this Bill will do to the ordinary turf-cutter and I queried the purpose behind it.  I am sorry Deputy Victory is not here, because I am sure he would give me his support on this amendment.  He referred to turf-cutting as a side-line. It is a side-line for many individuals and it ought to be allowed to remain so.  What may be a profitable and necessary side-line for many people ought not to be interfered with and destroyed, in so far as it is a productive business, by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the question I raised on the definition of turf was inconsistent with the amendment I am now moving.  That shows a typical lack of reasoning capacity on the part of the Minister.  Will the Minister not recognise from what I said on the Second Reading and from the amendment we are now discussing, that the purpose is to secure that where a person in a town voluntarily buys turf from an individual who cuts it, what he buys will be counted, so to speak, as satisfying the obligations of this Bill?  Will the Minister not recognise that where there is a voluntary purchase of turf, just as in an ordinary commercial transaction and just as has happened in this country for centuries, long before the Minister began to interfere with the cutting of turf, the individual who buys the turf will see that he is getting value for his money?  That has no connection with the other point that was raised, namely, that where people have turf forced upon them there should be some effort to see that the quality of that turf will be up to the approved standard.  There we have two distinct views.  The Minister's completely inaccurate habit of assuming things leads him into error on this occasion; he assumes there is a connection which is really entirely absent.</P>
    <P>This amendment has to do with a practice in existence for generations <Col N="598" /> in this country, a practice under which small farmers cutting turf bring it into the country towns and sell it to individuals.  My contention, and nothing that the Minister has said leads me to alter my view in this matter, is that that particular form of business will be gravely interfered with by this Bill.  I raised the point on the Second Reading, and the Minister said that the man to whom I referred was not going to be affected to any extent by the provisions of this Bill.  But then he went on to say that there is, of course, nothing in the Bill which prevents an individual from carrying on in future as he did in the past.  He added that it was true that to some extent the market that individual had been supplying might be reduced by the operation of this measure, but the extent would be negligible.  Again we are in difficulties, because we have no information from the Minister.  First he says there will be no interference with that particular individual; his trade will not be interfered with.  In the second sentence he confesses that the market will be interfered with, but he professes to believe that it will be only to a negligible extent.  On what does he base that?  Does he base it on the view that this Bill is not going to be operated seriously anywhere?  Remember, that the districts I have in view are the ordinary turf-cutting districts which can be found in most parts of my native County Kerry.  There you have turf-cutting districts, districts in which turf is consumed.  I have been unable to find from the Minister&mdash;and I challenge any Deputy who has listened to the Minister or read his pronouncements on this matter&mdash;if he can make up his mind whether a typical place for the enforcement of this Bill is the City of Dublin or the County of Kerry. I listened to some of the Minister's interruptions, and they were many, in the course of these debates, and I do not think it is possible to find out which he regards as a typical turf area for the purposes of this measure. I must assume that when he said deliberately, in cold blood, that the place he primarily intends to operate <Col N="599" /> the Bill is in the turf-consuming areas, he means an ordinary district with a town as centre and bogs around. That is precisely the area in which it will be operated, and it will be operated, therefore, to the serious <Col N="600" /> detriment of the particular type of individual to whom I refer.</P>
    <P>Progress reported, the Committee to sit again on Tuesday next.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 19th May.</P>
