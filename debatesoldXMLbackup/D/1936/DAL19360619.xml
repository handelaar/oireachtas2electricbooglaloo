      <P>I do not know that I can usefully add much to what I stated in the two speeches I made on this question yesterday.  I should like to say that with a great deal of matter in the speeches delivered from the opposite benches I agree.  I should naturally like to see a world in which peace was guaranteed by observance of law and behind the law some power that could enforce it but I fear very much that we are a good distance from that yet. Whilst I think the aim of everybody should be to move in some direction like that, we have, as people with definite responsibilities, to look at matters as we find them.  The experience of <Col N="2786" /> the last year or so in Geneva has been particularly valuable in pointing out exactly where the weaknesses of the League lay.  That there were such weaknesses is, I think, now evident to everybody.  A number of those who had the responsibility of Government in the past and who had to picture themselves in a position in which their countries would have to carry out the obligations which they were undertaking in the League were able to see these weaknesses ahead.  You had in Europe amongst the nations that would have to bear the principal burden of enforcing the obligations of the League two divergent lines of thought. There was the line which favoured the intensification of the measures of coercion in case there was any breach of the law and there was the line which favoured the idea of trying to get co-operation by goodwill, without these coercion measures.</P>
      <P>I can frankly admit that my mind, until comparatively recently, ran in the direction in which apparently the minds of a number of Deputies who spoke on the opposite benches are running now, and that is, the logical direction of making coercive measures strong and certain.  If I have changed it is because I have got a fuller realisation than I had before of the difficulties, when moving along that line, of any chance of real success.  Let us dwell for a few moments upon the problem as it presented itself to those who are dealing with the question in Geneva.  We hear a lot about following this lead or that lead.  As a matter of fact we were, and it is generally recognised that we were, the most single-minded of any State in Europe in approaching that matter.</P>

      <P>We had nothing to gain except the general interest in which, of course, our common ultimate interest in peace was involved; but we certainly were not being led in any direction by the influence of any other State.  We took our line because it was quite clear to us that we had but one line to take.  There was no difficulty about it.  It was not a question as to which one had anxious doubts as to which line one would take.  It is <Col N="2787" /> quite definite and clear.  We had entered into certain obligations to do certain things in a certain event.  The event happened.  It was quite clear it happened, and our obligations on that happening were equally clear.  Our action was taken not because one Power took this line or the other.  It was taken because it was made clear to us that it was due to what was a proper sense of our obligations.  We took our line, and if we may talk a little bit more fully of the factors that determined that, I would say that the only anxiety in my mind was as to whether a stage might develop from that which would involve us in doing something which I was perfectly certain our people were not prepared to do, would not agree to do and would not sanction.</P>
      <P>The question was whether military sanctions, the taking of military action was involved in the obligation of Article XVI.  My advice was that military sanctions were not involved. It was quite clear that a very delicate situation indeed would arise if hostilities began as a result of the sanctions, and that other States were of opinion that their obligations led them to contribute military forces to the common effort&mdash;if we had then, apparently, to hold back.  That was the problem, and I put it to the Deputies here in the House that if that situation arose there were going to be very violent differences of opinion in this country as to what was to be done.  Some would say: &ldquo;You have entered into obligations which lead to this step and the other step and, consequently, in the end you ought to continue to work in co-operation with those with whom you have begun.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, you would have a large section of our people saying that nobody was likely to take action of that sort in our interest; that action was primarily determined by the attitude of the big Powers, and it would have been said that some of the big Powers, at least, were themselves vitally interested in Abyssinia, and that it was in consequence of being vitally interested themselves and not because of any obligation they felt they had taken under the Covenant but for the advancement each of its own <Col N="2788" /> separate State that they were prepared to take military action.  We would have naturally another section of our people who would have said &ldquo;It is all very well for States that have clearly their independence to guarantee the independence of others in the hope that their independence also might be guaranteed; but it is quite a different thing in the case of a State which has not the independence the majority of its people desire, for that State to commit itself to military action in favour of supporting independence elsewhere, when its own complete independence has yet to be won.&rdquo;  That was our position and I certainly would not, under these circumstances have, as Minister for External Affairs, advised the Government, nor would I as President here have favoured an action that would have involved sending out military forces.  Our people simply would not stand it and any view I might have personally would not count in the matter.  Our people would not stand it, and I do not think any Government here any more than ours would take the responsibility for doing it.</P>
    <P>It was suggested yesterday that a number of individuals would go.  Yes, a number of individuals would go, I have no doubt whatever.  Quite a large number of people would be prepared to go and fight for the cause of freedom elsewhere.  It is an appeal that always met with response from the hearts of Irishmen.  I did not take the same side as others from 1914 to 1918, but I do recognise that a large number of the people, in fact, all those who had not already committed themselves by their previous obligations, did go out in the belief that they were contributing to the general welfare of mankind and to the establishing of freedom for small nations by going on an expeditionary force to the Continent.  I am perfectly certain, therefore, that sentiments of that sort would induce a large number of our people to go to the aid of a victim of aggression.  But that is quite a different thing from a Government taking upon itself the responsibility of sending such a force. When we enter into commitments we must as a Government be in a position <Col N="2789" /> to carry them out to the full.  If there is one maxim I should like to see acted upon always by any Government here, it is not to enter into any obligations except those they are prepared fully to carry out.</P>
    <P>If the League were to be reformed in the sense of making sanctions more certain, with the possibility of economic sanctions developing into military sanctions, I certainly could not advise our people, in the present conditions, to be a party to that League, because I am certain that when the time came to fulfil our obligations they would not, in fact, be fulfilled, as ultimately Governments must depend upon the public opinion of their country in order to carry out properly the commitments into which they enter.  That is our position, and I am quite frank about it, and I do not wish to press other people to do something which I know our own people would not do.</P>
    <P>Let us take the position of some of the great Powers.  Take the position of Great Britain, for instance.  I want to say this.  I see a great deal of blame being laid by opponents of the present British Government on the shoulders of that Government, and particularly on the Foreign Secretary. I was in Geneva, and of this I am certain, so far as I have been able to get facts to make me certain, that it was not the fault of the British Foreign Secretary that successful measures were not taken.  I want to say that quite frankly.  It is all very well for people in opposition, without responsibility, to talk.  But picture the situation there for Great Britain; picture the situation there for France.  The French people already had experience of what a great European war was&mdash; bitter experience of it.  Was the Government of France going to take action that they felt might involve their people in a catastrophe something similar to that of the war which they passed through from 1914 to 1918? Had they not every reason to hesitate about actions that would possibly mean war?</P>
    <P>I want to say also that if failure was there, if there was one element of failure which one would have liked to see eliminated it was the fact that it <Col N="2790" /> was evident to everybody at Geneva that there was not going to be the co-operation from France which would have been necessary to stop the war or to prevent the war.  There was obvious hesitation on the part of the French Government.  I am not blaming them.  I quite understand that others must have the same consideration with regard to their interests that we have for ours, and I do not blame the Government that hesitated to take action which they thought might ultimately end in war.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other reasons why the French Government should have hesitated in the circumstances. But if one thing rather than another prevented effective action being taken, I would say it was the obvious hesitation on the part of the French Government.  The British Government had every reason, both from the point of view of their own immediate private interests and any wider interests they might have at heart, to try and preserve the League. I do not think that anybody can say that they reasonably failed to take any action they could have taken, unless there are people who would say that, notwithstanding the immediate threat of war, they should have gone on in the direction in which they were going; that they should have taken the measures which I indicated yesterday, that they should have applied the oil sanctions and, in addition to that, if they were in earnest, that they should have seen that ships of war would not be allowed to pass through an area which they were able to command.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The President will remember that Mr. Eden did indicate the willingness of the British Government to join in oil sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact, however, is that a nation which was prepared to face war intimidated the nations who shirked the possibility of war.  That is the position, and that will always be the position.  You will have to face the possibility of war to end war.  We have had one already, and people might naturally ask themselves: &ldquo;Will another war end war?&rdquo; Possibly, it will be said in future, if a new European war should break out, that <Col N="2791" /> it would have been far better to have that war on the question of maintaining the Covenant of the League than to have war in other circumstances. But, naturally, one wants to keep off an evil, such as war, as long as possible, in the hope that it is not inevitable that it should occur.</P>
      <P>Let those who say that more severe sanctions should have been taken ask themselves: were they prepared for the alternative of war?  If they were not prepared, then let them not blame those who were stopped by precisely these considerations, and, as far as I know, no other.  Is it reasonable to hope that in any short time we will be able to get the whole world, and, mind you, that is what is aimed at, the whole world with all its diversity of interests, into a league to obey a common law, and to pledge themselves that if any one should break that law all will join together in preventing it from having its way?</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, our own position. Suppose that Britain was deemed an aggressor.  As a member of the League of Nations it would be our duty not to give Britain any of the things that were forbidden: any of the things that help her.  I imagine, for instance, that one of the things that would be of greatest use to Britain under such circumstances would be our agricultural produce.  Are our people prepared to enter into a league which would commit them to that in time of war, if Britain should be declared an aggressor, they are not to have any trade with Britain?  I want to bring this home, not because it is a likely thing but because it illustrates the position of certain small nations in Europe.  There are small nations in Europe that are economically tied up with their neighbours almost as much as we are with Britain.  Will you get the peoples of these small nations to refuse to give to their neighbours the things that they have to sell if their economic life is to continue?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's speech yesterday was not much of a blessing, whether in disguise or otherwise. <Col N="2792" /> The position, therefore, is this: that if we were going to have an effective League of Nations we would have to have people in every country who would be prepared to do things such as I have indicated should be done in our case.  Are the people prepared for it?  Can they do it?  Are they prepared to impose upon themselves conditions which would bring about on the civil community the hardships which they most dread in war?  Are they prepared for that?  Suppose that Britain, because we would not give to them our beef or our agricultural produce, chose to regard that as an act of aggression.  They would, of course, say, as other countries in similar circumstances say, that they were wrongly adjudged an aggressor; that they had nothing but the best motives in whatever act they committed&mdash;that it was for the benefit&mdash; I do not want to take a real example &mdash;of the people of Mars whom they wanted to civilise and so on.  By propaganda and so on their people would have been got to feel like that. They would say we were taking sides unjustly against them, and if they felt strong enough to put themselves in the position in which they could take the produce that they wanted they would do it.  Therefore, we would have all the suffering that would be caused by refusing to sell that which we could not dispose of.  If we did not sell our cattle we would simply have to destroy them.  If we are not prepared to do that, and are not prepared to take the further step, namely, the risk of the possibility of military attack upon us, in the case of Great Britain, let us remember that there are other States in precisely the same or in a somewhat analogous position with regard to other countries, and that they, by taking these sanctions in the Covenant, would be risking the same dangers.  Let us realise then that the taking of these sanctions and these commitments involve very real sacrifices.  I do not think that we are prepared to make these sacrifices for a thing that appears distant and indefinite.  We see immediately the sacrifices that are to be made.  The advantages seem dim and distant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the big Powers know that they <Col N="2793" /> will have to bear the brunt in the main of any military action that is to be taken as a result of sanctions, and they naturally are slow to move.  It is only the countries that have felt immediately what war means to them, and that feel themselves in immediate and pressing danger, that are prepared to enter into covenants with obligations stern and severe such as Deputies would like to have in the League of Nations as reconstituted.  I think that you will not make much progress along that road, and I think the best line to take is not to think of a world League of Nations in that sense.  I believe that some form of organisation such as exists at present should be there.  I do not think it would be merely a debating society at all, but I think that you must move along other lines than these if you are going to get general co-operation.  Europe is the danger, and if you could get something like a Commonwealth of Europe&mdash;and, mind you, a Commonwealth of Europe is not nearly as difficult a thing as this League of Nations that Deputies speak about&mdash;I think it would be much better.</P>
    <P>When I heard some Deputy speak yesterday&mdash;at the moment I cannot recall his name&mdash;he immediately reminded me of the position of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Do Deputies think that that could hold together for any length of time if there was to be some law imposed by, say, a central group by a majority or other vote upon all the others?  If, for instance, there was some central organisation, something that appeared to be a form of government in which each of the States, irrespective of its own immediate interests, was supposed to fall in with the view of the majority, I am perfectly certain it would not last for any length of time.  The British Commonwealth of Nations, so far as it is successful, is being worked on quite a different system.  It is being worked on the idea that the States in it will realise that they have certain interests in common: that they are to meet to discuss these interests, and if they agree, and only in so far as each State agrees, that it will carry out any general plan that is accepted. <Col N="2794" /> But that is voluntary co-operation without any set law to govern it.  If the States in Europe that have suffered by war, and that were in danger of suffering by war, could form some central council in which the statesmen of the different countries would meet in order to consider their common problems and get a solution of them in that direction, it would be very much better, in my opinion, than proceeding along the line of increasing their commitments in regard to the sanctions of the League.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see anything scrapped except the machinery which has been proved to be useless, the machinery that is worse than useless, that is, in my opinion, positively dangerous. Whatever commitments are entered into, they must be explicit and they must be such as will give confidence by people being able to satisfy themselves that the obligations will be honestly carried out.  You have jockeying, obvious jockeying, in a case like that where action would mean military action.  There would be no rush for the front-line trenches, I can tell you. Each State would be trying to put the other State into the position of having to bear the main brunt in the belief that it would be weakened, and particularly if there was any rivalry between States otherwise, one would be trying to put the other into that position in the belief that that State which went in and bore the brunt of it would be weakened and those States that kept longest back would be strongest when the contest was over.  It is considerations of that kind that have led me to the view that, if we are going to advance along the line of securing peace, we will have to go in the direction that I have indicated rather than in the direction of increasing sanctions. I do not want to say that I have a closed mind on this matter.  It does not, as it happens, come up for immediate decision.  In regard to things that come up for immediate decision, I think I have indicated our attitude.</P>
    <P>With regard to the League of Nations, I can only say that the League, as it is at present constituted, with its Articles, has not fulfilled expectations. Take Article X as an example. Under Article X you are supposed <Col N="2795" /> to maintain the integrity of existing boundaries.  We objected to Article X at the very start, because we said it was going to guarantee boundaries that were not just boundaries and we did not want to see nations committed to the maintenance of these unjust boundaries.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Esmonde, I think it was, referred to the action which I personally took in the United States in 1919.  I think there is a good deal of misunderstanding about the position that I took at that time, and it might be no harm to refer to it now.  I went over from this country as an interested third party to ask the United States that if they were entering the League they would not commit themselves to maintaining the existing British Empire. We had declared our independence, and we wanted to have our independence recognised.  We wanted that fact, as an important fact in the situation as it affected us, clearly brought before the American people, and we asked the American people that, in any adhesion they might give to the Covenant, they would make such reservations as would make it clear that that did not imply guaranteeing to Britain the possession of this island as a matter of right.</P>
    <P>That compelled me to speak occasionally of the League of Nations.  I did not have the impertinence in the United States to try to dictate to the American people what line they should take.  My view was that Article X was going to possess a certain influence. I realised that America was not a likely centre of conflict.  I do not think that on any occasion I expressed my opinion in public but my view was that when Europe had settled its own differences and had brought about there something like a United States of Europe, then without danger the United States might come along as another group of States and try to secure universal peace.  I saw that the United States was not likely to be involved in war, and I thought that there, at any rate, was a large and important portion of the earth free from conflict, and why should it introduce conflict and the horrors of war there by joining itself up to a disturbed <Col N="2796" /> centre?  That was my view then, and I do not know that my view has changed in that respect very much since.  As regards Article X, unless you can say that the boundaries are just, you cannot get a common consent in maintaining these boundaries. Article XVI, with its indefinite obligations, is also an Article which could not stand, and the changing of that Article, in my opinion, cannot take place in the direction that Deputies on the other benches have indicated, namely, that of more intense sanctions.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can add very much to what I said yesterday on this whole matter.  If it were simply a question of desire, of willingness to work, there would be little difficulty. I do not believe I am a cynic; neither am I a pessimist, and so far as I have anything to do with inspiring the action of the Government in any question touching the League of Nations, it will be in the direction of trying to improve the conditions so that we will not have these recurring wars, and that some system by which peace might be maintained could be evolved.  That is naturally the direction I would like to work in, but I think that in doing that one had better take full account of all the facts; not to take account of them is to court disaster and disillusionment. That is what has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>Look at all the big things that the League of Nations tried to do and failed to do.  I am not saying that the League of Nations did not perform useful service&mdash;let nobody get that from what I have said.  But as regards the big things that the League tried to do, it failed in all of them.  They did not want Japan to enter China, to interfere with Chinese territory.  They failed in that.  They failed also in regard to a similar dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia.  They have failed in the case of Ethiopia and, if we take the other cases that did not involve immediate war, there was, for example, the Disarmament Conference and also the Economic Conference. These have failed and the result is that the League of Nations as it stands will not get the public opinion <Col N="2797" /> behind it which is absolutely necessary for its success.</P>
    <P>Let us then try to do something which will get public opinion behind it.  So far as the Government are concerned, at any rate, we shall do everything we, as a small nation, can do.  We have a certain amount of moral weight, perhaps, and that will be exercised to the full in so far as it is possible.  Any influence that we have here or elsewhere will be exercised to the full to try to bring about an arrangement by which these disputes, which inevitably arise between nations, as they arise between people living in a community, may be peacefully settled by methods of arbitration, and that the ultimate thing on which all will depend, public opinion, may be properly educated along those lines.  That is the line we shall take, and I do not think that, in the long run, if we did have that committee that was referred to by Deputy Costello yesterday, there would be very much difference of opinion between the members of that committee on the line that should be taken if we had all the facts equally before us.  It is because each one of us does not give the same amount of attention to the matter&mdash;it is not our business to do so&mdash;to enable us to see it as a whole, that we very often differ.</P>
    <P>The matter of defence, of course, is one of very serious moment to us. Deputy McGilligan said that the Volunteers are no defence.  Small nations realise that they would not be able successfully to resist a great power which had made up its mind to conquer them by its military forces. They know that, but they do not at the same time want to make themselves defenceless.  Very often a small force can hamper an invader so much that valuable time is gained.  On one occasion I remember saying that a man, if you are defenceless, may rob you for sixpence.  If you have only a blackthorn it may take more than sixpence to induce him to interfere with you.  If you are still more strongly armed he will hesitate still more.  We have to take the reasonable view that the more we are able to defend ourselves, the less is the probability of attack.  At least <Col N="2798" /> it will make an intending attacker hesitate more.  He will have to have very much better reason for attacking you if you are able to defend yourself than if you are completely defenceless.  That is all that can be said for any of the small nations looking after their defences.  I have also indicated what, in my opinion, is the attitude of our people generally in this matter.  We do not want to be dragged into imperialist wars because we have no imperialist ambitions.  I said yesterday that if we were a neutral State, and if we were attacked, other States would have an interest in seeing that the attack was not successful.  My thoughts were not confined to Great Britain alone.  We are in a very important position in the Atlantic, and I can easily see that it would be of interest to more countries than Great Britain that an enemy of those countries should not attack the position of our country or use it for military purposes.</P>

I think that people on the opposite benches, including Deputy Anthony himself, are much more anxious than I am to bring up all those things when they think there is political advantage to be gained.  I have had to spend too much time looking for to-morrow to spend very much time about the past. Suppose we only say there is only one State which would have that interest&mdash; I do not think it would be confined to one&mdash;but suppose there is only the one which Deputies on the opposite benches seem to suggest I am relying on.  I am relying on it only as a factor in a situation which I see clearly.  If we were independent, and if we were fighting to maintain that independence against another power, Britain would be as anxious&mdash;not in our interests but in her own&mdash;to see that we maintained it.  Therefore, I say that that being so, as far as any help we were likely to get from Britain was concerned that help would be forthcoming at least as readily if we were an independent nation as it would be if we were held completely by Britain.</P>

      <P>Let us come to that. Suppose we had our independence here, with a possible war threatening on the continent, in which it was not unlikely that attempts might be made to utilise some of our territory as a base.  What would we do?  Is it not obvious that, in dealing with any defence programme&mdash;I am assuming now that we have friendly relations with Britain&mdash; one of the first things we would do would be to get in contact with them, to see how far the assistance which <Col N="2800" /> they would give in their own interests could be best worked in with us, so that the defences would be planned as a whole to meet with such a contingency? Is there anybody so foolish as to think, for one moment, that that would not be done?  Of course, it would be done, and the line in which we would build up our defences would be a line which would take cognisance of that as an ultimate situation. Could that be done now?  It could not. That could not be done at present, but it could be done under the circumstances I have indicated&mdash;if this country were a free country&mdash;and it would be done, I am perfectly certain, by any Government which was in a position of responsibility for the defences of the country.  You would have, therefore, a planned system&mdash;a system that would be planned by each nation in its own interests&mdash;but it would be planned in co-operation, in order that in the eventualities I have indicated the total forces would be available for the common defence.  So far as we were concerned, and so far as they were concerned it would be a question of common defence.  No Government here at the moment can adequately plan defences for this country.  In fact, a large section of our people would be careless about the matter. Their attitude would be that which was indicated by Father O'Flanagan in his speech in 1917, or about that period, when somebody was accusing us of being pro-German.  He said that if a mouse is being worried by a cat, and a dog comes along, the mouse is likely to be pro-dog for the time being at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the situation, and it is only when a people are independent that they have any reason to co-operate with others for the maintenance of their independence.  If they have not independence, however, they are sometimes inclined, wisely or unwisely, to think that a change of masters would be no harm&mdash;that that was not the worst thing they could see out of the situation.  Naturally, what they would try to do would be to try to use the situation as best they could to get rid of any master, and that would naturally be the line of the majority of our people in any such situation as I have <Col N="2801" /> indicated so long as there is any interference whatever with the right to independence of our people here.  The situation here, the fundamental thing from the point of view of defence, is to try to get our people here and the people across the water to realise that they have certain common interests and that these common interests can be best served by each nation allowing the other nation to go its own way in peace and, when co-operation is in question, that each should admit the rights of the other and that they should sit down and see how best they could co-operate. That is what I, at any rate, have been working for as long as I can remember.  It is the line I have taken since I have come into office.  We have taken the same line, and any contacts that there have been with the British Government have been contacts with that aim in view.</P>
    <P>There is available here a vast deal of goodwill which can be immediately released if the action which Britain has been taking up against us in the past were changed.  I think the people in this country are as ready to bury the hatchet as the people in any country are ready to bury it.  It is a misrepresentation of the people, as it was of me, to say, as Deputy Anthony said, that we are always thinking of the past&mdash;going back to Cromwell and all the rest of it.  That is simply the propaganda of those who try to excuse themselves from dealing with the actual problems which are there.  We have shown goodwill, but that goodwill has not been reciprocated to any extent, and, if it is not, then, as far as I can see, the relations between the peoples of these two countries are going to continue in the future as they have been more or less in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I should like the Minister to deal with in connection with this Vote.  It is a matter in which hundreds, if not thousands, of young men throughout the country are interested.  I want a clear statement from the Minister as to the position regarding recruiting for the Gárda Síochána: whether it is closed absolutely, whether it is open, or whether only men with special qualifications for the Gárda are considered <Col N="2803" /> or are being admitted?  There are, as I say, hundreds, if not thousands, of young men throughout the country interested in this matter, and great numbers of them were called up some few years ago and were examined with a view to their suitability for the force, and their names were put on the list.  Many of them have now gone beyond the age limit fixed for admission to the Gárda, and I take it that, notwithstanding the fact that they passed the examination and were found to be suitable, the fact that they have now gone beyond the maximum age, as a result of not being called up, will debar them from being called to the force.  I think, and I am sure most Deputies in the House will agree with me, that it would be very desirable to have a clear statement from the Minister as to the position, because many of us, I think, if not all of us, get many requests regarding admission to the Gárda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is another matter that, I think, more properly arises on this Vote, and on which I should like a clear statement, because whatever the facts may be there is a feeling through the country amongst great numbers of people that certain members of the force have been victimised because they took certain action to enforce the law, or because they did not take action which, in the opinion of certain of their superiors, they should have taken.  Perhaps that is not the correct way to put it&mdash;perhaps it would be better to say that they were victimised because they were not taking aggressive action, rather than the ordinary necessary police action in certain directions.  As I say, I should like to have a clear statement from the Minister on that, because certain cases have been brought to my notice that were, to say the least of it, very suspicious; where certain members of the force were removed or transferred to the most backward stations in the country in a particular set of circumstances that, as I say, were suspicious, to say the least of it.  Of course, we know that transfers will take place and must take place from time to time, and we know that the most backward parts <Col N="2804" /> of the country require to be policed and must be policed, just as much as the most central parts of the country. However, I bring this matter up here because, as I say, there is that feeling down through the country, and I even think there is that feeling in the force itself, and it is a feeling that should not be there.  I think the Minister will agree that, if that feeling exists, it ought to be removed, and removed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>These are the only two points I wish to raise on this Vote.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will deal with them and make it perfectly clear to every member of the force in this country that if he does his duty as he is supposed to do he need have no fear of being victimised in any way.</P>

      <P>It always affords me pleasure to say a word on this Vote in praise of the Gárda Síochána as a a whole, and it was, I think, the view of all sides in this House up to very recently that the Gárda Síochána as a police force compared very favourably with police forces in every country in the world.  This House should be jealous to preserve that situation and to permit nothing to occur which would justify adverse criticism.  But we have got to realise one fact, that about three years ago there was a general drive for recruits under the patronage of the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Oscar Traynor, and there is no doubt whatever that in the course of the mass recruiting that went on a number of very bad hats got into the Guards, some of whom have been since disposed of under the glaring light of publicity.  While public confidence was substantially restored in the Gárda Síochána as a whole by these cases, still damage was done to the prestige and the reputation of the force by the number of persons of that character who had been allowed to wear its uniform or to appear in public as plain-clothes members of the force. I want to know if the Minister is satisfied in his mind that all the rubbish that got into the Gárda Síochána at that time has been now effectively put out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of taste between the Minister and myself.  I fail to find any term too strong to describe the conduct of persons who were attracted to the Gárda Síochána, and who were then guilty of assaults with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and indeed assaults with intent to murder, while wearing the uniform of the Guards.  The Minister knows as well as I do, that at least one member of the force recruited under his auspices had to be dealt with in court on a charge of the utmost possible gravity, and was very properly and promptly dismissed from the force; that other members to whom were <Col N="2806" /> delegated special duties used language in public of a grossly disrespectful character, and even of a grossly offensive character to the ears of anyone, and that these persons were dismissed with ignominy from the force.  I want an assurance now that the Minister for Justice has disposed of all such elements, for the introduction of which into the Gárda Síochána he was responsible.  There are many occasions on which it is the duty of the Opposition to exercise forbearance, and deliberately to avoid raising certain issues if they are satisfied that the Government are dealing with them, or that would be embarrassing if pushed too rapidly along the road of reform. I do not expect the Government to admit that they have received from the Opposition considerable forbearance in matters of this kind or that the Opposition has not gone out of its way to upbraid it in the past while dealing with evils for which the Government itself was responsible, but I think a time does come when the Opposition is entitled to ask the Minister for Justice: can you now report to this House that every undesirable character whom you introduced into the force has been got out of it?</P>

I want the further assurance that if some narrow-minded and corrupt supporter, either while a member of this House or of a Fianna Fáil Cumann, has pursued a member of the Garda Siochána with slander or lies, the Minister for Justice will now take his courage in his hands and denounce the slanderer and vindicate the Guard.  I think that time has come.  There are Deputies sitting not one hundred miles away from where Deputy Brady is sitting who did their best to drive out of the ranks of the Gárda Síochána good officers who were doing their duty and I think in the early stages of the Fianna Fáil Government there was an inclination to succumb to conduct of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had members of the Gárda Síochána shifted all over the country.  That has stopped.  Why? The Minister for Justice has come to realise that the slanderers and those who libelled officers of the Gárda Síochána were doing it out of malice, and that 90 per cent. of the complaints had no substance, beyond a desire to vent private spite against particular officers.  That evil, I am happy to say, is virtually ended, and, as far as it is ended, I pay a tribute to the Minister for Justice, who I recognise had to deal with a difficult situation and to meet pressure brought to bear upon him by political supporters down the country.  He is now, I believe, facing that kind of pressure, and insisting that every allegation made against a member of the Gárda Síochána shall be signed and proved by the person who makes it, before he moves to punish a Guard against whom an allegation is brought.  That is happily something which belongs to the past and it would be better for all if Deputy Brady did not choose to dig it up.</P>
      <P>The other matter is one that does not belong to the remote past.  Of the new Guards who were introduced, some have proved worthy of the position to which they were appointed, and have become loyal members of the Guards as well as reflecting credit on the force.  I want, however, to get, as I am entitled to get, an assurance that the remaining candidates have been thoroughly tested, the wheat from the chaff or rubbish, whichever way the Minister wishes to describe it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kehoe has spent most of his time looking up at the strangers in the gallery and he might spend the remaining time gazing up there.  I want to say something about the Irish-speaking Guards. I recognise that one of the most valuable contributions to the language movement is that being made by the Irish-speaking Guards, because that <Col N="2808" /> contribution is largely made in the Gaeltacht.  We are, in so far as we are stationing Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht, making it possible for the people there to do their daily business in the vernacular, and we are making a contribution to the maintenance of the living language in these parts where it is alive.  I do not want to compare that very constructive and useful work with the fatuities of the Minister for Education for it might lead me beyond the bounds of relevance&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A most unusual thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But I want to make this suggestion to the Minister that he, being a Dublin man himself, will recognise readily that for a young and active member of the Gárda to be taken away from the larger centres of population, and stationed in the more remote stations which are ordinarily in the Gaeltacht may be a very material penalty.  In summer, it has its compensation, but, in winter, it must be almost unmitigated gloom for somebody who is not accustomed to the living conditions of the Gaeltacht areas.  Is he satisfied that there are monetary inducements adequate to counter-balance the amenity disadvantages which are inflicted on those members of the Gárda Síochána required to do Irish-speaking duty in the Gaeltacht?  I do not believe in coddling anybody, but when I want a job done I want to do it in such a way that it will succeed, and if the vast majority of the Gárda, who are sent to the Gaeltacht because they are Irish speaking, feel that it is an imposition upon them, and that, in fact, to be Irish speaking brings upon them material disadvantages, I am afraid we cannot expect the spirit in that section of the force that we want if the work is to be properly done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all agreed that the Gárda Síochana barracks should be comfortable and healthy, no matter where they are situated.  I want to make a suggestion that if we take from the Gárda the pleasant social surroundings of the suburbs of the city, or a large country town, and transfer him to the Gaeltacht, we should try to do <Col N="2809" /> something to make the Gárda barrack to which he is transferred a little more cheerful than it otherwise would be, and I want to do that, not because I want to weaken the proper and desirable discipline and rigour that ought to be found in the barrack of a uniformed force.  Therefore, some of the suggestions I make will at first sound a little incongruous, but when we think back to the prime motive we have in mind the incongruity will disappear. I should like to see these places equipped, perhaps, with wireless, and I should like to see the Commissioner examining the question as to whether special library facilities might not be made available by the county library, acting in co-operation with the Carnegie Trust.  I should like the Chief Commissioner to examine every device which would make the Gárda barrack in the Gaeltacht area a happier place for the Gárda to live in and, not only that, but to develop into a place where the young fellows of the district would be encouraged to congregate and spend the evening.</P>
    <P>Now, I fully recognise that that second suggestion would be extremely difficult to reconcile with the proper discipline of a Gárda barrack, but I think we might try to develop the barrack into something a little more than a police station and to bring home to the minds of the people in the Gaeltacht, as I think we ought to do to the minds of the people all over the country, that the Gárda, in addition to being the vindicators of the law and defenders of order, are also the friends of the people, and that they are there to help and advise, and to give any assistance they can within reason.  One of the great difficulties in every country area is to occupy the young people in the evenings.  My experience of the Gárda Síochána is that they are respectable, clean-minded, decent young men, and if you could get the young fellows of the district&mdash;I say nothing of the girls at this juncture&mdash;who would otherwise be rambling the roads, or perhaps gathering in public-houses, gathering around the Gárda barrack, they would be assured of decent company and you could be satisfied that decent conduct <Col N="2810" /> would be enforced, not by superiors or people standing <i>in loco parentis,</i> but by the comrades they have themselves chosen.</P>
    <P>If you want decent standards enforced amongst young people, you have to realise that you cannot be chasing round after them all the time, and telling them they cannot do this and they cannot do that.  What you have to do is to get their own comrades and the people of their own age setting a standard of conduct and remonstrating with them if conduct of an undesirable kind is developing.  In the Gárda Síochána, I think, we have that type of person, and I should like to gather the young people around them so that the good influence would permeate the ideas of these young people.  In addition, it would have this great advantage, that where you have a body of young Gárda setting a high standard of conduct in a Gaeltacht parish, they would also set a strict standard, being members of an Irish-speaking division in that they would use the Irish language as their vernacular at all times.  You would have that poisonous element, which is doing more to kill the language than anything else, the desire to speak English in order to appear grand in the Gaeltacht, effectively rebutted by that group of fellows, who stand highest in the public esteem of their neighbours, scorning to speak English and preferring to use Irish as their vernacular in the Gaeltacht and encouraging the young fellows associated with them to recognise that it was something somewhat contemptible, when you had the language and when all your friends and associates spoke it freely, deliberately to turn your back on it and speak an English patois, when you had at your command an Irish of Shakespearian purity, if one might use that term.  I feel that valuable work for the language can be done, and, at the same time, substantial justice to the members of the Gárda can be done. Last, but not least, a useful social service can be provided in the rural areas which will do a great deal to solve the problem of profitably occupying the leisure hours of the young people in those parts of rural Ireland to which I refer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2811" /> Now, I want to say a word about the experts who have been produced by the police.  I strongly urge on the Minister for Justice that this is not a matter about which we need get cross, and that if it has appeared that something has emerged in the course of the debate which would justify indignation, in so far as it has so seemed to the Minister, it has been a misunderstanding.</P>

If he does, I want him to examine it calmly and let us dispose of it between ourselves, because the experts whose services are availed of by the Attorney-General are not a matter for the Fine Gael Party or the Fianna Fáil Party. They are a matter for the State as a whole.  I have read a careful and copious note that has been taken of Deputy McGilligan's speech.  The Official Reports are not yet available and so I have been obliged to rely on an exhaustive note.  From that, it appears abundantly clear that Deputy McGilligan said what this Party actually desire, and that was, that, so far as the pathological and medical evidence produced on behalf of the State is concerned, it leaves nothing to be desired.</P>

I have been for a long period one of the Whips of the Government, and, in that capacity, my job was to save Parliamentary time. <Col N="2812" /> I have that in my bones now and I am disgusted if Deputy Dillon is to be allowed to reopen a matter that was thrashed out very fully on the Minister's Vote.

I pass to the case of one particular witness, a witness who was produced from the ranks of the Gárda Síochána on the question of ballistics.  We have made our position clear, Sir, that we regard the ordinary expert who has been produced by the State for several years &mdash;Commandant Stapleton&mdash;to give evidence on ballistics, as a person who has given abundant proof in the courts of being a highly skilled and experienced man.  We do not contend that any expert can be infallible.  We do not set a standard of infallibility as being an essential desideratum for an expert witness, but we do say that when the State undertakes to produce evidence in that regard, the State has a heavy obligation to be peculiarly scrupulous because if the Gárda Síochána, or the Attorney-General, puts a person in the box as an expert witness.  Although attempts may be made to discredit his skill by cross-examination, the fact that the Gárda stand over him in itself carries heavy weight with a jury or whatever tribunal he appears before.</P>

My respectful submission, therefore, to the Chair is that where the conduct of any person, whether a uniformed member of the Garda or not, is called in question, the proper means of raising that is to raise it here and to ask the Minister for Justice how he defends the attempt of that person who is a member of the Gárda and whose weekly pay is charged upon this Vote?

If there is, how many members of the Gárda are in the school of ballistics? At the conclusion of six months instruction in the school of ballistics would a member of the Gárda be qualified to appear in public and set up to be able to give expert evidence on the subject of ballistics?  Does the Minister, in his view, think that a student of the school of ballistics for which he is responsible is competent to give evidence on ballistics after six months' training?  Will the Minister call that particular member and the head of the school of ballistics before him and question them as to the propriety of a person with six months' training in the school of ballistics holding himself out as an expert on ballistic questions?  Will he do that and direct their attention to the fact and ask their comments on the statement made by a recognised authority on ballistics in this country that no one who has not from five to six years' experience in ballistics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reputation of the Gárda Síochána is very high.  If he were to send a member of the Gárda to Chili or Peru and say that this man has completed a course in ballistics and is a man fit to give evidence on the subject, any court would listen to him with respect, but you cannot turn out an expert after six months' training.  An admitted expert in ballistics has stated that you cannot turn out in less than five or six years an expert on ballistics.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances someone asks me to ask the Minister for Justice a question upon the matter and I reply &ldquo;Certainly I will ask him, but then someone else comes along and says you should not ask the Minister for Justice, you should ask the question on the Estimate for the Gárda Síochána.</P>

I believe there is a school of ballistics and I desire to know upon what terms students are admitted.  I demand to know the requirements demanded by the head of the school from students before they receive his certificate that they are experts qualified to give evidence in a court of law.  I suggest that the course in the school of ballistics ought not to be less than five or six years and that the stipulation should be that a considerable portion of that course should be devoted to practical work and not strictly confined to the theoretical study of other people's experiments. I want to make it quite clear that I consider it to be the duty of the Chief Commissioner of the Civic Guards to refuse to allow any member of the Gárda Siochána to appear in any court of law at the request of anybody.</P>

The Attorney-General may be free to describe the individual whom <Col N="2820" /> he calls in any way he likes.  I believe the duty of the State is to see that substantial justice is done to the person in the dock.  If the Chief Commissioner is of opinion that the Attorney-General or anybody else has called from the depot a man who, he knows, from his knowledge of the school of ballistics or any other department, is incompetent for the purpose for which he is called, my respectful submission is that it is the duty of the Minister for Justice and the Chief Commissioner to communicate promptly with the defence and tell them that the person the Attorney-General has called out of the uniformed force is not a competent person and that cross-examination of him should be conducted along certain lines in order to avoid the deception of the court by the evidence put forward.</P>

Having made clear our views on the question of expert evidence, I want to address the attention of the Minister to a matter in regard to the Civic Guard barracks in the Gaeltacht. I outlined a general scheme whereunder they might be made centres for young people to gather around in given circumstances.  May I suggest an added and valuable amenity with a view to promoting the other purposes to which I referred.  I suggest that a ball alley should be built as part of the Gárda Síochána premises in the Gaeltacht districts where Irish-speaking Guards are stationed.  Along those lines, I think, valuable work could be done from the point of view of the language, from the point of view of the district and from the point of view of the force itself.  As there seems to be a great deal of money knocking about now for public works of one kind or another, I think some of it might be very profitably used for the purpose of improving the amenities available at Gárda barracks in the Gaeltacht. In addition to doing useful work, the wage content of the project to be carried out would be very high and would make a contribution to the social problems of the areas concerned.</P>

I stand here for the elimination of undesirables, if there are any there.  What happened on the occasion to which I have referred? We had six signed statements by witnesses and by the persons aggrieved. I read some of these in this House. I shall only refer to one of them now and that from memory.  This statement set out that in Longford on that particular evening a public meeting was held between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock.  At 10 o'clock that night, a certain superintendent of the Guards came out of a hotel, walked down to where four people were standing, raised his stick and struck one of them in the chest, telling them to &ldquo;get out of that.&rdquo;  Two of them wheeled to the right and two of them wheeled to the left.</P>
      <P>The superintendent, according to my information, pursued two of the men down the main street and 40 yards down raised his stick and gave one man three unmerciful strokes.  He was knocked down and had to be carried to a neighbouring house and attended by priest and doctor.  It was not for some hours afterwards that he could be removed home.  That account is either true or not true.  I asked the Minister for Justice in this House for a public, sworn inquiry. The reply I got was that disciplinary measures were being taken.  The people of my county are not satisfied with the position.  This superintendent is either guilty or not guilty.  If he is not guilty, I shall be the first to go to him and apologise.  I should be very sorry if any wrong were done him. If he is guilty, I maintain that he is not worthy of retention in the force. If that is the kind of rubbish referred to by Deputy Dillon, I am with him but, if it is not, I am against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2823" /> Deputy Dillon suggested that Gárda stations should be made celidih houses for the districts in which they are situate.  That is the very thing to which I object.  That was the position during the Cumann na nGaedheal days and it was even worse after hours. That has been eliminated and I hope that we will not see it revived.  We do not want to see the barracks converted into club houses or places for secret societies.  I believe the people, as a whole, are entitled to have confidence in the Guards and, for that reason, I do not want to see these club houses started again.  I know the Guards cannot please everybody.  So far as I can observe there is, at the moment, a genuine effort by the Guards to carry out their police duties.  No matter how the work is done, it will not please everybody.  I think, however, that grave injustice is done by people of the mentality of Deputy Dillon who let it go broadcast that there is rubbish in the Guards. He went so far as to say that the rubbish got in lately.  If there is rubbish in the Guards from the time of the previous Government or during our time, I shall be glad to see it eliminated.  I want to see the Guards a force to which all the people can look with confidence and with respect.</P>

      <P Just="Center">Gárda Síochána Vote, 1936-37.</P>
      <P>This Estimate shows a decrease of £14,349 below the amount provided for this Service for last year.  The gross total of the expenditure subheads is £4,734 less than the total for the previous year while the estimated amount of the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote shows an increase of £9,615.</P>
      <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Pay: This sub-head shows a decrease of £17,534.  The explanation for this decrease lies in the fact that last year it was necessary to make provision for 53 weeks' pay for Sergeants and Guards stationed outside the Dublin Metropolitan area as 53 weekly &ldquo;pay-days&rdquo; for these men fell within the financial year.  This year it is necessary to provide for only 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>Recruiting was suspended during last year with the result that on the 31st March, 1936, the total strength of the force had fallen to 7,364&mdash; i.e., 147 below the total number provided.  It is hoped that, with a continuance of the improved conditions throughout the country, it will not be found necessary to reopen recruiting this year in which event a more substantial saving will be effected on this sub-head than that provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head B&mdash;Allowances: This sub-head shows an increase of £10,298 of which £5,665 is attri- <Col N="2825" /> butable to rent allowance and £3,565 to Gaeltacht allowance.</P>
    <P>The increase in the amount of rent allowance is a consequence of the gradual increase in the number of married men to whom the allowance is payable.  During the year 1935, 306 sergeants and Guards were married and the actual expenditure under this heading during the last financial year exceeded the amount provided by about £2,000.  At present about 80 per cent. of the sergeants and 59 per cent. of the Guards are married.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht allowance is at the rate of 7½ per cent. of the member's pay and is paid to members stationed in certain districts where Irish is used by the Gárda as the normal medium of official conversation and correspondence.  The Gárda Gaeltacht districts scheme was first adopted in the West Galway division in the summer of 1934.  Last October it was brought into operation in three districts in County Donegal and two in County Kerry. The increase in the amount of the allowance provided for is due to this extension of the scheme.  The total number of members serving in the districts referred to is 373.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C&mdash;Subsistence Allowance: The increase under this sub-head is due to the inclusion of provision to meet anticipated expenditure in connection with a series of instructional courses on technical police subjects which it is intended to hold at headquarters during the year.</P>
    <P>I gave a detailed account of this on the Minister's Vote.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Locomotion Expenses: The increase of £1,000 in the provision to meet transfer expenses is due not to any anticipated increase in the number of transfers, but to the fact that there has been a gradual increase in the number of married members, and the expenses of transfer of married members are, of course, considerably higher than those of single members.  The number of permanent transfers effected last year was substantially less than <Col N="2826" /> during the previous year, and it is hoped that a further reduction in these numbers will be possible during the current year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E&mdash;Clothing and Equipment: The provision necessary under this sub-head varies considerably from year to year as the quantities of various articles which are due for issue, in accordance with the authorised scales, vary substantially each year.  (Each article of uniform issued to members has a prescribed period of wear).  The other sub-heads of the Vote call for no special observations.</P>
    <P>The increase in the amount of the Appropriations-in-Aid is due to the inclusion of an anticipated receipt of £9,500 from the Road Fund under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  This amount has been determined by the Minister for Finance in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three features of this Estimate which stand out prominently in contrast with the Estimates of the previous year. I think I made out exactly the difference between this Estimate and that of five years ago.  The last time that I did make that calculation I found that the Minister is spending £250,000 more on the Gárda Síochána than was spent five years ago.  For some years previous to 1931-32 very many criticisms had been passed by the then Opposition, the present Government, about the extravagance in connection with the Gárda Síochána.  We were told about the enormous expenditure there then was on the Gárda and we were told how that could be reduced and would be reduced as soon as the Fianna Fáil Party come into power. But their conduct in connection with this Vote is on a par with their conduct in connection with every other Department of Government.  There has been extravagance, greatly increased expenditure, less results, less efficiency, and there has been very much less public confidence in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is struck by the difference between this Vote and the Vote for last year.  The net total is lower than <Col N="2827" /> that of last year by £14,349.  We have the fact that there were fifty-three weeks budgeted for in last year's Estimate as against fifty-two weeks in this year's Estimate&mdash;if I have correctly taken the Minister's statement.  In addition there has been brought in to this Vote a sum of £9,500 from the Road Fund this year.  If there is one thing more than another on which this Ministry has declared war, it is on the Road Fund.  On the very first year of its existence, the Government reduced the tax upon buses thus reducing by £23,000 the amount going into the Road Fund and knocking off 230 men from permanent occupation on the roads for the whole year.  Now again, in order to show a reduction on this Vote, 100 men are going this year to be taken off employment on the roads.  In addition in the Finance Bill other concessions are to be made in respect of the construction of lorries also resulting in an attack on the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>While we are led to believe by the pronouncement made by the Ministers and the Members of the Party opposite, that they are the poor man's friend, the poor man's Government.  I know of no Government, not even the British Government who have made such devastating war upon the people's employment as this Government have made.  The taking of £9,500 from the Road Fund is a glaring example of their want of consideration for the men who are employed on the roads. And this is done at a time when anyone who has any experience of the roads of the country knows quite well that that service will not bear that reduction. I would be glad if the Minister would give us what are his own definite instructions to the Gárda Síochána in connection with what it called third-degree methods.  Perhaps it would be better if the Minister would give me his attention on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that, when he was in office, he occasionally consulted officials, too, and he might not have made that remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is too important <Col N="2828" /> a matter to warrant any diverting of attention.  I was asking the Minister an important question which the Minister ought to have as much interest in as I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The real question at issue in this case and in all these cases is: is this a State institution or is it a mere appanage of the Party in power?  I do not subscribe to the idea that it should be the appanage of the Party in power.  It is a State institution and should be regarded as such.  It should have the respect and confidence, and ought to command the respect and confidence, of every section of the community.  I ask the Minister if any instructions have been issued to the Guards in connection with third-degree methods. Has the Minister set his face against them, and have the higher officers of the Guards been instructed not to allow, under any consideration, third-degree methods to be practised?  It is a fair question, and I think the Minister cannot quarrel with it.  It gives him an opportunity, at any rate, here in this Parliament of letting it be known to the country what the Ministerial view is.</P>
      <P>The other question I should like to direct attention to is this, whether he knows it or not, that public confidence has been shaken in the administration of the Guards during the last few years&mdash;very seriously shaken.  There is a very widespread conviction throughout the country that the activities of the Guards are restricted by political representations; that prosecutions on the part of the Guards of certain persons can be deflected by political influence.  If the Minister is unaware of these rumours, I hope he will take the opportunity of assuring the House that that particular species of activity has not got any support from him.  But the Minister cannot be unaware of the fact that there is a widespread conviction throughout the country that that is so.  I hope he will take occasion on this Vote to give expression to the Ministerial view on the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently, on the occasion of a rather serious outrage, when one would <Col N="2829" /> have expected that the high officers of the Guards would have been in attendance, they were in various parts of the country.  One was engaged in an athletic competition of some sort or other.  That sort of thing does not tend to public confidence.  When and if a crisis of any sort occurs, it is the duty of the responsible officers of the Guards to be in their offices, or to be doing their duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>At least one hour of Parliamentary time would have been saved to-day if some arrangement had been come to by which we could have considered the two Votes, namely, the Vote for the Department of Justice and the Vote for the Gárda Síochána, at the same time, and we would have obviated all the finicky points of order raised during the speech of Deputy Dillon.  I would suggest to the bigger Parties in the House that, in future, they might come to some arrangement by which we could discuss these two Votes together.</P>
      <P>When a crime has been committed in any country and the criminals get away unpunished, usually the police force is blamed.  That occurs even in our own country.  If, at any time, particularly if the crime is of a political character, notwithstanding the efforts of the police, criminals get away with it, the first persons to be blamed are the Gárda Síochána. Nobody takes into consideration the fact that, because of the lack of morale and of a responsible public spirit in our country to-day, these criminals, these murderers and these assassins, have got away with it.  The fact that four murders of a political character, and of a most brutal nature, have taken place since this Estimate was last considered, without the culprits being brought to justice, is a very poor commentary indeed on our civilisation, not to talk about our civic spirit.  These dreadful occurrences in a Catholic and Christian nation undoubtedly give evidence of a lack of public spirit and a lack of civic spirit and, I regret to say, a lack of the co-ordination and co-operation that we should expect, and have every right to expect, from our people who profess Christianity and Catholicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2830" /> These occurrences are manifestations of a very widespread and well-organised conspiracy in this country which no Government can afford to ignore.  Before the present Government took office the country was enjoying a measure of ordered and settled Government.  We had a police force second to none in the world who were able by the ordinary methods of law, supplemented by some special legislation, to check crime and to arrest criminals.  Honest and law-abiding citizens were beginning to feel a sense of security.  In the streets, in the highways, and in the homes there was security for life and limb.  The reign of the terrorists was almost at an end &mdash;I might say at an end.  But when the change of Government took place mark what occurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt, but I think this should have been brought up on the Minister's Vote. With all respect to the Deputy, I think he ought to have referred to this matter on the Minister's Vote and that only matters of detail should be discussed on this Vote.  That is the settled practice.  I do not think it is the proper procedure to bring up a matter like this on a Vote which has never been used for the purpose.</P>

      <P>This is the Vote for the Gárda Síochána and if the Gárda Síochána have nothing to do with crime, are not there to detect crime, I want to know where I am.  I want to refer to what happened when a change of Government took place. New heart and life was given to these people whom I mentioned a moment ago.  Fianna Fáil and their Labour allies have a very big responsibility for the present condition of affairs in this country.  The gesture of the Minister for Defence in opening the prison gates, by the way, was not taken as a gesture of good-will, but was interpreted as an indication of weakness.</P>

The Minister is responsible for the administration of the Gárda Síochána and what is open for discussion now is the <Col N="2831" /> administration of the past 12 months. I allowed Deputy Anthony to make some general remarks hoping that he would have come to the details of administration by now, but he is proceeding in a general way to deal with matters that transpired two or three years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>And we cannot bring back to life the persons who were murdered and assassinated.  Reference was made to-day by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies to the fact that several active and efficient policemen were removed from populous areas to remote districts because of their activity in detecting political crime.  In Cork, some of the most effective crime detectors, men who were able to bring criminals to boot in many cases within 24 or 48 hours of the occurrence of a crime, were transferred, immediately this Government took office or a year or two subsequent to its taking office, to remote areas.  That is not the way to encourage an efficient police officer or a detective to do his duty.  The consequence, at any rate, is that to-day owing to the activities of members of the Fianna Fáil Party, Guards whom they regarded as objectionable have been transferred.</P>
      <P>That, I am certain, is not going to have the effect which I am sure the acting Minister would desire on the morale and discipline of the Gárda Síochána.  It is a state of affairs that is not conducive to good government in this or any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this small country the horrible occurrences to which I have referred took place within a couple of weeks of each other, and, notwithstanding the condemnation of them by the heads of the Churches and by various public <Col N="2832" /> bodies, the criminals concerned are still at large.  I want to say again that the Gárda Síochána were not responsible for not being able to capture these criminals.  The people themselves are in a large measure responsible. Unless and until the acting Minister for Justice and the Government create a better public spirit by being quite serious in the matter of apprehending criminals, then the state of affairs that prevails, which is a disgrace to any civilised country, will continue.  Having watched the activities of the Gárda Síochána since their establishment, it appears to me that we have now drifted into this position that our Government prefer to placate the armed bully rather than protect the unarmed citizen. Unless the Minister and his Government are prepared to face up to their responsibilities, this country will drift and drift because of the operations of people outside this House&mdash;parenthetically I may say that I was very glad to hear the declaration which the acting Minister made the other day when referring to those people&mdash;into a state of government by gangsters for gangsters. I would ask the Minister if he has any influence in the Cabinet not to give any encouragement to the advice received from some members of his own Party because of the activities of a Guard in any constituency in apprehending, arresting or questioning members of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Minister should not hearken to advice to remove a Guard, against whom a complaint is made in such circumstances, from his station.</P>
    <P>That is a scandal that has occurred in the City of Cork, and I need hardly remind the Minister that even in Dublin Inspector O'Connell was removed because it was thought that he had certain political leanings.  I do not know that he had.  It was said that he had.  These are concrete cases of the details of which the Minister must be aware.  The Government were responsible for establishing a new force which came to be known as the flying squad.  I have always thought it advisable not to refer to this force as the Broy Harriers, but as a special branch of the Government forces because as a Government force I think it should <Col N="2833" /> be respected, and should not have any peculiar appellations or nicknames given to it.  I believe that such a thing reflects, in the end, on the country as a whole.  But, as I have said, the Government established a special branch of detectives known as the flying squad.  Its special work was to help in the collection of the land annuities or to make distraints on the stock and property of farmers who were unable to pay their land annuities.  Why should not the Government now establish a specially trained squad&mdash;men trained in criminology&mdash;whose special work would be to hunt down criminals, murderers and assassins and to suppress societies which have for their aim and object the assassination of their political opponents, societies composed of people whose object is to overthrow this State.  Not alone are these people in antagonism to the members of the Opposition here but they are in antagonism to the Minister and his Party.  I welcome the statement made by the Minister the other day that he is out to deal with those people outside the House in possession of firearms without the authority of the State.  I would again ask the Minister to pay less attention to the representations made to him by some members of his own Party, back benchers particularly, in regard to certain members of the Gárda Síochána.  It appears now that unless the Guards, to use a colloquialism, play up to certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party their jobs are no longer secure.  If the Minister would make it quite clear that the state of affairs which I have just described is going to be cleared up and cleaned up, he would at least be doing something to make this country a little bit more attractive than it is at the moment, not only for outsiders, but for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see developing in this country a situation in which people will go in fear of the gangster and the gun, but I am afraid it is fast developing into that, and in my view the Minister and his Party have displayed a certain amount of weakness in dealing with that particular class of crime.  If it did not get open <Col N="2834" /> encouragement it certainly did not get much condemnation from the members of the Government Party who speak now with their tongues in their cheeks about the preservation of peace and in their condemnation of murders and assassinations.  I would like to see a little more practical sympathy displayed in that connection.  I do hope that the Minister will have regard to what I said earlier about the effective crime detector who, because he arrests or apprehends some sympathiser with the Fianna Fáil Party, is transferred from a populous area to some remote district in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by the Deputy has no foundation whatever. The Guards need no assurance from me that, if they do their duty properly, their jobs are safe.  I defy Deputy Anthony or anybody else to say that since we came into power Guards have been victimised, penalised or punished because they did their duty.  If Guards have to be punished, there is machinery set up for dealing with them.  That machinery was set up by the Commissioner under the last Government and is still in operation. Under it disciplinary courts are held and if, following an investigation, they are found to have been guilty of some offence, they are dealt with under the regulations.  Deputy Anthony referred to the recent removal of the chief superintendent in Cork.  I want to tell him right away that that is not a matter for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did not refer to the chief superintendent in Cork nor did I say anything to mislead the Minister.  I referred to the removal of Superintendent O'Connell in Dublin.  I also referred to cases in Cork in which Guards were, if I may so put it, unfrocked.  They were taken from the detective division and put into uniform.  Members of the detective branch in Cork were transferred from the city to remote areas because of their activities in discovering political crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2835" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy referred to that case and I merely wanted to assure him and to assure the Guards that that was done by the person on whom responsibility for right conduct amongst the Guards devolves, and that is the Commissioner.  I hold that the Commissioner is responsible for the conduct of the Guards, to see that their work is done right.  He uses his discretion as to what officer is removed in any district.  I do not interfere with him in any way.  He uses his discretion as to who will or will not be in uniform.  If it will be any comfort to Deputy Anthony or any other Deputy or the people in the country to learn it, there is a special squad dealing with these people outside. I can give that assurance now. They have been in operation and will continue to be in operation until we run these people to earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go back on what should have been dealt with on another Vote, but as the practice has been departed from I will take this opportunity of referring to certain things.  Now that Deputy Cosgrave is in the House, I will ask him sincerely to do with that section of the community, for whom he should have responsibility, what we are trying to do with other sections in the country, and that is to induce those people who were definitely convicted for using arms&mdash;for instance, those who used rifles in the attack on Kildorrery barracks&mdash;to give those arms up.  I would ask him to make that gesture now and endeavour to get those people to hand up their arms.  I do not know to what extent the organisation outside, the League of Youth, or whatever it is called at this moment, possesses arms, but it is well known that they have some arms and I would like to have the position made clear, so far as the Opposition are concerned, that they will, to the best of their ability, endeavour to have those arms collected. I am prepared to admit that they may not be able to do it, any more than we are able to do it in the case of certain people, people that we were at one time associated with.  I admit there may be difficulty in getting <Col N="2836" /> some people to hand up their arms.  I would like Deputy Cosgrave, if not here, somewhere else, to make an appeal to those people in whom he may have an interest, who have used arms and who have been convicted for using arms, to surrender them.</P>
    <P>I am not taking up this attitude in any carping spirit.  I am genuinely asking him to co-operate with us in this matter.  Since we became the Government we have done everything we could do to collect arms.  We have never hesitated in going after arms when we got to know where they were. We have never raided indiscriminately or endeavoured to make trouble by carrying out fruitless searches.  Wherever we knew there were arms we collected them and we gave every protection to people whose lives might have been endangered because they helped us to collect arms.  If people's sense of civic spirit is not sufficiently strong to assist us voluntarily in this matter, we are prepared to reward them for anything they do in helping us to get arms.  Further than that it is not possible, I think, for us to go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave compared the expenditure on this Department in 1931 with the expenditure in the present year, and he said there was a difference of £222,000.  He took up the style of criticism that we adopted against his Administration.  We were always saying that there was too much money being expended.  I quite admit we took up that attitude.  I will, however, say this, that if Deputy Cosgrave's Party had pursued the constitutional line when they went out of office the necessity for that increase would never have arisen.  I am not prepared to say offhand how many people associated with the Deputy's Party were put on trial for crimes which amounted to acts of war against the State.</P>

      <P>No person with whom I have any influence, or over whom I have any control has ever done anything unconstitutional.  That is point number one.  Secondly, I was not six months in office before Ministers of the present Government were making speeches threatening to have me arrested.  Have they any sense of <Col N="2837" /> responsibility?  Apparently they have never had.  Even the Chief of the Executive on one occasion said he could not make people popular.  Is not that a nice confession of failure?  Let me say that I do not ask for any popularity from any of the Deputies over there, or from the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave complained about the cost of the administration of the Guards this year as compared with the time when he was in office, and I am telling him what the reason is.  I know that Deputy Cosgrave himself did not go out wearing a blue shirt; I know he did not cut trees, block roads or interfere with trains.  But supporters of his Party did.  In fact, the person whom he practically gave the leadership of the organisation over to, encouraged those operations and took part in them&mdash;that is, the ex-Commissioner of the Gárda. There were at least 600 of these people connected with the Party opposite. Some of them were sentenced, and when they were being released receptions were held for them, and amongst the speakers at these receptions were leading members of the Opposition in this House.  They spoke at meetings when certain people came out of jail. Approximately 425 were sentenced by the Tribunal set up by the Party opposite for offences which actually were acts of war.  About 275 of the other Party which we are now going to break up were sentenced.  Deputy Dillon need not laugh at that remark, because this is a very serious matter.  I am explaining why this Government has had to spend so much more money on the Gárda Síochána than was spent in 1931-32.  Naturally, I took the opportunity when Deputy Cosgrave put his foot in it&mdash;walked into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The police force is not an appanage of the Party in power, so far as I know. There were some references by Deputy Dillon to mass recruiting.  I do not know what he means by that, but I will give him some figures, and then he can judge for himself whether there has been mass recruiting.  I will ask the Deputy to remember that when we took over office there were 6,000 or 7,000 men in the police force, recruited by another Government.  I am not going <Col N="2838" /> to charge that Administration with putting anybody into the Guards who was not entitled to be there.  That would not be fair.  We found that the men in the Guards were very efficient and very good men, and I am not going to be tempted to say anything else about any individual.  I am not going to say what Deputy Dillon said, that there are rubbish remaining there since the last Government's time.  I object to calling any human being rubbish or chaff.  I can tell Deputy Dillon this: that during the last Government's time&mdash;and I am not going to blame them for it&mdash;men had to be put out of the Guards from time to time because they were not found suitable. And because they were not found suitable as Guards it did not follow they were rubbish.  Since we started recruiting we found a small percentage unsuitable as Guards, and they were removed.  I do not see what grounds Deputy Dillon has for talking of the rubbish that Deputy Oscar Traynor put into the Guards, having regard to the fact that in every police force in the world unsuitable men will inevitably be found, and they have to be removed.</P>
    <P>Since the 1st January, 1932, the total number of recruits taken on was 587. That covers a period of four years and I think it will be considered a rather small proportion in a total force of 7,300.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon I think will have to admit that that is not a very high proportion.  During that period there was a wastage of about 350, so there is a net figure of 237 men.  That extra number has been able to practically finish a war here, and there is another one to take on now.</P>

      <P>I am not going to take it for granted that the Guards go out of their way to use them.  I do not think they do.  There may be&mdash;and I am prepared to say there possibly are &mdash;cases in which members of the Guards exceed their instructions, but, if they have done it in a way which brings them under disciplinary action, they will be dealt with.  They certainly have not been encouraged at any time to be anything but fair in their treatment of prisoners.  On the contrary, they have been discouraged. I would not stand for anything else. I have been a prisoner myself on several occasions, and although I was not badly treated I have seen others badly treated, and I certainly would not stand for it.  I can assure everybody that that is so.  Deputy Cosgrave tried to make a big point about the taking of £9,000 out of the Road Fund. He drew a picture of the resultant unemployment, forgetting, of course, that there was £2,500,000 left out for work of that kind this year.  Under Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act, the police are reimbursed for work they do under that Act.  Therefore, we must take that fact into consideration. That is not making war on the Road Fund at all.</P>

      <P>I am trying to deal with every point made by Deputy Cosgrave. He referred to an important officer who was in some competition.  Those Guards, as far as I know, are senior officers.  They are on duty practically all the time.  They can be taken out of their beds at any time during the night; they must always be available. I imagine that if Jack has to work all the time he will be a dull boy.  If he is not allowed to play sometimes he will be very dull.  Those officers, as far as I know&mdash;I am simply deputising for the Minister&mdash;are very efficient.  In cases which have shocked the country they have done everything which could be deemed possible to do.  As I said in my opening statement on the Vote for the Minister's Department, some people will go into the dock charged with those offences, and it is not right that Deputy Cosgrave should deny a little recreation to people who have such arduous work to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to the Guards playing golf all day and dancing all night if there is no work to be done, but, on an occasion when there is a crisis of any sort, they must be on duty.  That is not unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically every speaker has adopted the method of starting off by telling us &ldquo;I do not mean this to be taken as an attack on the Guards,&rdquo; and then proceeding to attack them in all their moods and tenses in every possible way.  Deputy McGilligan started off on the same line.  I am quite sure that even though I was able to say I had a letter in my hand from the Judge in the Ball case, complimenting the Guards on the excellent way in which they had conducted the case, he was quite capable of getting up and repeating the statement he made about the Guards looking out to sea and getting their photographs taken.  Irresponsible statements like that might be all right coming from people in opposition, as we were a few years ago, without ever having had any experience as Ministers, but there is no excuse at all for such statements being made, without any examination whatever, or evidently any desire to ascertain the facts, by people who held positions as Ministers for years.  If ever the time comes&mdash;and I do not think it will come&mdash;that we should get back into Opposition, I think I can promise that you will find a much higher standard.  However, as I say, I do not think that time will come, or at least not during the time of the people opposite.  I think I have disposed of Deputy Cosgrave's points. If not, he can tell me.</P>

      <P>The Gárda have duties in connection with the present census, and I have heard of one case in which a Guard, acting on instructions, had to call to a house six times.  I think that is unreasonable.  I think that whoever has charge of this census business ought to allow the Guard to leave details of the information he wants at the house, and that he should not be asked to call back to the house so many times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, I would have to make inquiries about <Col N="2844" /> that, as I do not know anything about it.  I can quite understand the Deputy's point and I shall find out what can be done in the matter.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go back to the question of the expert.  I think Deputy Dillon is satisfied and I do not think we ought to go back on it.  I think I dealt with it very effectively.  However, I should like to say that there is not what one would properly call a school of experts.  There is no such thing as a school, but there is this technical bureau, the details of which I gave the House when I was replying on the Minister's Vote.  As Deputies know, there is an expert on ballistics there.  I believe he is an expert, but what constitutes an expert I am not prepared to say.  However, he is recognised as a very efficient person, and it is a matter for the judge to say whether he is an expert or not. He has two regular assistants and he gives them all the training he can. The particular man referred to has had great experience, at least since that time&mdash;I think it was two years ago&mdash;and his evidence on that occasion was corroborated by Commandant Stapleton.  Since that, he has been highly complimented by the judge on the manner in which he gave his evidence.  I am not saying that he is an expert yet, but he was put up by the Attorney-General as a witness, and he gave evidence in certain cases requiring expert knowledge and was so successful in that, and so impressed the judge, that the judge thought it worth while to make a special reference to him in a letter which he wrote after the trial in which he complimented the Guards.  In that letter he made a special reference to this man&mdash;McGrath, I think it was.  That, I think, was the Galway case, and he mentioned a number of cases in which a witness in ballistics was necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell the Deputy that.  I would not take the Department's view on that question <Col N="2845" /> if it were given to me.  I prefer to take my own opinion on a matter of that kind.  I know that there are some people who could learn it in six months and others who could not even learn it in ten years.  That is my opinion.  It may be the Department's opinion that a man can be trained in such a subject in a particular time, but it is not my opinion. Deputy Dillon must know himself of cases where one man might be able to learn a subject in a very short time and of other cases where you could not knock it into another man's head in years.  That is a thing on which we can only have an opinion.  The judge and the jury must have formed an opinion, but we could not lay down a dogmatic view on the point.  As I say, the Department may have its view, but I hold myself free to decide whether a man is an expert or not or whether his evidence is worth relying on or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, then.  I shall read the statement, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this Estimate provision is made for the staffing and upkeep of the prisons under the control of the Department of Justice and for the maintenance of the prisoners detained therein.  These prisons are: Mountjoy (male and female); Portlaoighise (male convicts); Cork; Limerick; Sligo; the minor prisons at Waterford and Galway.  Provision is also made for certain expenditure which is a statutory charge on the Vote, such as the cost of escort and conveyance of prisoners and the cost of maintenance of Criminal Lunatics detained in District Mental Hospitals. Provision is made for an estimated daily average of 615 prisoners&mdash;including Borstal Inmates &mdash;as compared with 625 provided last year.  The daily average number of prisoners for the year 1935 was 617 as compared with 632 for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In sub-head A&mdash;Pay and Allowance of Staff&mdash;there is an increase of £1,486 which is almost entirely due to an estimated increase of £1,188 in the Cost-of-living bonus and to a new provision of £225 required to meet the employers' contributions under the Widow's and Orphans' Pension Act.  There is no material alteration <Col N="2848" /> in the staff provided for.  The only other sub-head which calls for special observation is sub-head G&mdash;costs of escort and conveyance of prisoners. This estimate was prepared some months ago and the increased amount provided for was estimated on the basis of the actual expenditure under this heading for the previous year which exceeded the provision made therefor in the previous estimates. The figures now available show, however, that the expenditure under this heading has been falling during the past six months, as a consequence of the improved conditions in the country, and it is anticipated that with a continuance of this improvement the greater portion of the increased provision of £1,000 will not be required.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A new sub-head H.1. provides £200 for the purpose of having electric light installed in the Prison Cottages at Mountjoy.  There are no material variations in the other sub-heads.  As the Deputies are aware, an annual report on prisons, including various statistical tables, is published by the Department and copies are laid before this House.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately this branch of the administration is one which does not get must attention, as people do not take much interest in it, but I wish to ask the Minister what his views are on the desirability of instituting a Borstal Institution for women.  No doubt the Minister is aware that the Minister for Education set up a Commission, presided over by Mr. Cussen, the Senior Justice, to inquire into the general question of reformatories and industrial schools, and at one time there was a suggestion that that Commission might go further afield and examine the Borstal question as well.  I do not know whether that Commission has reported but up to a month ago the Minister for Education had not received the report.  The present situation is that if a girl is arrested and convicted on evidence given before a court of summary jurisdiction, the court frequently finds itself in this difficulty, that it must either send her to prison or release her <Col N="2849" /> unconditionally.  A girl can be asked before the court decides whether she will be sentenced to imprisonment, if she will undertake to go to a certain home if the Probation of Offenders Act is applied.  Even if she goes to such a home, and gets the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, she can immediately afterwards break the undertaking and leave the home.  The circumstances surrounding these cases are not present to the mind of most people who have not addressed themselves to an investigation of the general conditions governing prison requirements in connection with courts of summary jurisdiction.  I am assured by responsible justices that if these girls were taken away from their home surroundings, and placed in the care of prudent people they would get out of the trouble into which they had got and be put back on the right road, and very often after a period of three or four years careful training, could make a decent livelihood, whereas if sent to prison they would be irreparably destroyed.  In the alternative if mercy is shown and a girl is released, she may drift to the streets or fall into the hands of people who are her enemies. While the court missionary is there it is not always possible to deal with people of 17, 18 or 19 years of age effectively through the machinery of the court missionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first glance one is reluctant to advocate the establishment of borstals, because they are associated in the mind of the public with all sorts of unpleasant things, but the alternative, in many cases, is jail, when we begin to envisage borstals on their merits. The only place that a borstal has been established for women is in Great Britain where I am informed it has been an unqualified success.  The whole object of that institution has been the reform, education, and training of the inmates.  Naturally discipline in a borstal is stricter than in an industrial school or a reformatory, because the persons who go there are between 17, 18, or 19 years of age, and are usually much more difficult persons to deal with than children who are incorrigible and are sent to industrial schools and reformatories.  It is a mistake <Col N="2850" /> to think that a borstal is a punitive institution.  Whatever punitive element it may have, its application to women is almost exclusively one of reform, and, as far as reports of the system in Great Britain show, it has been beneficial.  Two or three books have been written on the subject and have, I am sure, been brought under the notice of the Minister.  The acting Minister may not have perused them, but the results have been beneficial and of great assistance in the administration of law.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister whether he could see his way to make a borstal experiment for girls in this country. Naturally, it would cost money, but when it is a choice of sending girls to jail or reforming them, by putting them on the right road again, we should not hesitate to spend whatever money may be necessary to achieve that purpose. I have no doubt once the Government made up its mind that such a borstal was necessary they would not hesitate to come to the House for the money.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister how he feels about the borstal institution for youths.  We had two reformatories but the difficulty is that reformatories are part of the Vote of the Minister for Education.  I want to submit now that one of two things should be done, either reformatories should be taken under the Department of Justice or the borstal institution put under the Department of Education. In my opinion the reformatories ought to be done away with and we ought to have a system of schools for convicted persons, in which event I think they ought to be administered by the Department of Education.  It is a wholly evil system to have divided authority, as we have in respect to reformatories, and further to divide the system of places of detention for young persons makes it extremely difficult to view the whole problem as it ought to be viewed.  Frequently you find a young person convicted in a court of summary jurisdiction, and it is a question for the justice to say whether that young person is to be sent to a reformatory or to an industrial school.  It is very hard to examine the problem as it ought to be examined <Col N="2851" /> with such division of responsibility. We have only one borstal for boys and I should like to hear from the Minister his views as to the success which has attended that institution up to the present. I want to submit that his problem of borstal administration is one of great difficulty and would take all the precautions which devolve upon a Government to take and be no easy task.</P>
    <P>I feel that in a country like this where 90 per cent. of the population is Catholic, we ought to consider seriously placing the borstal institution here in charge of a religious order, which deliberately consecrated itself to the mission of reforming youth.  There is an order in the Catholic Church founded by Dom Bosco, the Salesians, whose sole vocation in life is looking after that type of persons who ordinarily find their way to a borstal home. Nevertheless, we are bound to recognise that in a borstal or institution of that kind we must provide for our fellow countrymen who do not share our faith.  That could be overcome by appointing chaplains from other denominations in institutions of the kind.  I am not sure if that would meet the situation.  If not, I recognise that the Minister will have special difficulties to overcome, because it would be no remedy for non-Catholic boys because they would be so few that that would be impossible to administer. He might also have one boy in a non-Catholic establishment.</P>
    <P>I would like to see one or two Borstal institutions opened in this country, run by the Salesian Fathers, with a purely reformatory purpose and designed to enforce within them the discipline of a strict school, with the object of turning out, at the end of the period of confinement, tradesmen trained in whatever trade they might take up.  If that is going to be done, we are up against an extraordinary difficulty which, so far as I am aware, perplexes reformatory administration both here and in Great Britain.  If a youth, who would ordinarily be going to serve his apprenticeship, gets himself <Col N="2852" /> into trouble, is sent into one of these establishments and has to spend three or four years there, the object is to teach him a trade by which he can earn his living, when the period is finished; but if you teach him a trade, when he comes out the trade unions will not let him work.  The trade unions have a case.  They say that there are enough people in the trade already and so forth&mdash;all the stock arguments&mdash;but the fact remains that the State finds itself confronted with the problem of a young person who is in danger of becoming an habitual criminal.  They reform him, give him a trade, and when he comes out he is in a difficulty.  Now, I see the problem, but what I would like the Minister to do is to ask the trade unionists to meet him, discuss that problem with them and ask them have they any suggestion to make whereby he would be facilitated in turning out these young people, at the end of their period of reform, equipped to earn their livelihood in some other capacity than as a common labourer, because trade unionists, social workers and the Government will all agree that the greatest social problem we have is the unskilled labourer who is so desperately vulnerable in any trade depression that may come upon the country.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which, as I say, comparatively few people take very much interest, because it is not a subject that comes under their attention at very frequent intervals, but, nevertheless it is one, to my mind, of enormous importance.  I should like to say a word in connection with the treatment of young persons in the Children's Court.  Would that more appropriately arise on the Courts Estimate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of Borstal and industrial schools is closely connected with the Children's Court. Admittedly, we are going to have a report from this commission, but I do not know whether they propose to deal with the Children's Court or not.  I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  In practice, what happens is that the children who are brought before the Children's Court are the children of the poor, and it would be an illusion to imagine that the Guards are continually going round seeking a chance to bring them before the court.  That is not so.  If they bring them before the Children's Court for a misdemeanour, they do it because they make up their minds that, having rebuked and advised and cautioned until they are sick doing it, the child is continuing to do something contrary to the law and is a danger to himself and his neighbours; that some step must be taken to stop him, and that the parents apparently will not try.  They bring the child before the court and, very frequently, what happens is that the parents appear and are admonished from the Bench and give a solemn undertaking to look after the child more closely.  That is the end of it and the child goes off. Sometimes, the Guards are obliged to say: &ldquo;The conditions of this child are unsatisfactory, and we feel that nothing can be done until the child is taken out of its parents' care and properly looked after.&rdquo;  In any case, what happens is that a small child is brought forward for rebuke, punishment or final settlement in life in one way or another; and I think that where you have a small child it is highly undesirable to introduce him, at that impressionable age, to the atmosphere of the police court, and that the procedure proper and necessary in the case of an adult person is neither necessary nor desirable when dealing with a child of tender years. Therefore, I would try to eliminate from the proceedings altogether the court atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to examine this problem <Col N="2854" /> there are two great dangers. One is that you get sloppily sentimental and begin to think, &ldquo;The poor little crathur, is it not a terrible tragedy?&rdquo; Of course, these children are not brought before the court before they have given a good deal of trouble and they are not so simple as they look.  On the other hand, you can err on the side of indifference, and say that they are tough youngsters and that it does not knock a feather out of them.  I should like to avoid both those extremes.  We do not want the child unduly frightened.  We want him effectively looked after and properly handled, and I say that to introduce any small child to the atmosphere of the police court is a bad thing.  No decent child or man can relish the prospect of being put in the dock.  I should like the child to be brought before the district justice&mdash;just as one of us might have been brought before the headmaster of whatever school we happened to go to&mdash;and there be questioned as to his conduct, and punished, advised or otherwise disposed of as the district justice shall think fit.  I think it is necessary on general principles to preserve the element of publicity, and, therefore, I think it would be necessary for a representative of the Press to be present.  I think the parents of the child should be present, and the court missionary, because the court missionary plays a great part in the matter of justice in juvenile crime. I should like to see these entire proceedings carried through in the room of the district justice, with the district justice sitting at his desk and all suggestion of judicial proceedings minimised to the utmost possible degree.</P>
    <P>I also think, though I am not so sure of this as I am of the other things, that the Guards ought not to conduct prosecutions of juveniles in uniform, because I want to create in the minds of young people in this country who are growing up the idea that the Guards are their friends; and if you associate in the mind of a seven, eight, or ten-year-old child the uniformed Guard with one of the most alarming and depressing occurrences of his whole career, he will regard the <Col N="2855" /> Guard for evermore as a standing menace.  I may be wrong, but that seems to me to be true and worthy of consideration.  I should like the proceedings to be as informal as possible, so that as little track of fear and apprehension as possible will be left on the mind of the child.</P>
    <P>I am precluded on this Vote from referring to the House of Detention in Summerhill, for the astonishing reason that it is under the control of the Department of Education, but I may refer to it in this way, that I may urge on the Minister for Justice not to send any children there, because, oddly enough, they are in charge of the Minister for Justice until they get to the door, and it is only when they go through the door that they come under the control of the Minister for Education and cease to be in his charge.</P>

      <P>I say it is highly wrong to commit children even on a week's remand and no child is left there for more than a fortnight.  They are always brought up before the court within a fortnight and finally disposed of to an industrial school or reformatary, or sent to their homes.  I say, however, that the place is an entirely unsuitable place to send any child. I want to make it perfectly clear that it is not a place of this Government's construction or which this Government founded.  It was there when the Government came into office, and what I complain of is that it is still there. I say it is a place where the Department of Justice should send no child. I am not suggesting that there is any scandal going on.  I think that with the resources available, it is being as well run as it can be, and the persons in charge of it, a man and his wife, are eminently respectable people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am, but I do not want to suggest there is any scandal going on in the place.  I am merely looking at it from outside this <Col N="2856" /> old Georgian house in Summerhill in the middle of a slum, a slum within which I live myself, so I know all about it.  It is an entirely unsuitable place for small children.  To judge from the windows outside, there is no proper accommodation for adequate segregation.  I submit very strongly to the Minister for Justice that he should absolutely refuse to send any person in his custody there and that he should fix the Department of Education with notice that until they provide a place, which he considers adequate for these children, he will release any child who may be in danger of going there.  I shall not go further except to say that I think there should be a house of remand established by the Minister for Justice.  I want to suggest that that place established as a house of remand should be run by experts so that a child would receive not only some educational attention, even during the short period of remand but that the child would be under the observation of a competent, highly-trained matron and a children's doctor who would be qualified to assist the court by giving an opinion on the child's mental condition, as to whether there was any abnormality or as to whether there was any explanation for anything it had done, through malnutrition or something of that kind.  He would be able to come to the court and give the court information that it could not hope to get in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had a really well-run establishment of that kind, what I should like to stipulate would be that in every case where a child was brought before the courts and the magistrate did not decide the case on that day, he should order the detention of the child for a fortnight or so in that institution so that the child would be closely examined, so that he would get the benefit of the treatment which would be afforded in this establishment, and so that the parents of that child would feel that when the State had accepted the very grave responsibility of removing the child from the family circle, it was removing it to a Government establishment so excellent that the child of the wealthiest and <Col N="2857" /> the most influential parents in this country could go there without any question at all.  If we are going to take a child away from its parents, though the parents be the humblest and the simplest people in the worst slum in the city, I say we have got a very big responsibility for that child.  We have got to provide for the child exactly the same accommodation and the same supervision that we would insist upon for a child of our own.  You may say that the child was taken out of a slum and that it was never used to such a home.  That does not matter; we are depriving that child of the benefit of its domestic circle.  When we deprive it of its domestic surroundings, we have got to give it the very best that the State can provide.  If we are going to take a child out of the family circle we have got to put it into surroundings into which we would have no qualms about sending a child of our own.</P>
    <P>I believe that an institution run on those lines would be of great value and would enormously increase the value of the Children's Courts.  It would greatly mitigate the scrupulousness many of us have when we attend the Children's Court on a Friday morning and witness the painful spectacle of a youngster of nine or ten years of age being torn out of his mother's arms by the police, that child being dragged away perhaps for the first time from its father and mother, who are left in the greatest distress.  When a child like that is put into Summerhill, I must say that I have had the greatest doubt as to the prudence of the course pursued, but if I felt that the child were going to be put into a perfectly-run establishment where, no matter what the facts were, the child would derive some benefit from its sojourn there, then I would have no anxiety on that account. It is never pleasant to see people suffering under the stress of a great grief, but one would feel that one was only being cruel to be kind, and if there was any substance in the people's interest in that child, when they came to understand the nature of the detention, they would not be so grief-stricken. If they were, you could at <Col N="2858" /> least say to them: &ldquo;You can see this child at any reasonable time you wish. If you think he will be unhappy, or that he will be ill-treated, you can call to see him and you will be welcome at any hour.&rdquo;  In that way I think the administration of justice in the Children's Courts would be enormously improved, and any Deputy who interests himself in the matter would have an easier conscience knowing that everything that could reasonably be done for the comfort of the children would be provided.</P>

      <P>In supporting the plea made for a Borstal institution for juvenile offenders by Deputy Dillon&mdash;he has left me only a few minutes to do so&mdash; I would suggest to the Minister that long before the advent of the late Government we had a lady probation officer attached to the old police courts in Cork City.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the reappointment of that lady probation officer.  Deputy Dillon referred to a court missionary, but I think it was the appointment of a lady probation officer he had in mind.</P>

As regards the Borstal institution which he mentioned, the Departmental view is, I think, that such a scheme would not be warranted by the expense.  Personally, I think the money would be well spent, and I am generally in sympathy with the pleas put forward by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Anthony.  As both Deputies are aware, a commission has recently inquired into this matter, and we hope <Col N="2859" /> to get some valuable recommendations from it.  I certainly hope that we shall be able to give effect to these recommendations. Most of the points raised by the Deputy will, no doubt, be dealt with in that report.  Would that satisfy him?</P>
