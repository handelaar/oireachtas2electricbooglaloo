      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can state what is the position now with reference to the proposed building of a county hospital in Longford and if he can state if there is any likelihood that the county might lose the money which was allocated for that purpose, and if he will specially set this sum aside for the County Longford and direct the local authority to proceed with the work.</P>

      <P>The local authority are at present negotiating for the purchase of a site for the hospital by agreement.  If the hospital is built within a reasonable time and if funds are available the usual grant will be given.  It is hardly reasonable to expect that money would be set aside until the project has taken more definite shape and the actual cost is known.  It is not considered desirable to give a direction to the local authority to proceed with the work having regard to the fact that they are experiencing difficulties in their efforts to obtain a suitable site.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary, I wish to ask whether he is aware that there are several other suitable sites available in the immediate vicinity of Longford; that these sites have been inspected by Department officials; that the hospital shortage in Longford is very serious, and does not the Parliamentary <Col N="1774" /> Secretary think that directions should be issued to the local authority to acquire one or other of these sites and proceed with the work?</P>

In the O'Donoghue Estate it is proposed to carry out extensive improvement works consisting of buildings, roads, drainage and fencing, and these works will be undertaken as soon as possible.  The rearrangement of the holdings themselves is not contemplated. In the Drummond Estate a scheme of regulations under Section 21, Irish Land Act, 1903, and Section 42, Land Act, 1923, in respect of turbary situated within the ambit of eight vested holdings at Glencutane Lower, has been formulated and objections thereto have been disposed of.  Owing, however, to the cutting of portion of the turbary intended for allotment, it <Col N="1778" /> has been found necessary to have a re-survey made of the bogs, and the matter is now engaging attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was directing my remarks last night particularly to this fact: that in this important question of industry, its development, and the development of the foundations upon which our present industries and our future industrial development must rest, public confidence is being definitely undermined and, in so far as the public are assisting in the development of Irish industry, they are being misled by the general line of deception practised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government. The Minister intervened in an interruptive kind of way, with considerable energy and in considerable volume, last night, simply to carry out the particular policy of deception about which I was complaining.  In the matter of prices&mdash;I was dealing with the question of cement&mdash;I said that the Minister had informed this House that the import price of cement had gone up by 6/- within the last few months, and <Col N="1779" /> that it was for that reason that purchasers of cement in this country were being charged 6/- more per ton for cement than in November.  The Minister said that he made no such statement and then developed it with the statement of what he tells us are the facts; and these are that the foreign importers of cement increased their price by 2/- a ton, but insisted that the sellers of cement in this country would sell cement at an additional profit to themselves of 4/-.  Now, I want to stigmatise the Minister's intervention in that particular way, and his statement, as a further example of the deception that is being practised on the people of this country.  The Minister made his original statement in regard to this matter on the 21st April, 1936 (column 1143, Vol. 61 of the Official Debates).  The extract from the Parliamentary Reports reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: There has been an increase in the price of cement.  The price of Continental cement has increased by 6/-, but that has got nothing to do with the institution of this licensing system.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;General Mulcahy: Why was that increase charged before it touched the ports?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, that was not exactly the question that was in my mind.  The question in my mind was whether that increase was charged before it touched the ports.  Did the Minister answer that? No.  The Minister continues as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I pointed out, when the Cement Act was under discussion, that this was the only free market for cement in Europe&mdash;the only country in which the various cement-producing countries were in competition, and that, in consequence of that, the price of cement was lower here than it was in any other country in Europe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Subsequently (Col. 1147) I asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Did the Controller of Prices give the reason why imports of non-British went up by 6/- a ton?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I asked that question after the Minister had indicated that the price of cement was under review carefully by the Controller of Prices.  The Minister's answer was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" />&ldquo;The reason was that cement would be supplied only on that understanding.  The three producing countries from which we were getting cement.  Denmark, Germany and Belgium, increased prices by 6/- a ton and supplied importers only on condition that it was sold at the price fixed by them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, last night, denied that he had stated that the reason why cement prices went up by 6/- a ton was that the foreign suppliers of cement increased the price of their cement by 6/- a ton.  Last night, he said that he never said such a thing&mdash; that the import price of cement had gone up by 2/- a ton and that foreign suppliers of cement had insisted upon those handling cement in this country putting another 4/- to that 2/- and pocketing the 4/- themselves.  That statement was made on the 21st of April, and when we turn to the figures for the import of cement just supplied in respect of March, 1935, we find that the average price of cement imported in March, 1935, was 26/10 a ton.  The average import price of cement for the whole year had been 26/4, but the average import price for cement in March, 1936, was 27/5&mdash;an increase, as against March, 1935, of 7d., and an increase against the average price for the whole of 1935 of 1/1; and yet the Minister tells us that 2/- was the increase.  He goes back on his statement made the other day, which he now denies, and suggests that the import price of cement has gone up by 2/- and that foreign suppliers dictated to this country that they would not supply cement at, let us say, the increase of 2/- that the Minister mentioned, except the importers here pocketed an additional 4/-.  Does the Minister resist the charge that he is carrying out a general policy of deception as to what is happening here, and that he is refraining from carrying out such examinations as are in his power to carry out through the Controller of Prices, simply because he does not want to disturb the forces that are at work increasing the prices of commodities to the public generally?</P>
    <P>When we were discussing super-phosphates, <Col N="1781" /> the Minister said that the reason for the fall in the production of super-phosphates here was that there was an increase in the import of super-phosphates.  The Minister subsequently denied that he said such a thing.</P>
    <P>But when dealing with super-phosphates on the 21st April, 1936, as reported in column 1108 of the Official Reports, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition, the actual amount of fertilisers produced by Saorstát factories in 1933 proves nothing in relation to the consumption of fertilisers in 1933, because fertilisers were being imported in increasing quantities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact was that the imports of super-phosphates had declined in the particular period that the Minister was speaking of from about 30,000 to 13,000 tons.  The Minister, in dealing with the further assisting of the superphosphate industry in this country, told us that the reason why production in this country had gone down was because the imports had gone up, at a time when his own statistics showed that the imports had been reduced by half.  The Minister also resists the interpretation of his statement with regard to the Spanish market for eggs &mdash;that it was more important than the British market and offered greater opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted it last night and I shall quote it again.  I quoted it in support of the Minister's contention that he did not explicitly say that.  I said it was implied in his statement, but I said that, as far as his statement was concerned, he did not explicitly say it.  However, the Minister wishes to have it read again. This is what he said on 20th February, 1936, as reported in column 999 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The second point is that the egg market in Spain is a valuable <Col N="1782" /> market which shows very great possibilities for the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 13th February, 1936, as reported in column 667 of the Official Reports, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This agreement with Spain opened up for the egg producers of this country a new and valuable market, a market which in the present circumstances is more valuable than the British market, a market that is likely to be permanent and offers considerable opportunities for expansion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although the Minister said that the market for eggs in Spain was, in present circumstances, more valuable than the British market, I went to the extent of acquitting him of explicitly stating that the Spanish market was more valuable than the British.  But the Minister and his Party, through their newspaper publications dealing with the matter, carry out more explicitly the finally implied suggestion of the Minister, a suggestion intended to persuade the farming community that the Minister was making agreements that were going to provide them, even in time, with markets that would make up for the catastrophe suffered by the farmers in the sale of eggs, because the Government organ on the 13th February, following the Minister's statement and dealing with the discussion which took place on the matter, expressly states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It could not be questioned that the Spanish agreement is one of distinct advantage to the Free State. It provides a new outlet for the egg trade which is more valuable than the British market, and not only that, but it has thrown up a market which promises to be lasting, not like the British which is a declining market because of the policy which confines it as far as possible to British products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister assisted at a conference in Ottawa for the purpose of carrying out the policy outlined in the last sentence there, and the things that are there mentioned as British products include Irish eggs.  The Minister considered that we should have a grievance against somebody, other than <Col N="1783" /> himself and the Ministers who weat with him, for the low price that we got last year for our eggs in the British market as compared with Australian eggs.  We got 5/11 per great hundred and the Australians got something like 11/4.  On the statement of the Minister in this House, the Minister's Party boost the fact that we have established a very valuable market for eggs, a market which is infinitesimal in quantity compared with the market that we have elsewhere at the moment, and even more infinitesimal than the market that we lost, measuring that market by the fall in the income of Irish farmers from it, and also a market with this outstanding characteristic, that we get less in that market for our eggs than the Chinese get in the British market, although we have to send 1/7 or 1/8 after each particular quantity of our eggs there in order to get them into that market. We get 1/10 per great hundred less in the Spanish market for our eggs than the Chinese got in the British market for the whole of last year.</P>
    <P>On these facts taken here and there I base my charge against the Minister, that he is carrying out a policy of nothing but deception.  Irish industrialists and the Irish people cannot afford to be deceived at this stage of our industrial and national progress with regard to vital and fundamental things dealing with the proper utilisation of their resources and of the opportunities for developing those resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister treated us yesterday to another litany of the new factories set up.  I told him yesterday that we want a systematic statement of the classes of factories established, their general location, the number of persons employed in them, and the wages they are paid.  The very fact that they have been established under the present type of circumstances makes it the more necessary that we should know from day to day what type of progress is taking place.</P>
    <P>We discussed brushes the other day, and in this case, with a substantial tariff increased to 50 per cent. by the Minister, he had to announce that the <Col N="1784" /> brush industry was being hit by competition, a type of competition that he indicated in general terms, but not in terms that were capable of persuading the House.  By passing a quota order here he surrounded the brush industry with a quota wall.  The brush industry was an industry that was helped by a tariff under the previous régime, and did develop substantially under the previous régime.  In 1924, when a tariff was first given for the assistance of the brush industry, the full-time equivalent of the employment given in the middle of that year was 120 persons.  By the end of 1931 it was increased to 351.  That was part of a general scheme where, over 19 different industries, carefully thought-out tariffs were applied and in a set of industries where, before they got the benefit of a tariff, 8,148 persons were finding employment&mdash;that is, there was employment for the full-time equivalent of 8,148 persons&mdash;there had been by the 1st September, 1931, an increase in employment by 13,078 persons to 21,226.</P>
    <P>Now, under that arrangement of assistance to industry, it was possible to get and to give every six months the increase in the number of persons employed in these industries.  But we are waiting even now for information as to the number of persons employed in September, 1934, in some of the main branches of industry in the country, and it is an outstanding thing that we are left in this position when one considers the increase in the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the increased expenditure in that connection, and the fact that the Minister wants to stir up enthusiasm for and to give confidence in the development of Irish industry.  The very fact that the foundations upon which Irish industry must rest&mdash;that is, the earnings of our agriculturists&mdash;are being so largely destroyed, with a prospect of continuing thus, is all the more reason why we should know where we are going in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us we have 22 boot industries established, and five more are to be established this year. The fact is that some of these industries are of the get-rich-quick type, indicated by the results we have <Col N="1785" /> recently seen in Kilkenny.  A boot industry there, at a time when our people have less money than ever they had and are spending less money on some of the necessary articles of life, such as boots, shoes and clothing, is able to declare a profit of, I think, 50 per cent&mdash;is able to pay a 25 per cent. dividend to some of its shareholders and put 25 per cent. into reserve.  Are the five new boot factories that are to be established going to do the same thing?  All the circumstances of this country would dictate that people who have money and are able to come in here and reap these quick profits should do it; but it is going, at some later day, when the continuing loss of income of the farmers reduces more and more the capacity of our people to buy the necessaries of life, to leave some of these industries unable to carry on.  It will not matter to the people who have put in their money and got 25 per cent. dividend paid for a few years running, but it will matter to the operatives who have been brought in there and trained, and who look forward to having a settled and continuous existence derived from work in that industry. It will matter to them that the people who have put in their capital have taken their capital out, have simply picked up their tents and walked away, leaving them with or without the machinery, but at any rate without the capacity in the country, even in improved conditions, to support the 27 separate boot industries.</P>
    <P>The deception of the Minister is carried on even by the type of litany that he gave last night and by the statement that five new boot factories are going to be set up.  Why does he deal with the boot industry and tell us the great developments that have taken place and that are going to take place, and not discuss the huge profits that have been shown to be made by some of those in the industries out of the unfortunate people whose income has been steadily reducing?  Only to-day, dealing with the statistics that have been published in respect of trade for March, <Col N="1786" /> the Government organ again continues to carry on the particular type of deception I speak about.  I do not know where it gets the information from, but this passage occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In that case it might have discovered that in 1931 we imported food, drink and tobacco to the value of £17,371,169, and that in 1934, the latest year for which complete detailed figures are available, our imports of these commodities fell to £11,447,593, or very nearly £6,000,000.  It would also have found that as between these two years the imports of bacon alone fell from £1,288,534 worth to £682 worth, and that the imports of wheaten flour fell from £1,662,402 to £281,408 worth.  In short, the gap left by the fall of £6,000,000 was filled by our own producers, who were able to supply our requirements to the extent of that £6,000,000, and had consequently less to export by that amount.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a falling off in the importation of certain agricultural commodities to the extent of £6,000,000, and the Government policy is to tell us that that £6,000,000 becomes £6,000,000 additional income to the farmers of this country.  In so far as everybody knows that industrial prosperity and industrial development must rest on the income of the farmers, it deludes people by a statement like that.</P>
    <P>In March, 1932, a body known as the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association published a series of advertisements indicating how much both the development of industry and of agriculture had been neglected in the past.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of March 5th, 1932, it is indicated:&mdash;&ldquo;We import agricultural products to the value of £16,000,000, all of which could be produced at home,&rdquo; and it provides figures.  These figures were provided in March, 1932, at any rate a month after the total figures in respect of the various items of imports of agricultural produce had been published by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>An examination of these figures shows that they refer in detail to the <Col N="1787" /> year 1929.  A further examination of these figures shows that the imports of live animals, food of animal origin sources, fruit and vegetables, etc., declined from £19,380,000 in 1929 to £13,940,000 in 1931, or, if we include sugar and similar imports, by £5,098,000 in those years.  We are able to state what happened between 1931 and 1935.  Between that period there is a further fall of £7,090,000.  The figure of £5,098,000 referred to was the fall between 1931 and 1934, and by 1935 this had fallen by the additional figure which I have given already.  Will the Minister say that while between the years 1930 and 1931 the imports had fallen by £5,098,000, or by £2,549,000 a year, the farmers in 1929 and 1930 had that additional income per year coming into their pockets under the previous Administration?</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  I do not know how the Minister is going to add, let us say, beef, cattle, imported tomatoes, lettuce, eggs and a number of other things like that.  I am giving the information in terms of the information in which he and his Party argue.  I would like to hear the Minister say what are the quantities of increased production that represent the increase that has taken place first as a result of this £5,098,000 worth of produce that was imported between the years 1931 and 1934.  The Minister will not say that the drop in the import of these articles between 1929 and 1931 of £5,098,000 put every penny of that into the farmers' pockets or into the pockets of the general purchasing community in the State.  He pretends, or he presumes to argue, that the cutting down that has taken place in the import of these items since 1931 has, by his great management and work, brought every halfpenny of that into the farmers' pockets.  But the Minister ought to give up, both here in the House and by his Party and Press in the country, making a systematic attempt to delude the people with regard to the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outstanding thing, so far as the <Col N="1788" /> Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned&mdash;and that is the Department responsible for watching every detail that might injure industry in this country and prejudice its development&mdash;has to say to the people is to try to delude them as to what is happening in regard to general production and, therefore, as to the earning capacity of the people in the country.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the Minister, and I persist in indicating to him, that the fall in the consumption or purchase of boots is very great, because the people have not the money to pay for the boots they want.</P>

      <P>Yes, if you count in the year 1933 the use of 120,000 dozen pairs of boots or shoes, whatever they were, imported at a price, which I have since verified, of 1/6 per pair. I said last night I was not standing on the figure of something like 7d. a pair. The actual price was 1/6 a pair.</P>

      <P>In respect of 1934 the total consumption of boots and shoes was 20,000 dozen more, but among them we imported 80,000 dozen pairs of the import value of 1/6 a pair. That class of boot and shoe, in quantities represented, at any rate, by tens of thousands of dozens, was a class of boot and shoe never bought by the people before.  The Minister has the necessary machinery for verifying whether the increase in the year 1934 of 20,000 dozen additional pairs of boots and shoes, with the 80,000 dozen included in our consumption, denotes a better and a cheaper shoe for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> We had Deputy Moore a short time ago enlightening us upon this matter. I challenged him to pluck up courage in his rambles through his own constituency, when addressing some of the farmers there to ask anyone listening to him who had got a new suit of clothes since Easter, 1935, to put up his hand, and, also, to ask those who had got a new suit since Easter, 1934, to put up their hands, and the Deputy's answer was that he had not got a new suit himself since Easter, 1935.  I have put before the Minister some figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to give them to him now.  I tell him that the purchasing capacity of our people in 1933 is reflected in the fact that they spent £747,192 less on general clothing, exclusive of hosiery; and £294,000 less on hosiery.  When we look at 1934, we find that the people spent £551,311 less on their clothing exclusive of hosiery, and we have not got the hosiery figures yet.  In the same year we see a continuous fall in jams, confectionery and other sugar products and a steady fall in the consumption of soap and candles.  There is a rise in the consumption of furniture and goodness knows that is not to be wondered at considering all the new houses built so plentifully throughout the country and the money spent upon them.</P>

      <P>I have met people who had.  The Minister, if he has any interest in Irish industry, will not so lightly and glibly deal with the signs of the times that are sticking out from his own figures.  We are <Col N="1790" /> not yet in a position to see what the increased wages pool in respect of 1934 amounts to.  The Minister has recently provided us with amended figures in respect of 1933.  Some time in the middle of 1935, we got particulars as to the number of persons employed and the total wages paid in those 26 industries which are dealt with in the census of production for last year.  Those figures showed an increase of less than 2 per cent. in a wages pool of £4,250,000.  The preliminary figures have been amended and that increase becomes about 3 per cent.  The figures with which the Minister now provides us would indicate that, in 1934, there was evidence of an increase of 10 per cent. in the wages pool for 1931.  He has given us information in regard to 21 industries and, in respect of those, there is an increase in the wages pool of £397,000.  However, the industries dealt with in the census of production, though the largest and most important in the country, outside agriculture, cover only a comparatively small fraction of the general wages pool for industries and services throughout the country.  According to the original census of production, the general wages pool, including services, amounted to about £11,000,000.  The Minister is only covering, in his figures, about £4,000,000 of that sum. Take the case of the people who have been put out of business by the Minister's orange quota.  The income lost by the people who were put out of the fruit business as a result of fixing upon one monopolistic channel for the import of oranges would take a substantial slice out of the increase in wages indicated by the 1934 figures, as published up to the present.  The minimum estimable loss in wages of agricultural labourers since 1931 has been put at about £800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>By me, for one, and I invite the Minister to examine the figure and controvert it.  He will not examine it because, if he examined it systematically, it would go above the £1,000,000 mark.  That figure of £800,000 is based upon the figures provided <Col N="1791" /> by the Minister's Department. The Minister has had evidence, not only from Deputies in different parts of the House but from public bodies throughout the country, that the actual wages paid to agricultural labourers is in many cases one-third the figure he fixes.  With a view to informing himself and better informing us about conditions in the country, I invite the Minister to examine the figures he has given us with regard to the fall in wages of agricultural labourers and to give us, with the assistance of the machinery at his disposal, an official estimate.  The Minister told us yesterday that what is wrong with the turf figures for 1934 is that the Civic Guards do not collect them very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, the Minister conveyed the impression that he would not stand over the figure as to the reduction in the amount of turf cut in 1934 as against the amount cut in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the figures should not be taken as representing the actual production in any one year but that they could be used for the purpose of pointing out the trend by comparing the figures of one year with those of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely taking the trend of agricultural wages and I am dealing with the difference in the figures quoted by the Minister for 1931 and 1935 as indicating the fall.  Local bodies, individual Deputies and people throughout the country disagree emphatically with the figures quoted by the Minister and consider that the fall in agricultural labourers' wages has been very much greater than is represented.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They disagreed with the amount of the fall as between 1931 and 1935, as indicated by the Minister's figures.  The Minister should bear in mind that the rise indicated in the wage-pool in respect of these industries in 1934 is less than half the fall in the wages paid to agricultural labourers.  It is remarkable that, for every £4 approximate increase in the wages pool, there has been an increase of £1 in salaries, wages and allowances in the Minister's Department, if you include the Industrial Research Board and the Turf Development Board.  It is, therefore, time that the Minister got down more critically and more honestly to an examination of the general position in the country with a view to seeing that his responsibility for fostering and securing sound development of Irish industry is more effectively carried out.</P>

      <P>I intervene for a moment in this debate to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give sympathetic consideration&mdash;and, as we all hope, a favourable reply&mdash;to the petitions which have already reached him from the most influential and representative bodies in Galway with regard to the threatened taking over by the Great Southern Railways Company of the Galway Omnibus Company's service.  The petitions, emanating from such authoritative sources as the Galway Urban Council, Galway Chamber of Commerce, Galway Harbour Commissioners, as well as one signed extensively by local residents served by the Galway Omnibus Company, will have, by their reasoned statement of a strong case, brought home to the Minister the fact that if he yields to Galway's wishes in this instance he will not be sinning against <Col N="1793" /> any of the principles underlying the Transport Act which he piloted so ably through this House some three years ago.  That Act was designed, as I understood from the discussions in this House, mainly to do two necessary things: to save the railways from imminent destruction and to cut out of our general transport system wasteful and ruinous competition.  If the Minister gives a favourable answer to our petition which has all Galway, not only to the last man but to the last woman, behind it, he will do nothing to defeat his own objectives as envisaged in the Act.  This has been made plain by the petitions, but perhaps the House will understand the position better if I say something of the circumstances in which the Galway Omnibus Company came into existence.  If that company are given a renewal of their licence the Railway Company will suffer no harm, and no one will be the worse, because the omnibus services are strictly defined by local needs and limited by a local boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the outbreak of the Great War, the old horse-tramway which linked Galway with Salthill went out of existence, and for a considerable time Salthill was left without any convenience in the way of cheap transport.  We had nothing but outside cars, and Salthill suffered economic losses.  To remedy that state of affairs a few public-spirited men and women in Galway and Salthill came together and formed a company to provide a convenient bus service. This company, from the beginning and up to the present day, never had as its first aim the securing of dividends for the shareholders, but the convenience of local residents.  It was one of the early examples of self-help of which Mr. Tom Kenny cited many striking instances to the President on the occasion when he presented with characteristic competence and completeness Galway's case for an airport and Transatlantic terminal, and from the day Galway Omnibus Company was started Galway has never looked back.  The company was free to provide a service which would take the most fatherly thought for the convenience of the users.  Galway is a homely city, and everybody knows <Col N="1794" /> everybody else, and so the company knows when we like to have a bus to take us to Mass, to do our shopping, what time we want to go golfing or to the pictures, what time we wish to catch a train, to visit the hospitals or to send children to school.</P>

      <P>The company gives us exactly the service we want.  We are very proud of the Galway Omnibus Company as its service makes life in Galway so delightful that if I were to tell Deputies all about it there would be a rush to Galway next summer.  I should like that to happen, as we would then show them the finest body of drivers and conductors in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I am not speaking on my own authority on this. One of the biggest men in the motor world recently told me that he heard Galway praised at the last Motor Show for having the best maintained service in the Saorstát.  That is largely due to the personality of the drivers and conductors.  The drivers are men of great skill and of high character, and the conductors men of the greatest courtesy and efficiency.  During the rush days of the summer season you will see them leading blind persons, people suffering from rheumatism, or women with babies across the roads at dangerous crossings.  They are good tempered, and their help never fails. The people are under an obligation to them for that courtesy and kindliness which make Galway so delightful. For my own part I am under a deep debt of gratitude to the Galway Omnibus Company and I take this opportunity of acknowledging it.  There is a bus service to bring me from my own gate every Tuesday or Wednesday to ensure that I shall attend this House regularly.  The Minister might bear that in mind.  The employees are practically all recruited from Galway, and that helps to solve a problem that exists in Galway as elsewhere, unemployment. But it also helps in another respect.  As the Minister is aware, Galway was a great coach-building centre until the passing of the old aristocracy, and the days of coaches <Col N="1795" /> and carriages.  The bus-bodies are built in a Galway factory, and the money spent in their maintenance and repair is kept locally.  For these reasons, Galway, for which nothing much has yet been done industrially, has a special interest in keeping under Galway control this little local enterprise, and I hope the Minister, in consideration of its special circumstances, will not insist on the transfer of the licence when it expires next July, but will allow it to be renewed, and help the Galway General Omnibus Company to flourish for many happy years. I have been asked to read in this House a resolution that was passed by Galway Urban Council at a recent meeting, a copy of which was sent to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The attention of the Council has been drawn to the proposal of the Great Southern Railways to apply to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a transfer of the road transport licences of the Galway General Omnibus Company, and we desire to point out to the Minister that this company, formed for the purpose of providing a regular service between Galway and Salthill, is composed of several shareholders resident in Galway and Salthill who have a special interest in maintaining an efficient service, and the management is in the hands of a directorate who are closely in touch with the needs of the Galway urban area, and accordingly better able to judge of the local needs than a board far removed from Galway.  Employment is given locally for the working of the service, the building of the buses, and the maintenance of the plant for the service.  We are of the opinion that the creation of monopolies in transport and other industries is not in the best interests of the country. The transfer of the licences of the company is not for the encouragement of investment in local enterprises if they are to be liable to be taken over for the interests of larger concerns, and we would respectfully ask that no licences should be given to any company to carry on service in the Galway urban district except <Col N="1796" /> to the Galway General Omnibus Company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have, further, a letter from the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Galway to the Secretary of the Great Southern Railways:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council of this Chamber, at their last meeting, had before them a copy of your letter dated the 18th ult. and addressed to Mr. Leech, Secretary of the Galway Omnibus Company.  At this meeting it was unanimously decided to enter a strong protest against the taking over of the omnibus company by your company on the following grounds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The Galway company has not been run as a profit-making concern, but mainly to provide cheap and convenient transport facilities within the city.</P>
    <P>2.  The company understands local conditions and needs, and can serve these better than any outside organisation, however efficient it may be.</P>
    <P>3.  The people, who have 16 years' experience of the Galway company, are satisfied that in the interests of local transport a change is neither desirable nor necessary.</P>
    <P>4.  The Galway company, inasmuch as it only operated within the borough boundary, cannot have any serious effect upon the economics of the national concern.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On previous occasions when this Estimate has been under consideration I have drawn the Minister's attention to the scarcity of employment for young persons, not alone in the City of Dublin, but in practically all the cities and towns in the Free State.  I am sorry to say that the problem becomes more acute as years pass on.  The reason we have been given for the scarcity of employment is that in the past there was a large element of emigration for that class which has since disappeared.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a statement that was recently issued by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Lyons, who said that they were looking forward to resuming immigration.  He also said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" />&ldquo;It is known that negotiations are taking place between the Government of the Commonwealth and the British Government for the provision of necessary assistance for intending immigrants to this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is just a cutting I have before me, and there are other facts in connection with it.  It is sufficient to say that the matter of emigration to Australia in particular, and to a somewhat smaller extent to other countries, is now assuming more attractive proportions for countries like our own, where there is a surplus of this particular kind of labour.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the claims that we have on Australia.  In the most recent figures at my disposal, it is shown that from January to October in the year 1935 the Free State purchased from Australia goods to the value of £820,645 and that Australia purchased during the same period from the Free State goods to the value of £8,262.  We purchased 100 times more from Australia than she purchased from us.  In view of that serious adverse trade balance, I think the Minister can fairly claim that we in the Free State are entitled to a concession from Australia.  That concession, at present at all events, might take the shape of permission to send them some of the surplus labour we have at the moment.  If the Minister could do anything in that direction, I am satisfied that it would relieve an amount of anxiety and responsibility from parents and others interested in these young people.  I am satisfied, from the amount of attention that has been directed to this problem, that it is really one that deserves immediate consideration, and I hope it will get that consideration from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters to which I wish to refer before the Minister replies.  First of all I should like to support the application which Deputy Mrs. Concannon has made with regard to the Galway Omnibus Company.  There is no doubt that the Great Southern Railways Company has already too much of a monopoly in the transport of this country.  Another matter to which I wish to refer has reference to the <Col N="1798" /> increases in freights and fares which the Railways Company has introduced in the last year or so.  There is, I understand, at present before the Railway Tribunal an application by the Great Southern Railways Company with the object of increasing their freights.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he is going to be represented before the Railway Tribunal when that application is being considered.  I understand that the application which is coming before the Railway Tribunal means that freights are going to be increased fully 100 per cent.  I think the Minister ought to be represented at the Tribunal and ought to oppose this application.  It will probably be opposed also by the merchants and traders of the country.  I have a scale of charges before me in respect to merchandise included under classes A, B and C.  For a consignment not exceeding 14 lbs. in weight, the proposed charge for five miles is 9d., for ten miles 11d., and for 100 miles 3/3. You can just imagine a charge of 3/3 for carrying 14 lbs. of merchandise. There is another scale, Scale No. 3, under which it is proposed to charge 1/2 per 14 lbs. for the first five miles. The charge for 100 miles is 4/11.  Just think of it&mdash;4/11 for 100 miles! With regard to horses, cattle and other live stock, I have the scales here, and I note that the company is trying to get permission to enforce a charge of, I think, 29/9 per beast for 100 miles. That is for cattle.  That would mean a waggon rate roughly of £15, practically double what it is at present.  I hope the Minister will take some steps to oppose this application before the Tribunal.  I understand that it will come before the Tribunal early next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also desire to refer to the proposed closing down of the Broadstone Station.  I hope the Minister will do all in his power to induce the company not to proceed with the closing down of that station.  Surely to goodness, when the railway company took over the Broadstone and the branch lines operated by the Midland Great Western Company heretofore, it did not take them over for the purpose of closing them down. I think everybody coming from the <Col N="1799" /> West will agree that to make Westland Row the terminus is not in the best interest of the city.  I hope that the Minister, before he gives permission to the railway company to carry out these proposed changes, will look very carefully into the matter and do something to protect the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>With regard to the closing down of the branch line between Westport and Achill, the railway company closed that line some time ago and then found that the roads were not fit to bear the extra traffic that was thrown on them.  They had to open the line again, and it is understood that they propose to keep it open until the roads are steam-rolled.  I hope the Minister will see that the railway company are compelled to operate that line.  I understand that, when they took it over some years ago, they signed an agreement to the effect that they would run two trains each way per day over it.  I hope the Minister will see that the railway company are made observe the terms of that agreement.  The people in Achill cut and save a considerable amount of turf, and surely the railway company do not expect that the people will be able to take all that turf over the narrow bog roads. The closing down of that line would be a very serious matter for the people of Achill and of the County Mayo generally.  I also protest against the closing down of the other line from Ballina to Killala.  When the Midland Great Western Company handed that line over to the Great Southern they did not do so for the purpose of having it closed down.  I have been told recently that the railway lines which were single-tracked from Athlone to Mullingar are going to be double-tracked again as the railway company find that it is impossible for a single-tracked line to carry all the traffic.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of complaints from persons who have made application for unemployment assistance. They complain of the long delay that takes place in dealing with their applications.  I must say that every time I wrote to the Minister in connection with these complaints, I got a <Col N="1800" /> courteous reply, but at the same time I think something should be done to speed up the work of disposing of the appeals that are pending.  We have heard a great deal from time to time about the cement factories which were going to be established in the Free State.  I hope the Minister will be able to get them established as soon as possible and get cement manufactured in the country.  It was manufactured here before, and under modern conditions there should be no great trouble in starting a cement factory. In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister to look into the matter about the railway company.  I think he should oppose the application for an increase in freights to which I have referred.  I have been told on most reliable authority, by merchants and others, that if the application were acceded to it would mean 100 per cent. increase in freights.  That would be outrageous in view of the fact that the railway company have now a monopoly of both rail and road transport in the country.  All competition has been wiped out and, therefore, I hope the Minister will not allow the company to do what they like.  If they are not prepared to give reasonable treatment to the public, then I suggest to the Minister that he should proceed at once to license new competitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two cases referred to by Deputy Mrs. Concannon and Deputy Nally give one a fair idea of what a monopoly may mean and what, in fact, it does mean.  These cases ought to give the Minister some food for thought.  The Department of Industry and Commerce may claim that its work has been successful in many directions, but in my opinion it has achieved more success in establishing monopolies and rings, which are making profits out of the people, than in any other direction.  We have been given a fair idea of that in the case referred to by Deputy Mrs. Concannon. One can understand a railway company or any other transport company making the case that they cannot succeed where there are too many people in competition for the same business, but in the case referred to by Deputy Mrs. Concannon there is no competition. <Col N="1801" /> The Galway people have always had their railway terminus in the City of Galway but as we have been told they have buses going farther back into the West.  These bus services have been found to be very satisfactory. They do not affect the railway at all because it is not in competition with them.  But, as we know, once you create a monopoly, you give those who are operating it the whip hand and experience has taught us that they will use the power when they have it.  The startling announcement was made by Deputy Nally that the railway company, having got a monopoly, are now going to increase their charges.  The Deputy's information on that point seemed to be well-founded, as he was quoting, apparently, from an authoritative document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this Estimate I would like to bring the Minister's mind back a bit.  I will refrain from taking him back to the plan.  I will, however, bring his mind back to more recent times, and remind him of statements he has made on occasions when he went down the country to take a prominent part in the opening of new factories.  On every such occasion he took the opportunity of telling the agricultural community that the whole basis of the success of industry in this country depends upon the agricultural industry.  That is true.  As a matter of fact, on more than one occasion I opened my eyes when I read speeches reported in the newspapers to have been made by the Minister.  They were speeches that might have been made by members of the Opposition.  I would like to remind the Minister that it is not sufficient for him to make speeches of that kind.  He should put the sentiments that he expresses into practice at meetings of his Party and of the Executive Council.  It is not sufficient for the Minister, when opening a new factory, to express the hope that agriculture will prosper because agriculture is going to provide purchasing power for the people: to say that everything will depend eventually on the success or failure of agriculture, and then come back to Dublin, and neither in the Dáil nor at meetings of the Executive Council <Col N="1802" /> pay any heed whatever to agriculture or to the difficulties under which the industry is being carried on.  Almost every commodity which the agricultural community requires, and which has to be brought into the country, is tariffed without any compensating advantages for that section of the people for whom the Minister expresses so much concern when he is speaking down the country. Recently a report was published of the profits made by a certain industry here that is protected by tariffs. Those people announced that they were able to distribute dividends to the extent of 25 per cent.  Those things ought to make the Minister open his eyes, and ought to make him feel that if industries are to be established in this country they ought not to be established at the expense of the poor people of the country.  If we are going to have industrial activity it ought to be sound activity; it ought to be sound enterprise; it ought not to look for profit beyond what it is entitled to; and it must be able to stand in competition with other people.  It is manifestly unfair that the people of this country, who are mostly of the farming class, and have been very hard hit, must pay exorbitant prices for their everyday necessities.  There is really no necessity for me to enumerate the disadvantages under which the people are labouring at the present time owing to tariffs.  It does not matter what you take up in the way of the ordinary purchases of the people, they have got to pay tariffs on them all.  If we want to get the figures in bulk, all we have got to do is to take up the returns from Customs duties, and we see there the amount which has to be paid in the first instance. Of course the amounts are largely increased when they are distributed over the people.  £10,000,000 is no small amount to get from Customs duties in this country; it is a huge amount.  Of course the customs have to be paid at the docks, and when the traders have to put down their money it is not the £10,000,000 they will charge to the people; the people will be charged much more than that. The traders have a cash outlay in the <Col N="1803" /> first instance which they are not accustomed to, and which they are going to get back with interest.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister ought to direct his attention is the question as to whether or not some of the articles produced in this country are value for the money&mdash; whether they are able to stand on their merits.  We are all most anxious that the name of Irish manufactured goods should be kept well above the average, but I am afraid if some of the output were put to the test it would not do that.  The Minister and his Department, when there is such activity about the revival of industry, ought to be jealous of Irish manufacture and jealous of the manner in which it is turned out.  I would advise the Minister that he ought to take particular care to see that the goods which are turned out in this country are able to stand the test.  It is rather unfortunate, if we take the Minister's statement which sets out the number of factories established in this country, and compare it with the unemployment list as it stands to-day, that we find unemployment has not decreased to the extent one would anticipate.  Those of us who go around the country have an opportunity of seeing the crowds at the employment exchanges.  Perhaps we have been particularly badly hit in Roscommon, because neither the Minister nor his Government appears to remember that Roscommon is on the map. It was a live stock county, and has suffered more than most.  The people of Roscommon produced and reared young cattle, and from the very beginning they were hard hit.  In Roscommon, we have not had anything in return for the destruction of that business, and I know that in that county unemployment has been on the increase.  Of course the Minister will probably say that there are times at which, according to the figures supplied by the employment exchanges, unemployment has been relieved there.  That is of course when public works start, and when people in anticipation of the work, come in and register, but on the whole nothing whatever has taken the place of the <Col N="1804" /> live stock industry which has been ruined in that county.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would find time seriously to think about the statements which he makes up and down the country with regard to agriculture. I compliment him on them. There is no agriculturist in the country or no advocate of a settlement of the economic war who can make a stouter or stronger statement on behalf of agriculture than the Minister does, but he ought to carry that back with him and he ought to remember that agriculture is the basic industry of this country.  He ought to remember that, no matter what energy he displays in endeavouring to establish enterprise or industry, he must have a purchasing public, and you cannot have a purchasing public if you have not a prosperous agricultural community.  If the Minister would only endeavour to impress that upon his colleagues he might get something done for agriculture; he might get something done in order to ensure that he would have a purchasing public for the products of industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister yesterday evening and I was glad to hear that he is getting on so well with his industry.  We are all anxious to see industries getting a bit of an impetus because it is time that the country should be improved in that respect, but at the same time there are different ways of promoting industry.  I am afraid the Minister has not examined the foundations upon which he has built some of those industries.  When he builds them on a basis of 75 per cent. tariffs is that a sound foundation?  I am afraid that, apart from the repercussions upon the community by increasing prices, it will induce some people to go into those industries and put money into them who will not be able to carry on.  It is an invitation to inefficiency to start industries by putting on tariffs of 75 per cent.  Industries should be built on a solid foundation, and no one should be encouraged to go into any industry unless he is prepared to compete with others.  A great deal of Irish capital will be invested in those <Col N="1805" /> industries, and if the people are inefficient and unfit to make a success of them serious loss will be caused to the investors unless the Minister gives those inefficient people a monopoly. That would be a serious matter. Not merely would it be a serious injury to the people who put money into industry but it would injure the credit of the State.  I would remind the Minister that the process of building industry should not be rushed. When those questions were before the Tariff Commission they reported, after careful investigation, what industries should be encouraged, whether they were likely to be an economic proposition, and the extent to which they should be supported by tariffs. That was a very wise course, and no one was induced to go in who had not the requisite amount of efficiency. I think the Minister should take a little bit more care.  Even if he did not advance so fast with those little industries they would be more lasting and more permanent, and he would find in the long run that it was a sound course on which to proceed. Apart from that, the position is that, with the economic war and the general condition of agriculture, the people are not able to buy the products of these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy furnished the House with figures showing that much less of the commodities produced by these industries, such as boots, are being bought.  I know that in County Cavan, the people are not able to buy the products of these industries and unless there is an improvement in the policy of the Government generally, the people in the country districts will soon be like the Abyssinians, going barefoot.  Unless the agricultural community, as Deputy Brennan pointed out, are in a position to carry on and to buy the products of these industries, while the industries may prosper for a little while, they will eventually go down because all these industries must be based on the one principal industry of the State, agriculture. I should very much like the Government to co-ordinate all industries, including agriculture, and improve the position of them all, but if they advance one industry, or set <Col N="1806" /> of industries, at the expense of the principal industry, all will go down in a crash.  Anybody who knows anything about conditions in rural Ireland knows that the people are not able to purchase the goods that are being manufactured.  I have been talking to drapers in different towns and I find that trade was never so bad. At the same time, I know that there was never such prosperity for people dealing in old clothing.  The purchase of new material is going down while the purchase of secondhand clothing is on the increase to an alarming extent.</P>
    <P>That is the condition in County Cavan, I am sorry to say, and I hope the Minister will take a broader and a bigger view of the whole thing and that he will not continue to put on these extraordinary tariffs.  Any industry which cannot be made an economic proposition with a 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. tariff at the highest&mdash;and I would say that 25 per cent. is quite sufficient&mdash;should receive very careful consideration from the Minister before he encourages it at all, because the country cannot afford some of these industries.  I am as anxious as anybody to see these industries flourishing. Another matter to which I wish to call the Minister's attention is the location of these industries.  How many industries have been established in County Cavan?  It has one industry, agriculture, and that is actually smashed. Yet we have not got a new industry. We have some industries closed down there, and yet the people of County Cavan are paying in every article they buy to support those industries.  Are they not entitled to some return? They have got no benefit from wheat, beet or peat, from factories or anything else.  Yet they are paying, every day in the week, increases up to 50 per cent., 100 per cent. and, in some cases, 200 per cent., as I shall point out to the Minister before I finish. This is an aspect of the matter to which I should like the Minister to pay some attention.  I think Cavan is entitled to some consideration.  The people there cannot continue paying all the time while receiving nothing in return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The Minister referred to strikes, and he said the Department had been engaged in settling something like 100 or 200 disputes.  That is a consequence of the increased cost of living.  The Minister, by travelling too fast and by making the tariffs too high, is increasing the cost of living.  I think it is generally admitted that the cost of living is going up, notwithstanding the fact that agricultural produce is about half the value it was some years ago.  The increase is so high on some manufactured articles that the general cost of living is on the increase, and an increased cost of living is equal to a reduction of wages.  While the cost of living is too high, you will always have unrest and strikes, and if the cost of living was cut down to a normal point, these industries and everything else in the State would be able to carry on much better, and there would be much less unrest and fewer strikes and threatened strikes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good has referred to the adverse trade balance between Australia and this country, but if we deal with adverse trade balances generally, I think we will find that the adverse trade balance as between countries other than Commonwealth countries is much worse.  All the countries outside of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are buying from us £1 worth for every £8 worth we buy from them.  There is a trading basis of £1 to £8 and that is the disadvantage this country is at in trading with these foreign countries.  I think the Minister should make some effort to bring the ratio nearer to equality. If trading cannot be carried on with these foreign countries, except on a basis of that kind, it is questionable whether it is any advantage to continue trading with them.  I think there should be a ratio more nearly equal than the ratio of £1 to £8.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to call attention is the question of railway rates to which other Deputies have referred.  The position in our part of the country is simply scandalous.  The Minister has given the railways a monopoly, and they have abused that monopoly to an enormous extent. When the Railways Bill was passed <Col N="1808" /> here the State remitted a couple of hundred thousand pounds&mdash;I do not know the exact figure, but the Minister will know it&mdash;and that was a big advantage to the railways in the first instance.  They got the right to take over all their competitors' trade.  That should have resulted in greater economy, and it meant a very great advantage for the railways, even if they were to continue the old rates of their competitors.  They had the advantage of the monopoly, and that there would be no wasteful competition by reason of different carrying companies running on the same line, and they could carry on the business much more economically.  There is no justification for the increase in rates at all. What are the facts?  I have documentary evidence to prove to the Minister that, in some cases, the increase is as high as 200 per cent.  For instance, bicycles were carried by the Autoway service, a carrying service established in Ballyconnell, for 2/6 each from Dublin.  Now, the railway company is charging 7/6, or an increase of 200 per cent.  Is that justifiable?  Had that been done with the Minister's consent? I would like to know from the Minister what he thinks of it.</P>
    <P>The Railway Tribunal is supposed to fix these rates if traders make application to them to do so.  What happens is that the traders simply pass the increases on to the customers and say nothing about it.  Perhaps these traders buy railway stock at the same time.  Then they do very well.  When the Minister gives a monopoly to those companies he should see that the monopoly is not abused.  I have also figures to prove that in the carrying of other commodities such as paper, etc., there has been an increase of 100 per cent. over the previous charges.  I do not know if the company have got the Minister's consent for these increases, but I understand that under the Railways Act the Minister has power to fix rates for certain classes of articles. This Act gives the Minister power apart altogether from the Railway Tribunal or whether the traders are doing their duty in calling attention to these charges, to fix the charges himself. The Minister can exercise his power and fix the charges for these particular <Col N="1809" /> articles where the railway companies are abusing the monopoly they have got.  I hope the Minister will look after this matter because this, with the other profiteering, is adding further to the hardships inflicted upon the people down the country.  I do not think that profiteering was ever so general as it is at the present time.  In a statement yesterday the Minister said that he had not power to deal with charges of profiteering.  But I wish to point out that in this particular instance in the case of the railways he has, under the Railways Act, power to do so.  He can fix rates for certain classes of articles.  I hope he will use his power, and I hope in connection with other matters where profiteering is going on that the Minister will also take steps to put a stop to it.  If legislation is necessary he will have no trouble in getting legislation passed through this House.  Of course, there would be no such thing as profiteering if there were no monopolies.  The tendency of all legislation in the past few years is to create monopolies, and thus give those parties power to profiteer.  They are taking full advantage of the power they have got.  As a check the Minister should exercise his power in another way to see that these monopolies are not abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this Estimate will be very few indeed, but I hope they will be to the point. I thoroughly agree with all that Deputy McGovern has said with regard to the railways.  Having got a monopoly, the railways have curtailed services; they have increased passenger rates and they have increased freights and transport charges.  I think if there is any power in the Minister that he ought to see that this abuse is duly and properly rectified.  I see here in the Estimate, of which I have just got a copy, that there is set down an item of £15,000 for &ldquo;mineral exploration.&rdquo; I should like to have some explanation from the Minister as to upon what and how this money has been spent.  Has it produced any profit of any kind to the State?  I see further an item: &ldquo;The production of industrial alcohol&rdquo; and there is a sum of £226,000 set down for that.  I should like to know, and <Col N="1810" /> I ask the Minister for the information in no Party spirit, how this money has been spent?  Has it produced a sufficient amount of alcohol of any kind even to kill a fly?  I see, furthermore, items under &ldquo;Turf Development Board, Limited,&rdquo; and very limited it appears to be.  It costs a sum for this year of £40,000.  In heaven's name, upon what is that spent?  As far as my constituency is concerned&mdash;and it is full of turf bogs&mdash;I have never seen anything accomplished by this Turf Development Board in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I listened here to a very long and tedious debate on turf.  I heard the Minister and learned professors talking about it.  I ask the Minister here in the presence of this House can he tell me the difference between slán turf, shovel turf and hand turf?  I am sure he has not the remotest idea as to the difference. Can he tell me the meaning of barrfhód or can he tell me what a &ldquo;scrath&rdquo; is?  I listened here for two hours last night to a discussion on this subject by people who know nothing about it.  I make an appeal to the Minister now and it is this: that some of this money ought to be spent in districts where turf can be properly developed, and not have it diverted to places where it is mis-spent and unprofitable. I see here on this Estimate the Industrial Research Council.  What that is doing I do not know.  I doubt if any person in the country ever heard of it beyond what he may have read about it in these Estimates.  I see there is a great deal of money set down here under the head of travelling expenses. Travelling is, of course, a luxury for those who can indulge in it. Another matter to which I would like to refer is: fees and subscriptions to international organisations, and the sum set down is £1,210.  Now, of course, £1,210 is an item of little concern to a person who can afford it, but it is a very important matter to a country or person who cannot afford it.  I should like to know exactly from the Minister something about the organisations to which this money is donated &mdash;for that is the proper word, I think, to apply to it.  That item does not seem to be bringing any good to this country or to anybody else.  These few <Col N="1811" /> remarks of mine are made in no cavilling spirit.  The Minister is a man for whom I have the greatest respect.  He is a sane and sensible Minister, and I am sure he was in no way responsible for the Thunder and Turf Bill which was brought before the House last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am a bit perturbed, Sir, with regard to your ruling.  Do I gather from your ruling, Sir, that the question of unemployment is precluded from discussion now?  I respectfully submit that what the Deputy has referred to is merely concerned with the administration of these Acts, and that questions relating to unemployment will be on this Vote.</P>

      <P>I wish to call attention to the Minister's failure in regard to his promises&mdash;and the failure of the promises made by his President is just as glaring.  I attempted to raise this matter some time ago on a Supplementary Estimate, and, if I may say so, with all respect, Sir, I was very gently held off by yourself&mdash;not that I blame you, Sir, in the least for that. The Minister was very anxious on that occasion that there should not be any reference to his own failure in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the policy of this Party is relevantly under discussion by this House, the Minister will be told about it; but the point is that when an attempt is made to saddle the Minister with his own responsibility he tries to shelve that responsibility.  The Minister toured this country for two or three years asking the people to give him the responsibility and promising that, if he were given responsibility, he would solve the problem of unemployment; but now, when he has had three or four years of responsibility, he wants to know what is one going to do about the problem.  Does the Minister think that he can get away with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister says, but perhaps he thinks that it is no harm to try it on.  Of course, as usual, the Minister had the last word in the debate on the last occasion, and we know that when the Minister is completely ignorant of any matter he always tries to cover his ignorance up by bluff and sound and fury.  That is quite his usual style here.  But the Minister, who had told the workers of this country that within 12 months of his getting responsibility there would be no unemployment in this country, now says, when he is reminded, after having had that responsibility for four years, that there are more unemployed here than there ever was in the history of the country before, that he has a contempt for people like myself who, as he says, have no interest in the unemployment problem except for the purpose of vote-catching. This comes from the people on the far side who were so desperately anxious for responsibility in order to be able to relieve the problem of unemployment and who, according to the President himself, had a cure for unemployment such as no other people ever had.  I am afraid that that is the kind of cure that Fianna Fáil mostly has&mdash;a cure such as no other country ever had thought of&mdash;and we have the fruits of it now!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister is speaking about his contempt for certain people, such as myself, in their efforts to cure unemployment, I should like to ask him can he measure what must be the contempt of the 140,000 unfortunate persons whom he promised to put into employment?  Has he any idea of the contempt that those people must have for him and his Government?  After all, what the Minister thinks about me&mdash;whether it is contempt or anything else&mdash;does not matter in the slightest.  It does not get the Minister very far and it does not affect me in the slightest; but the effect of his policy and the policy of his Government on the unemployment problem in this country does concern us and ought to concern the Minister himself.  I want to put it to the Minister that he <Col N="1814" /> has failed lamentably in this matter, and that he has not only added to the numbers of the unemployed in this country but that he has, through the other side of his policy, reduced considerably the standard of living of those who are in employment.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal of talk about strikes, and we heard a good deal of criticism outside this House about strikes and trade unions and about people going on strike.  I want to say this&mdash;and I defy contradiction&mdash; that, as a result of the Government's policy for the last two or three years &mdash;and I shall not go back further than that&mdash;the purchasing value of wages in this country for a married man with an average-sized family has been reduced by anything from 5/- to 6/- per week.  Then we hear talk about the Prices Commission.  The Prices Commission and the Price Controller are powerless.  So far as the increase in the cost of the necessaries of life is concerned, it is the Government, through regulations, or through Orders made as a result of legislation in this House, which is responsible.  We know the people are paying from 6d. to 7d. more for flour than they were paying two years ago. We know that they are paying more for coal, for tea, for sugar, for tobacco, and for all the other commodities than they were paying two or three years ago.  We know that all these commodities are considerably dearer, and does anybody wonder that men, who were already working at a comparatively small wage, have to go on strike for higher wages in order to keep up with the increased cost of living?  Of course they have. It is just the old vicious circle again, chasing after higher wages in order to keep up with the increased cost of commodities.  The people of this country are paying an enormous sum in order to back up the Government's policy of fostering Irish industries. Those industries were supposed to be started for the purpose of giving employment.  I take it that that is the main reason for the development of industries in this country.  The ordinary people are called upon to pay an enormous sum&mdash;a sum that <Col N="1815" /> they have paid already, and a sum that is out of all proportion to the amount of employment which has been given&mdash;but, notwithstanding all the factories that, we were told, have been started, and notwithstanding all the tremendous sums of money which have been expended, and notwithstanding the enormous tariffs, we are faced with the fact that the numbers of unemployed in this country have reached a figure never before reached in the history of this country.  I know that that will be met by the Minister's usual reply, that we have a different system of recording the numbers of unemployed now, that there is an inducement to sign.  I shall deal with that on Vote 61.  I want Deputies to take this into account, that in the last census the number returned as unemployed was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 76,000. Nobody sought at that time or subsequent to that to put the figure higher than 76,000.  Indeed, most people believed at the time that that figure was higher than the actual number of unemployed in the country. Let us take it that it represented the full number of unemployed.  It was accepted by every Party in this House that, putting it at the best, that was the total number of unemployed people in the country.  Last winter what did we reach?  After all the tariffs, new factories, the heavy increases in the cost of living, etc., we had 147,000 registered as unemployed. The Minister shakes his head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I published long memoranda in order to teach the Deputy to understand the position but it was of no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that the Minister does not understand it. I am not saying that the Minister does not want to understand it.  I am going to be charitable and say this&mdash;I have a note of it here&mdash;that the Minister's Department is too big, that its activities are too widespread, that there are too many avenues and openings for that Department to be controlled and understood by any one man.  Most Deputies will agree with <Col N="1816" /> that.  Anyone who looks at the list of Departments for which the present Minister is responsible, and who knows anything about the ramifications of the Department of Industry and Commerce itself, not to speak about unemployment, unemployment assistance, transport, railways etc., as well as dealing with orders, quotas, licences, tariffs which are being increased, reduced and altered every day in the week, will agree that it is impossible for one man to deal with all these things personally and to have a competent knowledge of all these things.  The Minister could not have it.  That is one of my points.</P>
      <P>This fact cannot be gainsaid whatever memoranda the Minister may have published side by side with these figures, that during the last six months 147,000 people signed the register as being unemployed, as being available and willing to accept work. The Minister cannot get away from that.  That represents double the number of unemployed returned at the time of the last census and that number is returned, as I say, notwithstanding the huge burden placed on the people to provide employment. We have to face up to this fact and the Minister has to face up to it, that he has made no impression whatever upon the unemployment problem; that there are to-day more people unemployed and looking for work with, I am afraid, less chance of finding it, than there were when he first took up office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to address himself to this when replying. Will he tell us what he believes to be the exact number of unemployed in the country?  Will he tell us how he proposes to find employment for them? Will he tell us in what space of time he hopes to have them absorbed into employment, or has he made up his mind that we are always to have an unemployment problem in this country and this wrangle over figures as to whether it is 140,000 or 150,000?  I do not care if it is only 80,000.  It is too much, particularly after four years of a Government who were to find employment for them within 12 months, who had an unique cure of their own <Col N="1817" /> for unemployment.  At the end of four years, we are entitled to be treated by the Minister, in his reply, to something other than the usual type of speech we get from him.  He should give us a few facts for a change, instead of the usual thumping of the desk and trying to cover up ugly facts with a lot of sound and fury.  He is not going to solve the unemployment problem by running away from the facts or the figures and he is not going to find employment by doing that.  He ought to know that now. He ought to know now that it is not possible to solve the unemployment problem by brow-beating agriculture. That is the snag in the Minister's whole scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in a speech made at a dinner given some months ago by the Federation of Irish Industries, I think, that in the main we had to look to new industries to absorb our unemployed.  I wonder if the Minister was serious in that.  I can see no hope whatever of any serious inroad being made on unemployment in this country, except by developing and restoring the prosperity of agriculture. We will have to depend upon the land to absorb most of our people.  I put it to the Minister that, even if industries were developed to the point that we were producing 100 per cent. of what we require for our own use, the factories would not be able to absorb the total number of unemployed. According to the Minister himself and his colleagues this is a growing problem, because if we are to take their statements here there are roughly 20,000 new employable people coming into the market every year, and the Minister is not absorbing anything like 20,000 per year into employment, and he knows it.  That is a matter with which the Minister ought to concern himself.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Government are only tinkering and playing with the matter.  The President announced immediately after the coming into office of the Government that he was setting up a committee for devising ways and means of finding employment for the unemployed.  He announced that Deputy Hugo Flinn had been <Col N="1818" /> appointed chairman of that Inter-Department Committee and that it was the business of the committee to submit schemes of work which would be of use to the nation and give the maximum amount of labour.  That is over three years ago.  Yesterday, in answer to a question put by me regarding the activities of this particular committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is always anxious&mdash;he was just as anxious on the last occasion&mdash;to try to keep us from discussing the facts that are there.  One outstanding fact is that there was no action taken as a result of the investigations of this committee which has been sitting for three years. I think there were three interim reports issued.  The Minister did not even promise to take action following the operations of that committee&mdash;and all this from a Government that did not want any committee set up because they had a plan thought out which was going to absorb all the unemployed in the country and would absorb even a greater number.  The plan was so carefully considered that they actually brought the figures of those who could be employed down to one.  We were told that this plan was going to be so successful that there would not be enough unemployed in this country to fit into the machine and we would have to send to America to bring back many of those who had emigrated.</P>
      <P>We were told that this Government would provide employment for 84,601 persons, and now we have 147,000 unemployed.  That is the position of the people who had everything planned when they were going to the country some years ago, when they were looking for the votes of the unemployed and the hungry people.  What of the man who has talked about contempt? Can he conceive the contempt that these people feel for himself and his Government&mdash;the Government that told them they had a plan ready to put all of them into industry?  Even after a special committee of their own sat for three years investigating and issuing reports, there is still no plan, and the fact is that there are more unemployed in the country to-day than ever there were before.  There is no plan forthcoming even now, and we have no statement from the Government as to how all those people are going to be absorbed into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> I would like to hear the Minister addressing himself to those matters and telling us how he hopes to solve the problem or what are his plans for putting the unemployed into employment. Let him not concern himself about his particular views with regard to me or anybody else on this side of the House.  What he thinks of us does not matter very much; nobody is concerned about it; nobody thinks two hoots about it.  We are, however, very anxious to hear from the Minister what he is going to do for the unfortunate people who are unemployed.  They, too, are anxious to hear when there is going to be some attempt to bring into relation to the enormous amount of money that is being spent in the attempt to provide employment the numbers who are anxious to secure employment.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which will probably arise more relevantly on Vote 61 (Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance).  There are many other matters in connection with the question of employment that I could deal with on this particular Vote, but there is very little use in referring to them here because I could almost give word for word the reply which will be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters arising out of this Vote on which I would like to get some information.  So far as I can ascertain, there are about 300 lorry owners in this country who, for one reason or another, have failed to secure merchandise licences from the Minister's Department and, as a result, they are prevented from using their lorries for hiring purposes.  That is a very definite hardship on these people. Many of these men were hard-working and by thrift they saved enough to purchase a second-hand lorry.  Later they were able to get better lorries. They depended on these lorries to earn a livelihood.  Now, if they put them on the roads they are prosecuted and fined.  Is the Minister in a position to do anything for them?  Could he enable them to continue using their lorries and permit them to earn a living in the only way they have available at the moment?  I do not want to go into the matter very fully now because I realise that to a certain extent the Minister's hands are tied. <Col N="1822" /> I would, however, like him to consider the matter with the object of seeing if anything can be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inspection of factories, the Minister may recollect that I raised this matter three or four years ago, and I suggested at that time that he had not a sufficient number of inspectors to do the work in the way in which it should be done.  He was rather short with me at the time and very sharp and he assured me he had as many inspectors as he wanted and if there were any more required they would be got in time.  We knew at the time there were not enough and, as a result, the necessary inspections could not be carried out.  I trust the Minister will now take whatever steps are necessary to have factory inspections carried out satisfactorily.  It is a matter of very great importance, particularly when you are dealing with new industries where there are likely to be accidents more frequently than in old-established factories where the men have been working for a number of years and are accustomed to their duties.  The factories that have come under my notice are run in an excellent fashion and every care is taken for the safety of the employees.</P>
    <P>If one were to believe 25 per cent. of what one is told about the conditions in industries, they would certainly seem to be in a bad way.  I hope that whatever steps are necessary will be taken immediately to have a very full investigation made into the conditions existing in the different factories.  I wonder is the Minister in a position to tell us whether there have been any recent inquiries or developments in connection with the Slieveardagh coal mines in Tipperary? I am aware there were certain people interested or making some inquiries. Is the Minister in a position to inform us whether there has been any advance or any likelihood of people coming to carry out work in that district? There is a good deal of anxiety in the district because there is a great deal of unemployment there, perhaps a higher percentage than in any other part of the county.  For that reason people are anxious to know whether there is any likelihood of any early development there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This in my opinion is the most important Vote taken in this House other than that of the Department of Agriculture.  In my opinion these two Votes are those that primarily concern the country.  The one is interdependent on the other; they are both interlocked.  Deputy Morrissey said that the Minister had made no impression upon unemployment. I think the Deputy was unfair to the Minister in saying that.  I am afraid he did not look closely at this Estimate.  In the year ending 1931-32 the total expenditure in this Department was £102,151.  The total cost of the Department now is £455,245. Deputy Morrissey tells us that the Minister has made no impression upon the question of unemployment, but there we find a difference of over £350,000 which is an increase in salaries and wages.  Surely that would solve some portion of the unemployment problem.  I take it it would pay £1 a week to quite a considerable number of people, and thus reduce the number of unemployed by that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey was very aggressive towards the Minister.  I am not going to be that.  I rather pity the Minister.  He is in an utterly impossible position.  I think the country takes it that if there is any man that could make a success of the Department of Industry and Commerce the Minister is that man.  But he is in an utterly impossible position, as I have said.  It is hard to say whether in one year or 20 years his policy will result in complete failure.  He is rushing about like an animal in a cage trying to find an outlet of escape here and there.  But the fact is that the basic industry of the country, namely agriculture, has been strafed, and as all other industries are depending on that it is clear that all his efforts will end in failure.  The Minister cannot solve the unemployment problem.  On the occasion of the Budget statement three years ago I said we were being treated to a policy of increased taxation and decreased income.  When you have such a policy as that you strike at the root of employment in every country. Many people have been put out of agricultural employment in those years.  I <Col N="1824" /> wonder will we get those figures.  Agricultural unemployment is piling up. There is nothing on the land for any young man to do.  There is no young man to-day who wants to remain 24 hours on a farm.  He does not want it known that he is working lest he might lose a few shillings a week from the unemployment bureau.  That is the whole problem.  That is what is making the Minister's position in seeking for a solution of unemployment utterly impossible.</P>
    <P>In 1932 the Minister promised to solve this problem in 12 months.  In four years the figure of unemployment has increased to that mentioned by Deputy Morrissey.  I am inclined to go with the Minister when he says that the present form of registration may mean the taking in of a lot of people that would otherwise not be there. Take the figures at the last census. There was no compulsion on anybody at that time to write down whether he was employed or unemployed.  If he wrote down he was unemployed he was not getting the dole, and at that time 76,000 people put themselves down as unemployed.  The assumption is that there are a considerable number of people now whose names should not appear on the unemployed register. The number of unemployed was put down at 150,000 during the winter.</P>

      <P>It is between 140,000 and 150,000.  Will the Minister go to any of the people who come to the labour exchange to sign, and tell them that they are employed?  I know people who walk nine miles to and from a labour exchange, and all they receive is 1/- per week.  What condition is this country in when a man will walk 18 miles to and from a labour exchange in order to sign his name, so that he may get 1/- a week?  Surely that is not going to solve the question of unemployment, no matter what defence the Minister may put up.</P>

      <P>Yes, certainly, I will give more than one case.  I know, as a matter of fact, the trouble in the Minister's Department is this unemployment question, and I think the whole position is futile and impossible. The Minister would have to spend the whole of his life walking up and through his Department looking after the interests of those people if he tried to do anything to solve this question. The sum that would be required to solve the unemployment problem is so utterly impossible that the Minister would not be able to get it.  Finance would not give it, and could not give it. Sixteen years after this country has been functioning through its own National Government, we find people who previously never got a penny from anyone, did not owe a penny to anyone even under a foreign Government, have to walk nine miles to get 1/- a week, and that is the way the Minister is solving the unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>When the Minister goes to the country let him try to tell the people what the truth is about this situation, whether it is popular or unpopular.  These are the penalties of improper propaganda.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, are amongst those who have sown the wind, and now they are reaping the whirlwind.  Ministers go up and down the country taking salutes from the military in different districts, but it is merely a mockery and an insult to the thousands of unemployed people in this country.  People are invited to come to some country town to see Ministers taking the salute.</P>

      <P>Have the Executive Council any idea of what is the psychology of young men in this country who do such a thing?  What do they think the psychology of people is when they come into a country town to see the salute given to a Minister when some of them walk eight or nine miles each way to a labour exchange to sign their names to get 1/- a week? The Government have no solution of this problem.  The cost of the Department has increased from £102,000 to £455,000.  Deputy Morrissey has told the Minister that he has made no impression on unemployment during that period, and the Minister cannot deny that.  Yet, this is what his Department is costing&mdash;an increase of £353,000.  If the Minister were a director of a company and came before his shareholders with a return of that kind, I wonder what the shareholders would say.  The general taxpayer is, of course, a dumb animal.  The Minister thinks that he can pile load after load on his back and that there will be no breaking of the back.  I hope that Deputy Donnelly will speak on this Vote and that he will tell us how the plan on which, he got votes has been carried into effect.  Will Deputy Donnelly go to the country, produce the plan to the young men and say: &ldquo;Here is the plan on which I asked your votes in 1932.  We have carried it into effect.  We have put into employment every employable man in the country.  To-day there is not an unemployed person in the State, and I ask for a renewal of your confidence&rdquo;?  If the Deputy made that kind of speech, I wonder what the result would be or whether there would be any torches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an increase in respect of all these items.  I should not mind that if there were anything to show for it. In 1931, £7,000,000 was collected in Customs duties.  Last year, £10,000,000 was collected on a smaller amount of goods.  What we are doing is piling up taxation and trying to stave off the evil day.  None of us is to say anything about the position.  It is treachery to say anything about it.  It is treachery to face a fact.  There is no use in ignoring the issue.  This problem of unemployment is going to continue <Col N="1827" /> until the policy of the present Government is changed or until the Government is changed and some hope is given to the young men.  I should like to hear from Deputy Donnelly what he has in mind for the young men.  Where in the Free State would Deputy Donnelly get a job for ten young men at £2 per week?  I challenge him to do that.  I myself have tried and failed. That is the condition of affairs to which we have reduced the young people.  It is shocking to think of the condition into which the country has got.  There is no prospect for the young people on the land, which should keep them in frugal comfort.  No young man wants to stay 24 hours on the land if he can get away from it.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who keeps in close contact with his constituency is getting letters from farmers' sons asking him to get a job for them somewhere. Some of them do not wait for a reply. They throw a few clothes into a bag and set out for Dublin with £2 or £3 in their pockets.  When that money is spent, they have to go back.  I am sure that other Deputies have the same experience that I have.  I represent a rural constituency and live in Dublin.  On that account, some of my constituents think that I can make jobs for them.  I wish to say publicly that I cannot do that.  I have travelled Dublin from morning till night looking for jobs for young men.  I was utterly unable to get a job for a young man at 30/- a week.  In these circumstances, one sometimes regrets that one is in public life at all.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and direct a reversal of the policy of the Government, especially the external policy with regard to agriculture. Until he does that his troubles are going to increase from day to day and the only end will be disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial and unemployment end of it is certainly the most interesting thing I have come across for a long time.  Deputy McMenamin says that I could not make any suggestions as regards the cure of unemployment.  So long as I have this Fine Gael Plan, I can&mdash;since Deputy McGilligan uses our Plan against us&mdash; make suggestions.  Here is the suggestion of Deputy Morrissey's Party for the cure of unemployment, as set out in Section 5, sub-section (c):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Carry out relief works and large scale public works of intrinsic value to the community; if necessary, absorb the able-bodied unemployed in a reconstruction corps for carrying out useful public works on a national scale.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That savours of Germany, in my opinion.  I do not know whether or not Fine Gael wants labour settlements or labour camps.  It is obvious from the look of astonishment on Deputy Morrissey's face that he knows nothing about this programme. If he were at the Ard-Fheis, he allowed this proposal to pass without even a word of comment.  That is the Fine Gael cure for unemployment. Ours is the establishment of industry and the carrying out in every way of the teachings and policy of Arthur Griffith.  I never thought I would live to see the day when such a frontal attack would be made on any Government here&mdash;I do not care what Party constituted the Government&mdash;for trying to carry out the policy of Arthur Griffith.  Not only that, but there are cases in which industries started in certain towns have been politically ambushed by members of other Parties, who call them &ldquo;baby farms&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweating dens.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is carrying on.  Deputy McMenamin said that after 16 years of home government a man had to walk nine miles to register for a <Col N="1829" /> shilling at a labour exchange.  Here is the view which obtained in 1922, when the present system of Government was being put into operation, as stated by the late Mr. Arthur Griffith: &ldquo;They in Ireland had since the time of his boyhood been struggling for every little thing&mdash;struggling to get anything in the way of national education, struggling for powers to develop the country, increase their trade and protect their industry, and, in 25 years, they had been able to do very little because they were without legislative power. They had legislative power now; they had absolute control over their own money, and absolute control over every artery of trade and commerce, and taxation was at their disposal to use in any way they thought right for the development of the country.&rdquo; It is unfair and anti-national&mdash;I do not care what Government is in power&mdash;to say one word by way of criticism against any body of men attempting to put that policy into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no bad consequences from the development of Irish industry.  There was no industry in the constituency I represent four years ago.  The Minister has been responsible for establishing some industries there since he came into office.  There was one factory established at Edenderry, and I believe a prospectus will be issued shortly for the establishment of a factory in the capital of that constituency which will give employment to 200 people.  Is there anything wrong about that?  Is there anything wrong in the Minister saying that the policy of the Government in agriculture and industry was interlocked?  Was there anything wrong in the Cooley area of County Louth in setting up alcohol factories <Col N="1830" /> to relieve the agricultural community there?  That is what I believe by the development of industry.  I believe in tackling the question from all angles. With all respect to Deputy McGilligan I assert that it is anti-national and that it is not right to try to prevent the development of the country on these lines.  Take the programme of the Fine Gael Party as submitted to their Ard-Fheis.  After looking at that programme, I wonder why this criticism comes from the opposite benches.  Item No. 4 dealing with industry says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Encourage the development of new and existing industries suitable to our needs and resources by every efficient means, giving existing tariffs every chance of justifying their continued imposition, since it is obvious that neither in agriculture nor in industry can the country afford sudden successive revolutionary changes in policy, and established industry still requires statutory security.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provide machinery in conjunction with representatives of both manufacturers and workers which will secure due regard for the interests of the consumer and taxpayer in respect of cost of living and scale of taxation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are a couple of other items that I need not read because they are non-controversial:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Plan, as far as possible, our national economic life with a view to increased industrial efficiency and harmony by the organisation of agricultural and industrial corporations with statutory powers, assisted by industrial courts and leading to the formation of a National Economic Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why the criticism?  Do Deputies opposite still subscribe to that?  The programme continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Improve the condition of the workers by the establishment within these corporations of contributory schemes for family allowances, death benefits and retiring pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing was &ldquo;to encourage the development of new and existing industries suitable to our needs and <Col N="1831" /> resources by every efficient means.&rdquo;  In view of that programme, unanimously passed by the Ard-Fheis of Fine Gael, why all this criticism?  Why the attack by Deputy Morrissey on the Minister this evening?  The Deputy said that it was impossible at present to cure unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy Morrissey has another trump card up his sleeve.  He was the first to let it out one Sunday afternoon at Nenagh that a loan of £3,000,000 should be floated and that it should be divided between agriculture and industry. That means £1,500,000 for each.  Why not float a loan and invest the money in some of these industries?  Would not that be the obvious thing to do?  If any persons will do that their names will go down in history and be covered with glory.  As a matter of fact the Deputy would outdo Deputy McGilligan. He would kill this Government with kindness while Deputy McGilligan would kill it by a verbal attack. These Deputies are anxious to get a list of the new industries that have been started.  I hope Deputy McGilligan has brought &ldquo;the plan&rdquo; and that he will read it again.  That is one thing this Government has done since it came into office, it has given a list of new industries established and the number of people absorbed as a result of their development.  I do not want to be severe on the Party opposite. <Col N="1832" /> I regard a number of the speeches that have been delivered on this Estimate more or less as a waste of time. There should be criticism naturally, but every moment that is wasted is keeping back the activities of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly believe it. I believe the average working man down the country would rather hear of some grant or of some industry being established than to read the speeches of Deputy Morrissey, Deputy McGilligan, of myself or even the Minister.  They are tired of that. What they want is to have the goods delivered.  They are getting the goods, and every moment that that is delayed is not satisfactory to the people.  It is a grand thing, and there is a kind of tradition about it, to be able to attack the Government.  I would love to be on the Opposition Benches sometimes, just to have the gratification and I suppose the pleasure of criticising.  All Irishmen by instinct are anti-Government, but I never met any person like Deputy McGilligan who was formerly a Minister, who, instead of being constructive was so keen on demolishing a case.  That is why I am delighted he is here this evening.  I want to hear some of his destructive work, but I cannot reconcile that type of criticism with a person who had to do constructive work in the past and in the same Department.  Deputy Morrissey discovered a mare's nest.  He was ruled out when he referred to the interim report on unemployment.  Does Deputy Morrissey say that anyone in this House believes that unemployment can be solved overnight?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McGilligan reminded me of that, because I read an interview given by Deputy MacEoin to the <i>Boston Herald</i> shortly after he arrived in the United States in company with a then Minister &mdash;I think it was Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald&mdash;in which the Deputy told the interviewer that unemployment was <Col N="1833" /> not particularly troublesome in the Free State.  That was nine years ago. We are in office for four years.  What happened during the other five years? Did all the unemployment take place since?  Deputies on every side are willing to admit that there are people at work now in certain towns who were not in employment when this Government came into office.  I advise Deputy Morrissey to look up that interview in the <i>Boston Herald</i> that was given by Deputy MacEoin in which he said that there was no such thing as unemployment in the Saorstát.  One would imagine that it was only since this Government came into office that unemployment became a serious factor. There was always a certain amount of unemployment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until we get ourselves properly on our feet and until this country is allowed to develop along the lines which this Government is trying to put into operation, there will be that unemployment. I do suggest that it would be much better for Deputies to give some constructive ideas to the Minister as to how to solve that problem than to repeat speeches which have been given here for the past four or five years.  Anybody can go down to the Library and see that these are the very same speeches that have been delivered for a number of years on this Estimate.  Let us consider this concrete proposal: Here is a certain amount of money which the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants.  Is he to get that money or is anybody going to say that he should not get it? One could quite understand if some Deputies got up to say that there is not sufficient money in this Estimate. I could quite understand an argument like that but I cannot understand this carping criticism that goes on when at the same time Deputies know in their heart of hearts that this money is necessary and that the only fault to be found with the Estimate is that it is not large enough.  I do not want to go back to the ancient past or to go through all the items of the Estimate but there is one thing which I should like to say to the Minister.  I suggest to him that something should be <Col N="1834" /> done to wake up the Prices Commission and to make it function a little better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but at the same time it is the duty of the Government in office to face what may seem impossibilities and to try to remedy them.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will deal with that matter.  I do not think there is anything else I want to say on this Estimate.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  I brought in a number of quotations which I intended to read but I shall read them on some other occasion.  I do say this, in conclusion, to Deputy Morrissey.  I am afraid there was a little show of vindictiveness on his part, particularly in the energy and the emphasis he put into his arguments as regards the Minister notwithstanding the fact that no county has gained more as the result of the industrial activities of the Government than County Tipperary. If I might refer to one other county that has benefited considerably since the industrial movement has started, I would point to the County Louth. That is one county in which the majority of the people have been political opponents of the Government. Two-thirds of their representatives are numbered amongst the Opposition.  I do not see any of the Louth Deputies here now but I defy anybody to go to County Louth now and to say that, industrially or agriculturally, the county is not better off than it was before the Government came into office.  A number of <Col N="1835" /> boot factories have been started; there is to be an alcohol factory in Cooley, and a number of trade loans have been given to firms in difficulty. All this has happened since the Government came into office.  That did not show any sort of political bias on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes one feels indignant towards the Opposition but at other times one is inclined to be sympathetic with them.  They have my sympathy on occasions and I shall give you the reason for that.  I know that there are men in the Opposition who think exactly and who are thinking at the present moment exactly&mdash;and I would particularly mention Deputy Brennan as one&mdash;along the lines of the quotation which I gave a few moments ago from Arthur Griffith.  I know there are good Irishmen on the Opposition Benches.  I know that Deputy O'Neill is not 100 miles away from the sentiments of that quotation.  I know that there are many others who believe in the development of Irish industry and who gave many years of their young lives, in the days when we were all young and when ours was the voice crying in the wilderness, to assist that development.  You have my strong sympathy for this reason.  I know that Party discipline, and perhaps also a false sense of allegiance to one's Party, make men who do not believe that there is anything wrong in this policy get up and protest against it.  For that reason there are some Deputies on the opposite side who have my sympathy.  As regards Deputy McGilligan, Deputy McGilligan was born to criticise.  Deputy McGilligan always captivates this House when he gets up to speak.  I am delighted that he is here this evening, and we all hope that he will tell us what he thinks about the Government's policy, not only in summary form but in detail.  I would also ask Deputy McGilligan to say why he should have made that little interruption&mdash;&ldquo;regardless of consequences&rdquo;. If there were to be bad consequences in this country as a result of industrial development, as a result of preaching the gospel which we carried about in our pockets throughout the country long ago, then <Col N="1836" /> Sinn Fein, in the days away back, propagated a gospel in which none of us believed.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene immediately after Deputy Donnelly's last statement.  He has made so many points that require an answer that it is hard to know exactly where to start.  His use of the quotation from Arthur Griffith, however, affords one jumping-off ground.  I do not believe any man, writing in his own time, has such foresight that his gospel must be taken for all time. Arthur Griffith himself, before he died, made to the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins a vehement protest against people using what he described as propagandist articles.  He said in developing that argument that he had written, as he often had written, in the most extreme fashion when there was an abuse which he wanted to correct.  The abuse in this case was the way in which English industry was deliberately strangling any effort to get industry going in this country, and he admitted that the articles which he wrote were propagandist, and violently propagandist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He admitted it in a conversation with the late Kevin O'Higgins.  It is inherent in the articles that Mr. Griffith wrote that they were propagandist.  It is clear from every line of them, and Arthur Griffith himself, were he alive to-day, would be the last man to say that a person was un-Irish because he did not believe in what Arthur Griffith wrote in 1914.  I read recently a dictionary of the New Deal in America in which a cynical American said that a definition of un-American nowadays was one who did not agree with the person speaking.  That is Deputy Donnelly's definition of un-Irish&mdash;a person who does not agree with him from time to time.  Even though many of his writings had merely a propagandist value, there were few men who gave us so many good ideas in his own time as Arthur Griffith.  Deputy Donnelly says that he was in favour of the development of industry irrespective of consequences, and that <Col N="1837" /> there could be no ill consequences from the development of industry. Supposing this country had to pay through salaries and taxes, in order to aid a young industry, a sum of £500,000 a year, and that that merely secured employment for 25 persons, would Deputy Donnelly think that the development of such an industry was good for this country?  Clearly it would be bad.  I do not think there are circumstances which would justify the employment, say, of 25 people for an annual tribute, paid in taxation, of £500,000.  If Deputy Donnelly can get that exaggerated view of what might happen in industry into his head he will find it easier to understand some of the arguments which are sincerely put up from this side of the House against the present policy.  May I say, in passing, that it amused me to hear Deputy Donnelly speaking of the false sense of Party loyalty in this House.  I have only heard one man here confess that he was unwillingly driven into the Party lobby, and that was Deputy Donnelly himself.  Only, he said, for the Party loyalty which he had succumbed to on a particular occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy did reveal that he had gone against his better judgement on that occasion.  It will be time enough for the Deputy to criticise people on this side when a confession of that type is made from this side of the House.  I am against the present type of industrial development because I think it is not doing good.  It is taxing the people of the country beyond what they can stand, and is going to set back a proper tariff policy.  Will Deputy Donnelly agree, or will he not agree, that there are different ways of developing industries in the country?  I think he came to the root of the matter when he said that the Minister ought to liven up the Prices Commission, and I suggested it should be buried without honours.  I think in their excuse it ought to be said that they were given an impossible task.  There has been no machinery found in any part of the <Col N="1838" /> world, outside war conditions, capable of fixing prices.  May I refer again to the writer I quoted a short time ago?  As far as America is concerned, this particular cynic has described price fixing as a government scheme for putting up prices at a level which everybody, except the consumer, can afford.  There is a certain element of truth in that, as far as America and some other countries are concerned, where they are blind to what happens the consumer.  Their only idea is to lift prices.  They get the hope that in the lifting of prices and of scattering purchasing power you will get the wheels of agricultural industry started again, and that people will get the money to enable them to bear the extra prices.  But there is a lag in that which depends on the extent of the time period and the sufferings of the consumers who are made pay these heavy, exorbitant prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set up as an example against what is being done at this moment one item.  When we were a Government we decided to make a tariff experiment with regard to boots and shoes. We believed it would raise prices in this country.  We found that our fears in that respect were justified.  We made calculations, and we thought that the extra cost to the people of this country would be about £350,000.  We said that it was not fair to make the people of the country suffer to that extent, small as it was; so we looked around for something which would equalise the burden that we were putting on the people.  We had to get something equal to the amount that would be imposed on the people on whom the various taxes would fall. We got an equable alternative.  We made the obvious calculation that most people who wear boots and shoes drink tea, and that most of those who drink tea wear boots and shoes.  We took off the tea tax, which amounted to £350,000 exactly.  Now let me put that lesson a bit further.  The tariff was a moderate one.  As a moderate tariff it was eminently successful.  It got people into employment at once, and, being low, it kept prices low.  Prices were, in fact, raised by manufacturers who are only too anxious to take every <Col N="1839" /> advantage of a tariff, but we equalised the burden on the people by exempting them from the tea tax.</P>
    <P>You do not need a Prices Commission for that.  We put the tariff at a point and said: &ldquo;Let prices go to whatever is the amount under this that will enable Irish-made boots and shoes to be sold under the price of the English importations.  Let them raise the cost to the consumer; we will give away with our right hand what we are taking with the left.  We will leave the position much as it was before, but with this difference, that we will get people into employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had no such foolish machinery as the Prices Commission, machinery that was doomed to failure from the start, machinery that never should have been set up for operation here if anybody concerned in the project of keeping prices low had even surveyed half a dozen countries and found out how they deal with prices.  When tariffs came, immediately there was an increase in the cost to the consumer. Except in war time, there has been no successful effort at fixing prices by a prices board.</P>
    <P>Let me speak a little on that.  Look at the folly to which this Prices Commission was reduced.  Has Deputy Donnelly ever pondered over the ridiculous position revealed by the Prices Commission in their report on flour, where they solemnly say that they had made a series of calculations which, I am sure, were based on very correct information.  They calculated that on flour selling at a certain price there would be a certain profit which they considered a just profit to the manufacturers, and then they continued: if flour is sold only at that price there are certain millers in this country who will go out of production. They are not efficient enough to manufacture and sell at that price.  They must be kept in being.  Why, I do not know.  They must be kept in being was their conclusion.  The Prices Commission found themselves in that particular dilemma, and they decided to resolve it in this way: The men who can produce at a certain amount are making more than what we think to be <Col N="1840" /> a just profit; take from them and divide it amongst those who cannot manufacture and sell at this price that we consider to be a just price.  Phrase that generally&mdash;take money from the efficient people and pay off the inefficients.</P>
    <P>That is the solitary report, the sole monument to the wisdom of the Prices Commission on any project sent to them.  Of course it was not followed out.  It is all very well to get a report of that type, but even the folly of Fianna Fáil stopped short at penalising people for being efficient by making them keep the inefficients.  If that had been allowed to develop, the natural tendency, of course, would have been to put a premium on inefficiency, and efficiency in milling would have slumped, and I do not know how many years it would have taken until you had reached a completely bad state with regard to milling in the country.</P>
    <P>Prices cannot be kept down by this sort of machinery.  Only in war time can efforts of that kind be successful, and there are many publications which show how those put in charge of such price-fixing machinery operated in war time.  The conclusion come to, I think universally, by the people operating such machinery in war time was that you must act irrespective of persons. You say to yourself that everyone is making so much profit from the production of the raw material to the production of the finished article, and that if you hit a man here and there along that line he is not being too badly hit in the long run.</P>
    <P>Only under those conditions has it ever been said that price-fixing machinery of the artificial type can be successful.  How then is the consumer to be protected?  We have to remember that the consumer must be protected.  I sometimes do feel aggravated when I read of the activities or the paradings of certain&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;certain&rdquo;&mdash;of our industrialists here.  Of course, the difficulty in speaking of this subject is that it is so easy to misrepresent.  If one speaks critically of a certain group of Irish industrialists, or industrialists who operate in a particular way, it is so <Col N="1841" /> easy to make it appear that the words had a universal application.  I have this feeling about Irish industrialists, that if I thought they were all as bad as I think some of them are they would probably have to be supported, because there is only a certain number of people in business.  There is a limited number who have a certain tradition of industrial activity in the country, and they have got to be kept going if we want to extend the field of their operations and to get other people into that field with them.  But there are some Irish industrialists who are doing just the same type of thing that was described as war profiteering during the Great War.  Look at the chance they have got.  Instead of 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. tariffs, I suppose it is a low average to put it at 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is a tariff in its essence?  It is a licence given to a manufacturer to charge up to within 2 or 3 per cent. of the tariff that is given to him. Any manufacturer operating with an 80 per cent. tariff knows he can charge, say, up to 70 or 75 per cent.  He can shelter himself behind a 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. tariff wall, raising his prices.  In its essence, a tariff is completely and definitely a licence to manufacturers to charge higher.  If that charging higher is done unnecessarily it is fleecing the public.  Deputies of all Parties, speaking in this House, use the phrase that they would rather see the unemployed in this country getting work than getting the dole.  It is proper phraseology with a reservation. I do not believe in making people work unnecessarily.  I think that is mistaking the means for the end.  Work is only a means; it is not an end in itself. Although we are definitely generations away from reaching the point, let us suppose that we are at the point where the present production had outrun the present demand, then there is an immediate case for reducing the hours that every worker has got to work.  I see no virtue in keeping people with their nose to the grindstone whether it is necessary or not.  But with that reservation it is a sound doctrine that people ought to be made work for money instead of having money given to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> Undoubtedly, in this country all workers are&mdash;through unsought and unmerited necessity put upon them&mdash; forced to take relief moneys, and in this House we speak sometimes with horror and bated breath of the unfortunate worker who gets relief.  I often wonder whether, at those ceremonial dinners which industrialists and commercial men indulge in so often, they ever consider that they are in receipt of public relief also, and some of them do not deserve it.  A tariff is as much relief as is the payment of unemployment assistance to the working men who cannot get work.  If the worker cannot get work he deserves the money that will keep him from destitution.  If an industrialist gets a tariff, and does not spread a bigger purchasing power through the community, he is pocketing what was meant for others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably his answer.  I do not believe, as a member of the consuming public, in being charged dearer for certain articles while a group of manufacturers who have no right to do so make a profit for themselves beyond a certain limit out of the sacrifices which I, as consumer, have been forced to make.  I do not believe that is what tariffs are for.  I do not believe that the Minister would seek to justify a tariff here by standing up and pointing to, say, 3,000 industrialists and their families who have been made wealthier, although those 3,000 industrialists and their families are, as Deputy Moore says, going to diffuse some of that wealth.  What tariffs were put on for was to give occupation, not to 3,000 industrialists and their families, but to 30,000 or 40,000 workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very secondary consideration.  The Deputy would not justify tariffs to a group of workers in his own constituency by saying: &ldquo;We have taxed you as consumers. There is no extra work in this <Col N="1843" /> constituency through tariffs.  There are extra profits being made by manufacturers. They are spending that money and they are keeping the money in Ireland.  I want you to pay your bit extra on boots and shoes and clothing in order to keep the money in Ireland, but there will be no more money for the workers.&rdquo;  Would the Deputy use that argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the money be kept in the country without being available for the workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy so simple as not to understand?  We had an example recently of an industry down in Kilkenny which declared a dividend of 25 per cent.  I believe it carried forward to reserve at least another 15 per cent.  They had made from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent. profit in the year.  How did they make it? By charging high prices for boots and shoes.  Does the Deputy think that that is allowable, and that a tariff which allows a firm to make 40 or 50 per cent. profit in a year's trading is a good tariff?  I am glad that Deputy Moore interrupted, because we have got to get those things clear.  If industrialists&mdash;mind you, I am not speaking of all industrialists; I have got to give that warning again; let me put it hypothetically and say: &ldquo;if there are any industrialists&rdquo;&mdash;who are making money out of tariffs, that is to say, making money out of the extra prices which tariffs allow them to charge, and are not giving extra employment, but are flattering themselves that they are giving public benefit by pocketing the proceeds and spending them themselves, then I condemn that as a performance.  I think that is profiteering, and I say it ought to be put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, to come back to the matter which Deputy Donnelly mentioned, a Price Fixing Commission will not settle that.  The Deputy agrees with me that the Prices Tribunal has failed to settle that.  I remember an occasion here early in 1932 when Deputy Corish put down a motion that the <Col N="1844" /> Government should take care that the fruits of all tariffs should be passed on to the workers, and I remember speaking against the motion on the grounds that it was an ideal but it was impossible.  But if we do not come somewhere near the realisation of that ideal, then tariffs have failed.  I want to make a point in this connection that I made previously in an agricultural debate, and I suggest it is a matter that Deputy Donnelly might consider in relation to his particular criticism and condemnation of the Prices Tribunal. I always give them the apology that they could not perform the task they were given to do; it is not because of weakness in the individual; it is simply that the job could not be done.  I asked previously in this House how it has come about that, almost without exception, tariff policies are condemned in countries where Labour Governments rule.  Even when Labour Parties are in Opposition and are in strength they condemn tariff policies. There is one notable exception&mdash;Australia. I think Australia as an exception very definitely and glaringly shows up the reason why there is so much Labour opposition to tariffs.  In Australia there is a Wages Board.  It is manned by a majority of those interested in the employees, and that being the case, the increased cost of living can almost immediately be met by an increased wage.</P>

      <P>This is a curious Bill.  I do not rise for the purpose of opposing it, but I think it is just as well that some comments should be <Col N="1848" /> made on the Bill and the philosophy behind it.</P>
      <P>It would be late in the day now to raise objections to the rewards that have been given to practically everybody connected with the Sinn Féin revolution.  Everyone who has had what is called a &ldquo;national record&rdquo; in connection with that revolution has, by this time, if he has lived to tell the tale, cashed in on it to a greater or lesser degree.  I could have no complaint to make of that if I were sure that all those who think that this State is good enough to take a pension from would also take the view that this State is good enough to be loyal to and that they would accept its laws.  I think it is time that people who are getting pensions from this State should, all of them, realise that it is inconsistent with that to belong to any sort of organisation which seeks to disregard the laws of this State and to overthrow it by force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the men who are affected by this particular Bill have got certain definite and respectable claims upon our sympathy.  They did in fact suffer for their action and some of them are in need and in poverty at this moment.  Those two things do give them a real claim upon our sympathy, a claim that was not possessed by some of those who in the past received pensions. Moreover they have this negative claim upon us that they committed no assassinations themselves and they did not betray any of their comrades to the bullet of the assassin. But at the same time it does strike one as curious that people who of their own free will went into the British Army, not as conscripts or even in answer to the appeal of John Redmond, the Irish national leader, to join up and take part in the European War for the purpose of saving civilisation and for the purpose of drawing the different sections of Irishmen closer together; it does strike one as curious that men who went into the British Army for neither of these reasons, who went in because they chose to, themselves, and who took the oath of allegiance to the King and <Col N="1849" /> entered an ancient, historic and glorious regiment and by so doing took its traditions into their keeping&mdash; should be given a reward which is denied to persons whose patriotism prevented them from going into the British Army at all.  It is a case apparently of there being more joy over the sinner who finds repentance than over the 99 who did not need it.  I am not objecting to it or opposing it, only I do think that one wants to put in a caveat, that one does not want public opinion to take the view that what these men did was something entirely praiseworthy. Quite candidly I do not think it was praiseworthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say why I do not think so.  It is because I have not got quite to the point of accepting the view that an oath can be regarded as an empty formula.  That is my reason in the first place, and in the second place I do not like the instability that their action displays. There have always been two different points of view that might be quite honestly taken by Irish Nationalists. There was the Irish Nationalist who considered that no sort of terms should be made with the British Empire and that we should devote ourselves to revolution.  There was the other sort of Irish Nationalist who took the view that the best way to work towards getting self-government was to accept the Crown and the Empire and to develop within that framework.  Obviously if these men were Nationalists, as I presume they were, as well all are, they took the second view.  They went into the British Army of their own free will, took the oath of allegiance of their own free will, took upon themselves the obligation of maintaining the splendid traditions of the Connaught Rangers, and yet in spite of that they mutinied while in the service of the Crown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The action of the Black and Tans did exasperate, but it does not follow that that exasperation justifies going back on the oath they had taken.  Moreover, that was not given as the reason for the mutiny.  According to the speech we have heard from the Minister, their objection was not confined to the Black and Tans.  According to his speech they demanded that the British forces should be withdrawn from Ireland altogether&mdash;the best disciplined as well as the worst, the Regular Army as well as the Black and Tans. According to the speech of the Minister, and according to the statements that they themselves have made, statements that have appeared in the Irish Press, they flew the flag of the republic and declared themselves as being in favour of the republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that it does not seem to me wholly admirable that people fly from one extreme to another.  I can conceive even very moderate Nationalists having been unwilling to go into the British Army before the war.  I can conceive still more easily their being unwilling to do so after the war, after the Rising of 1916 had taken place, after the great anti-conscription movement, and after Sinn Féin had become the dominating factor in Irish politics.  But if people were willing, after all these things, to go into the British Army, it does not seem praiseworthy that they should be so unstable as to turn completely round in a year or two.  It is true that fearful brutalities were committed by the Black and Tans.  It is equally true that fearful brutalities were committed by Sinn Féin, and moreover that Sinn Féin began it.  Obviously there was more excuse for those trying to free their country than there was for those who were trying to keep the country in subjection.  Still, as far as brutality is concerned, it has always been our experience in Irish history that it has <Col N="1851" /> been the extremists who have brought the brutality down upon us, active brutality as opposed to steady repression.</P>
    <P>Instability has been a strikingly frequent characteristic of Irish extremists.  We all know that the republican Wolfe Tone applied to the British Government for employment over and over again in the course of his career.  We know that Roger Casement spent most of his life in the employment of the British Government and that he accepted a title from the British Government.</P>

I think that there is much more to be accomplished by taking a moderate line and holding steadily to that.  These poor men took action in which, I am sure, they felt they were justified, but I do not admit that they were heroes, and I do not want them to be held up as heroes or as an example to be followed. Truth has many facets.

      <P>I am not going to oppose this Bill, but I thought it desirable to make these observations, because I think it is very easy for the moral sense of the community to be led astray by the sort of language that is used in connection with achievements of the kind that are rewarded by this Bill.  What the State is doing for these men I regard as an act of grace.  I do not regard these pensions as something that they have a right to demand.  The thing, however, that affects me most is that these men, in fact, have suffered for what they did and that many of them are in actual need.  The Minister, perhaps, has told us less than he might have told us.  For instance, he gave us a list of the terms of imprisonment to which these men were sentenced, but I should like the Minister to tell us what portion of the sentences they did in fact serve.  I presume that they did not serve the full term of the heavy sentences mentioned here.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to inform the House on this point.</P>
      <P>I hope that this Bill will serve the general cause of conciliation and goodwill. Certainly, any observations I have made upon what I conceived to be the principles behind the Bill are not intended to have an effect contrary to the spirit of conciliation and goodwill. I feel no hostility to the people affected, but I have noticed a tendency, in what has appeared in the Press on their behalf, to hold them up as heroes and as entitled to claim from the State a good deal more than is contained in this Bill.  In these claims I cannot see my way to concur.</P>

      <P>Speaking about the allusions to the instability of the Connaught Rangers by Deputy MacDermot, I think that he justified their change by one allusion.  He said that if men take up a certain position and, after a lapse of time, find that they are being forced to do something which is manifestly against the laws of justice, they have the right to withdraw from the position.  Personally, I agree with Deputy MacDermot this far, that in ordinary circumstances, and even in extraordinary circumstances, if men have given a pledge of loyalty that they should withdraw from it without mutiny.  I grant that.  I myself was in the same position at one time as the Connaught Rangers found themselves in India.  I went as far as I could to withdraw openly and without mutiny.  But men sometimes find themselves in the position that they get orders which are against the laws of justice that they cannot obey.  A number of these Connaught Rangers had joined up at John Redmond's request to fight for small nations. After the war they were given inducements to stay on in the British Army and were transferred to India.  When they were serving in India they found <Col N="1855" /> that the Empire which asked them to fight for small nations had started to crush their own small nation.</P>

      <P>The real crushing started here some time in the spring of 1919 during the Black and Tan war.  We are talking about one particular phase. These men continued in the army after the war and they were sent to India.  In 1920, after Lloyd George had scoured England for a lot of ruffians to send over here, this mutiny took place. I think that their action was altogether praiseworthy and that if Deputy MacDermot thought a little bit deeper about it than he has done he would admit it was praiseworthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that these men were not themselves called upon to perform any act of injustice and, so far as our grievances against Great Britain are concerned, those grievances are of very old standing. To my mind, more excuse could be found for what Great Britain was doing in 1919 than could be found for what she was doing, say, in 1913 at the time of the Curragh mutiny and the Ulster Volunteers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue too long with the Deputy.  He can keep his own opinion.  My opinion is that in the circumstances the Connaught Rangers were altogether praiseworthy in doing what they did.  The British, who had originally invited a number of Irishmen to fight for small nations, at the end of the war, when it suited their purpose, started in here to crush this small nation and used methods that even the Germans did not use against the Belgians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a statement just now that is perhaps open to misconstruction. If the Minister would allow me I should like to make it plain. I, personally, found the Curragh mutiny more infuriating, and I found the toleration of the Ulster Volunteers more infuriating, than anything that the British did after the war, because <Col N="1856" /> before the war they had no sort of provocation, but after the war they had the provocation of the Sinn Féin revolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that there are a number of people who agree with Deputy MacDermot in that.  If the Ceann Comhairle would allow us to discuss the Curragh mutiny from the point of view of any man who supported the Empire, I would say the Curragh mutiny was altogether unjustifiable and the British Government were betraying their trust to the British people when they allowed it to occur.  But the fact of the matter is that it was not the Connaught Rangers who joined up to fight for small nations, who turned completely around.  It was their masters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on an argument which Deputy Donnelly presented me with, drawing an analogy between persons who are in receipt of relief moneys throughout the country and the industrialists of this country, some of whom, to my mind, abuse the relief that has been given to them through tariffs as much as any worker can be accused of abusing the particular money he gets to keep him from starvation and destitution.  If I might get the thread of the argument together again, I am attacking Deputy Donnelly's main thesis, that a tariff policy is bound to be good and cannot have evil results.  I am inclined to point out to Deputy Donnelly, and through him to the House, that if a tariff policy has not been properly conceived, <Col N="1857" /> if the price level is raised too high, if the allowance given to manufacturers to over-charge&mdash;because that, in its essence, is what a tariff is&mdash;is put at too high a point and is abused, then this country is getting no benefit from the tariff policy, although individual manufacturers and their families may.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Moore, I was endeavouring to show that that result of a tariff policy is not one that can commend itself to the people who vote here and is certainly not one that any Deputy would stand before his constituents to explain and justify.  I stated that when tariffs were at a low level and, particularly, when there was the counter weight that prices were eased to the consumer to make up for any increase put upon him by reason of a tariff, then there was an ideal tariff situation, because the industrialists were given a chance to operate the tariff, the workers got employment, the people did not suffer, and the level of the tariff was so low that there could not be anything seriously dubbed profiteering.  The situation is entirely different when tariffs are at a 60 to 80 per cent. level, because then industrialists do undoubtedly take advantage of that, and do overcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, as I see Deputy Dowdall in the House, I should like to remind the House of what was said on two or three occasions with regard to tariffs.  As far as I can remember, Deputy Dowdall has made three comments upon tariffs.  I should like to explain, before I go on to say anything about Deputy Dowdall, that I understand he has, to some extent, attempted to explain away one of these phrases.  I think he has left the second alone and the third I am going to quote from for the first time.  One of the Deputy's statements was that if those who had money and who were making good out of tariffs&mdash;I think his particular phrase was waxing fat on tariffs&mdash;went behind the present Government, they ought to be &mdash;with a rather profane observation &mdash;ashamed of themselves.  The second was when Deputy Dowdall, facing a meeting of a Cork industrial body, said there had been complaints about manufacturers making use of tariffs to charge high prices.  His <Col N="1858" /> comment was that that was what a tariff was for and he personally intended to get as much out of tariffs as he could.  The third was when Deputy Dowdall commented on certain beliefs current in his own Party to the effect that England was on the down grade.  His comment was that he did not believe it was so, but if it was so, that the downfall of England would have been brought about by the interference of the Government and of Government officials in industry and business and he put forward the second leg of that argument by a further statement that England had reached her greatest point of glory industrially at a time when Government interference was at a minimum and Government officials had least of all to do with business.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dowdall was entirely and completely frank with the country in his attitude towards tariffs.  What are tariffs for?  They are to enable manufacturers to charge more for their goods; they are a licence to overcharge in the sense of charging more than before.  Whether they are overcharging in the sense of profiteering depends on themselves to a large extent.  Deputy Dowdall stated the business-man's point of view very frankly&mdash;make as much as you can out of a tariff.  I wonder does Deputy Donnelly begin to think that there is a possibility of tariffs going wrong? Would Deputy Donnelly agree with Deputy Moore that a group of manufacturers and their families are enabled to live in conditions of better comfort than before and give no extra employment to workers; or possibly&mdash;there is another possibility&mdash; giving more employment, but not giving bigger purchasing power?  I could repeat this to drive that argument home.  As one of the community who pays and has to pay a little bit more for tariffed goods, I delight in paying it if I believe that the product of the payment that I and others make is going to relieve unemployment, to get people out of unemployment into active work.  I can rejoice at that without being in the slightest altruistic.  If I get workers out of unemployment into employment there is going to be less necessity for <Col N="1859" /> the dole, less necessity for relief works and less necessity for the taxation to provide these things and I will gain by that in the long run.  But I strongly object to the use of a tariff policy which enables manufacturers and their families to live more luxuriously on what I, and particularly on what the very poorest elements of the community have to pay in the price of tariffed goods, if they do not give a very big increase in employment or, alternatively, while keeping the same number employed, if they do not give a very big increase in purchasing power.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  I am stating the theory which I believe to be a correct theory; I am stating the theory that I will put up on any platform to any group of workers or industrialists and, in the case of the group of industrialists who revile me for what I am saying, I will accuse them of condemning themselves out of their criticism of me because they cannot believe that this country submitted itself tamely to the extortion of money from the consumers, merely to make richer a few industrialists and their families.  The most valuable part of a tariff policy, is that which aims at getting workers into employment or else getting the workers already in employment more wages.  Even if it cost quite a considerable sum, there may be an argument for keeping certain industries alive in order to give occupation to the young people.  But that is not a general argument.  It applies only to particular industries and very small groups of industries.</P>
    <P>Can anybody say that he is certain that the tariff policy has worked successfully? I think we can all agree that it has to this extent, that it has ground money out of the consumers, and amongst the consumers are the very poor, because almost everything that a person eats or wears or uses in ordinary life is tariffed.  I should make this general exception at this point: If I thought all Irish industry depended on tariffs I would despair. I do not think all Irish industry depends on tariffs.  I think a very small proportion of Irish industry depends <Col N="1860" /> on tariffs.  More than that, I think a very much smaller proportion depends on extravagant tariffs that have been given and my main urge at this moment is against extravagant tariffs because the people who get them, ostensibly to use them for the good of the community, are in fact using them for their own benefit.  There is no doubt that the people have been charged more. There is a variety of facts upon which that can be based.  We used to be told that our tariffs were put on merely for the purpose of drawing revenue.  We are told the present tariffs were put on for quite the opposite purpose, and we are told the result will be made apparent in the revenue returns. Nearly £3,000,000 more has been collected from Customs duties compared with what was collected in our time. There is the tax on wheat to come off that and the few that were deliberately and cold-bloodedly put on articles of food, on articles of consumption, on the workingman.  I think it was the argument of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that the workingman must pay, that he must be taught it is his duty to pay.  There has been a considerable increase in the revenue derived from these tariffed articles.</P>
    <P>It is not a remote jump from that fact to another fact.  One cannot deduce from that, that the burden that is being borne by the consumers should be reflected if there is a benefit corresponding to the sacrifice in extra purchasing power amongst the community. But there is something to be examined when it is discovered that the Customs duties under a so-called protection Government, not a revenue-collecting Government, are bringing in £3,000,000 more than they did at the height of our taxation on dutiable articles.  There is this other fact to be observed.  Supposing one were able to get a segregation of these articles and find out that only half of them, representing £1,500,000, belonged to articles which are supposed to be in process of manufacture at home, that is not a tax on the consumer; it is part of it, but it is not it all.  If one discovered in a particular category of articles that the Customs duty brought in <Col N="1861" /> £250,000 and that there is an average 60 per cent. tariff on all this group of articles, the £250,000 only arises from the people who cannot get a particular class of article in that group they require at home, or can get it cheaper even though there is a 60 per cent. tariff on it.  But taking the people who are buying articles under a protection of 60 per cent., that is nowhere reflected in Customs duty, but it is reflected in the home budget.  Supposing the industrialists under those tariffs on those classes of goods have raised prices to within 10 per cent. of what the incoming article bearing 60 per cent. tariff would be sold at, for every article sold the consumer is bearing some portion of a fine imposed on him in relief of Irish manufacture. It is very difficult indeed to find out what the amount of that may be, but, at any rate, that there are millions in it is unquestionable.  What is the other side?  What satisfaction are people in this country getting from tariffs?</P>

      <P>Tariffs on the descending scale are only the first point; quotas are the second.  Reserved commodities are a danger which can only be vaguely conceived.  On this matter of tariff there is an interesting sidelight of what might be done in Ireland at a particular time, and which I thought some Labour member might have adverted to a long time ago.  Every intelligent Labour man, and every Socialist, must have James Connolly's &ldquo;Labour in Irish History&rdquo; on his shelf.  I think that, as a thesis of a philosophical kind, was exploded, but he does make comments on certain facts that he said he found, regarding two or three illuminating statements as quotations, if only from the angle of showing the danger inherent in a tariff situation.  Speaking about the time of Grattan's Parliament, James Connolly makes certain statements of facts and draws certain conclusions from them.  He rather hostilely criticises the statement of those who said that there was a wonderful improvement in this country when Grattan's Parliament was set up. In particular he alludes to those people <Col N="1862" /> who said that it was a marvellous tribute to the attractiveness of Irish character, and a sound argument for Irish Nationalists in those days, that a group of people were found in the State, at the time of the setting up of Grattan's Parliament, who turned from being Unionist to being Irish, and became far more Irish than the Irish themselves.  He examines that, and finds that most of it was due, not to the attractiveness of Irish character but to the credulity and gullibility of Irish character that allowed themselves, under Grattan's Parliament, to be fleeced for the benefit of a small number of Irish industrialists who, as in the case at the present moment, were of foreign origin.  The successful industrialist under Grattan's Parliament had no touch of Irish origin.</P>

      <P>Let me go on.  Is Deputy Donnelly going to have his faith shaken in Griffith by a mere instance of what a superficial examination will reveal?  Has it not struck him as peculiar how so-called Unionists, over-night; became the strongest Nationalist supporters of the Grattan Parliament?  Would it not strike him as peculiar that if he ran over the list he would find quite a number of people who could not be classed as republicans here, and are now strong republicans &mdash; stronger than Deputy Donnelly himself?  Deputy Donnelly has not his fingers in the industrial problem.  Some of those people have. I would like to see a very critical examination made of some of the factories that some of those quick-change artistes in politics run, to find out how many extra employees they have, to find out at what price their goods were sold, to see what percentage of the profits of their factories is going to workers and what percentage is retained in the hands of the industrialists themselves, and remains here after the spending by the industrialist and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>James Connolly further makes examination with regard to wages rates, and gives quotations.  All he says is that he could draw no conclusion that the success of Grattao's <Col N="1863" /> Parliament penetrated far into Munster, pre-dissolution of the Union and after.  Does Deputy Donnelly ever stop to consider what are the wages that are being paid at the present moment?  Does he know that there is a considerable decrease and that the decrease is very striking?  Does he know that in fertilisers the wages per head of those employed, as between 1931 and 1934, shows a decrease of as much as £26 per man?  Does he know that in the clothing industry there is a decrease of £5 per man, and that in hosiery it is down by £5 per man? Does he know that in the jam and confectionery business wages are down £5 per man; in the tobacco trade £6 per man; brick making £13, matches £10; engineering trades £19, and boots and shoes by £19 per man?</P>
    <P>I do not want these figures to be taken as absolutely fixed calculations. There may be some explanation.  The explanation may be that in order to get employment as well as for stricter business reasons, wages would be lower.  It may be that out-workers play some part in it, although I always discredited the argument that there is so much juvenile employment.  That cannot be shown.  But for some reason or another, although we are in a heavily practical régime, and the costs to the community are increasing, wages, that is the actual money received by workers, shows a decrease in most groups of the practical industries.  Now, as to the actual moneys received by the workers, you have the fall ranging from £5 per head up to as high as £26 per head.  It may be supposed the wages, the actual money received, was at the same point as it was in 1931, but it is not.  I do not think that Deputy Donnelly would be bold enough to claim that the same value could be got for £1 to-day as used to be got for it in former years. The real value of money has gone down and that must be related to the actual wages paid and to the actual purchasing power of the wages paid.  That leads to the third point, in relation to numbers.  On this I have argued at length.  That is to me the solid basis on which to raise any argument on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> I believe employment is increasing in certain areas of work.  I believe it is decreasing in other areas of work.  I believe the net gain, as far as numbers are concerned, is to be found entirely and completely in three items of work, namely, building, relief works and the sugar beet industry.  The campaign arising in connection with sugar beet is not very old, but were we not assured by the President that the numbers that would be employed in the three factories where sugar is manufactured, would be between 2,500 and 3,000 most of the year, and 900 all the time?</P>
    <P>Let us take the remnant of the 2,500 after subtracting the 900.  I am not sure whether the figures were meant one to include the other.  Let us take it that the 2,500 included the 900.  They are about 1,600 campaign-season people and there are about 900 all-the-year round people.  The part-time people would be employed about three months.  That is equivalent to about 400 people employed all the time.  That represents about 1,000 people in the sugar beet factories. I am not speaking of the people in the fields.  I am speaking only of those in insurable occupations whose cards must be stamped, the money that is paid in this way going to swell the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The figure is about 1,000.  I take the old calculation I have so often taken and I do not see how we can get away from it.  If my figures are right, the only way my argument can be countered is by showing that there is a very big number of people in insurable occupation for whom cards should be stamped and for whom cards are not being stamped.  I do not believe that there is any great non-compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Certainly, it is not sufficient to make any big change in the figures.</P>
    <P>Taking the matter roughly&mdash;I am not going into odd thousands&mdash;in my last year of office, the unemployment insurance fund showed an increase over the year before.  The present figures show an increase over my last year.  I shall take the old calculation. Roughly speaking, if we take, <Col N="1865" /> as our basis of comparison, a man in employment for 52 weeks of the year, that man, being in insurable occupation for 52 weeks, must be represented by £4 in the unemployment insurance fund.  If I take it&mdash;as I can show by one particular calculation&mdash;that there was £60,000 extra in the fund between my last year and the year preceding it, it means that there were 15,000 extra people employed whole-time in insurable occupations.  The fund has gone up by roughly £100,000 since.  Divide that by four and the comparable figures are: In one year, I showed 15,000, or thereabouts, of an increase and there has been an increase of 25,000 since.  Is that increase of 25,000 the result of tariffs? I say no.  At least, I say that if 10,000 people can be shown to have been put into occupation through tariffs, 10,000 must have disappeared for some reason or other.</P>
    <P>I turn to the Minister's calculation of a particular date.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce got so alarmed in the year 1934 over all the comments being made about the huge number of people reporting as unemployed that he called together the Press.  On the 26th October, 1934, he issued a statement to the Press.  I always thought that the amazing thing about that statement was that the Minister in charge of industrial development, who felt that the people were being unduly alarmed over the &ldquo;unemployeds&rdquo; and their numbers, when calling in the Press to reassure the public through them, founded his reassuring comments not on industry but on house-building and relief works. He estimated the direct employment on house construction in May, 1934, at 21,500 people.  To get that related to the comparison I sought to make, two or three things had to be done.  You had to have an examination made as quickly as possible to find out whether or not the May figures would be the maximum figures.</P>
    <P>I should have imagined that, if the Minister were dealing honestly with the public, he would have taken a month which would have shown the all-the-year-round figure.  Let us take it that he was frightened by the numbers <Col N="1866" /> reporting as unemployed and that he took the best possible figure for himself. I asked questions firstly from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and afterwards from his colleague, the Vice-President, to find out whether house-building was or was not an industry in which there was great fluctuation in regard to the numbers employed.  I found that there was not much variation.  In the first figures given me, there was not a variation of 1,000 in 7,000.  Later, the figures showed some variation but nothing more than that.  I had to find out one or two other things.  I was able to assume, as I think most people would assume, from the figures of the Vice-President, that house-building is not subject to very marked fluctuation between the winter and the summer period.  Employment in it is very much the same in both seasons.  When speaking of these figures, 1,000 makes very little difference.</P>
    <P>I asked the Vice-President to give me a calculation as to the number of houses that were being built.  He retorted that he could give me statistics only of those houses which were being subsidised&mdash;houses which were being built by private persons, public utility societies and local authorities and which were being subsidised.  I got a calculation and it showed that, if I were to take houses in progress and completed, the 1934 figure was 15,000 houses.  For 1935 the figure was 25,000 and for 1936&mdash;to the 31st March, 1936&mdash; the figure is 38,500.  When the Minister was speaking he referred to &ldquo;direct employment.&rdquo;  He did not depend on subsidised houses.  He depended on those plus whatever houses were being built by private builders, and of the up and down sway in those houses we have no knowledge.  The Departments profess themselves unable to give us the figure.  The only gap to be filled is that of private houses not in receipt of subsidy, because private houses in receipt of subsidy are included.  For 15,000 houses built or in progress, the Minister claimed 21,000 persons employed.  By the 31st March, 1936, that figure for houses had gone to 38,000.  On the 31st March, 1935, it was 25,000.  We get this progress in regard <Col N="1867" /> to the building of subsidised houses&mdash; 15,000, 25,000 and 38,000.</P>
    <P>I have made a calculation and, in that calculation, I am basing myself, as the Minister did, on the unemployment insurance fund for the calendar year, 1935.  At the end of March, 1935, there were 25,000 houses being built or completed.  At the end of March, 1936, that figure had risen to 38,000.  I think it is a calculation I would be allowed to make that, in the calendar year 1935, the figures being between 26,000 and 38,000, I am erring on the moderate side in taking the figure at 30,000.  The Minister claimed 21,000 persons directly employed for 15,000 houses actually built or in progress. For the unemployment insurance year 1935 there were more than double the number of houses being built or completed.</P>
    <P>To what point is the figure of 21,000 persons, directly employed in house-building alone, swollen in 1935?  I think I am moderate again if I say 30,000.  I am putting it up by half. How many of those in this type of construction are new employees?  Again, I put a question to the Vice-President and it appears that the number of houses being built in my last year, with which I am making comparison, represented employment to the extent of 5,000 persons.  If that calculation be correct, or anything like correct, there are about 25,000 persons employed at house-building who were not employed at such house-building before.  There are 1,000 employed in the sugar beet factories.  I think I am going moderate, again, when I say&mdash;I asked for the figures and have not got them yet, but I made a calculation on old figures &mdash;that there are certainly 3,000 more in insurable occupation in the guise of relief works, not being housing, than there were in our time.  If we take the figures 25,000, 3,000 and 1,000, we have almost 30,000 between sugar beet, relief works and housing.  The unemployment insurance fund barely shows an increase of 30,000 people.  If these figures are correct, I want them examined from that point of view&mdash;whether I am right in including house-construction as more or less steady, <Col N="1868" /> and whether the Minister was right in this respect in claiming 21,000 persons. May I point out here that his claim was in respect of those directly employed, and had nothing to do with those in the furnishing trades employed indirectly because of the provision of new houses.  It had nothing to do with any people but those directly employed in the process of house-building.  If I am right in making the calculation I have made, as between the 21,000 persons and the houses then being built, the 25,000 and the 30,000, the increase in the moneys of the unemployment insurance fund can be said to be represented entirely by those engaged in house construction, the sugar beet factories and relief works. I am conscious that there are people employed in industry.  I know there are, but I believe there are not half as many as are claimed.  Let us say that there are 10,000 more employed in tariffed industries than in 1931.</P>
    <P>If these calculations of mine, founded on the income of the unemployment insurance fund, are correct, 10,000 people have got employment in tariffed industries, and 10,000 who were employed in insurable occupations have, in some way or other, gone. If that is the situation, the tariffed industries have not helped us, or, at least, they have not been such an advantage to us as, say, the economic war has been a disadvantage.  Remember, this is all the unemployment insurance fund and, therefore, is dealing entirely with people in insurable occupations.  It has no relation to farmers or their families.  There may be hosts of farmers and their families knocked out of work owing to the non-settlement of the economic war.  They are not reflected in these figures.  They are something beyond that.</P>
    <P>Will Deputy Donnelly come back with me to his argument that Arthur Griffith in deciding for tariff development was Irish, and that anyone who spoke against such development was unIrish because, according to Deputy Donnelly's argument, no development of Irish industry through tariffs could have evil consequences?  Supposing the plus and the minus in the Unemployment Insurance Fund are about equal, <Col N="1869" /> and that that is due to tariffs&mdash;I do not say it is&mdash;and supposing that by making the cost of articles dear to consumers, while not increasing their purchasing power to any extent through wages given in tariffed industries, you find unfortunate men with £1, £2 or £3 weekly faced with an increase in the price of everything, and obviously unable to make the £1 stretch to as many articles as previously, they have to restrict purchases, with an immediate reaction on other trades, the goods of which cannot be bought and the employees of which must go out of occupation.  I do not know if Deputy Donnelly would consider that as rosy a picture as the one his imagination paints.  He tells us what Arthur Griffith said in 1914.</P>

      <P>Any year you like. The Deputy thinks there cannot be evil consequences from tariffs.  I do not say that there are evil consequences. I am speaking rather of the results of tariffs and I say that once you get into the region of 60 per cent. or 80 per cent. tariffs, once you allow a manufacturer a licence to charge 10 per cent. under that point, you are going to have, undoubtedly, very bad effects upon the price of the article, and a bad effect on the cost of living, and unless purchasing power of wages is increased you will, undoubtedly, have a falling off in the demand for certain other articles.  I have been reminded about quotas.  Tariffs are bad enough, but a tariff movement is a sound movement properly managed, tariff management to keep prices low, to see that the benefit is passed on to the worker or to create an extra demand for articles or to try to get industries started.  That type of tariff is sound.  Supposing you have a tariffed industry which allows 60 per cent. or 80 per cent. of a tariff for the asking, and that allows the manufacturer&mdash;because he cannot be prevented &mdash;to raise charges to the point mentioned in Deputy Dowdall's argument, in order to get profits that he thinks he is entitled to get, and supposing you have the community crushed under so big an increase in cost, and that is <Col N="1870" /> multiplied over a big number of articles whose prices are increased, that is a serious situation.  But a tariff is always under control.  It is under the control of the Prices Commission. The Prices Commission simply cannot manage this as we have been shown. I think Deputy Donnelly's view is sound and is a popular one.  The Prices Commission has been condemned by popular opinion.  It is a futile body.  It is not futile in the sense that the members are not exceptionally able but the Commission is not able to do the task put upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tariff weapon is always one which can be turned against the bad manufacturer, because the height of the tariff can be lowered, goods can be let in, and prices can be brought down under the stress of competition.  Alternatively, we have not so many manufacturers here that their employees could not be looked after.  The difficulty about attempting to increase wages in certain tariffed employment, and not to increase them otherwise, is that inequality is brought about, and demands will be made by those in non-tariffed or slightly tariffed industries when they see colleagues in 60 per cent. or 80 per cent. jacked up industries getting increased wages.  Surely workers should be protected to this extent, that whatever benefits accrue to a group of manufacturers from tariffs, some attempt should be made to share them out amongst the workers.  You can do these things.  It takes a lot of effort but it can be done, and it will be done in the end by labour troubles if not in some other way.  You get into a second and a worse region in quotas. You get into an extremely dangerous and I think a completely immoral state of affairs when you have reserved commodities. Let us take any reserved commodity.  There are not so many of them in this country.  A manufacturer is given the sole right to manufacture certain things here which the public must use.  He is protected not merely from outside competition but from internal competition.  No one can set up a factory against him.  He can charge what he likes subject to the will of the Prices Commission, which I regard as being only a bogey, as <Col N="1871" /> most of these people discovered it to be a bogey.  He can charge what he likes.  Who gets the profits?  I did not find it to be notorious that the employees in the few reserved commodities are very generously paid but I found it to be notorious that the public are being very heavily overcharged.  I do not agree with Deputy Moore or that it is a proper return to the community to say: &ldquo;Oh, the manufacturers who are getting these profits will spend them in the country and there will be a diffusion of wealth.&rdquo; There may or may not.  At any rate, there is not the same utility in their spending as there would be on the part of a couple of thousand workers getting wages, or even of the original workers getting better wages.</P>
    <P>When we get to the region of reserved commodities and to the region of quotas, I often wonder how people can justify the capitalistic system at all.  Of course, there is a very dangerous tendency against what I consider to be the useful capitalistic system if too many of the quotas are seen.  Analyse again a reserved commodity as it is operated in this country. A man is given a field for exploitation by means of tariffs.  He can charge what he likes and is subject to no competitive interference.  The fruits of the capitalist system used to be that a man embarked his own capital and took that with his enterprise, brains, energy and ability to get up earlier and to work later, and to get the most, in a sympathetic way, out of the men working under him.  He might have drawn big profits under such a régime, but he was operating against other people in the same system, but if he won out, it was first of all through his courage in embarking his own capital in a particular venture and, secondly, through his energy and ability in getting a return on that capital.</P>
    <P>Why should any man be given unlimited profits in a field that is handed over to him for his sole exploitation?  Although I object to Government interference as a practice, when we have Government interference and have it so widespread as we have, <Col N="1872" /> I cannot understand, when we are in the region of reserved commodities, why the Government do not do as they did in the case of the Sugar Company and a number of other things and say: &ldquo;We shall provide salaries for the managers; we shall give them good pay, and we shall see that we get value for the pay we give them.  If the public are going to be fleeced in the prices charged for the goods, then they shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the profits will go to the Exchequer to swell the revenue.&rdquo;  I think it is an extremely wrong practice that people should have handed over to them some article for exploitation. There is no Government supervision&mdash; I am not sure that Government supervision would be effective&mdash;to see that these people get a certain recognised rate of profit.  They can get two or three times the recognised rate of profit without interference.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke some time ago about industrial disputes.  With conditions such as they are, with wages down in many cases, with very little increases, certainly no increases in the number of workers, I have wondered that there are not more labour disputes, and there are going to be more if this matter is not attended to.  I do not know whether people are going to drift to Communism, but there is going to be a hardening of feeling against the attempt to keep alive the capitalist system under conditions in which we have all of what is described as the vices of the capitalist system with none of its virtues.  The only time that you can get the virtues of the capitalist system is when there is a free field for competition as there can be under the best type of a capitalist régime.  We get under the other system the manufacturers grabbing their profits.  We do not know what they are doing with them.  We do not know whether they are going to put them to reserve, to build up a cushion against a depressed time.  All we do know is that we are being charged more heavily for the same type of article than we were charged when it was allowed to be imported.  We are not aware that there is any great increase in the purchasing power as a result of the handing over of the reserved commodity to <Col N="1873" /> a group of individuals.  The State is getting little or no advantage from that.  That is the worst development of the system under which we are working, and it is increasing.  That is the situation we know to be here as a result of the tariffs.</P>
    <P>I want to have as complete an analysis as is possible of employment in industries that are getting the benefit of protection.  I want to have analysed as well the prices charged to the consumers for the articles so protected. I want a complete exposition of the number of workers, the wages given and if there is anything of a peculiar type in any of these factories &mdash;say the employment of juvenile labour, the employment of outworkers or anything of that kind which would give us on the surface a good view of the situation and a presentation of prices and wages.  In order to get our minds clear on the subject, we ought to know how many people are getting employment on the building of houses in the country, how many are getting employment through relief schemes and how many are getting employment in the sugar beet factories because we know the cost of them.  I have found the figures relating to employment are confined almost entirely to the building industry.  I think there are other signs that that is right.</P>
    <P>I asked a question the other day and we had the illuminating answer from the Vice-President that the indebtedness of local bodies from the 31st March, 1933, to the 31st March, 1935, has gone up by £6,000,000. £6,000,000 in two years! What is that being spent on?  I think everybody is clear that the biggest amount of that is spent on housing.  That is where you are getting your employment from. But we cannot go on increasing the indebtedness of our local authorities by £6,000,000 in every period of two years, apart from the fact that the saturation point in regard to housing must be reached some time.  What is the hope for the future?  If I am right there are about 20,000 or 30,000 employed in house-building.  If it is a fact that whatever gains we have got from the tariffed industries&mdash;leaving everything else out of consideration <Col N="1874" /> except the numbers employed&mdash;have been offset to the point of equalisation by losses, what about the rosy future? During these first four years of 60 and 80 per cent. tariffs, of every inducement to manufacturers to come in&mdash; capital guaranteed to them, capital loaned to them, tariffs promised, quotas established against their competitors, and reserved commodities at certain times&mdash;we have ranged widely over a number of articles.  We have raised the barrier very high indeed and we have it in operation for a bit over three years.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact that the sole gain to the country is the number occupied in house-building our hopes for the future must be very dismal indeed.  Remember we have got to catch up on the problem.  It was said that there were 70,000 out of work in my time.  That figure was examined, analysed and explained.  Assuming that there were 70,000, there are a number of people not reporting at the moment, the Minister having deemed them not to be unemployed.  You do not satisfy people by deeming them to be employed when in fact they are not. It may be a satisfaction to the Minister to have this notional figure of unemployment but it is no satisfaction to the people who cannot get work. There are 117,000 people not fully occupied or not occupied at all at the moment.  We are told that the population of the country has increased or is increasing at the rate of some 50,000 per annum.  The Minister has said, in some of his many speeches, that we have got to look to industry and not to agriculture to take these people off our hands.  The Minister is not making any appreciable progress.  He says now that we have got to go to agriculture and not to industry.</P>
    <P>Lately the tune has changed a bit. Up to about seven or eight months ago the Minister always flattered himself that it was industry would mop up the people who were out of work. We have had an interesting development since.  The Minister goes to industrial dinners and says &ldquo;Remember that agriculture is the basic industry of the country.  Unless that succeeds, industry cannot succeed.&rdquo;  On <Col N="1875" /> the other hand, the Minister for Agriculture goes to farmers' dinners and says &ldquo;We are employing on the land as many as we can.  Industry will have to absorb the remainder.&rdquo;  That is a criss-cross type of argument.  We shall deal with agriculture at another time.  We are on industry at the moment.  There are supposed to be about 20,000 coming of age each year for whom we have to find occupations and there is a large number on our hands.  We have indulged in a very heavy building programme.  We have experimented in a very wide field in this matter, with very high tariffs, and the best we can say is that there has been an increase of 25,000 in the number going into insurable occupations and the most of that has been explained by the activity in house construction.  Now, if that is the case, and if it is not the case I want to be shown how it is not, but if it is the case, then the case for tariffs has not been conclusively proved in this House, even to Deputy Donnelly's satisfaction. Supposing even that we have got 10,000 in, if these 10,000 have been offset by the 10,000 that we have lost from the simple angle of people in employment, we are no better off, but from another angle we are much worse off, because we have undoubtedly been taxed and taxed frightfully to the point of trying to get people into occupation in the last three years; certainly without any spectacular success.</P>
    <P>I have alluded before to the change in the mentality of people.  I was sorry to see that yesterday, again, the Minister decided that he had to go back to it.  This itch for interference in other people's business is desperately on the Minister.  He has not got over it yet.  I have observed several times that there are good lessons to be learned from other countries.  Men should not just be so completely absorbed in their own activities and movements that they cannot look beyond a sort of limited horizon.  The Minister talked of self-sufficiency and search for it.  I wonder has he ever considered the <Col N="1876" /> remarks that emanate from time to time from the Labour Office in Geneva, and in particular has he ever looked at the report of the director of the International Labour Office of two years ago?  In that report there was stressed this which may have some bearing on the problem here.  He said that it might be wise for the representatives of Governments in certain States who were keen on self-sufficiency to stop for a moment and examine what was their position with regard to raw materials. Supposing we accept that as a line for examination, what is our position as regards raw materials?  In our search for self-sufficiency, can we ever reach our objective?  What raw materials have we, what industry is there in this country about which it can be said that, from the production of the raw material to the presentation of the finished product everything can be done at home? When you name about three things you are finished.  If we had concentrated on these three things we might have got a great deal of development in a short space of time without a great deal of sacrifice to consumers. But we have scattered ourselves over all sorts of peculiar articles, and all in a search for self-sufficiency.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it is a peculiar thing that the countries that led us into this morass are now the most anxious to get us out as far as their example can help anybody in their direction. I have always felt that when people are writing about the last decade, or the last 15 years, they will certainly put their fingers on the United States of America and on France as the two countries that led the way in the raising of tariffs; in all these matters of protection, rates of exchange, quotas and limitations of different types.  But it is an amazing thing that in the last 18 months both the French Government and the American Government have been found to enunciate publicly their view that self-sufficiency is a myth, and that economic nationalism has led to the impoverishment of the peoples.  That was stated by the French representative who was Prime Minister for three or four <Col N="1877" /> months and is now the Foreign Minister in France.  He stated clearly to his House of Representatives that no example could be given where economic nationalism has proved a success.  At the last meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, in the autumn of last year, the American representative, Mr. Cordell Hull, brought before the Economic Committee what was an expression of the American point of view, that economic nationalism was a failure, and a resolution that the League should institute a study of a series of products with a view to getting tariff barriers lowered and international trade revived.  More recently still, at a meeting in March of the Labour Office, the American representative again proposed that an inquiry be undertaken into the effect that changes in commercial policy may have on the employment and wages, and the real income of workers.  He stated that the United States had gained experience in this connection and had taken certain measures towards freeing the channels of international trade.  He added this, that it was a proven fact to-day that the closing of frontiers by tariff walls did not protect workers against unemployment, and that if employment was to be encouraged tariff barriers must be lowered.</P>
    <P>The representative of, I suppose, the best placed industrial community in modern Europe was on the same line. The late Minister for Foreign Affairs in Czecho-Slovakia, and now its President, instituted a series of conversations with his neighbours, the old Austria-Hungarian Empire and Yugo Slavia.  His view was expressed in this way.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Economic nationalism has not proved a success; it is not a success with us; we must open up the barriers that are against us, and in complement to that we must lower our barriers to these countries that are around us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The dictator of Fascist Italy inaugurated a series of conversations with the States surrounding him.  He signed three or four commercial pacts as between Italy, Austria, Hungary <Col N="1878" /> and Yugo-Slavia, and his phrase in introducing these was that they must exploit the complementary national economies of all these countries, because not one of these countries can live without the other, and if there is to be any increase in productivity and wealth they must lower their barriers as regards rates of exchange, quotas and the rest that they had erected against each other.</P>
    <P>Last autumn when the American Congress was going out of session, President Roosevelt asked for an amazing power to be given to himself, and that was&mdash;without calling together the elected representatives of the people he could lower any tariff in existence in America by 50 per cent., but that if he wanted to lower it by more than 50 per cent. he had to call Congress together.  He stated his reasons for asking this amazing power, and they were that America, by the hard process of learning, had discovered that they must depend for employment for their workers on their export trades, that they must get other countries to lower barriers against their products, and that the only way in which that could be done was by America lowering her barriers against the goods of the countries with which America wanted to trade.</P>
    <P>All round the world, except where you have a peculiar situation, such as in Germany, owing to the Treaty of Versailles&mdash;even Germany is trying to get out of the net but cannot, and if Deputy Donnelly will read what the Controller of the Reichsbank has said he will find that if Germany is struggling behind tariff barriers it is not of her own wish&mdash;all round the world the movement is not, remember, towards complete free trade but towards freer trade.  This country in the teeth of all that, despite all the sad experience of all those other countries that have been wallowing in the mess for the last five or six years, is able to produce a Minister who yesterday was buoyant about economic nationalism and self-sufficiency.  He criticises anybody who wants even to slow down the processes that he has adopted for building up tariff walls. The united wisdom of the world must <Col N="1879" /> be worth something, and it would be no harm if Ministers in this country would at this moment confess that their rosy optimism about tariffs before they came into office has had another colour put upon it by their experience in office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly has spoken of our criticising so fiercely all that has been said about tariffs.  I will continue to criticise the sort of folly which was responsible for getting the Government elected.  The Deputy asked me if I had any of the advertisements.  I told him I had this one&mdash;that fatuity about the more and more money and why should it ever stop.  If there is no reason why it should stop why are we not getting the stream coming a bit more abundantly and copiously towards us?  Need I repeat again the nonsense that was talked about this country having a more obvious cure for unemployment than any other? President de Valera was annoyed with the advertisement about Hoover and MacDonald and Hindenburg not being able to meet the problem of unemployment in their countries.  His answer was if those statesmen had the cure staring them in the face as we have here they would have ended unemployment long ago.  What is it?  Why stand staring the cure in the face?  Then we have the Minister's famous folly:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we would only do this, produce our own food, make our own clothes and build our own houses, there would not be enough idle men in the country to do the work.  We would have to call back some of the 250,000 who emigrated within the past nine years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not to be outdone, the President gets up on a platform a few days later and says that if the country were to stop buying the foreigners' produce we could support a population of 17,000,000.  Is it any wonder that people would criticise?  That is what we want done in the country&mdash;to call back the emigrants and have a population of 17,000,000.</P>

      <P>He might have said we could support a population of 20,000,000 under other conditions if this country had got an industrial start at the time when we were prohibited from having any start in industry.  If we had been allowed to keep our population here when the agricultural industry could have supported vastly more, we might have got a far bigger population, but that is no argument faced as we are with about 3,000,000 people who have got to bear the huge taxation which there has been for the last three years.  Having borne it&mdash;not with any great willingness; nobody ever does bear taxation willingly&mdash; they find that there is no greater number of men in employment, and they find that their burdens in the way of unemployment assistance have not been relieved as they should be relieved if there were factories giving employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly finally is of the opinion that Fine Gael has adopted the Fianna Fáil policy.  I tried to explain that in relation to certain remarks made by Deputy MacDermot the other night.  He was not here. I should like now to explain the same thing to Deputy Donnelly.  This Party stands for continuing even things that they think are not economically sound, for the reason that Deputy Donnelly read out of that particular piece of literature&mdash;that it is not a good thing to have an economic revolution as an aftermath of each general election in this country.  You will not get stability that way.  As far as agriculture is <Col N="1881" /> concerned&mdash;I only touch on this as it is in the argument&mdash;I do not believe a bit in wheat as a method of getting a big number of workers employed here in an economic fashion.  I am sorry we ever started the beet experiment ourselves, and therefore sorrier still to see that extended.  I do not think there is any good in it, but the country must learn by experience between two policies when they are both getting the same chance, and we have the belief that if we were to continue subsidising wheat at the time when we will get, as we can get, the British market open for our old type of agricultural export, wheat will die a natural death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it has got to be tried out, even though it costs the country something.  It is better to have that tried out on an equal basis than to have some other set of people, five or ten years hence, again deluding the unfortunate electors into the belief that there is an absolute windfall in wheat growing.  With regard to tariffs, we had an experiment in tariffs ourselves.  I think we had a better tariff policy than the present Government. It was not so spectacular.  We did not give industrialists so much chance of making money, but we did try to equalise the sacrifices that we thought the people would have to make through consumption, by giving them remissions in other ways.  We think it is a wise and proper thing to continue tariffs for a couple of reasons. One is that people have put their money into the country.  That has got to be protected.  We will want money again and we cannot do what the Minister did with regard to railway stock.  We cannot do that.  The second reason is that we can continue tariffed industries, but with a difference, and I am strong for that difference.  I see no good in continuing industries that are limping along under a tariff&mdash;limping as far as the worker is concerned, and speeding gloriously as far as the manufacturer is concerned.  I think that on examination some of those tariffs would show either that the tariff can be reduced, consequently bringing down <Col N="1882" /> the prices which consumers are being charged, or, if that is not the case, and if the consumer has still got to pay heavily for the goods, the benefit of that should be more evenly divided between workers in the particular type of factory and the employer.  You can continue, but continue with a difference.</P>
      <P>When I mention capital, may I say this: this country has got capital invested in it recently.  I wonder do any of the labour people in this country ever stop to think of the cost of it. Money is about the cheapest thing in the world at the moment, outside this country, but the people of this country will be faced hereafter with the desperate problem that industrialists who have been brought in here with the promise and with the achievement of certain big profits will certainly look to a continuance of that, and if any of these people have got to be bought out hereafter&mdash;if there is some scheme about purchasing out, say, people making reserved commodities, as there was in the case of transport vehicles&mdash;you may find that somebody will settle the price upon so many years' purchase of particular profits allowed to be made in this country as a return in money at a time when money is, as I say, the cheapest thing in the whole world.  The workers hereafter will have on their shoulders the payment of an extra I, 2 or 3 per cent. more than what should be allowed under the present conditions of trade.  We are for continuing the tariff policy&mdash;we had a good one&mdash;but it is being run at a dangerous speed at the moment.  There are a great many casualties, and we will have to observe certain warnings apparent now from the way it has been run.  If tariffs can give employment without offsetting that employment by losses they are good, and good judgment can be passed on them; but if they are not, with due respect to the workers employed and the people who have put their money into them, they will have to be replaced by some more productive type of industry&mdash;productive in the sense of giving better production in the way of wealth at home and more employment to men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered why the <Col N="1883" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce could find it possible to shut his eyes to the things going on around him, but he explained himself recently.  In December of last year, he went to the Insurance Institute of Ireland and spoke there and you get his political philosophy in a few short phrases indeed:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a certain amount of Couéism in public affairs.  If everybody believes that things are going to improve, they generally do.  The reverse is also the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>December was an odd time for the voice of cuckoo-ism to be heard in the land, but we did get it, and that is what is carrying Deputy Donnelly and his Party along&mdash;believe that everything is going to be right and it will. Why not analyse a few figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the reverse was operating then.  It works both ways, the Minister announced.  Do not let us have Couéism either for or against, either towards optimism or towards pessimism.  Examine; analyse the figures; and let us assume with Deputy Donnelly that everybody is almost automatically in favour of tariffs because this country has been left industrially denuded; but let us understand that tariffs are a dangerous type of policy, dangerous to the consumer, unless there is some immediate benefit coming in a roundabout way to the consumer via the worker.  There are quite a number of figures that can be analysed.  They show, I think, not very many men employed so far as industry is concerned, but quite a number, so far as house-building is concerned. The conclusion I draw is that house-building <Col N="1884" /> cannot go on.  We cannot pile up these debts.  We cannot provide the money, apart from the fact that there will soon be more houses than there are people to occupy them, unless we call back some of the 100,000 who have emigrated, just to house them comfortably while there is no work for them.</P>
      <P>I pivot my whole argument on that. If it is house-building that is keeping up the number of employed in this country, it is a passing phase, and it is a dangerous thing to build a policy completely and entirely on that. Industry will have to be examined to see what it has given in the way of employment and we shall have to find out where have the losses&mdash;the Minister's word was &ldquo;casualties&rdquo;&mdash; occurred and why.  I cannot say that it is Party loyalty only that makes me argue that the tariff policy, as run by the Fianna Fáil Government, has not proved a success.  Their building programme has, but their building programme is based on the capacity of the local authorities to borrow money, and £3,000,000 a year for two years is a very heavy sum to involve in the building of houses in this country.  If tariffs cannot do better than that, we ought to reverse engines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): There are one or two things I want to say with reference to some industries.  Deputy McGilligan told us that the industrialist is just as much in the position of drawing a dole as the workman is when he is unemployed.  Of course, that is true, and more true in respect of the industrialist than in respect of the workman, because the industrialist may put into an industry inherited capital, whereas the workingman can only put into industry the labour he has himself.  Industry, to my mind, is service to the community, and if the organised State protects a service that protection ought to be afforded to everybody engaged in that industry. At the present time, that protection is not being afforded to everybody engaged in that service, and the Minister cannot say that he has not sufficient machinery to afford protection to everybody engaged in that service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will develop that in a moment and indicate what form of protection I want given.  At the present time, the industrialist seems to be getting nine-tenths of the protection&mdash;practically all the protection &mdash;and the worker seems to be giving all the service.  Let us take the woollen industry, for instance.  The Minister has ample powers to see that the worker in that industry is protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Protected in the matter of conditions of employment and protected in the matter of wages.  Surely, if the industrialist is entitled to be protected against unfair conditions of competition, the worker within that industry is entitled to protection when he is producing that wealth for the community?  Both are service to the community and the worker is entitled to get protection for that service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advocating that, notwithstanding the poor effect of certain boards in respect of industry, and how ineffectively and inadequately they afford protection, they at least afford some protection to the workers in industry, and I am referring in particular to the woollen industry.  The Minister has power to establish a trade board for any industry in which it appears to him that wages are unduly low or that there is no effective machinery for regulating wages.  These two conditions are amply fulfilled in the woollen industry.  I do not know whether the Minister has satisfied himself that the wages paid in the woollen industry are sufficiently high.  I know there is a woollen mill in my county, the Thomond Woollen Mills, more commonly known as Messrs.  James O'Flynn and Son or Company&mdash;I do not know which.  That mill got from the taxpayers of this State, under legislation, something like £12,000 at <Col N="1886" /> a very low rate of interest.  The owner invested that money in the development of his mill and, I am told, doubled his output.  One would imagine that the conditions of employment and wages paid in that mill would bear some relation to the cheap rate at which he got his capital and to the condition in which he was put by the present Government, but there is no relation whatever.  Representations have repeatedly been made to me with respect to that particular mill. Boys have been brought from the Artane Industrial Schools and put working there at 12/6 per week.  The position was so hard that the boys were not paid the money; it was paid over to local women to maintain the boys.  The women found, however, that they could not maintain the boys because the fines were so heavy that in some cases 5/- or 6/- was the only payment the boys got.  Therefore, that position had to be discontinued.  It is a position about which the Minister should satisfy himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have here an extract from a letter written by somebody who knows what he is talking about in reference to this matter.  The extract is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There was an investigation at O'Flynn's Woollen Factory in regard to the fines and workers' wages. Since then the fines are much the same as before, but to-day (28/3/36) Mr. O'Flynn put up a notice stating that the workers would be paid at 12 o'clock, that they would work until 1 o'clock and that at 12.45 they must repay to the clerk in the office the amount of the fines.  It is further stated that anybody who does not pay up the fines won't be allowed to start on Monday.  This is a new move... The fines to-day were from 1/- to 4/6.  Altogether he collected £3 in fines.  This firm got a loan from the Government at 2½ per cent. and the loan is costing him £250 a year, but he collects most of that amount, certainly not less than £200 a year, in fines from the weavers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He pays the interest and, possibly, the sinking fund of the loan by means of fines that he gets from the workers. It is nearly time the Minister took some action on this matter.</P>

      <P>Under the existing law if the Minister himself is satisfied that in any trade or industry wages are unduly low, or where there is no effective machinery for regulating wages, he can set up a trade board.  Is the Minister satisfied that wages from 5/- to 12/6, or, if you like, to 20/- a week, are proper wages where £12,000 of the taxpayers' money has been given to subsidise an industry?  Is the Minister satisfied under the circumstances that that is a satisfactory wage?  Will he go in and make an Order setting up a trade board which would have power to fix a minimum rate of wages for all workers employed in woollen mills?  Will the Minister make inquiries into this matter?  As to what wages are paid by Messrs. J. O'Flynn and Sons, Sixmilebridge, I had an inquiry the other day as to some contracts placed by the Government with that firm.  There is a fair wages clause in connection with all those Government contracts and I made inquiry as to whether that clause was operative or inoperative, or whether such a clause was inserted in these contracts.  What is the good of having such a clause when this sort of thing is carried on?  Before the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs placed a contract with Messrs. O'Flynn and Sons, Sixmilebridge, he ought to satisfy himself that fair wages were paid by this firm and that the conditions were such as would give the workers something approaching even a decent standard of living.  No such inquiries had been made, and I want to put to the Minister now that this protection that he has afforded this firm at the expense of the State, to the tune of £12,000, should percolate to the lowest worker in that industry. It is time that were done and it is time that the Government, after giving that loan of £12,000 at 2½ per cent. interest, should see that the firm gave some consideration to the workers. Further, before a Government Department placed a contract with these mills they should see that decent wages were paid there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to underline one or two points made by Deputy McGilligan.  I really do not desire to <Col N="1889" /> add anything to the general statement made by Deputy McGilligan because I find that he has covered in detail and with accuracy the programme which our Party have and that he has described accurately the attitude of our Party to the general question of tariffs, protection and quotas.  He referred to the potential evils of tariffs; to the potential evils of quotas and the almost inevitable evils of monopolies.  I want to underline for the House the kind of evil that is arising in connection with one monopoly of the few already created. That is the evil that is arising in connection with the Irish thread monopoly granted to the factory at Westport. It has been argued by the Minister that the danger of the public being exploited by such monopolics is remote, because, in preparing the licences under which they operate, he inserts conditions providing that the interests of the consumers will be adequately protected.  When he proceeded to issue these licences for an Irish trade monopoly he assured this House that one of the conditions would be that the thread would be sold to the Irish consumers at prices and qualities identical with those charged by the British concern to their customers in Great Britain.  When that firm originally started its operations in this country, for about six weeks they did make available supplies on the same terms to their Irish customers as their Irish customers had enjoyed from the merchants in Great Britain theretofore.  But shortly afterwards this astute alteration was made: The price quoted for an ordinary reel of sewing cotton was 16/9 per gross of reels of 120 yards each.  It is extremely difficult to get the public to understand the technicalities of a trade like the thread trade.  Sewing thread is sold in a number of different qualities and these qualities are indicated by numerals.  No. 10 is for purpose; No. 20 is for another purpose; No. 30 for a different purpose; No. 40 for a fourth purpose, and so on.  Nos. 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 are all for different sorts of thread.  Now certain merchants may require only No. 10 thread; if they were to buy No. 40 or No. 60 they <Col N="1890" /> would never be able to sell it because no customer dealing with them would ever require it.  If you buy No. 40 thread you must have customers who use sewing machines to purchase it and if you reside or do your business in the congested districts in the West of Ireland, where the people cannot afford sewing machines, then none of your customers will buy No. 40 thread. They will want nothing but No. 10 thread wherewith to do hand-sewing. Before the monopoly, merchants could buy any quantity of thread at 16/9 a gross, and if they wanted nothing but No. 10 thread they could buy it.  Then the Irish monopoly issues a price list in which they say the price of sewing cotton is 16/9 a gross.  But when you order the quantity of sewing cotton that you require you are told that 16/9 is the price for an average assortment, and that if you want to buy what you require, instead of what the Irish cotton monopoly wants to sell, you have got to pay 18/9 a gross for it. It is extremely difficult to get the public, even to get Deputies of this House, to understand that that is a vital and fundamental departure from the undertaking given to the Minister to charge the same price for sewing cotton as was charged before the monopoly was established.  In fact, it means an increase in the price of sewing cotton of 2/- a gross or an increase of 12½ per cent.  Deputies will observe that the Minister can always say: &ldquo;Oh! no, there has been no increase in prices.  These people are still prepared to sell cotton thread at 16/9.&rdquo; The unfortunate merchant replies: &ldquo;But that is not the kind of thread I want, I want only No. 10 thread; I would not be able to dispose of the others.&rdquo;  And the Minister replies: &ldquo;Surely you do not want me to go into personal disputes between the merchants and the millers.  All I can tell you is that sewing cotton is offered at 16/9.&rdquo;  The average Deputy says to himself: &ldquo;Is it not nonsense to be wasting time as between 16/9 and 18/9?  Are they not selling cotton thread at 16/9?&rdquo; They are. I cannot deny it.  They are prepared, however, to sell it on terms which, they know, no sane customer will <Col N="1891" /> accept, and when it comes to selling sewing cotton on the only terms which their customers will ordinarily seek, sewing cotton is 2/- a gross more than it was.  Artifices of that kind can be successfully practised, and it is virtually impossible to prevent them, but, in fact, they operate to increase the cost of a reserved commodity in this country by at least 12½ per cent.</P>
      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the House to another matter arising out of that monopoly licence which has been adopted in this House and in Seanad Eireann, and that is that certain threads supplied to shirt manufacturers in this country, which cost, before this monoply was granted, 48/-, are now costing the same manufacturer 67/-, and that a certain thread, which cost shirt manufacturers 112/- for a given quantity, before the monopoly was established, is now costing the same manufacturers 148/-, which means, approximately, 1/3 on shirts; and that, as a result, it interferes with the success of the shirt industry, which, hitherto, was having a considerable amount of success.  As to the matters arising out of this question of sewing cotton, I can certify of my own knowledge, as I have mentioned before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As the Minister says, &ldquo;Not once, but many times.&rdquo; In regard to the manufacturers themselves, I can stand over what has been said on the authority of a shirt manufacturer of long experience in this country.  I have raised this matter before, and I am raising it again, and am directing the attention of the House to this matter in order to point out to the House and the country the things that almost invariably accompany the monopolistic policy of the Minister, and in order to emphasise the worthlessness of any undertakings such as the Minister has relied upon here for the protection of the consumer. In this connection, I should like to join with Deputy McGilligan in <Col N="1892" /> saying that, if the Government determines on a policy of monopoly&mdash;which I consider to be an unmitigated curse&mdash; then, let that monopoly be carried on by the State on socialistic lines; because at least, if that policy is carried on on socialistic lines, you will get whatever is good in socialism, albeit you will have the disadvantages of socialism, whereas if you endeayour to carry on&mdash;the word springs to my lips, although I almost fear to use it here&mdash;a policy of capitalism, then, as Deputy McGilligan cogently pointed out, you are going to have all the evils and none of the advantages of that system, to the great detriment of the country as a whole.  Let me add to what Deputy McGilligan said with regard to the industrial policy of the Government, that, in addition to the evils that are daily accruing to the working of industry in this country, and the consuming public, there is a very much greater danger adherent in the whole catastrophe, in my opinion, and that is that the name of industrialists in this country, who gave good value for the money they got, and who manufactured good merchandise with modest protection in the form of low tariffs, is being besmirched by the misconduct of other persons, who are profiteering behind tariff barriers of 80 per cent. and 100 per cent, and under the protection of quotas.  It is my opinion that there is going to come a time, as a result of this policy, when the public at large in this country will identify profiteering with Irish industry; and, if that time comes, very grave injustice will be done and very great injury to the prospects of Irish industry will have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are men in this country&mdash; notably in the boot trade, the confectionery trade, and certain other trades &mdash;who did build up industries under modest tariffs, and who, having operated under modest tariffs, at first were not in a position to give as good value as could be given from external sources of supply, but who, operating under these protective tariffs for a short period&mdash;a quinquennial period or thereabouts&mdash;were giving just as good value as could be given from any British or other source of supply, and <Col N="1893" /> who could give that value at just as cheap a price.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is leaving the House.  I hope he will be back in time to reply, because he might say that in his absence I may have stolen a march on him.  The Minister interrupted Deputy Cosgrave last night when the Deputy was referring to the powers that the Minister was taking for the purpose of compelling persons to purchase turf.  The Minister, apparently, was outraged at any fault being found with the taking of such compulsory powers, and he described Deputy Cosgrave's remonstrance as pussyfooting with Victorian liberalism.  If one could find a German vernacular expression for that kind of reasoning, it might be summed up in &ldquo;Mein Kampf.&rdquo;  Anybody who objects to be taken by the back of the neck by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and who objects to having his nose rubbed in the turf that the Minister cannot sell, is pussyfooting with Victorian liberalism! Well, I wonder what de Valeraesque modernism is?  Does it mean that anyone who sits on the Front Bench of this House on the left-hand of the Ceann Comhairle is entitled to do anything he pleases, or that these gentlemen have been erected to a position, such as was known, I believe, in the days of the worst despotism of the Roman Empire, as protectors of the people?  It will be remembered that when the Roman Emperors had made up their minds to be absolute dictators and to execute everybody who was even suspected of being against them, it was their practice not to describe themselves as emperors or kings, or anything else of that sort, but as protectors of the people.  I wonder does the wrath of the Minister with us, who are old-fashioned believers in individual liberty, for pussyfooting with Victorian liberalism, suggest that at no far distant date we are going to have such Roman protectors of the people here who will woo us in no uncertain voice from our Victorian prejudices and show what good government by resolute Ministers can do.</P>
    <P>I mention that because I want to indulge in what the Minister for <Col N="1894" /> Industry and Commerce pleases to describe as a little Victorian liberalism. I want to protest against the licensing system introduced into this country by the present Minister.  I want to say that in my opinion the licensing system for which the present Minister is responsible is going to corrupt the public life of this country.  I say that a very considerable number of persons in this country already believe that favours and concessions can be wangled, and that a general atmosphere of that kind of dishonesty is beginning to manifest itself throughout the mercantile community&mdash;a belief that you have got to keep in with the Minister and his Department if you are to get a fair crack of the whip; a general reluctance to criticise the Minister or his Department in public for fear that retaliatory measures might be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a very common readiness to complain of difficulties and perplexities, but an absolute refusal to allow their names to be used, because they feel that they must go to the Department for licences or concessions in the hereafter, and it would not suit them to be put down as critics of the Department of that kind. I have argued here time and again that political corruption was manifesting itself in our public life, particularly in regard to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and not out of any love for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but simply because I believe it is due to the good name of the country, I have deliberately differentiated between political corruption and what I describe as base corruption. I have been careful to say, and I now repeat, that I do not believe, and I do not believe any rational man in this country believes, that there is any member of the Executive Council or responsible officer of the Minister's Department who would <Col N="1895" /> be susceptible to what is plainly known as a bribe, and when I use the word corruption I am not alleging, and I do not wish to allege, bribery of any kind, bribery of a monetary or base character. If the time comes when I have reason to believe such a thing was happening&mdash;God forbid I ever should&mdash; I would not hesitate to say so.  At any rate, I do not.  I do, however, allege political corruption.</P>
      <P>I want to take an opportunity that I have long been waiting for, and that was to bring home to the Minister that not only is it existent, but it is existent with the Minister's approval.  I have always maintained here that no merchant or trader in this country has a right to ask the Minister to exercise a discretion under his licensing powers in favour of one citizen at the expense of another, and that if the Minister exercises a discretion under his licensing powers in favour of one merchant, he must make a similar concession available to every other merchant.  I regard anything short of that as unfair, and if that unfairness is got through political influence, I say it amounts to political corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a member of the Fine Gael Party, or of the Fianna Fáil Party, goes to the Minister or his Department and says: &ldquo;I want a concession for Mr. XY who is doing a certain business,&rdquo; and the Minister examines the case and says: &ldquo;On the case stated, I think he is entitled to the licence you ask for him,&rdquo; I am of opinion that the Minister should resent a suggestion from any T.D. that that licence should be made available only to Mr. XY and not to the other merchants or manufacturers who are in Mr. XY's business. I hold that the Minister should say: &ldquo;On these facts stated a case for a licence has been made out and will be made available to all persons circumstanced as Mr. XY is circumstanced.&rdquo; If he does that, no difficulty will arise.  In my opinion the Minister does not do that, and to judge from a letter I have received from the Minister himself, and which I now propose to read to the House, it appears to me that the Minister does not think it is necessary to do that.  On the contrary, he suggests <Col N="1896" /> that it is perfectly legitimate and even desirable that members of this House should go and seek favours for individual citizens from his Department.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I must trespass on the time of the House, but I desire to place the House in full possession of the facts and, if necessary, that the Minister should have them too.  The facts are that a shirt-manufacturing company in the North of Ireland, in Donegal to be precise, engages amongst other things in the manufacture of semi-stiff collars and shirts in which the cotton textile used is a semi-stiff material.  That semi-stiff material is not manufactured in Saorstát Eireann and never will be manufactured in Saorstát Eireann, but these people export considerable quantities of these semi-stiff collars and they also sell large quantities of these semi-stiff collars within Saorstát Eireann.  For these reasons, it became peculiarly desirable that they should have duty-free supplies of this material, because it was not possible to get a rebate of the tariff that they had paid on this material coming into Saorstát Eireann when sending out the finished shirts and collars, as it was so difficult to assess just how much of the semi-stiff material there was in any given shirt or any given collar.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, acting on behalf of my constituent, I rang up the Department of Industry and Commerce, from the officers of which I have always received every courtesy to which any rational person could conceive himself to be entitled.  I should say that I called at the office and the responsible officer was engaged on Government business and was not in a position to see me.  I was received by another officer who told me the name of the responsible officer who would deal with my application, and I undertook to call back.  In fact, however, I had not time to do so, and I rang up and spoke to the responsible officer.  When I spoke to him I explained my case and said to him:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I may not have made myself clear as to the nature of the textile to which I refer, but there are one or two manufacturers in Dublin who <Col N="1897" /> handle this textile for the manufacture of their shirts, and if you refer to them they will be able to explain to you in technical language the exact nature of the textile in regard to which I am speaking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I happened to mention the name of one manufacturer in Dublin, who happened to be a personal friend of my own, and whom I knew to be a very enthusiastic supporter of the Fianna Fáil Government, and the Minister in particular, and who, I knew, would be readily available to assist the Department in a technical matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I mention that fact because I want to explain to the House that my case was that a licence of this character should be issued to all shirt manufacturers in Saorstát Eireann and that I did not ask, and did not want, any special concession for an individual manufacturer.  I would have regarded it as politically corrupt on my part to ask the Minister to give a licence to one manufacturer and withhold it from the others.  In due course I got a letter from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your recent telephone conversation with an officer of the Department, in connection with the importation of cotton webbing by Messrs. John McLaughlin and Co., Buncrana.  I am to say that the Minister has had an opportunity of looking into the facts of this case but he sees no grounds for granting concessions to this company which are not granted to its competitors in the shirtmaking industry in the Saorstát.  He is unable, therefore, to recommend the issue of licences for the free importation of the cotton material in question.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister has given further consideration to the question of the importation of cotton cloth for use in shirts and collars for export, and for the time being he is prepared to consider sympathetically applications for licences for the importation, free of duty, of cotton cloth for such trade.  It will be necessary, however, <Col N="1898" /> for any applicant to furnish to the Department details of export orders in respect of which the duty-free cotton cloth is required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that the Minister here says that he sees no grounds for granting concessions to this company which are not granted to its competitors. If the Minister did not know, his officers must have very well known that I was not seeking any concessions for a company which would not be granted to its competitors.  I was seeking for concessions for the whole trade.  I replied to that letter very emphatically.  In the course of my letter I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I recommended to him (the Minister) that cotton webbing should be admitted duty free to all shirt manufacturers in Saorstát Eireann, because</P>
    <P>(i)  special machines had been installed to make up this particular type of cloth;</P>
    <P>(ii)  because this webbing is not manufactured in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    <P>(iii)  because the practical difficulties of segregating export orders from home-market orders when ordering supplies of raw materials were insuperable.</P>
    <P>I did not at any time suggest that discrimination should be exercised in favour of any individual firm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the concluding paragraph, which, I think, pretty reasonably irritated the Minister:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I shall take suitable precautions in future, when transacting business with your Department, to record in black and white whatever passes between us, as the possibilities of a defective understanding on the part of your officers seem formidable, and somewhat reminiscent of the unfortunate methods of the potential blackmailer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be observed that had I let the Minister's original letter pass uncommented upon, it could be produced in the House hereafter to prove that, while I was protesting against the granting of licences to individuals at the expense of others, here was I looking for a special <Col N="1899" /> licence for Messrs. McLaughlin and Co., my political colleagues, which I did not want anyone else to hear about, so I answered the Minister pretty trenchantly and, if he laid a trap, then he caught his own toe in it.  The Minister got on his high horse, and I received the following communication from the Minister, which contains a most astonishing paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inform you that your letter dated 28th December has occasioned him no small measure of surprise.  On the 29th November you interviewed an officer of this Department, and on the 5th December you had a telephone conversation with another officer; in each case your representations were directed to securing certain licensing facilities for the firm of Messrs. John McLaughlin and Co., Buncrana.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is not true.  On each occasion I explained that I was moved in the matter by Messrs. John McLaughlin and Co., of Buncrana, and I referred the Minister to several manufacturers in Dublin who would elucidate any obscurities in my application, naming some of them, in order to facilitate him in that matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Each officer made a record of his conversations with you on the date on which it took place....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not know that my conversations were of such mighty importance that every unfortunate officer was taking shorthand notes of what I said.  However, that is apparently true.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...and the Minister is not prepared to accept your suggestion ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am also, apparently, a suspected person.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... that two responsible officers have misrepresented to him what you said.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe they misrepresented to him what I said, but I believe the Minister thought a trap could be laid. The trap did not come off.  This is the paragraph I want to draw particular <Col N="1900" /> attention to, because it represents a direct cleavage between myself and the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is, of course, not necessarily anything reprehensible in making representations on behalf of an individual firm, and the first paragraph of this Department's letter of the 18th December last merely conveyed the Minister's decision on your representations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to return your letter herewith and to say that the Minister takes grave exception to the terms in which it is couched; it is offensive in tone and unwarranted by the facts.  He welcomes what he understands to be your intention of making in writing any further representations you may wish to bring before him, and he desires me to express the hope that any communications which you may in future have occasion to address to his Department shall conform to the standard of courtesy which is ordinarily observed by persons who correspond with Departments of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I desire to give the Minister's entire letter so that no misapprehension may arise in the mind of anybody.  I think it is highly reprehensible for any Deputy of this House to make representations on behalf of an individual firm to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in order to get for that firm concessions which they do not intend to secure for the other firms engaging competitively in the same trade.  If the Minister does not think it reprehensible to make such advances on behalf of individual firms, I think it is.  If the Minister thinks it is not reprehensible to make such advances available to Deputies interested on behalf of individual firms, that is to my mind a type of political corruption.</P>

      <P>In this case had I made the request which the Minister attempted to father upon me I would have been guilty of gross political corruption.  It is for that reason that I answered the Minister in very trenchant terms, to make it perfectly clear I believed he wanted to level such a charge against me on a future occasion and to support it by his version of the conversations I had with his officers, and I took particularly good care to snap that trap before the Minister would get a chance of putting it under my feet and I did so, to the Minister's considerable confusion and alarm.  It is very important that this House should make up its mind what standards are to obtain in regard to this matter of issuing licences.  Do they think, as the Minister, that there is nothing reprehensible in a Deputy asking for licensing concessions for an individual firm which are not to be extended to everybody, or do they not?  I think it is reprehensible and undesirable, and I think it is going to lead to corruption in the public life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this general question of licences, I renew my request that a public register will be opened wherein particulars of licences issued for the free importation of merchandise will be made available to the persons interested in the entire business life of the country.  At present one merchant will get a licence from the Minister to import certain merchandise, free of duty, while his next-door neighbour will have paid 30 or 40 per cent. import duty on the same commodity.  I asked was the <Col N="1902" /> Minister prepared to issue licences for the free import of flannelette, and his answer was that he was considering his action on that matter.  But I happen to know a merchant who had imported flannelette and paid 33? per cent. duty on it.  I do not know what decision the Minister may take or whether he will decide to admit flannelette free of duty, but the Minister may change his mind to the advantage of one merchant and to the very material disadvantage of another.  A licence may be issued to one merchant, and that licensee does not then bother to ask for another.  You have a situation where one man is to pay a duty on a commodity and another may get the same commodity in duty free.  I allege licences are being given inequitably at the present time; that substantial justice is not being done between one merchant and another, and that there is no satisfactory method whereby the mercantile community can discover that justice is being done by the Department unless some register of licences is published.  Every rational man knows that a system of licences issued under cover of darkness is going to corrupt the public life of the country. It is going to introduce into our public life elements that never existed before and a form of corruption will manifest itself which it would be extremely difficult to extirpate once it has taken root.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken objection to the opening of a register of licences on the ground that it would publish secrets relating to the business of certain individual merchants.  I know no member of the mercantile community that will substantiate that objection.  All the Minister is asked to do is to provide a register which will contain no more than the name of the licensee and the commodity he is to import.  If such particulars were published the position is guarded for every other licensee and all he has to do is to ask the Department for a similar concession if he is interested in the same commodity.  If he is unable to get a licence to import some commodity he has his remedy.  He can ask a Deputy to ask the Minister why he will not make the licence available <Col N="1903" /> in that particular case, or, he can ask the Minister himself a simple question. He can say you have given a licence to A.B., why will you not give a similar licence to me?  What single objection can there be to providing information of that kind?  Is it not obvious to every Deputy that the evils of not providing such information may be very great and that their general tendency is to grow?</P>
    <P>I think it would be a mistake, certainly from my point of view, to underline the general review given by Deputy McGilligan here to-day.  I particularly wish to raise these two points relating to monopoly and the evils arising from trading under a licensing system.  But I think before I conclude, lest Deputy Donnelly should feel dismayed or disappointed, a word should be said upon the Spanish agreement.  When I first raised that scandal in this House, the Minister with his usual audacity did everything short of telling a lie.</P>

      <P>What more insolent or damaging attack could any man make? The facts are gradually coming to light. I said we were forced to send our best eggs to Spain and that the Spaniards would not pay us but eat them, and I said that the Spaniards were sending us oranges which when compared with Jaffa oranges were rubbish.  A pious letter appeared a few mornings after, signed by Mr. Connolly Shaw, showing that he was too economically-minded to put an advertisement in the Press, stating that his firm had lovely Spanish oranges to sell and that they would show me the best oranges that were ever brought into Dublin if I <Col N="1904" /> would go down to the North Wall.  The Attorney-General will tell us that that kind of codology does not amount to misrepresentation.  It is simply puffery and is a well-known practice on the part of some kind of merchants. But the fact remains that three weeks later certain fruit merchants&mdash;not Messrs.  Shaw&mdash;in the city had the courage to take action on this matter. They signed a round-robin and sent it to the papers three weeks ago and stated that anybody would fail in the attempt to persuade the public that these oranges compared in quality with the Palestine oranges available before. Deputy Mulcahy demonstrated that the price of these oranges, to the consumer in this country, was very nearly twice as much as had been charged for oranges before this trade agreement was made.  The egg merchants who shipped their goods to Spain published the fact that they could not get paid for their eggs and that, as far as they were aware, the Spaniards had eaten them.  They could neither get the eggs nor the money nor any satisfaction from the Minister who induced them to send their eggs to Spain.</P>

      <P>If one of these eggs hit President Azana he would not only not be in the Senate but he would be in his grave.  They were there long enough for that.  That was the agreement which induced our unfortunate people to send £35,000 or £40,000 worth of eggs to Spain and to pay the exporters of these eggs £18,000 for sending them. And that is described as something of more value to us than the British market. We are upbraided on this side of the House by the Minister for decrying this valuable trade asset which he secured for this country.  And he defended the gentlemen who waxed so eloquent about the excellent quality of the lovely oranges they are bringing in, and who are the only people in a position to bring in such oranges under this Spanish trade agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though there are 139 import quota licences issued by the Minister, there is a condition put in each licence which <Col N="1905" /> effectively prevents anyone from bringing in oranges save the patriots who published the letter about the lovely Valencia oranges.  There is no express prohibition in the quota licence.  The form is gone through.  Quota licences are issued to 130 or 139 orange importers but the condition is inserted therein that the oranges must be brought direct from Spain to the port of Dublin without touching any port in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Some of them might give a portion of their spare time to a consideration of the economics of bringing a shipload of merchandise from a Spanish port to Dublin and sending the ship back in ballast.  Then, they would understand what an economic and desirable enterprise that was.  Then, they would understand why it was that the only person who could attempt to bring in oranges on terms that would make it possible for him to sell them here at all was somebody who was in a position to give a charter party from Spain to Ireland, and a charter party from Ireland back to Spain.  Unless you constituted yourself a trading company of that kind, any possibility of dealing direct with Spain would be out of the question. But if you got a tip in time to organise yourself along these lines you might find yourself in the happy position of being only one of 139 persons who received quota licences to import oranges, but being the only one of those 139 persons who could use this quota licence.  You would get the pleasant job of bringing oranges into Dublin and all the other holders of quota licences would come down with their hats in one hand and their quota licences in the other and ask you if you, of your kindness, would take the quota licences from them and give them some of your oranges for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will get up and say that all these statements are erroneous. How could I prove that?  Does he <Col N="1906" /> imagine that his henchman is going to come to me and tell me the whole story for the purpose of bringing it up in this House?  If his henchman did that, would he continue to be his henchman?  If he ceased to be his henchman, what else would he be? If the henchmen of Fianna Fáil ceased to live on their employment as henchmen, would they not revert whence they came&mdash;to the South Dublin Union?  I do not now refer to those merchants.  They are men of good mercantile standing in the community. I do not want to suggest that they are potential inmates of the Dublin Union. They are men of standing in the mercantile life of the country.  But if certain individuals are enjoying special benefits at the hands of the Government, it is absolutely impossible for somebody whose duty it is to direct attention to these facts to get conclusive proof of the evils existing, because nobody has that proof but the concessionaires and the man who gave them the concession.  There is one way of making an end of all that obscurity, doubt and difficulty.  That is, by setting up a register of licences which will be available to anybody who desires to peruse it.</P>

In regard to licences, I think it would serve, because all that is necessary is that everybody should know the nature of the merchandise and the name of the licensee.  The quota system is, unfortunately, open to evils even greater than the tariff system.  I urge on the Minister most strongly to take early and vigorous steps to eliminate these evils from the normal administration of his Department, and I warn him that unless they are removed, and removed very soon, they will give rise to bigger and greater abuses with which it may not be within his capacity to deal when he does come to deal with them.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters to which I wish to direct attention.  On a former occasion, I raised in this House the question of the temporary clerks employed in the labour exchanges of Saorstát Eireann. I think that the Minister gave me an undertaking then that an examination would be held to absorb these temporary clerks into the permanent service.  I should like him to give sympathetic consideration to the case of these men, who have given loyal and good service to the Department, but who have not yet been absorbed into the permanent staff.</P>
      <P>I should also like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that, in many cases in Cork City recently, workmen who suffered injury in the course of their employment were involved in grievous financial loss because their employers had not insured under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  No redress was open to the workmen in these circumstances. Another matter to which I think the Minister should direct his attention in the near future is the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act. I am aware that the problem is a very serious and a very difficult one.  The Minister must, however, be aware that a good deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed in respect of one secton of the Act, which provides that, where a man is found not to be genuinely seeking employment, he is immediately cut off unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied. In respect of the issue of licences, which has been referred to by two or three Deputies this evening, I have had several complaints.  When I drew the Minister's attention to the matter <Col N="1908" /> by way of question on a former occasion, he threatened me with all sorts of pains and penalties if I were to be seen in his office at any time.  A lot of provocative things are occuring in the trade and commerce of the country. These things are capable of remedy and should be remedied.  I have here a communication from a firm which ordered a certain commodity.  There is no necessity to name the commodity. I can hand the letter to the Minister if he requires it.  The letter is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sirs,&mdash;We thank you for your order of the 18th inst., for... but regret we are unable to supply. We have at the moment ceased to manufacture this</P>
      <P>&mdash;it is a tariff commodity&mdash;</P>
      <P>and it will be some months before manufacture will be resumed.  In the latter event, we shall be glad to receive your orders but, in the meantime, must ask you to kindly excuse us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree, that in cases of that character and for goods that are in general use in nearly every commercial office, the firms concerned should get the necessary permits to import free of duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What class of goods is the Deputy referring to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not care to give details but this referred to six dozen of paste.  I will hand the communication to the Minister when I am finished.  I could multiply complaints received by me in the City of Cork from week to week, about articles which are not manufactured in this country, or some of which are manufactured here, but which are not sufficient to supply demands.  In these circumstances, I think the Minister should consider the desirability of admitting the class of goods I have referred to duty free, until such time as we are in a position to satisfy demands.  There are other matters which I can take up with the Department, by correspondence or otherwise.  I direct the Minister's attention to this provocative practice, if you like, where goods in everyday demand cannot be supplied by local <Col N="1909" /> manufacturers, so that an opportunity to import them free of duty should be given.  That is a moderate request. Notwithstanding the Minister's threat I intend to go to his Department about these matters.  I do not know if I will be put out of the office.</P>
      <P>I also received communications from a number of persons who were employed in mills on the Shannon, complaining that they had lost their employment owing to the operation of the Shannon scheme and had received no compensation.  I replied to these letters and pointed out that the Minister had already decided cases of this character on representations that were made to him from Clare and Limerick. I ask the Minister in cases where hardship has been created, such as occurred before the passing of the Cork Tramways Act, or where hardship has been created as a result of Government action to consider the desirability of setting up some sort of committee as was set up on the dissolution of the Cork Tramways and Electric Lighting Company to deal with that type of case.  I do not think it would cost the country very much.  It would certainly be a great benefit to men who have lost their employment through no fault of their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate may be regarded as having unusual significance because, during the course of it, the veil was lifted slightly from the policy of the Opposition Party.  For the first time to my knowledge during the course of the past four years we had an attempt made, however inadequate and however incomplete, to give us an indication of the viewpoint of the Party opposite upon important matters of Government policy.  That attempt was made in the speech delivered by Deputy McGilligan, and because that speech was delivered in this debate I think to-day must be regarded as the most significant occasion in the history of the present Dáil.  I am very glad to learn that my efforts to induce the Party opposite to give us an indication as to where they stand upon broad and important matters of public policy are at last bearing fruit.  For the rest, we have had from speakers who addressed themselves to the <Col N="1910" /> Estimate, the usual mixed grill of matters, relevant and irrelevant, to which we have been accustomed on these occasions.  That description applies particularly to the opening speech from the opposite benches delivered by Deputy Mulcahy.  The Deputy had apparently worked very hard preparing a lot of statistics and acquainting himself with a number of facts to deliver himself of, but with all these statistics he forgot to tell us what he set out to prove, and certainly did not prove anything.  He reminded me of a mouse in a revolving cage who works very hard and very energetically, but succeeds only in staying where he is, no matter what energy he expends. Deputy Mulcahy's statistics and facts ranged over a large number of commodities. He started with cement, then passed on to eggs, oranges, boots and shoes, and he got mixed up for a time, but not for long, with artificial fertilisers.  He concluded with a reference to wearing apparel and commodities of that description.  I was particularly interested in his reference to eggs, because apparently eggs are of considerable importance in the minds of the Deputies on the opposite benches. Quite a number of the speeches referred to eggs, but Deputy Mulcahy it was who got the brilliant idea of comparing the price of Saorstát eggs in the London market with the price of Chinese eggs.  I could understand the price of our eggs in London being compared with Danish, Dutch or Polish eggs.  Such a comparison would be a natural one, because the principal suppliers of the English market are Denmark, Holland, Poland and ourselves, and in any event there is a certain similarity between eggs coming from these countries and eggs from this country.  I can understand Deputy Mulcahy not making that comparison, because it would not suit the particular point he appeared to be trying to make.  The price of our eggs compares very favourably with the price of those other eggs.  During the past few weeks, as Deputy Mulcahy could ascertain from the current issue of <i>The Grocer</i>, the price of Irish Free State selected eggs, which are 15 lb. to the great hundred, ranged from 7/9 to 8/3 per great hundred.  The price of <Col N="1911" /> Dutch eggs, which are slightly heavier, weighing 15½ lb. to the great hundred, ranged from 7/6 to 7/9; and Danish eggs, which are the same weight as Dutch eggs, from 8/- to 8/6, while Polish eggs realised from 5/6 to 6/9. It will be seen, therefore, that any comparison of the prices we received for Irish eggs in London with prices received by other principal suppliers of that market could not support any argument that Deputy Mulcahy wanted to make, and so he went to China and tried to make a point against the Government on the ground that the price of Chinese eggs in London was higher than Irish eggs.  That was Deputy Mulcahy's strong point on the question of eggs.  For the information of the Deputy, who may not be aware of it, there is a slight difference of opinion between the Chinese and ourselves as to what constitutes a good egg.  In Ireland a good egg is regarded as a fresh egg, and the fresher it is the better, but in China a good egg is an old egg, and the older it is the better.  In China eggs are preserved for some time.</P>

      <P>Oh, no, for some period. I understand an egg becomes marketable when it changes colour.  When it becomes black it is saleable, but a black egg is not regarded as of very high value.  In fact, the lowest price for Chinese eggs is in respect of black eggs.  When they keep eggs a few score years longer they turn violet, and when violet they bring a slightly higher price than black eggs.  When kept for a much longer period, say, three or four generations, they turn green, and if really green they fetch the top price in the market.  It was that top price Deputy Mulcahy quoted. According to <i>The Grocer</i>, we are informed that Chinese eggs have been in moderate request and that quotations have been maintained.  The green eggs fetched from 10/- to 10/9, the violet eggs from 9/3 to 9/8, and the black eggs only 8/8.  This is the new piece of Cumann na nGaedheal propaganda against the Government&mdash;that we are not getting as much for our fresh eggs in the London market as <Col N="1912" /> the Chinese eggs are fetching.  Perhaps if we kept them as long as the Chinese and developed the methods they practised for 1,000 years, then by the next century we might be able to compete with the Chinese in that special market.</P>

      <P>For the time being we are content to export fresh eggs, and we are quite satisfied if we can get, as we are getting, for our fresh eggs a price slightly higher than is secured by our principal competitors there&mdash;the Dutch, the Poles and the Danes.  That is the position at the present time. Deputy Mulcahy twice tried to attribute to me the statement that the Spanish market was more valuable than the British market for eggs, and twice I corrected him.  Then he withdrew the allegation that I had made the remark, and proceeded to make a speech on the basis that this remark had appeared in the columns of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  In regard to the quantity of eggs which we can dispose of, the Spanish market is much less important than the British market.  We can dispose of a larger quantity in the British market than in Spain, because our imports into Spain have been regulated by quota, but the price secured in Spain was slightly higher than the price secured in Britain, and the prospects of extending the market in Spain, when the temporary difficulties which have been holding up the trade have been removed, are very good.  Deputy Dillon has been making his usual point about the difficulties which arose in securing the release of the foreign exchange in Spain to enable our exporters to be paid.  He will be glad to hear&mdash;and I am paying him a compliment, when I express the opinion that he will be glad to hear&mdash; that the arrears which have been outstanding in respect of eggs exported have been paid.  I shall deal later with the matter of the Spanish agreement, which agitated Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon equally, to whatever extent it is possible for me, having regard to the fact, of which Deputies were informed last week, that negotiations are at present in progress <Col N="1913" /> between ourselves and the Spanish Government.</P>
      <P>The matter of the price of cement was also raised.  It was raised last week, and the week before, but the position in relation to it is one that can be easily understood by anyone who is familiar with the conditions that have prevailed in the cement market during the course of the past few years.  There has been intense competition. Certain continental countries were competing with one another on what appeared to be an entirely uneconomic basis in this market.  As I repeatedly pointed out, Danish cement was being sold here at a price much below that at which it was being sold in Denmark.  Belgian cement was being sold at a price much below the price in Belgium.  Similarly German cement was being sold here at a price much below the price at which it could be sold in the country of production.  That situation was bound to end sometime.  In fact, it ended this year when these Continental suppliers of this market got together and decided amongst themselves the price they were going to charge us and the extent to which each of them was going to supply the market.</P>
      <P>When that situation arose, the price of cement was bound to increase.  It has been increased.  I am not accepting the present price as a reasonable price or as an economic price.  I am not accepting the amount of profit secured by the distributors as reasonable, but the explanation of the increase is that which I have given, and not the explanation as given by Deputy Mulcahy, that the increase in price is an inevitable consequence of the institution of a quota.  It is nothing of the kind.  The increase would have arisen whether the quota had been instituted or not.  The main, in fact the only, method by which we can make ourselves independent of these combinations of producers in foreign countries, in respect to the price of cement or of any other commodity is to produce it for ourselves, and I hope that this year we shall have a definite start made in the construction of the two factories which we have planned for the production of cement within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> Deputy Mulcahy tried to make some point, from the information which had been given to him in the preliminary returns from the Census of Production, that the purchasing power of the people was declining.  There is no evidence of any decline in the purchasing power of the people.  In fact, whatever evidence there is points in the opposite direction.  There has been a definite increase in the purchase of many classes of commodities, and it is particularly noticeable that there has been a very definite increase in our total purchases of commodities which may be classed as luxuries.  I do not know where Deputy Mulcahy got his figures relating to boots and shoes.  He said that there was in 1933 a decline in the total value of the boots and shoes purchased.</P>

In any event, I want to impress on Deputy Mulcahy that he will not get any reliable figure which could be taken as representing our requirements of any commodity by adding together our imports and our production in one year. All sorts of factors arise, that may inflate or deflate figures of either production or imports of a single year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, and the Deputy having taken it for two consecutive years, will have realised that our requirements in boots and shoes appear to be increasing.  There has been no evidence of a decrease, and, in fact, whatever evidence there is, is that the demand is increasing.  I think that that in itself is a natural development and that it would have taken place even if my assertion that the purchasing power of the people is increasing were not correct.  There is a tendency to use a lighter type <Col N="1915" /> of boot or shoe than was worn some years ago.  That tendency is affecting a larger number of people every year, with the result that the total number of pairs of boots and shoes used in each year is generally higher than in the previous year.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with some of the minor matters that were raised at a later stage.  I want to get on to what are the most important points that occurred, mainly in the speech of Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy Morrissey ranted a bit, but perhaps he will excuse me if I leave him until I have disposed of Deputy McGilligan. Deputy McGilligan attempted to express what I might describe as the philosophy of his Party in the matter of protection.  He wandered a bit now and again, but generally he gave it as his point of view, that the protective policy of the Government was to be condemned for three main reasons&mdash;firstly, he said, because it was doing the country no good; secondly, because it is taxing the people of the country; and, thirdly, because it prevented a more satisfactory kind of tariff policy being put into operation. Let me deal with the third point first.  Deputy McGilligan argued strongly with Deputy Donnelly against the idea of proceeding with the development of our industries, by methods of protection or otherwise, irrespective of consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, nobody can say with any degree of certainty what are going to be the consequences of the industrial development drive that is taking place at the present time.  We are fully informed of the consequences of ignoring our industrial possibilities, and Deputies who are influenced by Deputy McGilligan's remarks should bear this in mind, that there is complete historical information as to the consequences on this country and its people of a policy of ignoring its industrial possibilities and of concentrating upon the production of agricultural produce for exportation to Great Britain and securing our requirements of industrial goods from outside our own borders.  That policy has been tried and has been condemned, <Col N="1916" /> condemned not merely in the minds of thinking men who have given close study to the question, but condemned by popular opinion, not once but many times.  It is a policy contrary to the general conception of what an independent Ireland should attempt to achieve, but in any event its material results on our population, on the standard of living of our people and upon the resources and wealth that are available to the people: upon their productive capabilities and upon their <i>morale</i> have been such that nobody could possibly contemplate, in cold blood, restoring that policy into operation again.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan stated, however, that under the policy of the previous Government tariffs were applied in a much more sensible manner than they are being applied now, and said that these tariffs were successful.  He gave the House an example of what he called a successful tariff, a tariff of 15 per cent.  <i>ad valorem</i> imposed in 1926 on boots and shoes.  He advanced that as a successful tariff.  It is his example&mdash;not mine.  When we come to consider whether or not a tariff can be regarded from any point of view as successful we must, first, ask, ourselves what constitutes success.  Surely, the success of a tariff must be measured by its effects in increasing the internal production of the goods tariffed, and in increasing employment in the production of these goods.  I agree fully with the point of view expressed by Deputy McGilligan that nobody will attempt to justify tariffs on the grounds that they increase the profits of manufacturers or enable a small group of manufacturers and their families to enjoy better conditions of living than they had previously. The acid test of the effectiveness of any tariff is its results in increasing the production of the goods tariffed, and in increasing employment in the production of these goods.</P>
    <P>Now, on that basis&mdash;and I take it from Deputy McGilligan's remarks that it is accepted on both sides of the House&mdash;how can this tariff on boots and shoes imposed in 1926 be regarded as successful?  Deputy McGilligan contended <Col N="1917" /> that their policy in relation to tariffs was superior to ours, that it gave better results to the country, and he gave as the supreme example of the successful tariff policy of the previous Administration this tariff on boots and shoes.  When that tariff was imposed in 1926 there were 887 people employed in the boot and shoe factories of this State according to the census taken in that year.  These factories were producing between them considerably less than 10 per cent. of our total requirements of footwear.  Two years after that tariff had come into operation, this successful tariff which is advanced here as being symbolical of the wisdom of the whole tariff policy of the previous régime, the total number of persons employed in the manufacture of boots and shoes in this country was 959 or 72 more.  In the course of two years, 72 more people had been put into employment in that industry.  The total number of factories had not been altered, while the total production of boots and shoes was still under 10 per cent. of our requirements in footwear.  By 1931, five years after that tariff commenced to operate, there were 1,097 people employed in the industry, an increase in five years of from 887 to 1,097, and the industry was still producing less than 10 per cent. of our requirements.  Is there any Deputy who, applying any test, would regard that as a successful tariff?  In 1932, this Government took charge, and there are now employed in that industry 4,500 people. Five new factories are being established this year, and by this time next year we will have 5,000 employed in the industry.  I submit that that industry is as efficient now as it could have been under any system of development. I agree that in some of the newer factories the workers may not be as fully trained or as completely efficient as they are in other countries, but taking the average output per individual worker in the Saorstát factories and comparing it with the average output per individual worker in British factories and making due allowance for the smaller size of the units existing here, the industry is as efficient as we could reasonably expect it to be in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> We had reference made to the fact that a particular firm in Kilkenny paid a dividend of 25 per cent. on its ordinary shares this year.  A very false picture of the situation in the boot and shoe industry could be conveyed by a mere reference to the profits earned by one firm.  It is possible in any industry, in any country, for an individual concern by adopting particular methods of production or because of the abnormal efficiency of its management or of its equipment to make profits much higher than the average, and that may be the explanation of the fairly substantial profits earned by this firm.  But it ought to be said here that the 25 per cent. to which reference was made was the dividend distributed upon the ordinary capital of that firm which has a rather unusual financial structure in so far as the ordinary capital represents a very small proportion of the total capital invested in the business and the profits earned, although large, were not sufficient to enable 25 per cent. to be distributed on the whole of that capital. I think the firm made profits which, if they were made generally throughout the industry, we should have to regard as much too high; but, in fact, the other firms engaged in the industry have not been making profits to that extent, and have, in fact, been representing to me that in certain lines competition is becoming so keen that some concerns are likely to show losses.  They have been urging me to restrict the entry of new firms into the industry.  We have not taken any positive steps to secure that, and, in fact, as I have stated, five new concerns are coming into production this year.</P>

      <P>Let us take the question of price which was one of the matters to which all the speakers opposite made reference in the course of this debate.  There are three ways by which, in the circumstances of this <Col N="1919" /> country, it is possible to control the prices charged by the manufacturers of tariffed goods.  The first is by securing the development of sufficient internal competition to ensure that the making of undue profits will not be possible. That is the most desirable one. Secondly, by securing definite undertakings from the manufacturers of the goods as to the prices they will charge, and, if they depart from those undertakings, removing or reducing the protection afforded to them.  Thirdly, by means of a system of price control such as the Control of Prices Act provided for.  We have it represented here, however, that widespread profiteering is taking place.  I must say that very little evidence to that effect has been produced by any speaker, and very little evidence to that effect is, in fact, available.  There are in some industries, no doubt, reasons to fear that the prices could be reduced and that profits are being kept up unduly, but over the great range of industries, there is no evidence that undue profits are being secured, and I think we have sufficient safeguards against the possibility of undue profits to make us quite easy in our minds concerning the situation. In the majority of industries, competition is going to settle that.  It is true that during the initial period of our development the element of competition was absent.  It is now appearing in most industries, and in others there are either price agreements in operation, which are being observed, or the machinery of the Prices Commission, when it is improved a bit, will be quite capable of dealing with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have frequently had to complain about the hypocrisy shown by certain Deputies on the opposite benches who criticise the Control of Prices Act, the Prices Commission and the work of the Controller of Prices.  The Control of Prices Act which is now in operation is not the Bill which I introduced into this Dáil.  Deputies opposite should take in full their responsibility for the watering down of that measure to an extent which impaired its effectiveness. It was members of their Party <Col N="1920" /> in the Seanad who faced me with the alternatives of accepting their amendments or having the Bill held up for 18 months.  If they have now changed their minds upon the question of the nature of the machinery that should exist in this country in the circumstances of our times for the control of prices of protected commodities, or of articles which are necessary for the sustenance of life, then let them admit that they have changed their minds, and promise me their full co-operation when I come to the House this year with the Bill for the amendment of the Control of Prices Act.  In any event, let me say that there has been no increase in prices.  The index of the prices of industrial products shows that the level of prices in 1934 was just about the same as it was in 1931. Taking the range of products that are brought into account when the cost of living index is being prepared the retail prices of those products are lower to-day than they were in 1931. It is, therefore, entirely incorrect to condemn the tariff policy which is now in operation, on the grounds that it has involved a substantial increase in the cost of living or a substantial rise in the general level of prices.  The cost of living has not increased as compared with 1931.  It is lower than it was in 1931.</P>

Some commodities have gone up in price, but taking the general level of prices there has been no increase.  Taking it all round, there is a definite decrease in respect of commodities which are taken into account when the cost of living index is being prepared.</P>

      <P>The price of agricultural produce has gone down?  I am <Col N="1921" /> anxious to find out the attitude of the Party opposite upon this question of the price of agricultural produce.  On one day, they are bewailing the lot of the farmers, telling us how hard it is for the owners of agricultural land to carry on because the prices of agricultural produce are too low, and the next day they are bewailing the lot of the townspeople who have got to pay higher prices for this agricultural produce than they had to pay last year. On which leg do they want to stand permanently?  They cannot have it both ways.  There is only one way of improving the position of the farmer, and that is by widening the gap between his cost of production and the price at which he sells his produce. You can do that in two ways.  One is by reducing his costs, and we have done that.  We have halved his annuities; we have given large subventions to the payment of his rates, and by various measures adopted through the Department of Agriculture his costs have been brought down.  If you still want to increase the margin, there is only one way to do it, and that is by increasing the price of his produce, and you cannot increase the price of his produce except by raising the price of those goods to the consumers of them.  Are you prepared to stand for that?  No; you are not, because on every occasion upon which a measure designed to that end was introduced in this House, you voted against it.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan came back to his original calculation in respect of unemployment.  He gets amazing results from those figures when he addresses himself to them.  I think he could prove, if he tried, that there is nobody employed in this country.  He gets amazing results by a series of ingenious devices which I think worthy of examination.  He first assumed that the total increase in employment which took place since 1932 was 25,000.  He got that figure from some place which I do not know; <Col N="1923" /> where he got it is a mystery to me. But he did build up his whole case on the basis of that figure, which is a purely notional one, and entirely contrary to the facts.  Between 1932 and 1935, the average number of persons employed weekly in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts increased by 36,000.  That is not the total number of persons who got new employment; it is the increase in the number of persons employed each week.  If we were to assume that every person employed was employed for the whole year, then the total increase in employment over those three years was 36,000.  I ask Deputies to keep that figure in the back of their minds, because Deputy McGilligan based his case on the figure of 25,000, and, as Deputies will see, he was only two-thirds right.  He said, &ldquo;I can account for the whole of that 25,000&mdash;21,000 in housing, 3,000 in relief works, and 1,000 in the sugar factories&rdquo;&mdash;and there was no more employment.  Very simple. He proceeded to take the figure for the sugar factories first, and made a rather elaborate calculation.  &ldquo;There are 900 people employed the whole year round, and 2,500 employed for ten or 12 weeks; let us average it out, and say 1,000 per day for a year.&rdquo;  Deputies however, did not perhaps notice that he did not do quite the same thing in relation to the figure for persons employed in housing.  He took the figure for one day in May, 21,000, and assumed that 21,000 were employed for the whole year.</P>

      <P>In so far as relief schemes are concerned, the greater part of the employment on relief schemes has been deemed not to be insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Perhaps I should emphasise that it has been decided by me that it is not insurable, but my opinion has been contested, and the matter may go for final determination in the courts.  But so far as the calculations of Deputy McGilligan are concerned, Deputies can take it that the great majority of the persons who have been employed on relief works paid no contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is again falling into Deputy McGilligan's trap&mdash; 3,000 per day.  Relief works are generally conducted over certain periods of the winter.  They are not continued all the year round all over the country, but Deputy McGilligan based his figure on the assumption that that work was spread out the whole year round, and took the figure of 3,000 as representing the full employment for the year.  He assumed that the actual number of persons who paid these contributions did so in respect of the same number of days as contributions would have been paid by 3,000 persons if they had been employed all the year round.</P>

      <P>The Prices Commission has been made the subject of attack. <Col N="1926" /> I want to pay a tribute here to the members of the Prices Commission, both the permanent members and those who have come in to assist at special investigations, and who have done so without reward, and as a public duty, and who in my opinion, have performed a very valuable service for this State, not merely in investigating prices charged for particular commodities, but in instituting, for the first time, in the minds of the public, and particularly in the minds of manufacturers, the conception of the State as having authority to regulate prices in the public interest.  That is a new idea.  It was so new in 1932 that the Party opposite could not accept it.  It has now come to be regarded, however, as a normal function of the State to institute general supervision over prices, and to back up and support that supervision by action to regulate prices wherever abuses can be shown to exist.  The Prices Commission has been effective in the narrow limits of the powers which the Oireachtas decided to give it.  It has kept down prices in many industries, and it is because it has been effective that we are proposing to extend its powers, to give it a wider field to operate over, and to take away a number of the shackles which were very mistakenly, in our opinion, imposed on it by the Oireachtas in 1932.</P>
      <P>We have had this ranting about the reserved commodity procedure.  A number of reserved commodity Orders have been made and there is no control over the activities of the firms which got licences under these Orders, so Deputy McGilligan says.  There is one such Order.  One reserved commodity Order has been made, and one licence has been issued.  Under that licence, the most complete degree of Government control and supervision of the activities of the firm concerned has been provided for.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy was reserving to himself the sole right to make allegations of that kind. Deputy McGilligan proceeded to get on to the ground of general theory, and told us that the leaders of the great industrial nations, Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, had declared that economic nationalism had not been a success.  It is a lot of good for us to know that the Prime Ministers <Col N="1928" /> and Presidents of great industrial countries, the prosperity of which depends on their continued exportation on a large scale of industrial goods, condemned economic nationalism when adopted by us or by nations similarly circumstanced to ours.</P>
      <P>What is the alternative to it?  That is what Deputy McGilligan forgot to tell us and it is because he forgot to tell us that I said that the veil had been lifted from the policy of his Party only slightly.  What is the alternative to the policy in operation, to the policy of economic nationalism?  It may not be a success in the United States of America with its vast resources and its limitless possibilities of doing an export trade.  But does that mean that there is any alternative policy for us?  I concede at once that in an ideal world in which there were no separate nations and in which there were no differences of race, language or religion that complete freedom of trade would be the ideal arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, that would be an Utopia, but we are dealing with world conditions, with existing conditions and not with dreams or Utopias.  We have got to deal with the fact that in the minds of individuals there is a strong desire to preserve the existence of these nations and to promote the welfare and well-being of the various tribes and groupings of the population in different parts of the world.  That is a fact that you cannot ignore and these economists who write text books ignoring it end in futility.  Our task here is to promote the well-being of the people living in this island.  It is of little advantage to us to know that they would possibly be better off in America of England or some other country to which they would have to move if complete freedom existed and if no separate nations were recognised.</P>

      <P>We are concerned here with the preservation of the Irish nation and with securing the well-being of the people who constitute this Irish nation.  That is our aim and there is no alternative to our present policy. If Deputies opposite think there is they must tell us what the alternative is.  They cannot possibly hope to get away with it at a general election on the basis of asking the people for a blank cheque.  We want to know where they stand and I warn them if they want to secure their own political existence in this country they will have to define their policy.  They cannot get away with it without giving us their alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, our plan was to end unemployment.  It was stated in the quotation that Deputy McGilligan read that we were to end unemployment.  If we produced here the food, the clothing and the housing that we require we could end unemployment but we are not producing the food, the clothing and the housing that we require.  We are not producing here the materials which constitute the housing.  If we were able to-morrow to organise production so that we could supply all our requirements in food and clothing, all the materials that go to the making of clothing and all the goods that are necessary to meet our requirements in housing and the things that produce these requirements with the necessary tools, we would be able to abolish unemployment for the time being.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not do these things at once because of the difficulty of organisation and finance and because of the difficulty of breaking down the prejudices which exist in the minds of those who control the capital necessary to develop the nation.  That was <Col N="1930" /> our biggest task.  One thing I claim in which this Government has been most successful has been in removing the prejudice against Irish industry and in bringing about faith in its stability and continuity in the minds of those who are able to make capital available for investment here.  In the past week three industrial issues of shares were over-subscribed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By the public, and remember that has happened in a country in which less than ten years ago a Banking Commission set up by our predecessors reported that it was utterly impossible for any Irish enterprise to seek to get capital by a public issue of shares in Ireland. Deputies will realise the change which has taken place in the outlook of our people when they look back over the past 12 months and note the successful flotation of companies that has taken place over that period.  We undertook to do that, but we never promised the people to abolish unemployment in eight months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I defy Deputy Morrissey to produce any statement in which we gave that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>You actually made that promise yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We did state that we were going to pursue a policy designed to have that end and we have operated it to the success which it has achieved.  Our efforts have been acclaimed by the people on every occasion on which they have been consulted. The people have given us encouragement to proceed along the lines we are following.  Deputies have heard Deputy Dillon speak about the Spanish agreement.  I am not going to talk now about the import arrangements made with Spain.  That was a good treaty, and it would have worked out satisfactorily only for the difficulties that arose on the Spanish side in making available foreign exchange for the payment for exports. The difficulties that arose there have <Col N="1931" /> now been adjusted and these difficulties will not, I hope, arise in the future again.  Deputy Dillon tried to convey the impression that by some arrangement I had given to one firm a monopoly to import oranges.  The Deputy said so.  That followed his assertion that he was accusing the Government, and myself in particular, of political corruption.  I presume he intended to convey that the one firm to which I gave a monopoly is a firm that could be described as political supporters of the Government.  The firm of Connolly, Shaw &amp; Co. is English, and I do not know anyone connected with that firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I named no firm.  I do not know whether it is desirable in this House to name firms or individuals who have no spokesman here. I think it is better that persons or companies be not named here.  I will give the name of the firm to the Minister in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 193 importers of oranges, and, so far as I am aware, any of those importers can secure the fulfilment of the conditions which qualify them to import those oranges direct from Spain. There is an Irish shipping service operating between this country and Spain on which any firm importing oranges can get accommodation for their imports.  The allegation that we made that arrangement for the purpose of securing a monopoly for one particular firm is entirely unfounded.  I might take occasion on another Estimate to deal with the matters raised by another Deputy in connection with the Transport Act and in particular with the proposed acquisition by the Great Southern Railways of the services of the Galway Omnibus Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> Deputy McGovern talked about our trade relations with countries other than Great Britain, and said that we were importing eight times as much as we exported to those countries.  We can end that if Deputy McGovern can tell us of any country in which we can purchase oil, timber, maize, tea and tobacco and that is prepared to purchase our goods in return.  If you take these things, oil, timber, maize, tea and tobacco out of our imports from countries other than Britain you will find that the rest does not matter.  I have also been asked to state the manner in which Relief Vote grants for mineral development have been expended.  This money is expended in the first place to secure the relief of unemployment in these particular areas in which it is expended, and secondly, it is expended in a manner designed to facilitate the permanent development and working of our mineral resources in such areas.  The results secured up to date have been very satisfactory indeed.  There were other matters raised in the course of the debate to which I would like to refer, but perhaps another occasion will arise for doing so.  I am sure we will have all these matters over again upon the general Budget debate, and therefore I am now concluding my remarks.</P>
