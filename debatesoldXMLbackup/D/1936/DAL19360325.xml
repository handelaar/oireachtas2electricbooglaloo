      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will give consideration to an application by licensed motor hackney owners, who have been disqualified under regulations made under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, for a qualifying period during which such owners can fulfil the conditions laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is not clear to what disqualification the Deputy refers, I am unable to promise favourable consideration to the application referred to in the question.  I can assure him, however, that I will give full consideration to any representations that may be made on behalf of motor hackney owners on matters within my control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in view of the fact that a number of motor hackney owners will lose their means of livelihood as a result of the administration of the regulations made <Col N="162" /> under Section 15 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, he will make provision for a scheme of reasonable compensation for such men on an approved scale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will indicate the portion of the regulations to which exception is taken, and give me particulars of the cases he has in mind, the matter can be looked into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to listen to a deputation that will put their views before him on this matter?  Is he aware that there is grave danger of companies putting a number of hackneys on the road and causing numbers of present owners to be thrown out of employment, and will he give consideration to the fact that these men have been earning their livelihood as motor hackney owners and supporting their wives and families from that occupation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention was directed to the proceedings of the Dublin Board of Public Assistance as reported in the public Press on 12th March; whether he observed the statement attributed to the resident medical superintendent of the Dublin Union that due to the operation of rings, shocking prices were being charged for commodities supplied to the institution; whether the commodities referred to are obtained under a scheme of combined purchasing instituted by his Department and, if so, whether he is in a position to check the profiteering, so far as the Dublin Union is concerned, complained of by the resident medical superintendent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has observed the report in the Press on March 12th.  The article referred to&mdash; a baby's bath&mdash;is not included in the combined purchasing list.  Articles included in the list which could be used <Col N="163" /> for the equipment of wards show a reduction on the prices ruling in 1930-31.  If the Deputy wishes I shall make further inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would make further inquiries, because this is not an isolated instance in which local authorities have been compelled to call attention to the rising cost of articles of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that large sums of the ratepayers' money and sums under his control granted under the Hospitals Sweepstakes scheme are being used in procuring these classes of commodities, and will he, in these circumstances, waive any regulations that would interfere with the Dublin Board of Assistance or with any other public authority purchasing such goods where they can procure them at a lesser price than from the present suppliers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If local authorities can get articles of as good quality and cheaper from other sources they are entitled to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that in a letter dated 7th October, 1935, Mr. Timothy F. Begley, Fortlands, Charleville, was notified by the secretary of the North Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance that he had been appointed temporary whole-time caretaker of the Charleville sewerage works at a salary of £1 per week, and if he is aware that Mr. Begley has not yet been allowed to take up duty, and if he will state what is the cause of the delay in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>When this proposed appointment was submitted for his approval the Minister suggested to the North Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance that it would be <Col N="164" /> preferable to assign the duties of caretaker of the Charleville sewerage scheme to the existing waterworks caretaker who is in a position to undertake the duties of both posts. The policy of the Department is opposed to the multiplication of minor positions carrying small rates of remuneration.  The board of health and public assistance have not given any reason why the suggested arrangement is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is the wish of the local board of health to make this a whole-time separate job will the Minister say for what reason he is standing in the way of the board of health dealing in the matter in the way they wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in the employment of the board a waterworks superintendent who can do the duty without very much additional time being occupied.  The waterworks and sewerage scheme are close by and there is no reason why a separate appointment is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the holder of the present office about which he speaks is holder of that office as a full-time job, and is the Minister aware that the present appointment was offered as a full-time job too?  Would the Minister say why, with so much unemployment in the area, it is necessary to amalgamate those two full-time jobs and give a double salary to one person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In our view there is not really full-time employment for the present man who is filling the waterworks post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if the depreciation of this post in his Department is based upon representations from local person?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister understand, therefore, that if it is the unanimous wish of the local board of health that a separate appointment should be made in this instance he ought not to interfere with <Col N="165" /> their making the appointment in the way in which they wish to make it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can say this much without having gone in great details into this case, that it does not follow&mdash;and I certainly would not allow the rule to apply&mdash;that because even a unanimous wish of a local authority to make an appointment which is unnecessary were put forward to me I would allow that appointment to be sanctioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="166" /> Public Health if he will state why Patrick Naughton of Treenlaur, Tourmakeady, County Mayo, who has been totally incapacitated from work by illness since 27th September, 1935, has received no benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, even though an award in his favour was made by an arbitrator under the said Acts as far back as the 4th day of February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Unified Society that Patrick Naughton claimed benefit in respect of an incapacity which appeared to be the result of an accident and his claim was accordingly refused by the Society on the grounds that compensation should be paid under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  At the request of the member the dispute was summitted to arbitration on the 4th February, 1936, and on the 17th February the arbitrator issued his award in favour of the member.</P>
      <P>The Society had under consideration the question of appealing from the award in accordance with their rights under Section 67 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, and the member was so informed on the 10th March, but it was subsequently decided to accept the arbitrator's award.  Notification of this decision was given to the member on the 19th instant and a cheque in respect of the benefit has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that this course has been adopted, but does not the Minister think it is very unfair to keep a man from 27th September until the middle of March without any payment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received repeated complaints regarding the alleged bad condition of the Killamullen road between Monasterevan and Portarlington, County Leix; whether he has received an application for a grant from the Commissioner now administering the affairs of the Laoighis County Council for the purpose of carrying out the necessary improvement work and, if so, what action he has taken or proposes to take concerning same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of the road between Monasterevan and Portarlington has been the subject of representations.  It is linked with the question of the condition and suitability for modern traffic of the canal bridges at Monasterevan and Portarlington and of other bridges on the main road between the towns.  It has been found that the provision of an alternative route between the towns will take the bulk of the main road traffic from all but one of the unsuitable bridges and a grant from the Road Fund has been provided towards half the cost of the improvement of the alternative route.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that thousands of gallons of milk are sold in Dublin daily for human consumption produced from cows under conditions that are not subject to any inspection or supervision and that milk of this standard is not allowed to be sold for human consumption in Northern Ireland or Great Britain or even used in making bread and confectionery and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to prevent such milk being sold for human consumption and if he is also aware that if a milk producer in Dublin City or County offered such milk for sale he would be prosecuted, and put out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the Deputy is correct in stating that thousands of gallons of milk are <Col N="168" /> sold in Dublin daily for human consumption produced from cows that are not subject to any inspection or supervision. In all districts in the country veterinary inspectors charged with the supervision of the milk supplies have been appointed and it is difficult to see how so large a number of cows could escape inspection or supervision. If, however, any such milk is supplied in Dublin the operation of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, will remedy the position in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply is he not aware that, as stated in the question, thousands of gallons of milk come into Dublin daily; that the producers of that milk are not bound to register, and consequently their premises are not subject to inspection, and their cows are not subject to any clinical inspection by a veterinary officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is correct in saying that thousands of gallons of milk come in under those conditions, but it is true that in all those public health districts in and surrounding Dublin the public health authorities have their own veterinary officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They have their own veterinary officers, but the Deputy knows that the Milk and Dairies Act which was passed last year was passed with a view to remedying this situation which he has in mind.  The regulations under that Act will be, I expect, in force in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, if he relies on remedying this matter by the Milk and Dairies Act passed last year, which will soon come into operation, may I take it that that is an admission of what is implied in my question, namely, that milk is coming in which is not subject to supervision, and that the insinuation in regard to the source of production is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit that the situation is as the Deputy has stated in his question, but I do agree <Col N="169" /> that there might be greater supervision, and I say that such greater and more detailed supervision will come into operation under the Milk and Dairies Act of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister investigate the matter, therefore, and give a guarantee that if the milk which is coming in is not subject to the same supervision to which milk in Dublin City, Meath, Kildare and elsewhere is subject, he will take the necessary steps to have that proper supervision instituted or stop the supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Act of last year is put into operation, as I hope it will be shortly, not alone in Dublin but in the surrounding counties, the full powers of the Act will be used to see that the supplies of milk will comply with all the terms of the Act.</P>

      <P>Local authorities advertising for tenders for the supply of milk under free milk supply schemes have been recommended to give preference to milk from tuberculin-tested cows, and where such milk is not available at a reasonable price, to take precautions that the contractor selected shall be in a position to supply pure milk.  His cattle and dairy premises are to be inspected regularly by the veterinary inspector and samples of the milk supplied are to be tested from time to time both as regards quality and purity.  All advertisements for milk contracts have now been published as such contracts commence on 1st. proximo.</P>

In September last only 21 houses out of 448 had been connected.  If there is likely to be an increase in the number of houses connected to the water supply that would warrant the expenditure on a water-carriage sewerage system the question of giving sanction to a sewerage scheme in next financial year will be considered.  No opinion can at present be expressed as regards the allocation of a grant.</P>

Particulars in reference to numbers of wage-earners employed and the amount of wages paid were not asked for.

The allotment of the lands as approved and effected comprises 12 parcels, of which two were assigned to discharged employees on the estate (one unmarried), three to local landless men (all unmarried) and seven to local congests (two unmarried) by way of addition to their existing holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get from the Vice-President some answer to the question raised by Deputy Norton.  There are certain motions in the names of Deputies of this House to which some answer should be given by the Government.  There is a motion standing in the names of three Deputies and myself in regard to introducing proposals for legislation to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  I think the Vice-President would admit that that is a motion that should be taken before the adjournment and we ought to get some indication of what the Government's intention is with regard to that and the other motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there has been any departure from the usual procedure with regard to Private Deputies' business this session as compared with previous years.  It is usual at this time of the year to give most of the time to financial business and it is seldom that time is allotted at such a period for Private Deputies' business.  I think if the number of hours during the last session of the Dáil were reckoned up and compared with the number of hours allocated in previous years it would be found that more than average time was given in the last session for Private Deputies' business.  At this time of the year, while the Estimates are being discussed, it is not usual for the Government to give time for Private Deputies' business.  I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that the matter is being discussed in the usual way, and if agreement can be come to as to the provision of time, or if certain arrangements can be made, that a considerable amount of time can be given to Private Deputies' business. With regard to the point raised by Deputy Morrissey, with regard to amending the Widows' and Orphans' Act, I do not know that the motion he has on the Paper would be affected in any way by the passage of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  In regard to what the Minister has said about providing time for private Deputies' business, <Col N="190" /> I agree that it is customary in the course of financial business to take Private Members' time.  But the Minister is aware that there have been weeks in this session when the Dáil has not been sitting at the time it ordinarily would sit.  The Minister is aware that in two recent weeks the House did not sit on Friday.  That means depriving Private Members of four hours and four hours are of considerable value, as I think the Minister will agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what use is made of the four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but the Minister ought to give us an opportunity of making some use of these four hours, whether good or bad. That is our complaint.  I do suggest that this turning of Private Deputies' time&mdash;this taking away by the Government of Private Deputies' time&mdash;is really turning the matter into a sort of farce.  It is a farce to have motions on the Order Paper as long as two years without our getting a chance of discussing them.  The Minister may not consider it so, but there was a time &mdash;when he and his colleagues were in opposition&mdash;when they were very jealous, and properly so, of Private Members' time.  That may happen again.</P>

      <P>We do not know what the arrangements are.  I know of no arrangements that are under consideration. So far as we are concerned, all we have seen is an announcement in the Press, and which was not communicated to us officially, that the House proposed to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and not on Friday which is a day for Private Deputies' business.  As Deputy Morrissey has said, there have been weeks when there was no business before the House.  There have been Fridays when the House did not sit.  I suggest to the Vice-President that he should make an announcement to the House this evening as to what it is proposed to do regarding Private Members' time.  Some of us are interested <Col N="191" /> in motions that are on the Order Paper.  We are anxious that other motions should be disposed of so that the motions in which we are interested should be debated and that the matters represented in them should be ventilated to the House.</P>

Má bhíonn sé de dhíchéille againn é chur ar bhun eile ní bheidh ach oideachas bréige mí-nádúrtha againn.  Is baoghalach go bhfuil daoine sa Dáil ná tuigeann é sin fós, daoine dá mbeadh a dtoil féin aca, a dhéanfadh mar atá á dhéanamh ag Rialtas na Sé gCondae, an Ghaoluinn a chur ar an gClár mar theangain iasachta.  Is maith nach é sin an léargus atá ag an Aire ná ag Roinn an Oideachais, go bhfuil ceist na Gaedhilge á brostú agus á cur chun cinn ins na scoileanna acu.</P>
      <P>Dhein an Teachta O Diolúin cur síos ar an ndíobháil atá á dhéanamh do sna naoidheanáin sa Ghalltacht nuair a cuirtear ortha brainnse scoile d'fhoghluim sa Gaoluinn.  Admhuighim go dtagann sé cruaidh ortha ar dtúis ach cad é an tam is fearr chun an tslat a lúbadh ach nuair a bhíonn sí óg. Muna dtosnuightear ar na rudaí sin a mhúineadh dóibh as Gaoluinn agus iad óg cathoin is féidir é dhéanamh? Ní mór a dheimhniú, ámh, gur múinteoirí acmhuinneacha go bhfuil an Ghaoluinn i gceart acu féin a dhéanfaidh an teagasc san.  Mar má múintear droch-fhoghair agus drochghramadach dóibh i dtosach beidh sé deacair ortha scaramhaint leo ar ball.</P>

    <P>Bhíos ag éisteacht leis an dTeachta <Col N="193" /> céadna a fághail lochta ar an scéim atá á cur ar bun ag an Roinn chun stair áitiúil agus seanchas a bhailiú agus a chur ar fághail do sna scoileanna. Nílim ar aon aigne leis, mar ní dóigh liom go bhféadfaí rud ní ba shuimeamhla a mhúineadh do leanbhaí ná tuaithe ná an stair atá ag baint le na gconndaethe agus le na mbailte féin. Músclóchaidh sé suim ins na háiteanna a rugadh agus a tógadh iad agus de bharr san beidh níos mó éilimh ar an ndúthaigh ag baile acu ná mar bhí go dtí so.  Is cuimhin liom gur dheineas tagairt don rud so tá trí bliadhna anois ann agus gur mholas don Roinn a leithéid de scéim a chur ar bun.  Níl aon chathú orm mar gheall air sin mar táim láidir go ndéanfaidh sé a lán tairbhe agus gur fiú go mór an méid dá chostas é.  Maidir le stair na linne seo, do mholas cúpla bliadhain ó shoin leis go múinfí níos mó dhe in sna bun scoileanna ach do thuigeas an deacracht a bheadh ann ag iarraidh téacs-leabhair d'fhághail.  Do chuala mar gheall ar téacs-leabhar le Máire Ní hAodháin, M.A., agus Seóirse O Múnáin.  Dligheadóir, a tairgeadh do Roinn an Oideachais.  Sé an ainm atá air ná &ldquo;A Short History of the Irish People&rdquo; agus tá sé annso im' láimh agam.  Do moladh do sna scoileanna é agus tá súil agam na glacfaidh an Roinn leis mar théacs-leabhar, nó má glacann go ndéanfar é do dheisiú agus do cheartú mar tá a fhios ag an saoghal ná tugtar cothrom na féinne do sna saighdiúirí a bhí ag troid ar thaobh na Poblachta i mbliadhain 1922-23.  B'fhéidir go neósadh an tAire dhúinn rud éigin 'na thaobh.</P>
    <P>Do dhein teachta ar an dtaobh so tagairt do chaighdeán an Bhéarla maidir leis an scrúdú i gcóir na gColáistí Ullmhúcháin.  Táim-se leo nuair a deir siad go bhfuil sé ró-árd. Ní ceart go mbeadh coinne againn le haon Bhéarla mór ó lucht na Gaedhealtachta, cuir i gcás, mar isiad is mó atá i gceist.  Do casadh le déanaighe orm ógánach breagh cliste sa Ghaeltacht go raibh an Ghaoluinn ar a thoil aige agus dubhairt sé liom go raibh sé istigh ar an scrúdú so agus gur chaill sé an lá mar gheall ar an mBéarla, go raibh na hadhbhair eile ar feabhas aige.  B'fhéidir go ndéarfaí go bhfuil an chaoi chéadna <Col N="194" /> ag na daltaí go léir ar Bhéarla d'fhoghluim, ach ní ceart go gcuirfí ortha dul ag lorg an Bhéarla an iomarca.  Tá sé sin bun os cionn le n-ár soiscéal ar fad.  Táimíd ag iarraidh gan an Béarla a leigint isteach sa Ghaeltacht chucha agus táimíd 'á dtiomáint chun an Béarla d'fhoghluim san am chéadna.  Sin puinnte go mba cheart machtnamh a dhéanamh air, ar eagla go gcuirfeadh sé an tairbhe atá á dhéanamh ag scéim an dá phúnt ar ceal agus is mór an tairbhe atá á dhéanamh ag an scéim sin.  Tá sé molta go hárd ag Teachta eile agus ní gadh dhomhsa a thuille a rádh mar gheall air.</P>
    <P>Anois focal i dtaobh stáid na Gaedhilge ins na Gairm-scoileanna. Is maith liom a chloisint go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht air, cé go bhfuil sé mall.  Ní dóigh liom gur maith an rud a deineadh nuair a cuireadh na seana-mhúinteoirí taistil ag obair go hiomlán fé'n Scéim sin.  Do tugadh cúrsa do sna múinteoirí sin agus b'éigean dóibh Béarla a ghlacadh mar adhbhar múinte.  Tá rud éigin bun os cionn leis sin&mdash;daoine a chuaidh amach an chéad lá fé ghairbh-shíon is fé chruadhtan chun Gaoluinn agus cultúr na nGaedheal a scaipeadh i measc na ndaoine agus gur chaitheadar Béarla a thógaint mar adhbhar múinte sa deire.  Do mhol an Teachta Donnchadh O Brian seana-scéim na múinteoirí taistil a chur ar bun athuair agus aitheantas na Roinne bheith acu.  Daoine go mbeadh an teanga ar fheabhas acu, seana-cheol agus amhránuíocht acu agus mar sin de, cúrsa maith a thabhairt dóibh sar a raghaidís amach in aonchor.  Caithfimíd rud éigin mar sin a dhéanamh mar is baoghalach go bhfuil ceol agus amhránuíocht ar sean ag dul i laige.  Is féidir gan amhras an teanga a mhúineadh go maith in sna scoileanna gairm-oidis, ach ní fheadar cad mar gheall ar an gcultúr a ghabhann léi. Ceist ana-mhór iseadh é sin go léir.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras ná go bhfuil labhairt na Gaedhilge ag dul i bhfeabhas agus ag leathnú go maith de bharr na deagh-oibre atá á dhéanamh in sna scoileanna.  Do cloisfí á labhairt anois í ar na sráideanna, in sna síopaí, ar an dtraen agus ar an mbus.  Caithfimíd coimeád chuige mar <Col N="195" /> sin agus mholfainn don Aire gan maolú ar an bhfuadar atá fé in sna scoileanna agus gan áird a thabhairt ar na daoine atá á lochtú mar gheall air.  Tá a ndícheall á dhéanamh ag na múinteoirí, in sna bun-scoileanna go mór-mhór, ar son na Gaedhilge agus is maith liom gur deineadh an clár d'éadtromú dhóibh.  Bhí san tuillte acu agus níos mó mar bhí cúram ró-mhór go léir ortha.</P>
    <P>Cúis áthais dom a chlos ón Aire go bhfuil £200,000 á chur i dtaisce aige sa mheastachán so le haghaidh scoileanna nuadha a thógaint agus seanascoileanna do dheisiú.  Tá san ag teastáil go géar ina lán áiteanna mar sé an chaoi a bhfuil cuid de sna scoileanna fén dtuaith gur baoghal do shláinte múinteoirí agus leanbhaí ionta.  Tá cuid mhaith déanta ag an Aire cheana maidir leis na scoileanna agus ní cheart dó staonadh go dtí go mbeidh gach aon fhothrach scoile acu ar lár agus scoil nua tógtha na hionad. Chuige sin teastóchaidh a lán cabhrach agus comh-oibrighthe ó sna bainisteóirí.</P>
    <P>Dhein an tAire rud maith nuair a chuir sé an Coimisiún ar bun le béal-oideas a bhailiú agus a chur in eagar. Tá daoine maithe éolgaiseacha ar an gCoimisiún san gan amhras agus daoine go bhfuil a saoghal caithte acu ag gabháil don obair sin.  Bhí cruinniú ag cuid acu le déanaighe, ámh, nuair a pléidheadh scéal an bhéal-óideasa agus cad é mar iongnadh orainn nuair a fuaireamar amach gur Béarla ar fad a bhí ar siubhal acu.  Do chuir ball de choiste Chonnradh na Gaedhilge leitir go dtí na páipéirí á gcáineadh mar gheall ar an bhfaillighe seo agus bhí an ceart aige, is dóigh liom, ach b'é donas an scéil ar fad gur as Béarla a scríobh sé féin an leitir ghearáin.  Sin é donas an donais.  Tá súil agam go mbeifear níos cúramuighe feasta mar gheall air seo agus gurb í an Ghaoluinn a bheid in úsáid ar ócáideacha den tsórt san feasta.  Tá Gaoluinn ag furmhór muinntir na hIolscoile anois agus ní gádh Béarla d'úsáid maidir leo agus dar ndóigh adhbhar oireamhnach iseadh Béal-Oideas le plé as Gaoluinn.</P>
    <P>Níl a thuille le rádh agam, a Chinn Comhairle, ach go bhfuil moladh mór tuillte ag an Aire agus ag Roinn an <Col N="196" /> Oideachais as ucht a bhfuil á dhéanamh ar son na Gaedhilge acu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister yesterday evening reviewed, at considerable length, the activities of his Department in a variety of directions, but the speech, apart from its length, was remarkable not so much for what it contained but for what was omitted from it.  In this respect I desire to refer to that portion of the speech of the Minister dealing with replacement of defective school buildings.  In a speech running into 54 typewritten pages, the Minister could find only one page in which to deal with that pressing problem, which goes to the root of the whole educational system in this country.  We are told by the Minister that in rural areas the replacement of defective buildings is proceeding as rapidly as circumstances permitted.  But the Minister did not take the House into his confidence and tell them for what reason it was not possible to proceed with the replacement of defective schools more rapidly at the present time than he is doing.  The Minister seems to be satisfied with the making of annual allocations from the Estimates for the purpose of replacement of defective schools.  He is satisfied, apparently, to believe that the policy, if continued for a long period of years, will ultimately make an impression upon the problem of repairing defective schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in the debate on the School Attendance Bill discussed here some time ago that, structurally, the national schools of this country were amongst the worst to be found on the whole continent of Europe.  There were many of these schools, particularly in rural areas, that one could hardly believe would conform to any test which might be imposed as to what exactly constituted a proper school building.  Many of these schools are situated in dreary swampy places.  In other cases they are structurally defective. Many of them have not seen paint for decades, and the interior woodwork is often in a dilapidated condition. They suffer, in many cases, from want of proper ventilation and want of proper sanitation.  Generally <Col N="197" /> speaking, a large proportion of the schools in the rural areas, as I think the Minister acknowledged when introducing his Estimates in 1934, are in a very bad and insanitary condition, yet in face of that fact the only programme the Minister put before the House in the matter of repairing defective buildings is to make an annual allocation in the manner indicated in the Estimates. That is only dealing with the problem in a piecemeal manner, and we should have to go on for a very long time, proceeding in that manner, before we would be able to arrive at a decent solution of the problem of the defective schools, especially if it was to be approached in the half-hearted way envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think there is nothing more calculated to impede the work of the teacher in the school than to compel him or her to endeavour to impart education in a structurally defective building which is dreary and lonely and drab and uninviting, and in which the mind of the child cannot ever reach a high level.  If we are to succeed in our desire to impart the maximum of education to children, and to impart that education under conditions which make it possible for the child to absorb the maximum amount of education which the teacher imparts, we should set about, in a speedy and in a vigorous manner, replacing the defective school buildings which exist in the country.  We should proceed to erect new schools in their stead, to ensure their proper ventilation and lighting, so as to make them attractive to the children, and to make sure that the children shall have education imparted to them in circumstances much more calculated to enable them to retain that education than in the circumstances under which it is imparted to them to-day.</P>
    <P>I think instead of making this annual allocation in the manner suggested by the Minister in the Estimate, the Government should take its courage in its hands and borrow a large capital sum for the purpose of speedily replacing the defective schools in the country.  Let that capital loan, such as is necessary, be borrowed, be repaid <Col N="198" /> by the allocation of a certain annual sum in the Estimates, and in that way we can be sure that a large capital sum is available for the purpose of the replacement of defective schools, and that that can be availed of with the minimum of delay.  If the problem was tackled on these lines it would be very much more calculated to lead to the replacement of defective school buildings, at an early date, than dealing, in restricted small sums, with a problem which, if it is to be solved effectively, efficiently and expeditiously, can only be solved if we are prepared to make available the sums necessary to enable these defective buildings to be replaced by suitable buildings.  If the Government are prepared to carry on a policy of making annual allocations, there is no reason why the capital value of those allocations could not be borrowed in one sum.  With that money available the Government could then feel satisfied that the question of replacing defective school buildings could be tackled expeditiously.  I am afraid the present policy of making annual allocations is one which stereotypes the amount of replacement, and stereotypes it at a rate which is inadequate having regard to the huge problem of replacement which at present confronts us.</P>
    <P>In another portion of his speech the Minister made a brief reference to that all-important question of raising the school leaving age.  In this very lengthy speech no more than a few lines could be devoted to giving the House the views of the Minister and his Department on this all-important problem.  The Minister approaches the matter by saying that &ldquo;the inter-departmental committee engaged upon a study of the problem of the raising of the school-leaving age presented a unanimous report.  As a summary of this report has already appeared in the Press, I shall not trouble you with the details here.&rdquo;  It is some time ago since the Minister told the House that he would have a copy of this report circulated to Deputies for their information. This report in particular is one which might usefully have been placed before now in the hands of Deputies, so that we might have some effective examination of the problem as <Col N="199" /> envisaged by the inter-departmental committee which considered it. Instead, the Minister merely tells us that &ldquo;the inter-departmental committee was engaged in a study of the problem; it presented a unanimous report, and if you want to find out anything about the report then you do not come to the Department of Education, but look at the public Press, and you will find a summary of it there.  If you do that, then there is no need for me to trouble you in this speech with any details of the scheme dealt with by the committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the worst report that has ever been presented by any departmental committee was presented by the inter - departmental committee which dealt with this problem.  Apart from the committee who, of course, are standing for their own views, and apart from the Minister who appointed them, and apart from rather hysterical leading articles in the <i>Irish Press,</i> which had not very much logic or justification, the Minister has not been able to get any single independent authority interested in the question of education or interested in the question of the future welfare of the children of this State to support the view-point which is contained in the recommendation of this committee.  Even Deputies of the Minister's own Party have denounced the report, and notwithstanding the effort made by the <i>Irish Press</i> to get views in consonance with its own on this matter the result was extremely disappointing even from the particular point of view which it was postulating.  The fact of the matter is that nobody has any respect whatever for the report of this inter-departmental committee, and the only people apparently who can be induced to stand for the report are the committee itself, the Minister, and the Government Party organ.  A member of the Minister's own Party so well versed in educational problems as Deputy Cormac Breathnach has felt that even the restraint of Party discipline could not keep him from denouncing the report, lock, stock and barrel.  It is no wonder, therefore, that the Minister in his speech does not want to say much <Col N="200" /> about the activities of this inter-departmental committee which dealt with the problem of the school-leaving age.</P>
    <P>The committee, in my opinion, approached the problem from an entirely wrong angle.  Judging from the summarised version of its report which appeared in the Press, it seemed to have been concerned more with making a case against the general extension of the school-leaving age than with examining the problem which arose out of the fact that children are at present permitted to leave school at 14 years of age.  We were told in the committee's report, if we are to judge by the summarised version of it which appeared in the Press, that children were not too immature for entering into industry at 14 years of age.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows, too, that almost two months ago he promised to circulate to individual Deputies a copy of this report, and so far the Minister has not kept that portion of his promise to the House. If the Minister will hand me a copy of the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;that, I take it, will not be questioned by the Minister&mdash;I will show him the relevant portion of the report dealing with this matter. Does the Minister deny that the committee went on record as saying that children of 14 years of age were not too immature for entry into industry?  Has not that been one of the points on which their whole report has been assailed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, like the newspapers that have assailed the report, has taken care not to quote the context of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied to be judged by the <i>Irish Press</i> version of it?  If he would pass me over a <Col N="201" /> copy of the <i>Irish Press,</i> which contained their version of it, I will have no hesitation in relying on that.  That is probably more favourable to the Minister than to me in that particular matter.  I think anybody who has read the summarised report, or anybody who has read the report which is made available in the Library, will have no hesitation whatever in realising that the committee regarded the entry of children into industry at 14 years of age as something which did not at any rate excite their desire to prevent a development of that condition.  If there is any way in which we can judge the complete unsuitability of this committee to deal with this problem of the school-leaving age, it is on those very lines of its report.  To suggest that children of that age are not too young for entry into industry is to suggest to people who have any knowledge of the complexities and technicalities of modern industry something which they know to be palpably untrue.  If the individual members of that committee had some experience of working in a clothing factory, or had some experience of working in a mill, or had some experience of working at any of the mechanical processes that are carried on in the State to-day, I think they would have no hesitation in realising that children of such tender years are utterly unsuited, educationally, physically and mentally, for meeting the full impact of modern industry on their undeveloped minds and on their undeveloped bodies.  Yet, this report of this remarkable committee tells us in 1936 that children of that age are not too immature for entry into industry.  A hundred years ago the committee whose report led to the introduction of the Shaftesbury Factory Acts in Britain would not go on record as expressing that view.  It was left to this remarkable committee appointed by the Minister in the Irish Free State in 1936 to put on record the view that children of such tender years are not too immature for entering into industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee seems to have taken the viewpoint, in its approach to this problem, that the problem to be dealt with was one of taking the child out of industry; and appears to have had <Col N="202" /> the belief that the main case for raising the school-leaving age has been in order to keep children from going into industry, and, by the passage of legislation, to endeavour to have those who are in industry ejected from it.  Those who have been advocating the raising of the school-leaving age have never advocated it solely on the ground that it would prevent children going into industry during their tender years. The case for the raising of the school-leaving age has been based on two main considerations.  One was that in a complex life in which education is playing, and will continue to play, an increasingly important part, it is desirable that we should equip our future citizens with the maximum measure of education which it is possible for the State to impart to them.  Those who have been advocating the raising of the school-leaving age in any representative capacity have pleaded in support of that reform the necessity, in the first instance, of keeping the child at school as long as possible in order to give the child the maximum possible education.  It has also been urged as an important secondary consideration that it is undesirable in the interests of the education, the health, the general physique and the physical well-being of the nation that children should be allowed to enter industry at 14 years of age.  It has been pleaded that the return to the State and to the community, now and in the future, would be very much greater if these children were prevented from entering industry until a later age, and were enabled to absorb in the schools the education which, in these formative years, they are more capable of absorbing than when they are very much younger.</P>
    <P>The case, therefore, for raising the school-leaving age has been based on two main considerations; firstly, to equip the child better for the intellectual battle in life; and, secondly, to prevent the child going into industry at a time when its undeveloped mind and body are incapable of meeting, without seriously impairing its own health, the full impact of modern industrial life.  The committee appear to think that the question of the retention of the child at school is a small <Col N="203" /> consideration compared with the question of the child being prevented from entering into industry.</P>

      <P>The very decided effort made by the committee to show that the whole question of raising the school-leaving age had an industrial and not an educational basis, shows that the committee approached the problem from an entirely wrong standpoint and, by ignoring the main consideration, namely, the educational benefits to the children by retaining them at school as long as possible, and, particularly between the ages of 14 and 16, the committee showed itself to be utterly unfitted for its task.  The members of the committee have no knowledge whatever of the conditions in industry such as to entitle them to say that a child of 14 was not too <Col N="204" /> immature to enter industry.  One might understand a child entering industry at 14 if there was a scarcity of labour.</P>

In the summarised report the committee deal with the question of children of 14 leaving school and entering industry. The report is an item in the Minister's speech and, presumably, we are paying the salaries of the people who constituted the committee, or some of them, in this Estimate.  I suggest that the fact that the report has been made, that our attention has been directed to it by the Minister in his speech, and that the report raised definitely the question of the desirability of the child leaving school at 14 and entering industry, makes it possible to make some brief reference to the question.</P>

      <P>I do not know the Deputy's definition of brevity.  To raise the school-leaving age would, I understand, require legislation.  Legislation may not be advocated on the Estimates.

      <P>I do not desire to get beyond your ruling, but I should like a ruling as to whether we are permitted to discuss the report on this Estimate, seeing that the Minister has directed our attention to it in his speech.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take the same impression.  You are so convinced of that, that I shall pass from the report with this suggestion to the Minister.  This report is a thoroughly bad and reactionary one.  It is the product of halfhearted, timid people who know little about the problem to be dealt with, and less about the condition of the working class children.  I hope the Minister will not take that report as the basis of his future policy in the matter of extending the school-leaving age, and that we will have <Col N="206" /> some of the radicalism, which the Minister formerly ventilated in this House and outside, in the matter of the school-leaving age; that the Minister will tell us he is not prepared to accept that report as the basis of his school-leaving age policy but will come to the House later with proposals for raising the school-leaving age and giving children, particularly the children of the working classes, an opportunity of absorbing the educational which to-day, under the educational system which we have, can be bought by some and must be denied to others because they have not the wherewithal to buy it.  That is the kind of legislation we should expect from the present Minister for Education, not the timid, halfhearted type of legislation that is envisaged in the report of this committee.</P>
      <P>In this and subsequent Estimates, the administration of which will be in the hands of the Minister, a very substantial sum of money is being provided for education throughout the country.  The object of the Minister is to make available to the children the benefits of a free national school education.  I want to suggest to the Minister, without advocating legislation, that this education is often imparted to the children under conditions which do not enable them to absorb it efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing, under this series of Estimates, schools for the education of children.  The State provides teachers for the education of the children.  The State prepares the school programmes which are to be adhered to as part of the national school education.  Yet the State appears to be quite unconcerned with the position of many school-going children whose families are in necessitous circumstances.  These children are compelled to trudge to school and to take their place in their classes without being able to purchase the school-books through which it is thought to impart education to them.  If the State goes to the length of saying it is necessary to provide free schools; if it goes to the length of paying national school teachers, and if it goes to the length <Col N="207" /> of saying that a fixed programme, carefully planned, shall be devised and adhered to, I suggest that the Minister ought to go a further step towards ensuring that the children who attend the schools will at least be equipped with the books which are provided for them in the particular standard in which they are placed.  Many children go to school to-day without books. One can picture the task of the teacher trying to impart education to a child who has not even a school-book which the teacher is taking as the text-book. It is not an unknown thing to the Minister's Department that children do attend school without school-books and that they try to acquire information by looking over the shoulder of another child who has a school-book.  Education imparted under these circumstances cannot be adequately imparted nor adequately absorbed by the children.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the State provides schools and that it provides teachers, the Minister should see that there should be a recognition of the fact that it is just as necessary to provide text-books as it is to provide schools and teachers.  One has only to contemplate for a few moments the situation of the child attending school without books to realise how much of the teacher's time and talents are wasted in endeavouring to impart knowledge under such circumstances. It might cost a considerable amount annually to provide these books, but I think such money provided by the State would be a very valuable investment. It would ensure that the child was, at least so far as the text-books are concerned, equipped with the medium of absorbing information.  The provision by the State of school-books for necessitous children would result in improving their standard of education and would prevent the appalling waste of time and talent which takes place to-day.  Many children, through sheer economic necessity, are compelled to attend school without books.</P>
    <P>A matter closely related to the provision of text-books is the question of the condition in which the children are housed in school during their attendance there.  Many of these children <Col N="208" /> are the children of the 143,000 who are registered at the employment exchanges as unemployed.  Many of these children are the children of a father who has not merely to sustain himself but his wife and children on the small allowances provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act. Children trying to exist under these circumstances are inevitably forced to leave home in the morning sometimes with no breakfast and in most cases an inadequate breakfast.  They trudge the long weary way to school with a body suffering from mal-nutrition or probably famished.  These children are compelled to remain in school for six hours.  During that period, through sheer economic necessity, they are unable to provide themselves with a lunch.  The State does nothing really effective to ensure that the child will be physically sustained during this period in the school.  Trying to impart education to famished bodies, suffering in many cases from mal-nutrition, is a very trying task to those on whose shoulders that responsibility devolves.</P>
    <P>We talk about free education in this country, but I do not think that we can ever justify that claim so long as the school-children are sent to school without books and many of them without a breakfast.  Remember these children are not able to obtain any sustaining meal during their long hours at school.</P>
    <P>So long as these conditions are present in the national schools in practically all areas in the country, it will be impossible for the State to get an adequate return on the money spent on national education.  While it would cost more money to provide a simple mid-day meal at school and free text books to necessitous school children I think the expenditure by the State would been expenditure which would yield a very substantial dividend in the form of a better educated citizenry and a bolder and physically stronger nation.  It may be urged against the policy of extending national school education to the extent I have mentioned that it would cost money.  Again I suggest to the Minister that ultimately the problem will have to be tackled.  In the meantime, any delay <Col N="209" /> in tackling the problem is going to continue to give us unsatisfactory results such as we have in an inadequate system of education where children have to attend school in an unnourished condition.  Many of them have not even the necessary textbooks through which the teacher is to impart knowledge.</P>
    <P>I would have thought the present Minister for Education, who was fond in other days of giving expression to radical views in this and other matters, would not have occupied his present position very long before he came to this House and asked for a bold policy of that kind, one which will give to the working-class children free national school education in the fullest sense of the term.  I hope the Minister will not allow any pettifogging impediments such as have been created for him in other respects by the Inter-Departmental Committee to stand in the way.  I hope no impediments will be created to prevent his undertaking a bold policy of providing a mid-day meal for the school-going children, and that, at all events, he will have sufficient courage to face up to the necessary expenditure involved in providing school-going children with the textbooks they want for their educational advancement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to draw attention to one particular point. Before I deal with that specific point, I should like to say a few words upon the question with which Deputy Norton was dealing&mdash;the question of the school-leaving age.  I am dealing with that question entirely from the point of view of the agricultural community.  I think that the Minister might exhort persons who live in the country districts&mdash;the ordinary farmer and farm labourer&mdash;to go back much more to what used to be a custom in my youth&mdash; the custom of the &ldquo;winter scholar.&rdquo; Boys who were of age to be of use upon farms, large or small, during the summer, used not to attend school in the summer.  They attended regularly during the winter and they were known, as I am sure, you, a Chinn Comhairle, are aware, as &ldquo;winter scholars.  By way of exhortation rather than by legislation, the Minister might urge on rural <Col N="210" /> districts that more grown boys should be kept at school during the winter months, even though they be required to work at home.  I am dealing with agricultural circumstances and not with town circumstances with which I am not so familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I do think that in rural schools the programme is altogether too wide.  If the Minister consulted the ordinary national school teacher, he would tell him that he has too wide a programme to teach, that he cannot teach any single subject intensively because he has got to teach a lot of subjects extensively, and that this is not giving the boy the same training or equipment as the intensive teaching of a few subjects would give him.  I question whether, with all the reforms that have taken place in national education in recent years, boys coming out of our national schools are as well ground in the important subjects as boys coming out of national schools 40 or 50 years ago were.  These boys were not taught a number of things which boys are being taught now but they were thoroughly ground and, what they knew, they knew completely.  To my mind, education has three aims. In the first place, the aim of education is to form moral character; in the second place, to train the intellect to work and, in the third place&mdash;if it is an aim of education at all&mdash;to acquire knowledge.  The acquisition of knowledge is only the means by which the intellect is trained in education so-called and character is formed by acquiring habits of industry, concentration and the like.  Nowadays, it seems to me that there is a tendency to put the acquisition of knowledge&mdash; knowledge which will be of very small importance to the child in after life&mdash; in the first place and the training of the intellect in the second place.  I should rather have the boy able to do sums which he would require to do in the avocation which he is to follow.  If the ordinary boy from an agricultural district goes to a fair or market, he should be able to do mental arithmetic quickly.  That should be the main thing and a lot of these other subjects <Col N="211" /> which he will forget the moment he leaves school should not be driven into him.  If the Minister went to a group of country national teachers and asked them their views on the present programme, he would find almost unanimous agreement that the present programme tends to be too wide.  It seems to me that the opinion of the national teachers as a body does not get the recognition it ought to get.  I see resolutions passed and views expressed by national teachers which do not seem to carry as much weight as they should.  They do not seem to have attributed to them the weight that I think should be attributed to them. After all, the national teacher has got practical experience of the work he is doing.  He sees how the children under his care are progressing.  He sees that really better than the inspector because he is watching them from day to day.  He is giving them, more or less, individual attention.  I am sure that, when the views of a considerable number of teachers are expressed, they are given attention.  I am not saying that they are completely ignored but I do not think they are given the force in the Department that I should like to see them receive.  I do not make these few remarks on the general subject of education with any hope that these established programmes will be substantially altered as a result of them.  I make them in the hope that the question of narrowing down the programmes may be considered rather than the modern tendency to extend them.</P>
    <P>The one subject on which I have risen to address the House is the question of the £2 prizes which are given for the Irish language.  So far as the principle is concerned, I am in agreement with the Minister.  I think it is very good, but I am not at all in agreement with the way in which these prizes are being given.  Some information has been placed at my disposal, and I am going to give it to the Minister now and ask him to inquire into it.  In certain instances I think great unfairness is being done.  The principal case I have in mind is one which I have already brought to the notice of the Department of Education. <Col N="212" /> For obvious reasons I shall not mention names, and neither shall I indicate the school to which I am referring, or the teacher.  It appears that these £2 prizes are given when two things concur&mdash;one is that the child is able to speak Irish, and the second is that Irish is used to a considerable extent, or is made the principal language, in the child's home.  On the first ground, the inspector is the natural judge and I am not quarrelling with any decisions any inspector has given as to the competency of the child to speak Irish.  On the second ground, it appears to me that great abuse may creep in and, in one instance, I am satisfied, on the facts before me, that great abuse has crept in.  The facts have been brought before me, and I have mentioned the case to the Department. The parents themselves in this particular instance tell me that they have communicated with the Department. As far as I can gather, the practice is that the teacher mentions to the Inspector whether Irish is or is not the language of the child's home, and no further investigation is made. That I understand is the amazing position, leaving everything completely at the mercy of the teacher.  There is a particular case which I have brought to the notice of the Department; the charge is roundly made that unless a person belongs to a particular school of thought he is not getting these prizes.  A certain teacher&mdash;I am not mentioning his name; I do not think from anything I say that he can be traced, but the Department have the particulars before them&mdash;according to the reports which have reached me, refused to certify that Irish is the home language of the children unless the people happen to agree with his political views.  This has occurred.  He has refused to give certificates, and children have not got these £2 prizes. Suddenly the parents say to him they have changed their political views, and immediately they become eligible for the prizes.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister say that.  I have communicated with the Department on the matter.  The communication may not have reached the Minister.  If the Minister does not wish me to press the matter any further in public I will send the details to him, the name of the school teacher and the names of the children and of the parents involved.  Will the Minister then send down an inspector who will see as to whether the parents are or are not Irish-speaking, because I can assure the Minister that in this particular instance I am satisfied&mdash;of course, I have only a one-sided statement&mdash;that an injustice is being done? If the Minister will send an inspector to inquire as to whether what I have said is well founded, I am perfectly satisfied.  I am sure that the inspector the Minister will send will act fairly and properly in the matter.  I shall send the Minister, if he has not got them already, the names of the people concerned, and of the school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I desire, first of all, to state that I did not get a translation of his speech last night, and I regret to have to admit that I did not understand one word of what he said.  Notwithstanding all that, I was pleased to hear the Minister introduce this Estimate in Irish.  He held me spellbound with his musical Irish tongue for two hours.  Several comments have been made here on the teaching of Irish.  I am pleased to inform the Minister that the teaching of Irish in the National Schools has made tremendous strides within the past few years.  It is a grand thing to hear the children on coming home from school conversing in our native tongue. I sincerely hope that there will be further advancements in that direction. <Col N="214" /> Perhaps in the near future all the debates in the House will be carried on in the Irish language.  We must remember that it was the sweet tongue of our Druids in past ages and of our sages, and when the Minister ceases to preserve the Irish language his glory expires.  I cannot say whether he omitted any important items in this Estimate or not.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Norton as regards the unsuitability of some of the schools in the rural areas.  There is no doubt that some of them are in a bad condition and in some places sanitation is in a shocking state.  I cannot say whether it is a matter for the Minister's Department to rectify that state of affairs. I know that in a number of national schools from time to time there have been outbreaks of diphtheria and scarlet fever and those schools have been kept open when they should have been closed.  I think it shows great neglect of duty on the part of doctors in those areas that they do not insist on schools being closed up when outbreaks occur.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister.  There is general complaint amongst parents all over the country of the volume of home work which children get.  The time of parents, which they cannot very well spare from their house work and farm work is taken up with the teaching of those children.  I consider that six hours a day is quite sufficient for school children and that this large volume of home exercises should not be given to them.  It is a system which should be put a stop to.  I consider that it only makes children dull to be cramming their immature brains.  It is a matter I think the Minister should take into serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards books for the children of the labouring classes, there is a tremendous amount of money spent on education.  I think that some money should be devoted to the purchasing of books for the children of agricultural labourers.  These poor people cannot afford even to provide their children with luncheons and certainly cannot afford the expense of the books which their children need <Col N="215" /> in the school.  I have not much more to say upon this matter. But I would like to know from the Minister why a number of privileged Deputies were supplied with translations of his speech while others have been treated with scant courtesy and especially members of the Centre Party.  We never got a copy of the translation of his speech.  I think the translation should have been delivered to all of us so as to give every Deputy in the House an opportunity of going through the Education Estimates and criticising the Minister, not, perhaps, for what he said so much as for what he omitted.  He may, perhaps, have made an attempt, in that speech, to take a short cut through the Estimates. I do not say he did but we do not know.  The Minister should consider in future when proposing huge Estimates such as this giving every Deputy a copy of the translation of his speech and not compelling them to wait for the reports in the Press.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Tadhg Murphy Mr. Tadhg Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tadhg Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this debate ought to close without the Minister being reminded about a number of matters that I have not heard referred to so far.  The Minister must be aware of the fact that there are still a small number of the old convent teachers, and junior assistant mistresses, who have been very badly treated.  The number is not very big, and the amount of money that would be necessary to give them some recompense for many years of faithful service would not involve much of a strain upon the Exchequer no matter how hard the times may be.  I realise it is not entirely correct to put all the blame for this matter at the door of the Minister.  He is only partly responsible for this rather serious omission so far as the people concerned go. I urge he should avail of an early opportunity to talk to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, about this matter and take the earliest possible steps to remedy this blot, for it is a blot, not only on his administration, <Col N="216" /> but even on the State, so long as it continues without being remedied.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another matter very lightly touched upon by Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan.  I was sorry to find a Deputy like Gearoid O'Sullivan touch upon it as apologetically as he seemed to do.  I have before me a statement of the correspondence that took place between the national teachers' organisation and the Minister with reference to a member of the inspectorate staff of his Department. I do not at all agree that the matter should be discussed in the manner that Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan wished last night.  He just whispered about it and left it there.  It is unquestionably a very serious matter in view of the settled policy of the Department's inspectorate in regard to the inspection of national schools. I have been at teachers' meetings, occasionally, and I have heard complaints about the inspectorate system. Sometimes I wondered if these complaints were not slightly exaggerated. But in view of the terms of the document I have before me I am forced to the conclusion that there is a great deal to be desired if the condition of things as represented in this correspondence are allowed to continue. The regulations of the Department with regard to inspection of teachers and schools provides for certain things. Certain principles are laid down including the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When examining pupils the inspector should prove by his manner that his object is to elicit what they know&mdash;not to expose their ignorance. He should, therefore, avoid showing signs of dissatisfaction or impatience. He should not frighten the children in any way or confuse or puzzle them by unreasonable questions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And there are extracts from a number of other regulations in a similar strain which I think are very commendable and very proper.  But this memorandum contains all sorts of complaints from all parts of the State and practically from every county in the State which go to show that a particular inspector is entirely ignorant of or absolutely tramples upon the instructions of his Department. <Col N="217" /> Now it may be said that there is some exaggeration in the complaints. But I think it is very unlikely that a responsible organisation like the teachers' organisation, and after they had examined a very large number of complaints that, significantly enough, have come in from various parts of the country where this official has operated, would send them to the Minister and ask without very, very serious cause that this matter should be investigated with a view to the taking of certain actions.</P>
    <P>I want to comment upon what I think deserves comment, and that is the fact that although this complaint was forwarded on the 28th of February, 1935, a reply was not received for several months afterwards, and that that reply was only received after there had been frequent reminders sent to the Department that that important document was not acknowledged or any decision announced upon it.  It seems to me at all events clear that this young official of the Minister's Department has been running amok here and there through the country, and that he has been endeavouring to show, not how his services should be employed to serve and to advance, but to show how faults can be found over every small matter and to show how much distress a bad-tempered and unpleasant person can cause to others whom he visits occasionally.  It is an interesting thing in connection with this matter that the National Teachers' Organisation desire to have this man's conduct investigated.  Of course there is no need to say that that generally represents the position so far as the teachers are concerned.  Certain complaints, vouched for in a very definite manner, detailed in every degree, were sent to the Minister, and if the Minister was well satisfied that the complaints were well founded, it appeared to the teachers' organisation there was only one remedy in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the Deputy is, perhaps, not aware that the charges were not vouched for. A list of cases was given, but the only information we had was the names of the counties in which incidents were <Col N="218" /> stated to have occurred.  We were not supplied with the names of the teachers or the schools in question.  I do not see how the Deputy can say that a case against the inspector was vouched for in any way.</P>

In return may I inquire from the Minister if his Department took any steps that would enable them to identify the schools of the teachers that made the complaints?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respectfully suggest to the Minister that in view of the serious nature of the complaint it was his duty to make inquiries, and that he had that responsibility to his officials.  The Department, without ascertaining if the complaints were a serious libel on an official in question, simply evaded the fact.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister is evading the question in refusing to say whether or not such steps were taken by his Department.  This is quite a serious matter, and I sincerely hope that the fact that it has been rather lightly dismissed in a correspondence of a few lines will not end the matter.  I suggest that if the Minister finds there are fair grounds for complaint, and that the particulars supplied are justified, reasonable and proper steps should be taken in restraining the person concerned from the very undesirable activities which are complained of. This is not a pleasant matter to refer to.  Complaints of this kind do not usually come from this quarter of the House.  It is regrettable that they should have to be made on this occasion, and I hope that the occasion for making complaints of the kind will not arise again for a very considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of school buildings, I want to endorse what has been said. I want to express my appreciation of what the Minister has done recently in the part of the country that I represent, in regard to some long standing extremely bad cases of defective school <Col N="219" /> buildings.  In two cases grants for the erection of new schools were sanctioned as far back as 1912, and have since been held up owing to the difficulty in connection with a local contribution. I do with pleasure express my appreciation of the way in which the Minister met the representations made to him on this matter recently, and enabled provision to be made for blotting out two of the worst schools in West Cork and providing proper schools without entailing any great financial hardship on the local people. It is very commendable, and I have only to say in connection with the matter that there is still a very large number of defective school buildings in that area, and in many other areas, which would merit the early and sympathetic attention of the Minister's Department. I should like to remind him that it does appear very inconsistent that we should continue very energetically to proceed with a housing campaign for the purpose of eliminating unhealthy surroundings for men and women and very largely for children, and at the same time permit the desolate and unhealthy surroundings that are inflicted on the children during the school hours. I would urge that, in connection with school buildings, the same energy might be displayed in blotting out some of the miserable old hovels which are still masquerading as schools in this country, and we might put into the drive for new schools a portion of the very commendable energy that is used in the matter of housing generally in this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>In view, Sir, of the hesitancy of the Ceann Comhairle to permit of any prolonged discussion on the question of the school-leaving age, I do not want to refer to it at any length, beyond saying that the Minister ought to consider that it is absolutely essential, especially in present circumstances and in view of the developments that are likely in this country in the next few years if it is to progress, that children of all classes of people in the country should have an equal opportunity in the matter of education.  As long as there is a position that does enable the children of many persons in the country to leave school long before they should <Col N="220" /> do so, there remains a problem which the Minister himself or his successor will have to tackle and remove.  I hope that the credit for the removal of that problem will be earned by the Minister, and that the whole position in regard to this question will be reviewed in a much more reasonable and democratic manner in the near future than has been done up to the present.</P>
    <P>I have only to say in that connection that I have long ago lost faith in the reports of the Inter-Departmental Committees. If I mistake not, another Inter-Departmental Committee examined, within the last two or three years, the question of the provision of free school books for children, and whether or not any report was made I know that certain Departmental inquiries in connection with that matter proceeded for a considerable time.  It is very regrettable that this whole present problem of the provision of school books for children did not appear to present itself in the important manner in which it should have presented itself to the officials of the Department who conducted such investigations.  Again, I would say to the Minister that in the question of national school education, which is alleged to be free, the Minister should take the necessary steps to make sure that it is free in every sense of the word.  Children ought not to be compelled to obtain school requisites through the generosity of their neighbours or the generosity of the teachers, or, in the absence of that generosity, to do without such school requisites. It is clearly inequitable that such conditions should exist, and there is a growing feeling, which will be extremely strong in a short time, that this matter will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer also.  Deputy McMenamin referred here last evening to the question of reformatories and reformatory school boys.  I want to make reference to industrial school children, and to bring to the notice of the Minister certain things which I have seen in connection with the entire absence of supervision of ex-industrial school children.  One hears occasionally&mdash;and one is always glad and proud <Col N="221" /> to hear it&mdash;of an industrial school boy who makes good in the world; who becomes a well-educated person, and obtains a position in life which reflects much credit on himself and on the training that he received.  But there is the other side of the story, and I want to complain with all the sincerity I can command about what appears to me to be the appalling lack of supervision in the case of many ex-industrial school boys.  I have seen a number of them appearing from time to time recently before courts of referees in pursuit of claims to unemployment assistance, and from questioning a number of them I have elicited the fact that from the time some years before when they left the industrial schools and went into what is termed &ldquo;employment,&rdquo; they had never received any wages.  They were badly clothed and presented the appearance of being entirely neglected.  It seems to me that this hiring out of industrial school boys without any full inquiry as to the manner in which they will be looked after is a very serious scandal. They are badly treated, and no attempt is made to train them.  The whole thing to me savours of a traffic in human beings that is entirely deplorable. I am sure the Minister is not responsible, and the superiors of the industrial schools may not be entirely aware of what goes on.  But there are a growing number of cases of the kind all over the country.</P>
    <P>References were made last night to the growth of crime amongst juveniles. I do not know whether that is so or not, or whether it is worth all the references that were made to it.  But if there is any foundation for it, I suggest to the Minister that it might easily be accounted for by what I have referred to.  An inquiry might very easily be made as to what contact is maintained between the industrial schools and the boys who leave them and as to the conditions under which they are housed, clothed, fed and employed after leaving them.  That inquiry would enable the Minister and the officials of the Department who control the industrial schools to get a full appreciation of what appears to me at least to be a very unpleasant position in many respects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> Then as to another matter.  Regret must be expressed that the provisions of the Temporary Economies Act, which have lapsed so far as most of the public servants are concerned, still continue in regard to the national teachers.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter which ought to be considered at an early date and that an effort ought to be made to remove the feeling that exists that in regard to working and general conditions the representations made through their organisation by the national teachers do not get the consideration that they deserve from the Minister's Department. It would be regrettable if such a responsible organisation, representing several thousands of responsible people, should get the feeling that the representations made were treated lightly and without due consideration.</P>
    <P>I sincerely trust that an effort will be made to maintain between the general body of teachers and the Minister and his Department that harmony which, in my opinion, is essential to the success of the educational system.  I hope the Minister will keep in mind the points that I have tried to make, not with any desire to be unduly critical, but from the point of view of showing how far the removing of the difficulties might be helpful and beneficial to education and to the more efficient administration of the Minister's Department during the coming year and in the future generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose most Deputies realise that this Vote is one of the most important which we can discuss.  Of all the Votes that will be discussed it provides the most material for speculation and experiment and for the expression of different ideas.  Therefore, I do not think it would be wise for any Deputy to go very broadly into the question.  There is a time and a place when theories and proposed experiments might be discussed.  In debating this Estimate one has to confine oneself just to a few points.  I should like to pass on to the Minister some of the things that one hears spoken about, especially in regard to primary education, as one moves <Col N="223" /> through the country.  I pass them on as I hear and receive them.</P>
      <P>For one thing, one hears a good deal of talk about the text-books.  Last year on the Estimates reference was made to the text-books.  But, coming from a country constituency, I must represent the country viewpoint.  There is a feeling amongst country folk that the text-books are not all that they might be&mdash;that we might attain a higher standard in these things, and that the facts of history might be presented in better form than what they are.</P>
      <P>It is said that the facts of history in some history readers are presented according, possibly, to the viewpoint of the writer.  One is speaking frankly &mdash;it works out obnoxiously to the parents of a great many of the children. It is said that taking the facts of history out of their setting and presenting them as if we were writing about them in the twentieth century is not a fair way to set out the facts.  It is said also that there is a departure from the high moral tone of some of the school books with which we were familiar in our early days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no period of life so impressionable as the school-going age.  One has to think of the child-mind as a white sheet of paper just like wax.  All the impressions the child gets in its earlier years will help to cover its afterlife. It is a great thing for every State which through the medium of that white sheet of paper has an opportunity of implanting in the child's brain high ideals of purity, morals and the rest of it, so that it may grow up thinking of the things that are best in life.  It is said that we fall far short of that in our school readers and that there is a great room for improvement. On looking over the readers one is inclined to agree with that viewpoint. I would again urge on the Minister the possibility of getting a better standard of readers.  On other occasions we meet another kind of complaint, and that is with regard to the frequent changes made in the schools from one reader to another.  Where there are families of five or six children it is found when the readers are changed in <Col N="224" /> the class from year to year that, instead of being passed on to the next member of the family, the reader has to be scrapped and a new one bought. These are details which are worthy of attention from the Minister.  The remedying of this latter complaint would go part of the way towards meeting the demands made by Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy when speaking of the difficulty on the part of the parents of providing text-books for their children.</P>
    <P>Then there is another matter that is pretty current, and that is that one has to visualise the fact that in a country district the child will only receive, in the primary school, whatever education he is to get.  I am not, of course, shutting out the fact that we learn in the school of experience.  What I do say is that the child's school life will be within the compass of the primary school.  It is there that we have to equip the child for the battle of life. It is complained that too many subjects are attempted in the schools&mdash; subjects that are non-essentials.  It is suggested that if we concentrated more on the things that would be useful to the child in its after life, it would be more advantageous for the child.  I was speaking the other day to an old pupil of a school which we attended long years ago.  He is a man who has achieved success in the educational world, and he said, in speaking of the primary school which he attended, that the mathematics which he got there during the early years of his life equalled anything he afterwards got in the university.  It is said to-day that our children are not getting a good ground work in the primary schools.  It is said that the three R's are not regarded as essential nowadays, that the children get a smattering of other things.  I have been frequently told that when a child gets home and is asked by his father to make up the price of certain articles, the child is not able to do the sum in a practical way.  With regard to the teaching of geography, it is said that we are not teaching it efficiently.  I know that it is being taught in a different way from the way in which it was taught in the old days.  If you ask a child to-day what are the <Col N="225" /> principal towns in a certain county in Ireland, he will tell you: &ldquo;We do not learn geography that way to-day.&rdquo;  We are not giving the children a grasp of the things which would enable them intelligently to meet the battle of life.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Murphy visualised when he said that the State should provide facilities where an equal opportunity could be given to everybody.  I do not know whether he visualises university education or not.  Whether he did or not I think the great thing for the country boy or girl is to get a good groundwork at the primary school, so that he shall learn not alone his A B C but that he shall also learn those principles of reading, writing and arithmetic; those things that go to make a good citizen, and that would make them appreciate their own country instead of turning their eyes always to a foreign land.  In this way we shall have growing up with us a better peasantry and a better class of people.  It is in that way that we can work out our destinies in our own country in an intelligent way.</P>
    <P>When speaking of providing those facilities for school-going children, surely Deputy Norton's picture is overdrawn when he told us of children going to school without breakfast.  I do not think that we should ask the Minister to shoulder that problem. Surely that picture must be overdrawn in a State when the local government provides so much for the comfort of the people.  In a State where necessitous children can have pure new milk for the asking, in a State where into the needy and necessitous home there come free beef, unemployment assistance and home assistance, surely Deputy Norton's picture is entirely overdrawn. Again and again I have heard it said that we have no starving people in this country, and that there is a bite and a sup for everybody.  I would venture to hope so.  I do not think for a moment that the picture that Deputy Norton drew is a typical picture of our country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like to stand behind the Minister in every effort he makes for the advancement of education in this country.  We would all like to see the average boys and girls in the country able to read, write and count and do <Col N="226" /> the things that help them to earn their living and make them useful citizens of our State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrPatrickJODowd" hpid="Dr. O'Dowd Dr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points to which I would like to draw attention before this debate comes to a close.  I would like to endorse what has been said by the previous speakers about the necessity for the provision of suitable school buildings throughout the country.  While I admit that in the last seven or eight years a big improvement has taken place in the provisions of suitable school buildings, there are yet in many parts of the country buildings that are totally unsuitable for use as school rooms.  In addition to the provision of suitable buildings, there should also be an effort made to provide suitable playgrounds attached to the school in cities and large towns that would keep the children off the roads and would enable them to enjoy the exercise necessary to their mental and physical benefit.  I am at a loss to know how Deputy Kent, when speaking of unsuitable schools in East Cork&mdash;or whatever part of Cork it was&mdash;could have made the charges he made.  Some of the Deputies from Cork are very fond always of levelling charges at the medical officers of health in the County Cork.  Deputy Kent said there was an epidemic of scarlatina and diphtheria in his constituency, and that it was due to the neglect of the doctor.  I do not know whether that remark of Deputy Kent's was really used seriously.  I would prefer to think that the Deputy made such a remark without reflecting on its seriousness.  In case the Deputy does not know the procedure in these cases, I want to tell him that the local medical officer in the particular district to which he refers had no power to close the schools.  The Deputy should know that the medical officer could only make representations to the Manager.  The Manager is the person who has power to close the schools. Deputy Kent should also know that diphtheria and scarlatina are notifiable disease, and that once they occur in an adult or in a school-going child, they are reported to the county medical officer of health, and that it is the duty of the sanitary authority to take the necessary steps to prevent the spread <Col N="227" /> of the disease.  I think Deputy Kent, or any other Deputy, should not make a statement of that kind reflecting on the medical officers of the district from which they come, especially when they know that these medical officers cannot reply to these statements.  They should not use their privileged position to make such attacks on these officers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the School Attendance Act, I should like to say that the parents of school-going children, and especially those whose children are entitled to free medical treatment under the Medical Charities Acts, have the impression that they are entitled to go to their local dispensary doctor and ask for a certificate if a child is unable to attend school.  Often, the teachers send them to the doctor to get a certificate, and often, perhaps, the school attendance officer, the Civic Guard, asks them to supply a medical certificate, but the parents should know, and the teachers and Civic Guards should know, that the dispensary doctor is not in any way bound to supply such certificate.  If the case is brought into court, the onus is on the prosecution to supply the certificate and I might say, incidentally, to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies in this House, like some people in other positions in the country who use occasions such as the National Festival to make a general attack on the morals of the Irish people use every opportunity to make attacks on the Irish language, and the use of Irish in the schools has been subjected to attack by some Deputies here, some openly and others in a veiled way.  I have personal knowledge of the fact that children who attend schools in which the teaching is done through the medium of Irish are no more backward, and, if anything, are more advanced, than the children of the same age in the English-speaking schools.  I think it is an injustice even to insinuate that children who are taught arithmetic, geography or any other subject through the medium of Irish are not getting as good an education as children taught through the medium of English.  Deputy Dillon would never get up in this House and say that a child in Germany does not <Col N="228" /> learn arithmetic properly because it is taught in German, and neither would he say that a child in France does not learn the geography or history of France because it is taught through the medium of French.</P>
    <P>But Deputies in this House and people outside it, who would like to see us forgetting all about the Irish language, take every available opportunity to tell us that too much time is spent in the schools at present in learning Irish and imparting instruction through the medium of Irish.  There are schools in this city and throughout the country in which the teachers are imparting knowledge to the children through the medium of Irish, and I would safely say that if a fair and impartial test were made, as between a group of children attending these schools and a group attending any other school, it would be found that the children who were being taught all their subjects through the medium of Irish are far in advance of the other children.  I have personal knowledge of children going to Irish-speaking schools in the city and I can safely say that these children are as far advanced, if not more advanced, than children of the same age who are learning their subjects through the medium of English.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more on that subject, but I felt that I could not allow to go unchallenged the attacks which have been made and which have been replied to already by other Deputies.  There is nothing more to which I wish to draw attention except to recommend to the Minister and to everybody who wishes to see physical development going hand in hand with mental development in the schools, that the Land Commission, in dividing estates in the neighbourhood of schools, should allocate a certain portion of the land for use as a playground by the children.  That is very important, because I think that healthy exercise and physical development in the schools, if not of primary importance, are at least important enough to merit very serious consideration by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Vote was previously before the House, I mentioned <Col N="229" /> the question of the heating of schools and I mention it again now. Most Deputies here have seen little country children toddling along the road on a cold and wet winter's morning. Invariably, they go into a school which, if it is heated at all, is only very inadequately heated.  I put it to the Minister that every effort should be made to make the school something like it ought to be and not an ice-box when the children arrive there.  In a good many rural schools now, the heating consists of a little bit of a fire in a big school-room which everybody knows is not sufficient to heat the school on a winter morning.  I think that is the first thing that should be done in providing for the comfort of the children. We cannot remedy climatic conditions here but we can certainly remedy the conditions in the schools in this matter of heating.</P>
      <P>The next point I want to refer to is that the Minister ought to provide free books for necessitous children.  Everybody is aware of the difficulty of parents at present in providing books for their children.  It has become, I am led to believe, a heavy charge on people.  I understand that books have become very expensive since my school days, and I know it must be a very difficult problem for many parents, some of whom are possibly dependent on home assistance or unemployment assistance.  It is impossible for those people to provide these books.  I am not an authority on education matters and I just put these two points before the Minister and ask him to consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPKeely" hpid="Mr. Keely Mr. Keely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keely</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate closes, I wish to extend my congratulations to the Department of Education for the successful efforts they are making to revive Irish as the spoken tongue of this country.  I have noticed with pleasure during the past few years that children, coming from and going to school, carry on their conversations and play their little games, using Irish as their spoken language.  At one Feis last summer, which close on 1,000 children attended, from considerable distances around the town, in practically every case I heard those children speaking Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> That shows, if any proof were needed, the success that is meeting the efforts of the Department to revive Irish.  From an educational point of view, I feel and hold that a study of the Irish language is as conducive to the training of the mind and the development of the mental faculties as the study of any other subject which could be undertaken in the schools, national or secondary.  The aim of education should be rather the development of character and the production of good citizens than the acquisition of knowledge.  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney pointed out, the acquisition of knowledge is a means by which character is developed and by which thoughtful serious citizens are turned out by our schools.  I am afraid that, in a great number of our schools to-day, the means have become the end.  It appears that in many cases the acquisition of knowledge is the criterion by which the success or efficiency of the teachers is to be judged.  The Department of Education pays too little attention to the development of character in our schools.  I know schools where children have been crammed from morning till night so that they might acquire a certain amount of knowledge in the minimum of time in order to satisfy the inspectors.  These teachers were able to satisfy the Department of Education as to the amount of knowledge crammed into the children's heads.  The rating of the teacher depends on that.  I believe the knowledge acquired through cramming or forcing is worse than the non-acquisition of knowledge. The evil is greater than letting the children grow up almost illiterate or ignorant, because if children are crammed with knowledge at school and if they are forced to study at a time when they should be playing, their minds will be turned from the pursuit of knowledge and from study in the years after they leave school. Complaints have been made in many cases that children, once they reach the school leaving age and are free from school, never devote any time to study of a serious nature.  If that be so, I believe the fault lies in the <Col N="231" /> national school and that it lies not so much with the teacher as with the system which forces the teacher to cram knowledge into the heads of the children.  It would be better to progress slowly and in accordance with the development of the child's capacity for acquiring knowledge.  If that be done in a natural way, that child can be made to take joy and pleasure in acquiring knowledge and that joy and pleasure will be a stimulus to the child in after years to continue the pursuit of knowledge. If our teachers' rating and consequent remuneration depend on the amount of knowledge they are able to cram into a child's head during the school-going period, we shall not have the slow and methodical system of education whereby the minds of the children are developed and their character formed so as to make them good citizens and encourage them to seek knowledge in after years.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be done on those lines by a graduated system of home work.  I think the efficient educationist aims at, if I may use the term, &ldquo;schoolifying&rdquo; the home&mdash;carrying into the home, particularly in rural areas, part of the work done in the school.  I remember the time when the home was part of the school, when the children of the advanced classes studied their history and literary lessons at home and discussed their school problems with the older people. I am afraid that that system has died out.  At present, when children arrive home, they throw their books on one side and do not open them until the following morning.  I appreciate the objection to excessive home work, but home work could be utilised to create a taste for study which would be carried on to after years.  If there are faults in our education system, I believe the greatest is the cramming of knowledge into the heads of your children&mdash;the forcing of education.</P>
    <P>A greater amount of attention should be paid to the development of character. The development of character in any school depends entirely on the personality of the teacher.  The Department of Education, in selecting candidates for the training colleges, should <Col N="232" /> allocate higher marks for the personality of candidates than for their knowledge of any of the subjects on the programme.  If that were done, we might succeed in getting a higher standard amongst our teachers.  That higher standard would be communicated to the children under their care in such a way as to help to elevate still more our national characteristics of justice, rectitude and so forth.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the problem of the great variety of subjects on the school programme.  It would be much better for education and for the development of the child's mind to have a small number of subjects on the programme and to teach these subjects thoroughly.  It is better to give a sound grasp of the principles of a few educational subjects to a child than to give him a smattering of a varied programme.  By concentrating on a few subjects, you will be able to train the child to concentrate, to think for himself, and to solve many of the problems he will meet with in after life, whereas, if you have a varied programme and a wide range of subjects, the result will be that the child will be only able to skim over and get a smattering of these.  He will not have his mind sufficiently trained to concentrate on the subjects with which he is dealing, and so he will be handicapped by his inability to concentrate on the more serious problems of life which may meet him in after years.  In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister and the Department on the progress made in the revival of the Irish language during the last few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not purpose saying very much on this Vote, as I was one of the unfortunate ones who were absolutely at sea for three-quarters of the debate, in so far as it was conducted in Irish.  Some people may consider that that was very appropriate in the case of the Education Estimate, but, personally, I could not agree with them on that point.  I think it was rather wanting in consideration, having regard to the fact that practically half the House was as much at sea as I was.  Therefore, I just wish to say that I do not agree with the teaching absolutely through Irish of every <Col N="233" /> subject which children in the schools are taught.  The teaching of Irish as a subject is very desirable, and we would all agree with it.  I think when it comes to teaching subjects that have absolutely no relation whatever to Irish, through the medium of Irish, it is absolutely foolish to think that we can ever impart to the children the knowledge which we want to impart to them.  I think it is all due to the wave of insanity that has swept over this country for some years past in trying to force Irish on children and on the people when it is not necessary and when it is not advisable.  We can never succeed in that policy.</P>
      <P>The children, I am afraid, are not being educated as they were heretofore. The subjects which they will require in after life are being neglected, because they simply do not understand one word of what they are being taught.  I believe it would be much better if we could have Irish taught as one subject, instead of teaching every other subject through the medium of Irish, a practice which has become absolutely an obsession with the present Government. I think for the most part the children are not being educated as they were heretofore.  We can see for ourselves that the children are not being given a chance because they are not able to understand what is being taught to them by the teachers.  The teachers are not getting a chance, and the country, as a whole, is not getting a chance.  I think, therefore, that we really ought to revise the course we have adopted, look at it in a commonsense way, and understand that it does not serve the country, the teacher, or the child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few questions which I want to raise. The point in which I am principally interested is the erection of schools. Certainly a great amount of work has been done in that way but there is need for much more.  I have come to the conclusion that much delay in this regard is due to the fact that there is a lack of co-operation between the different Departments and the managers down the country.  One finds that applications for new schools have been made as far back as five <Col N="234" /> and six years ago, and that these schools have not yet been erected. The application is first made to the Minister for Education.  The Board of Works then comes into the matter. I know instances in which schools are being erected by the Board of Works and in which the Board refused to give the manager even the estimated cost of the school.  They refused to give the amount of the tender accepted for a particular school.  All they do is to say to the particular manager: &ldquo;You will give us £150 and we will build a school for you.&rdquo; Owing to the delay in the erection of these schools it frequently happens that the average attendance has arisen so much from the time since the application was made for the new school, that when the school is finished a further classroom has to be added after a year's time or so.  I think provision should be made for a contingency of that kind while the school is being erected.  Even if there has been a delay and that the average has gone up by degrees, extra accommodation could be provided while the school is being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I wish to bring before the Minister has reference to old schools.  I am not aware whether it is his fault or not.  I do not know whether they are called non-vested schools or not, but one finds them in a very bad condition.  The floors are very bad, there is nothing provided in the way of sanitary appliances, and the roofs are bad.  I should like to know from the Minister who is responsible for repairing these schools.  Sometimes children have to walk two or three miles to these schools in wet weather.  They hang up their coats and hats on the walls but the condition of some of the schools is so bad that these articles of clothing would be much drier if the children wore them all through the day.  Deputy Dr. O'Dowd referred to another matter which I would like to stress.  That is, that where new schools are being erected, the Land Commission should provide sufficient playgrounds.  Even in the case of new schools, sufficient space is not allowed for playgrounds.  There <Col N="235" /> is no reason why playgrounds should be restricted to a small space when there is plenty of ground available. In addition to providing bigger playgrounds, there should be an open shed attached to each school in which children could play during wet weather.  Frequently during the winter, children are obliged to stay the whole day in school even during the half-hour allowed for recreation, because of the absence of shelter outside. They remain in the school-room once they enter in the morning until three o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more co-operation between the Minister and the Board of Works in the erection of schools and I should like to see greater inducements held out to managers.  In some cases throughout the country very close to the Gaeltacht&mdash;for housing purposes these districts are really in the Gaeltacht&mdash;you find that the managers are asked to provide one-third of the estimated cost of the erection of the school. Then in the next village you find that the manager is asked to provide only one-sixth, one-seventh, or one-eighth of the cost.  That naturally leads to a good deal of delay, because the manager does not see why he should be asked for one-third of the cost, while the manager of an adjoining school is asked only for one-seventh or one-eighth.  I think that the neighbourhood should be taken into consideration, and that the Minister should be more liberal in these poorer areas along the western seaboard.  I should also like to see the van services extended along the western seaboard. Children in these areas have to travel a very long way to school. I would ask the Minister to have an investigation made with a view to seeing whether these services could be extended and improved.  I know areas in which the parents are obliged to keep their children at home because of the long distances which they would have to travel to school.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say much on this Estimate, because I do not pretend to be an authority on education, I know more about the <Col N="236" /> outside of some schools than the inside.  Speaking however, as an average man, I think I can say that I know something about our elementary and national schools, the progress that is being made in them and how it compares with the progress made some time ago.  With the exception of the Minister, it is evident to everyone that something is wrong; I do not propose to show what is wrong; it is for the Minister to find that out.  Is it not plain that there are no results for the time spent on it by the pupils and the industry of the teachers? The teachers are certainly working hard, and the children are working hard, and there is an extraordinarily good attendance at school, yet there is nothing to compensate them for their time and industry.  That is unfair to the teachers and to the children.  It is agreed that the system must be wrong.  Having regard to the strict rule compelling children to attend school, and to the number of days that they attend school now, compared with the position some years ago, as well as all the home lessons that are imposed on them one would expect better results.  What are the results?  The children know very little about arithmetic.  They are certainly not as good after the same number of years at school as the same type of pupil 20 or 30 years ago.  They are hopelessly in the background in regard to geography, of which they know practically nothing.  Even in spelling they are as a general rule very deficient.  It is admitted by parents and teachers in my part of the country that the children never worked harder.  Therefore, there must be something wrong in the system. I hope the Minister will apply himself to that.  I do not propose to say what is wrong.  Some teachers attribute the blame to the fact that Irish cuts in and wastes time, and that it is hard on the children.  I think there is something in that.  However, if progress were made in Irish it would go far towards compensating for losses in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately progress is not being made.  With the exception of those in the Gaeltacht, the ordinary pupils of 13 or 14 years of age are not able to <Col N="237" /> use the Irish language.  Is it not time that the Minister reviewed the whole position, to find out what is wrong both with the teaching of Irish and other subjects?  I believe teachers would be able to point to where the error lies if the Minister inquired from them.  My opinion as to the teaching of Irish is that the pace is too fast. It is being rushed, and anything that is forced on the people, instead of making them take an interest in it, is rather inclined to turn them against it.  It has been forced to a certain extent upon the children.  That is wrong.  If they could be induced to seek after such education, and if the Minister granted facilities to those who wanted to acquire a knowledge of the language, there would be a hope of making progress, and there would be better results for the amount of money spent in that way.  The one outstanding thing is that the system is not a success.  I suggest that the Minister should recognise that fact and try to find a remedy.  If it is found that we are on the wrong road there is no use in forcing the pace.  I do not pretend to be able to point the way.  I believe the Minister could do so.  If I were to offer an opinion I would say that the system by which English was made a success in this country might be successfully availed of in restoring the Irish language.  That was, by getting the educated classes to acquire a thorough knowledge of the language when the desire to imitate them would work down to the children.  If the Minister concentrated in making good Irish speakers of people in the higher schools for the first ten or 15 years, that would affect the position in the national schools where the children would be given the chance of acquiring the necessary knowledge of Irish for use in the ordinary affairs of life.  A proper stimulus would then be given to the language, and the people would take an interest in learning it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister said that he did not want them to learn Irish, but that he wanted the educated people to know it thoroughly, or if he said to the back benchers in the Dáil that he did not want them to learn Irish, but that he wanted the front benchers to know it, then we would all learn it, if only to <Col N="238" /> spite the Minister.  It would be the same way in the country.  If the Minister did not try to force the pace, but gave facilities and encouraged pupils in the higher schools to acquire a thorough knowledge of Irish and to become fluent speakers, that would be the right path to follow for the time being, and there would be more progress.  The first thing to be done is to induce the people to acquire a wish to learn the language.  Unless they take an interest in it they will not learn it.  Years ago I spent many long nights trying to master Irish.  I got the text-books and studied them, but when Irish was forced on us in every direction I took very little interest in it.  I believe that applies all round, and that if the people could be induced to acquire a knowledge of Irish, and if the Minister supplied the necessary facilities, that would be the right road. I hope the Minister will give careful consideration to the points I have mentioned.</P>

    <P>I shall refer briefly to the points that were raised by different Deputies, taking Deputy Norton's speech first. The Deputy, of course, says: &ldquo;Away with all caution in this matter of educational policy; let us have a broad and generous policy,&rdquo; and, in a few minutes, he outlined to us a policy that would cost something like £1,000,000 a year and perhaps more.  It is not, of course, part of the Deputy's duty to suggest how the money for these improvements in education should be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>£1,000,000 out of the £2,000,000 which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was going to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that these improvements suggested by the Deputy would cost very large sums of money.  To raise the school-leaving age to 16 years would, it is estimated, cost about £1,000,000; to give maintenance allowances, of which the Deputy has also proclaimed himself an advocate, would cost something like £500,000; and in the case of school-books there would be an additional cost of, I suppose, £100,000, at least, in respect of primary schools.  With regard to school-books, there is also the question of secondary school-books, which are very costly, but there are special circumstances connected with secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the point which the Deputy has raised as to the school-leaving age report.  He seems to think that there was something extraordinary about asking an inter-departmental committee to examine this question of the school-leaving age.  We appointed officers in whom we had confidence, officers who, in their respective spheres, had a thorough knowledge of the problem as approached from the point of view of the Department they represented.  The gentleman who represented the Department of Education, for example, is <Col N="241" /> certainly one of the most experienced and efficient officers in the State. Nobody can say, either in respect of himself or his colleagues, that they could have any other idea than that of advancing, in so far as they could, the betterment of the educational facilities of the State.  No sooner did a summary of the report brought forward by this committee appear than it was violently assailed in the Press by, as I have said, ignorant and uninformed writers who, I venture to say, had not even taken the trouble to read the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that to be taken as applying to Deputy Breathnach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No credit whatever was given to the committee for its labours. When Deputies get a copy of the report in a few days they will see that a great deal of hard work was put into the preparation of it.  It already has been considered worthy of attention by the Governments of foreign States, some of them perhaps the most advanced in Europe in educational matters.  Furthermore, the officials in question have been in constant touch with educational developments in other countries.  One would imagine, listening to what we heard said here this evening and from reading the rubbish that appears in some of our newspapers, that the officers of the Department of Education are quite unfitted for their task.  It is surely well known that they are recruited from the most highly-qualified class in the community and that they have special qualifications which entitle them to advise the Minister.  It is their prerogative and their duty to do so, and the Minister has the utmost confidence in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I see the silly rubbish that appears in the newspapers about bureaucrats I wonder where does the question of bureaucracy come in.  We are in constant touch, for example, with the national teachers.  The Minister is constantly in touch with them as well as the Secretary and inspectors, and there is no barrier whatever to the free and intimate discussion of difficulties between the teachers and ourselves.  The people who talk in the way that I have described <Col N="242" /> simply want to have a fling at the Government and at the Minister. They drag the question of Irish and of teaching through Irish into matters that have nothing whatever to do with it.  They suggest that, because I speak in Irish, I am attempting to burk criticism.  I am not attempting to burk criticism, and personally I would not mind if the debate went on for a week in English.  Let me repeat what I have already said in Irish.  I consider that it is my duty and the duty of the Government and of the Dáil&mdash;I know that the Dáil (even though many members of it do not speak Irish) are with me in this matter&mdash;to give a good example to the country: that we should not place it in the power of any individual or any writer to say that there is any window-dressing or camouflage about this question of Irish. Too much work has gone into the task of reviving the Irish language and too much money has been spent on it to have any going back, and while I am Minister, at any rate, there will be no going back.  I will go forward steadily and use every ounce of energy that I possess to push forward the policy which, I understand, has been accepted by the representatives of education and by the chief political parties in this country.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of the school-leaving age, the Deputy who spoke conveniently ignored the fact that in a neighbouring country this whole question of the school-leaving age has been discussed and that proposals have been brought forward. These proposals were acclaimed in certain sections that purport to represent Irish educational interests as evidence of the wonderful things that have been done across the water.  But, when these proposals were examined it was found that there were exemptions on the grounds of domestic necessity, of beneficial employment, and that the scheme would not be brought into operation until 1st September, 1939. Yet, when our officials who have gone to such trouble to examine this question, to collect data, to get the opinions of the representatives of the rural community, for example, to examine the facilities that we have available, the preparations that we <Col N="243" /> have to make, the organisation that has to be set up, if we are going to move forward&mdash;when they bring in a report and suggest that certain specific steps should be taken as an experiment, they are told that they are bureaucrats, and are described, I think, in one daily paper, as &ldquo;feudal barons.&rdquo;  It speaks of this report as if it were written by a committee of feudal barons in the age of serfdom.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against that kind of uninformed criticism.  It is the kind of thing that we get from some so-called Irish national newspapers.  We are told that, in actual fact, the Committee are wrong when they say that, as regards legislative requirements in regard to the school-leaving age, we are in at least as good as position in this country as in other countries.  There is not other country with the exception of Great Britain where a new measure has not been introduced in which, so far as I know, there is any general scheme for school attendance beyond the age of 14 years.  If there is I would like to hear of it.</P>
    <P>Why is it assumed that the officials, or the Department of Education, or the Government are not in favour of giving the fullest possible education to the children of this State?  Parents already can send their children to school as long as they are able to do so.  An important point arises where, due to economic circumstances, parents may not be in a position to send their children to school after they reach the age of 14.  Having weighed all the circumstances, parents may consider that it is better to try and find employment for their children.  The report recognises that fact.  It has to be recognised in every country.  It has to be recognised in considering this policy by every department of education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred at great length-he reiterated much the same as the other critics did, the conclusion in the Committee's report, which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no case for the raising of the school-leaving age on the grounds that young people are too immature for employment at the age of 14 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is good enough to read <Col N="244" /> the portion of the report which deals with that matter&mdash;page 20 of the proof copy&mdash;he will find the following statement under the heading &ldquo;That children are not sufficiently mature to enter employment at the age of 14 years&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was stated that there was an increasing demand for the services of girls of 14 to 16 years of age in factories where they are engaged on such work as packing, mechanical and monotonous operations by machinery, etc.  In such work the girls were often kept standing all day, and their duties in frequent instances necessitated constant stooping.  It was contended that employment of this kind was unsuited to girls at the age of adolescence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An issue of this kind, involving the physical fitness of juveniles for employment in industry, is one on which we are scarcely in a position to express a view.  It is more a matter of expert medical opinion. We are aware, however, that young persons between the ages of 14 and 16 years must be certified by the certifying surgeon under the Factory and Workshop Acts as medically fit before they are admitted to employment, and we presume that before young persons are certified for admission regard is had to the conditions under which they will be employed. It must be remembered that these young people are anxious to start work, to be independent, to earn a little for themselves, to supplement the family income.  In any cases where the conditions of employment may be unsuitable, a remedy should be sought by way of improving the conditions rather than by way of raising the school-leaving age and excluding the juveniles from employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So far as the improvement of the conditions of labour for juvenile workers is concerned, that matter has been taken in hands and the House knows that a Bill has been passed into law called the Conditions of Employment Bill, which received a great deal of attention in both Houses and which provides for the proper control of juvenile labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> The Deputy referred also to the question of school buildings.  We are endeavouring to build to the utmost of our capacity.  I do not think we can possibly go beyond £200,000 a year, having regard to the organisation of the machinery which deals with the matter and having regard also to the fact that there is an intensive building campaign going on in other directions. Obviously, if we cannot get the number of houses built that we would like to have built in the City of Dublin and possibly elsewhere, that is an indication that in regard to organising building we have not sufficient facilities; but to the utmost extent that it is possible to do so, we are pushing forward with our programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that there are 8,000 building-trade workers idle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter referred to by a number of Deputies was the question of statistics regarding juvenile crime.  Deputies admitted that the question of juvenile crime was really not one for the Minister for Education and that it might be more appropriately raised upon the Vote for the Department of Justice.  In view, however, of the fact that so much attention has been paid to the matter, I think it well to call the attention of the House to this, that in my opinion it might be rash to draw hasty conclusions as to the prevalence of crime from statistics covering such a very short period as two years.  I think in a matter of this kind one is apt to draw a wrong conclusion unless one takes a fairly long period into consideration and unless one gives an outline and, as far as possible, the general circumstances of the country during the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is claimed that an increase in the number of young persons who have been sent to reformatories is an indication of a growth in juvenile crime and that it gives cause for serious anxiety, I would like to point out that, taking the figures since 1928, I do not think that over the whole of that period it can be said that the committals to reformatory schools indicated that the position was very unsatisfactory.  In <Col N="246" /> 1928 there were five children under 14 years and 33 children over 14 years, a total of 38, sent to reformatories.  In the year 1929, the figures respectively were six and 33.  In the succeeding years, 1930 to 1934, the figures fell, but in 1935 there was an increase to a total of 44, seven under 14 and 37 over 14.  There was an increase in that year, but, as the increase seems to be peculiar to that year, I think it would be a mistake to jump to rash or hasty conclusions as to the prevalence of crime, having regard to the other figures.  Looking back on the position some years ago, I find that whereas, as I have stated, the number sent to reformatory schools in 1935 was 44 which was an increase over the previous year, in the year 1915 the figure ran up to 139 and in the year 1910 it was 113, for the 26 counties.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of children sent to industrial schools for criminal offences, there was an increase also in recent years, and these children are under 14.  Taking the case of the reformatory schools, the fact that we have only 44 committals now as compared with 113 in 1910 or 139 in 1915 over the Saorstát area would seem to indicate that we have come down considerably towards bedrock and, when we do reach the bedrock figure. obviously an increase on that can be made to look very large if treated as a percentage increase, although the actual number of increased offences may be rather small.</P>
    <P>I am not going to pontificate as to the reasons for any increase there may be in juvenile crime, but I think that perhaps the question of parental control which has been mentioned should be emphasised and it is only right for me to say that, so far as the schools are concerned, I feel they are doing their duty.  There is a very good spirit and there is training in good conduct and a good foundation is being laid in habits of good citizenship and so on in the schools.  We cannot blame the schools for defects which often come, unfortunately, from lack of parental control.  Occasionally, one hears complaints that even in the schools the teachers do not always get the co-operation and the support from parents to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> With regard to the claims made that this increase in crime may come from political causes or that in some way there is a deterioration which may be traced back to our political difficulties. I would like simply to say on that point that so far as the men who were in the national movement were concerned, the old I.R.A., there is no doubt that a finer or cleaner body of men rarely existed in any country and rarely kept such high standards as they kept.  In fact, I think it is a matter for congratulation that, in spite of the difficulties that we have had, we have maintained such high standards and I would not like the Dáil or the country to feel that because the figures in a particular year showed an unusual increase in regard to juvenile crime, that that is a proof that we had reached a position where improvement was not possible.  We have to wait for future events to show whether that year was exceptional or not.  Quite possibly it was.  It was an unique year and it would be a mistake, I think, to draw any hasty conclusions on account of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the inspector, in reference to whom a circular was issued by the National Teachers' Organisation, I think that, as the matter has been stressed by Deputy Murphy, and as he apparently considers it to be one of importance, I should devote a few words to it.  In this connection, however, I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that the circular that was sent out to Deputies did not give either the names of the schools or the names of the teachers in question and that, when representations were made to the Department of Education about this officer, representatives of the teachers were asked to supply the names of the schools or of the teachers in question, and they declined to do so.  So that it was extremely difficult for the Department of Education to make inquiries.  I should like to say in that connection that it seems to me rather strange, if the teachers' organisation considered this matter to be a very grave one, that they did not take steps to take out one or two or three well-defined cases where they felt that <Col N="248" /> they had strong grounds for grievances against the officer in question, and prepare a statement for the Education Office giving all the facts.  Their procedure was quite different, however. I think what really happened was that a circular was sent out to teachers asking them to supply instances of grievances against this particular inspector, or cases of improper conduct from the point of view of the relations between teacher and inspector, to make dossiers of these cases and send them on; and it seems to me a great weakness in the treatment of the case that an endeavour should have been made to bolster up the case against the inspector by going to the expense of printing a document of this kind, giving quotations from alleged incidents in practically every county in the Saorstát, and yet not giving the name of a single teacher or school involved, when we know that the material which went to make up that circular was prepared as the result of instructions sent out from the headquarters of the teachers' organisation in which particulars were asked for of all these cases&mdash;even of trivial cases.  Accordingly, I think that the Department can reasonably take up the point of view that they did not receive co-operation in this matter; that it was not approached properly by the teachers in the first instance; and that, secondly, they did not place the facts before us.  Then, on the information which was at our disposal in the office, we went into the question and we got into touch with the divisional inspectors in the different parts of the country where this particular inspector had been working, and we got their opinions regarding the cases in respect of which appeals had been made against his rating.  Deputies know that there is an appeal board to which teachers who feel that they have been wrongfully treated or their ratings unjustly lowered, have the right to appeal.  We went through the material which we have in connection with appeals and consulted the divisional inspectors.  Then we had a letter from the teachers' organisation expressing dissatisfaction that no official action had been taken by way <Col N="249" /> of censure on the inspector.  We were asked, as the House will recall, to dismiss the inspector, and representations were made solely on the ground that the National Teachers' Organisation thought that the officer in question was not suited to be an inspector. Apparently, what the organisation wanted was that we should intimate to them that the officer in question had been censured.  We are not prepared to make any statement to the teachers' organisation or to any other body as to the result of our investigations in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>Among a number of other matters mentioned was the question of the standard of English for Fíor-Ghaeltacht candidates in the entrance examinations for the preparatory colleges. In fact, there has been a reduction in the standard of English in that examination, but I think that, so long as the entrants for that examination are candidates for the teaching profession, it will be necessary that they should take English as a subject.  It is very extraordinary that complaints regarding English in this examination have only come from one part of the country.  In the other parts of the country, where the numbers of candidates who are sitting for the examination, and those who are successful, are increasing year by year, there has been no complaint either about English being compulsory or about the standard of English.</P>
    <P>Deputy Breathnach referred to the fact that the Education Office was not sufficiently active in doing their work through Irish.  We are sending out circulars in Irish to teachers and managers, except in cases where the managers have intimated that they prefer to receive the circulars in English. With regard to the question of the programme, I think it may be as well to emphasise again what I have stated in previous years, and what Deputy Breathnach and others have expressed in their speeches, as to what the policy of the Department is in regard to teaching through Irish. The present programme was drafted by a committee or conference representative, I think, of all the educational interests in the country, and it is on that programme that the work <Col N="250" /> of the schools is being continued.  I shall give one extract from the report in question (page 10), which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the leading characteristics of that programme is its insistence on the principle of teaching the infant classes through the medium of Irish.  The members of our conference agreed on the supreme importance of giving effect, as far as possible, to this principle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the year 1931 a circular was sent out to explain the position fully, in which it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a teacher is competent to teach through Irish, and where the children can assimilate the instruction so given, the teacher should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible.  When these conditions do not exist, such teaching through Irish is not obligatory.  Teachers who hold Bilingual or Higher Certificates will, unless there be evidence to the contrary, be regarded as competent; but the possession of these certificates is not an essential condition of such teaching.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is a practical question and a question to be determined on the spot by the local inspector whether, in the circumstances he sees in the local school, he considers that more work should be done in teaching through Irish, or less work.  It depends on whether he is satisfied, and I believe that the inspectors, being reasonable men, many of them having been teachers themselves, are working on the basis of this circular and are interpreting it faithfully and carefully and, having regard to the fact that if a teacher is obviously unfitted to teach through Irish he will be only doing more harm than good to Irish and to education generally by attempting to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to our general attitude to the teaching of Irish, we think that perhaps some more time might be given to speaking the language, which, after all, is the important and the fundamental thing in the curriculum.  The &ldquo;Notes for Teachers&rdquo; which were circulated to the teachers, by their <Col N="251" /> insistence on making the Irish language the language of the pupils, both inside and outside the school, I have no doubt are largely responsible for the happy condition of affairs which Deputy Kent and Deputy Keely referred to, of causing children to speak in the Irish language on their way to and from school.  These &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; emphasised the importance of getting pupils, first of all, to speak the language fluently and freely.  No doubt, if teachers follow the advice given, even where they have not all the requisite qualifications, they can make a very creditable effort, if they are in earnest, and they can do a great deal to create the atmosphere for speaking Irish amongst the children.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there are any other matters to which I need refer.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and a number of other Deputies referred to certain individual cases.  As I said, if Deputies will be good enough, in case of complaint, to write to me, I shall only be too happy to make investigations in any case where there are complaints of political bias or the introduction of politics into the schools, no matter by what side.  The statement Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan made that references were made to the late Michael Collins in certain schools as a traitor simply arouses my astonishment.  I am really astonished that at this hour of day we could have such action.  No matter how strongly we feel politically, or how much we may be attached to political Parties, I feel certainly humiliated to think that any teachers should so far forget themselves as to introduce a spirit of that kind into the schools. If my attention is called to cases of that kind I shall certainly call the attention of the managers in question to such.</P>
    <P>Then with regard to the history books, Deputy Haslett seems to be dissatisfied with the standard, and the contents, in some measure, of some of our readers.  Deputy Kissane, on the other hand, referred to a history book in use in the schools about which a great deal of dissatisfaction is expressed.  We do not publish text-books for the schools, and we leave it <Col N="252" /> to the discretion of the school, particularly in the case of secondary schools, to use what books they wish to use. There is, I think, an approved list, and in connection with that list certain books are named, and it may happen that in certain categories and in certain subjects the selection is limited. I think that in the treatment of history in regard to which controversy might arise, it is not the text book so much that is in question as the personality of the teacher.  You might find a distinguished member of the opposite side dealing with some book giving the John Knox point of view in regard to a controversial matter; and he might deal with it in a manner giving satisfaction to the opposing point of view. No one can question my predecessor's competence or breadth of view in regard to that.  After all, if our teachers would avoid the text-book and not stick too closely to text-books, but infuse history with personality and life and vigour, and give background to all their instruction, detach it from all controversies and current topics as far as possible, and show that history as dealt with is a connected thing going back to the past, ever changing but continuous, then, I think there would not be such cause for dissatisfaction in the treatment of historical subjects.</P>

VII., c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. V., c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928, etc.); and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Post Office expenditure estimated for the year 1936-37 is £2,031,928, being a net increase, including bonus of £31,414, on the Estimate for last year.  The higher figure is due mainly to increased allowances by way of cost-of-living bonus and to expenditure consequent upon a revision of Post Office wages which took effect in Mí na Nodlag last.  The increases are, however, offset to some extent by certain items accounted for under the heading of Appropriations-in-Aid.  The true financial position of the Department can be ascertained only from the Commercial Accounts which are prepared annually, and the latest such accounts available (which are subject <Col N="256" /> to audit) are those for 1934-35.  They show as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Postal Services&mdash;Income, £1,593,387; expenditure, £1,360,317; surplus, £233,070.  Telegraph Services&mdash;Income, £172,748; expenditure, £277,025; deficit, £104,277.  Telephone Services&mdash; Income, £467,952; expenditure, £389,885; surplus, £78,067.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be seen that on the Postal and Telephone Services there was a surplus of £311,137, against a deficit of £104,277, leaving a profit of £206,860 on the combined services as compared with £35,707 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Many improvements in postal deliveries, etc., were effected in 1935.  In addition four new sub-offices were established, 32 letter-boxes were erected, and ten new stamp slot machines were fitted.  The gradual introduction of motors instead of horses for mail services by road continued during the year, and about 80 per cent. of such services are now performed by motor transport.  Approximately one-fourth of the latter are worked by Departmental staff.  Cóbh and Galway are utilised to the utmost extent possible for the exchange of mails between this country and America.  About 19,200 sacks of mails were despatched and 30,000 were received through these ports last year. The frequency of utilisation and the volume of mails transmitted depend naturally on the incidence of sailings.</P>
    <P>Correspondence for conveyance by international air services (82,000 items) during 1935 showed a large increase over that posted in the preceding year (68,900 items).  About 30 per cent. of the traffic was sent by the London-India service and 20 per cent. by the London-Capetown route.  The Saorstát Post Office does not benefit financially, as all the additional postage required for transmission of packets by air is credited to the other Administrations concerned.  In regard to cross-Channel air transport, it may be found convenient to use the new air services between Dublin and Liverpool and Dublin and Bristol, and when the necessary time-tables are published the matter will be further considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> Inland sample post within the Saorstát which was introduced on 12th November, 1934 is being availed of to a considerable extent by Dublin manufacturers, etc.  Based on a recent return the number of sample packets posted in Dublin is estimated at 2,500 a week.  It is believed that most of these packets would not pass through the Post Office but for the facility of the sample post.  The posting of sample packets in the provinces is however very light.  The inland cash-on-delivery service increased slightly in volume during 1935.  The number of parcels posted was 16,883 on which trade charges amounting to £17,635 were collected.  For the previous year the corresponding figures were 16,660 parcels and trade charges amounting to £16,748 9s.  Express delivery services are being well patronised particularly the telephonic express service.  A late fee of ½d on letters posted in letter boxes on omnibuses was payable up to July of last year, when it was decided to abolish it.  The result was that the postings increased appreciably, and returns are being taken periodically to see whether the altered arrangements should be placed on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Telegraphs here as elsewhere are still losing to the telephone, which is increasing in public favour.  The development of our telephone service in Dublin and vicinity has been considerable, but the growth in other parts was normal only.  The total number of subscribers' telephones and extensions is now 35,962, an increase of 1,443 over the previous year.  The number of call offices and kiosks is 1,422 and 81, an increase of 42 and 11 respectively.  Several additional &ldquo;Trunk&rdquo; circuits have been provided with the object of improving service, and others are in hands.  The &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; trunk call facility appears to be much appreciated by telephone users.  The number of such calls during the last financial year (49,000) showed an increase of 11,000 over the previous year.  The Rathmines and Terenure areas were converted to automatic working in January, 1936, and resulted in the transfer of about <Col N="258" /> 1,800 lines to the Dublin automafic network.  The number of automatic exchange lines in Dublin at the end of February last was 9,276, an increase of 2,075 (which includes the Rathmines and Terenure lines) as compared with last year.  Plans for further development of the automatic system in the city area are in contemplation, and it is hoped to have automatic equipment installed in the Central Exchange, Crown Alley, early in 1937.</P>
    <P>The Engineering Branch, which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the telephone and telegraph plant, was subjected to special strain during the past year on account of the extensive damage done to the lines by successive storms.  The total expenditure on storm repairs was about £15,400.  The staff, I am glad to say, worked with commendable enterprise, and succeeded in restoring communication within the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>The Post Office factory is mainly engaged in repair work, and it is not the policy of the management to undertake the manufacture of articles that can be produced by the home manufacturer at a reasonable cost. This necessarily confines the manufacturing operations of the factory mainly to the production of special articles for the Post Office service, and to a less extent for other Government Departments.  The factory is also responsible for the maintenance and repair of Post Office mechanical transport, which comprises 91 vans and trucks and 75 motor cycles and combinations.  The van and cycle combination bodies built by Saorstát manufacturers are proving satisfactory in service and reasonable in price.</P>
    <P>The building programme for this financial year includes the erection of a new central garage and workshop in Dublin, in connection with the proposed central sorting offices scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It includes also the transfer of the College Green Branch Office to a new building in St. Andrew Street; structural alterations at Crown Alley Telephone Exchange in connection with the installation of <Col N="259" /> automatic telephone equipment; the completion of a new post office building at Athlone; the completion of structural works for the adaptation of the premises of St. Patrick's Quay, Cork, for letter and parcel sorting offices, postmen's office and Customs office; and the improvement and extension of the Thurles Post Office.  In addition improvements of a minor nature, including electric lighting, will be undertaken at several other provincial offices, apart from the usual renovation and maintenance requirements.</P>
      <P>The increase in cost-of-living bonus for the year 1936-37 is estimated at £32,000, and the recent special revision of Post Office wages, which affects many classes of permanently and temporarily employed Post Office servants will cost about £14,000.  In addition, the hours of work of all Departmental grades will be fixed at 44 a week net, a concession involving an extra cost of about £12,000 per annum.  In this case, relative authority was not received in time to allow of the additional expenditure involved being included in the current year's Estimates, but, if necessary, sanction for a Supplementary Estimate will be sought later on.</P>
      <P>There has always been a public demand for reductions in telephone charges, and this demand has been particularly strong during recent years. Owing to the loss on the service which resulted from the concessions granted in 1925 it has not been practicable until now to contemplate further material reductions, but in view of the improving position for the past few years, and particularly of the profit for the year 1934-35, that is £78,067, I came to the conclusion that the time has come when the demand of the public for a cheaper telephone service should be met.  The Government has accepted this view, and the result has been the extensive reductions in charges recently announced in the Press.  The alterations are briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Existing £7 10s. rentals reduced to the standard rates of £6 10s. for a business line, and £5 for a residence line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The &ldquo;free mileage&rdquo; radius&mdash;i.e., the mileage covered by the standard <Col N="260" /> rental&mdash;extended from one mile to three miles.</P>
    <P>3.  Reduction of the fee for local calls from 1¼d. to 1d.</P>
    <P>4.  Reduction of the fee for local calls from coin box call-offices on subscribers' lines from 3d. to 2d., and for calls from 5 to 7½ miles (second area calls) from 5d. to 4d.  Also, reduction from 3d. to 2d. per 3 minutes of the supplementary fee on trunk calls from all call offices.</P>
    <P>5.  Abolition of the local fee of 1¼d. on trunk calls from subscribers' lines.</P>
    <P>6.  General reduction of charges for trunk calls, including the introduction of a maximum fee of 2/6 for day calls to all places within the Saorstát, and of a 4/- maximum to all places in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. For night calls there will be a maximum fee of 1/- on all calls to the Saorstát, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The supplementary cable fee of 1/- on day calls and 6d. on night calls to Great Britain will still be charged in addition to the normal trunk fee.  A cable fee applies also in the reverse direction on calls from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>7.  Reduction of the supplementary fee for &ldquo;personal&rdquo; trunk calls during the day to a flat rate of 1/- instead of the present fees of 1/-, 1/6 and 2/-.  The night rate of 6d. remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the £7 10s. rental and the extension of the &ldquo;free area&rdquo; will mean that the rental of a private residence subscriber at a distance of three miles from an exchange will be reduced from £25 to £5 in the case of lines to which the present £5 minimum now applies, and from £27 10s. to £5 in the case of lines to which the £7 10s. minimum now applies.  The reductions for business lines and for varying distances between one and three miles will, of course, be proportionate.  The general effect of the rental and free radius changes will be that the rentals of about 2,550 existing subscribers including subscribers in suburban districts <Col N="261" /> such as Cabra and Mount Merrion in Dublin will be reduced by amounts varying from £1 to £22 10s. according to the circumstances in each case.</P>
    <P>As regards the trunk fees the following examples indicate the benefit to the public of the changes:&mdash;Dublin to Cork, day charge reduced from 3/6 to 2/3; Cork to Letterkenny, 5/6 to 2/6; Tralee to London, 11/6 to 5/-; Dublin to London, 8/6 to 5/-; Cork to London, <Col N="262" /> 10/6 to 5/-.  A night call from Dublin to London which now costs 4/3 will be reduced to 1/6.  That 6d. is a supplementary cable free, and applies also in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the satisfactory financial position of the Post Office as a whole I find it possible to announce also the following reductions in the rates for the internal Parcel Post Service:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The reductions will apply to the internal service only, the existing rates being maintained for the services to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In view of the repeated representations which I have received both in this House and from the public in regard to the porterage charges on delivery of telegrams I have decided, notwithstanding the heavy loss on the telegraph service to which rural telegraph delivery in no small degree contributes, to reduce the present porterage charge of 6d. per mile or part of a mile beyond the limit (one mile) of free delivery to 3d. per mile or part of a mile.</P>
    <P>The charges for the delivery of express letters, etc. are fixed on the same general basis as telegram porterage rates and having regard to the reduction in the latter it has been decided to reduce the express fee from 6d. per mile or part of a mile, beyond the first mile to 3d. per mile or part of a mile.  In the Express Service the full distance from the delivery office is taken into consideration, no portion being free.  The cost of the foregoing reductions of charges will amount to approximately £70,000 a year.  The revised charges will come into operation on the 1st of July next.  Leaflets giving full particulars of the new rates will shortly be available at all post offices.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very pleased to be in the position of informing the Dáil that the business of the Post Office is progressing so satisfactorily, and that its finances have so much improved in recent years as to permit me now to announce concessions both to the public and the staff.  And, although the accounts for the year just ending will not be available for several months, I am confident from the returns to hand that the surplus will show a further and substantial advance on that secured in the preceding year.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Can he hold out any hope that the Corporation Housing Department will be able to take over Aldborough House or the site at its rere, which we have been seeking from his Department for the last five years? Housing is urgently needed in that area and the space is only used as a store for scrapped cars.  It would make a splendid clearance depot for the corporation.  For five years we have been asking for the site and we have all the plans prepared.  No district in the city wants housing so much as that area where Aldborough House is situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might answer Deputy Byrne now.  The position <Col N="263" /> about Aldborough House is that about two years ago I met a deputation from the Corporation Housing Committee and promised them that my Department would put no obstacle in the way of their acquiring Aldborough House, although my Department wanted it badly for their own purposes.  But, in view of the necessity for a housing clearance in that congested district and for a housing scheme there, the Department decided to make other arrangements and to give the site.  Then the question of cost arose and, as Deputies know, that is not mainly a question for the Post Office.  The Department of Finance is mainly concerned with that, and that is the question that is holding up the business now.  I think that the Minister for Local Government, whose business it is to look after the housing situation, ought to deal with this matter, because I can assure Deputy Byrne that, as a Department, we have done all we can in the matter.  The finance end of it is scarcely one for us. My Department were prepared to facilitate as much as they could, but the question of cost arises.</P>
      <P>After all, whatever money is paid into the Post Office for the Aldborough House site will go to the general Exchequer to relieve taxation generally and, perhaps, to improve housing conditions in other parts of the country as well as Dublin.  That aspect has to be considered.  It looks as if something in the nature of a special grant may be necessary, and if pressure is put on the housing department of the Government they may consider it.  As far as we are concerned, I do not think it is right to saddle us with the blame.  As a Department, we are prepared to put ourselves out to facilitate the corporation in proceeding with the housing scheme and further than that I do not think it is fair to ask this Department to go.  The matter is one for the Government as a whole, and I think Deputy Byrne ought to turn his guns in some other direction.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister is most sympathetic and that he is up against officialism of some kind, but, <Col N="264" /> in view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is sitting behind him, I should like to say that they are asking for a sum of £7,000 per acre or from £20,000 to £30,000 for the Aldborough House site.  That is relatively the highest sum ever asked by any landlord in the City of Dublin or by any authority for any site for the housing of the working classes.  In view of the fact that we are prepared to do the work which the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government have asked us to speed up, is it right that the Department of Finance should stand in our way by asking this exorbitant price for a piece of ground that everybody knows is in the heart of a tenement area?  I put it to the Minister that he ought to consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, because we have had the plans ready for this site for four years and we want to build houses in that area and do what the Government are appealing to us to do every day in the week.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech on this Estimate, has apparently been in a generous mood because he has announced substantial reductions in telephone charges, some reductions in proterage charges, and further reductions in parcel charges.  He has been enabled to do that because of the fact that, according to his own admission, after having a deficit of £104,000 on the telegraph service, he has been able to produce a net surplus of £206,000, as the postal and telephone services have yielded a profit of £311,000.  This year the Minister is in the position of being able to extract a surplus of £206,000 from the Post Office service, and a substantial portion of that surplus is going to find its way back to the public in the form of reduced telephone charges, reduced parcel charges, and reduced porterage charges.  But there are other considerations which ought to operate with the Minister in connection with the distribution of any surplus.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will have to admit that the possession of a telephone by any citizen is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he is in no need of bread, not troubled with the problem of raising his rent, and that many other necessaries of life have been already well satisfied.  It is to that section of the community who are able to pay £7 10s. for telephone lines, and £5 and £6 10s. in other areas, as well as paying for individual calls, that the Minister proposes to part with a substantial portion of his surplus.  Might I suggest to the Minister that there are other classes for his surplus, and that if he were disposed to deal with the matter on a purely moral and Christian basis instead of on the basis of what scheme will get the greatest measure of political enthusiasm, he would have found a much more useful outlet for his surplus than that which he has discovered in the course of the debate on this Estimate to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine from the manner in which the Minister has distributed his surplus that everything so far as the wage level of the staff and the <Col N="266" /> conditions of employment were concerned was ideal.  I would like to remind him, in case he has forgotten it, that he is still the worst employer in the State service and that there is no other single Department of State which employs people at such scandalously low rates of wages as does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He can search the Departments of the other Ministers who are his colleagues on the Executive Council, and I have no hesitation in challenging him to discover a single instance in any other Department where the staff is paid at such intolerable low levels as the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House an instance of the kind of employer the Minister is in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The latest information as to the wage grouping of the staff in the post office shows that there are 2,158 part-time employees working for the Minister at less than 20/- a week; that there are 900 part-time employees working at wages between 20/1 and 25/- per week; the Minister is the employer of 3,700 part-time employees at an inclusive wage not exceeding 30/- a week.  In all, 4,131 persons employed at a wage not exceeding 30/- a week.  Another 550 are employed at a wage exceeding 30/- a week and not exceeding 40/-; another 2,200 are employed at a wage exceeding 40/- and not exceeding 60/ a week.  Another 1,000 are employed at a wage exceeding 60/- and not exceeding 80/- a week.  Out of a total personnel of well over 8,000 persons, approximately 350 have a wage exceeding £4 a week.  Even in these instances that wage is only reached in many cases after a service running upwards of 17 years.</P>
    <P>So that side by side with a surplus of £206,000 made on the Post Office, the Minister is employing well over 4,000 persons at a combined wage not exceeding 30/- a week.  He has the unenviable reputation in his official capacity as Minister, that he employs persons in the State service at less rates than are paid in any other Department.  I have no hesitation in challenging him to find any private industry employing over 8,000 persons <Col N="267" /> where only 350 of them have wages exceeding £4 a week.  While that state of affairs continues, while these people are paid such wretchedly low rates of wages&mdash;wages incapable of sustaining them and enabling them to meet their responsibilities as citizens&mdash;incapable of providing a bare reward for the onerous, responsible and trustworthy services which they render to the community&mdash;I submit that the Minister should have apportioned his surplus towards relieving the plight of those poor people for whose wages he is morally and legally responsible.  He should do that instead of&mdash;as he is doing&mdash;sharing so much of the surplus with those who are fairly well-to-do, and apparently holding the remainder so that it will be utilised by the Central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister moved a little since last year.  After having the wage scheme under consideration for 15 months he ultimately announced his decision on the scheme.  That decision was a miserable and disappointing one. As the Minister has intimated a large portion of the surplus is going to go back to the telephone users, while the main problem in respect of the wage issue remains unsolved.  If one looks at the position of the wage rates and of how this surplus is being disposed of, one must come to the conclusion that the only way in which the Post Office staff would get any benefit would be by becoming telephone subscribers and paying £27 per annum for their telegraph lines.  In that way they would get much more benefit than could be gained by working for the Minister.  By becoming telephone subscribers they get a benefit of £22 10s. a year, and by working for the Minister they get a miserable increase of a few shillings.  Even that miserable increase is not paid to all the staff.  It is not paid to the people between the minimum and maximum, but only to officers on the maximum of the scale.  Even those who are on the maximum are in many cases excluded from any participation in the increase.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of the staff gain nothing whatever from the miserable rate of increase provided by <Col N="268" /> the Minister.  The Minister's decision reveals that to get an increase persons would require to have a minimum service in the main classes of 15 years before they could get an increase of 1/- a week.  Part-time postmen, struggling to exist on the miserably low rate which the Minister pays them, would require to have ten years' service before they get any increase. Then the increase is a miserable one of a halfpenny per hour.  There you have the halfpenny per hour for the part-time employee and a reduction of £22 10s. to those who have telephone lines.  The Minister's decision was probably the most wretched decision on wage conditions ever given in the history of the Post Office wages. That is something of which the Minister cannot boast.</P>
    <P>A large number of grades were excluded from the increases granted, and they were excluded for no definable or logical reason.  It was not on the basis that their wages were higher than those who secured an increase, because a number of grades with less wages than those who got an increase were definitely excluded.  We have here a most illogical decision by the Minister who decided to grant increases in the case of the persons who had the most wage, namely those on the maximum scale, and give nothing to the men on the minimum or intermediate points of the scale.  I do not know on what grounds he can defend a decision of that kind which excludes other classes from participating in it, particularly as amongst the classes excluded were people at less wages than those who actually received the small increase granted.  If one wants to get a picture of an illogical increase, he can get it by reference to the scales now set up by the Minister's decision.  By this decision the Minister admits that it is necessary for postmen at Bray and Cobh to have increases in their wages of 1/- a week.</P>
    <P>In the same decision the Minister, who realised that there is a necessity for an increase in wages at Cobh and Bray, says that there is no necessity for an increase in wages at Waterford, Galway, Dundalk, Mullingar and many other areas.  I should like if the Minister <Col N="269" /> would say on what logical ground these later places were excluded, when the increases were granted, in the case of Cobh and Bray.  Is it cheaper to live in Mullingar, Waterford, Galway, or these other places that I have mentioned, than in Cobh or Bray?  On what ground does the Minister seek to defend an illogical decision of that kind?</P>
    <P>We had from the Minister, during the course of his speech to-night, a tribute to the engineering staff for the commendable way in which they repaired dislocated telegraph and telephone services during the recent storms.  The Minister was loud in his praise of the manner in which they worked to repair these services, but when we come to ask the Minister for something tangible to indicate the esteem in which he holds his engineering staff, we find the Minister in his decision deciding that he would not give the engineering staff one halfpenny of an increase.  All the talk about a tribute to the engineering staff for their work during the break-down has a very hollow ring about it, in view of the very definite decision of the Minister not to grant them one halfpenny per week increase. If that portion of his speech was not intended to be deliberately ironic, it might have been left out, as far as its application to the engineering staff was concerned.  To talk about the conditions under which the engineering staff worked, to pay tribute to the manner in which they restored the services, to say: &ldquo;I am prepared to pay an oral tribute to them, but I am not prepared to give them a halfpenny per week of an increase,&rdquo; seems to me to be a demonstration of irony&mdash;probably a curious little foible or an idiosynerasy on the part of the Minister.  His recognition of their services is limited to words and does not extend to cash benefits.  Instead of giving some of the surplus to the engineering staff, the Minister proceeds to shovel out £70,000 to the telephone subscribers. There is not a word in the way of an increase for the people who make the telephone service possible, and to whose efforts the Minister has been compelled to pay tribute.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister, in discussing this Estimate, indicated that one of the <Col N="270" /> reasons why he could not meet a claim for a decent standard of wages which was made to him, was the fact that the surplus on the Post Office amounted only to £35,000.  The Minister has now a surplus of £206,000, and whatever niggardly decision was based on the £35,000 the Minister should certainly open the purse further now in view of the fact that he has a surplus of £206,000 and that according to himself he anticipates that that surplus will be still greater after the commercial accounts for the year ending 31st March are made available.  So far as that portion of the Minister's speech in which he indicates that he has shared some of this surplus with his staff is concerned, I would advise the Minister to ascertain the views of the staff.  I can arrange to get him a monster meeting of the staff in Dublin; let him make the same speech to them, and I doubt if he will get even one in the audience to believe that he has the paternal interest in them that he has professed.  The increases granted to the staff, having regard to the extent of the staff, were miserably low.  The Minister has the unenviable record, in respect to the wages decision, that it is the most miserable decision that has ever been given in the long history of wages claims in the Post Office.  It is recking with anomalies and inconsistencies and is based on some kind of illogical reasoning that one cannot follow by any process of understanding.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as an employer on behalf of the community, has imposed on him the obligation to be a model employer.  So far as the wages scales in operation in the Post Office are concerned the Minister is far from being a model employer, and, as has been demonstrated to him on numerous occasions, in many respects he employs persons at much lower rates of wages than are paid in outside industries. The Minister has not challenged that statement or denied the accuracy of it.  The Minister himself knows perfectly well that many of the rates of wages paid to employees in private industries are very much higher than the rates of wages paid to employees in the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister, realising that he has now a surplus of <Col N="271" /> substantial dimensions, that that surplus has been yielded to him by the very severe reductions in the rates of pay of the Post Office staff during the past 15 years.  This surplus would not have been made possible were it not for substantial reductions in wages. Realising that prosperity has now returned, and that he has a substantial surplus, the Minister should now share with the staff some of that surplus, a surplus made possible only by the sacrifices in wages that they have suffered in the last 15 years.  In respect to the classes excluded from the recent decision, with the information in his possession now, the Minister ought to reconsider that decision so as to extend the increases all round, and to raise the figure to a level which will lift the staff above the low-wage classifications in which they are to-day, to grant an increase which will bear some relation to the surplus which has been yielded to the Minister on the operations for the year under review.  That surplus is only yielded to the Minister by the ability, the energy and competence of the staff.  The efficiency of the Post Office is only made possible by advertence to the same factors. With a surplus of such substantial dimensions, the Minister ought not to be hesitant in realising the obligation he owes to the staff to raise the wages to something like a tolerably decent level.</P>
    <P>In previous years, I pressed the Minister to endeavour to have the new central sorting and delivery office at Pearse Street completed.  During 1933 the Minister was so confident that he was going to get things done, that he stated that he had no hesitation in saying that the first portion of the building would be commenced in September, 1933; 1933 has passed, 1934 has passed, 1935 has passed, and we are now in March, 1936, and there is no sign of this work, which the Minister indicated in June, 1933, as likely to commence in September, 1933, being undertaken by the Department responsible. I do not know if the Minister has ever suffered the discomfort of remaining very long in the present disused distillery which serves as a post office in <Col N="272" /> Pearse Street.  I can certainly congratulate the Minister on the fact that he has never had to work in that place, During the wet weather the roofs leak constantly, it is impossible to make it draught proof, while the interior of the building is utterly unsuitable for use as the chief central and delivery office.  Mails are congested in it and the interior structurally is in a dilapidated condition. Generally, it is probably the most unsuitable building in Dublin that could be selected for use as a central sorting and delivery office.</P>
    <P>In practically all the capitals of Europe one of the objects of interest is the chief post office.  Many visitors to continental cities often pay a visit to the central post office there as something well worthy of interest from the architectural point of view.  Visitors to this city desiring to see the central post office, wherein the mail traffic is dealt with might be introduced to a place in Pearse Street which was formerly utilised as a distillery.  That building is anything but edifying from the point of view of visitors wanting to see the manner in which the central postal authority distributes mail traffic throughout the country.  I can scarcely imagine that any difficulties could have arisen to delay the erection of the new central sorting and delivery office over such a prolonged period. The Minister was confident in 1933 that it could be erected in the course of a few months.  Now, almost three years afterwards, the Minister is unable to get the work done which he indicated would be done in 1933, and apparently is no nearer providing a new office in Pearse Street than he was then.  I would like the Minister definitely to tell the staff how many years they are to be compelled to remain in the filthy, insanitary place that serves as a central sorting and delivery office in Pearse Street.  If the Minister were there for 24 hours, or if he had to put up with the inconvenience of doing night duty there, with the lack of heating, and draughts all around the place, he would not be long in realising that a new office would have to be built. If the Minister shifted his own office from O'Connell Street to Pearse Street <Col N="273" /> I suggest it would not be long until he would discover that there was need for improving the structural condition of the ramshackle building that serves as the central office.  At all events, we ought to know from the Minister, when he makes the next guess, the latest date at which the office will be erected.  I hope the Minister will be much more accurate in the next guess than the one he made three years ago.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1932, when the Post Office Estimates were under discussion, we had Deputy Little and Deputy Goulding calling for an improvement in the classification of the Waterford office.  Both of these Deputies were regarded as the two official spokesmen of Fianna Fáil on the question of the classification of the Waterford office. One would imagine from the speeches made by both Deputies at that period that once Fianna Fáil Party came into office they would have no great hesitation whatever in adjusting the grievance.  As the Minister knows, the classification of the Waterford office is an outstanding grievance. The staff there has been agitating since 1908 to have put right a grievous wrong which was inflicted upon that office when it was irregularly and erroneously classified in that year.  Efforts were made to induce the last Government to realise the obvious injustice that had been done to Waterford.  At times these efforts look like yielding success, but in the end nothing was done by them to adjust the obvious grievance from which the Waterford office suffers.  However, Deputy Little and Deputy Goulding then on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party pleaded for an improvement in the classification. One would imagine that it was only necessary to draw the attention of the Post Office authorities to be assured that the grievance would be made right without delay.  Although that was done, the Minister seemed reluctant to recognise the outstanding claims of the Waterford office for an improvement in its present classification. There was delay in 1932 on the part of the Minister of the period in recognising the claim of Waterford for better classification.  However, in <Col N="274" /> February, 1933, Deputy Little took Waterford by storm during the general election of that month, and announced publicly that if the people there, and the Post Office staff in particular, had only the good sense to elect him and the Fianna Fáil administration, everything in the garden would be rosy as far as the classification of the office was concerned. Trusting a responsible, careful, cautious and prudent man, Deputy Little was returned with considerable support from those for whose votes he angled when he made that promise.</P>
    <P>Now in March, 1936 the promise that Deputy Little made still remains unhonoured.  Apparently the present Executive Council intend to treat the classification of the Waterford office in the same indifferent and cynical way as it has been treated by previous administrations both here and in Great Britain.  However, the Minister cannot say that he has not had adequate time to consider the question.  He is familiar with it for the past three years.  Surely that is a sufficiently long time to enable the Minister to make up his mind, whether he is going to improve the classification of the Waterford office or whether he is going to allow the matter to drag on in the present unfair way.  In 1933 Waterford was promised by Deputy Little that he would have the classification question raised.  I do not believe that promise was made in an irresponsible way by Deputy Little.  I believe it was made by the Deputy only after he received assurances that the classification of the office would be improved.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the merits of the case, the Government are in honour bound to redeem the promise that Deputy Little was apparently allowed to make on their behalf in 1933.  To give an example of the outstanding injustice under which Waterford suffers, it is only necessary to say that post offices are classified for purposes of pay under three categories&mdash;Class I, Class II and Class III.  Classification is based upon the local cost-of-living index figure, plus units of work. Where one is low the other must be correspondingly high.  Waterford is <Col N="275" /> classified for the purposes of pay of the postmen the same as Dunmore East, Portlaw, and Pilltown.  Although Waterford is a big busy city, with a population in the vicinity of 30,000, for the purpose of pay, in the case of the indoor staff, it is classified in the same way as Abbeyleix, Cashel, Clifden, Callan, and a number of other relatively small offices of that kind.  Nobody would defend the injustice in the classification of the Waterford staff on that obviously inequitable basis.  Having had the matter under consideration for three years I hope the Minister will now give some indication that there is likely to be a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>One thing I can congratulate the Minister on this year&mdash;the only thing I can congratulate him on&mdash;is the reduction of hours in respect of the grades, chiefly in the engineering and stores departments.  The Minister has in this particular instance reduced the hours from 48 net per week to 44 net per week.  I believe that is a beneficial reform from the point of view of the staff, and I believe it is a reform which will be appreciated by the staff.  I believe that the repercussions of that reform in other respects will also have beneficial reactions from the staff point of view.  I hope, therefore, that the problem, which is allied with the problem of working hours, will not escape the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Post Office staff suffer from the peculiar injustice that they are denied any weekly half-holiday.  Under the 1912 Early Closing Act, the workers in industry and commerce are allowed a weekly half-holiday.  An obligation reposes in the State to enforce that Act to the extent of ensuring that workers in private employment are, under penalty, allowed a weekly half-holiday. Under the Conditions of Employment Act, recently passed by the Oireachtas, not only was that right which was then conferred upon industrial workers confirmed, but in some respects it was extended.  You have, however, the curious anomaly that the State, which is charged with <Col N="276" /> the responsibility of ensuring compliance on the part of employers with the 1912 Act and with the Conditions of Employment Act, the State, which pursues the private employer in that respect, will not grant in respect to the manipulative staff in the Post Office Department the weekly half-holiday which it compels private employers to observe.</P>
    <P>The entire staffs of every other Department of State&mdash;the Departments of Justice, the Land Commission, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and Finance&mdash;secure a weekly half-holiday, although they do not work for such long hours as the Post Office staff.  In these particular instances the weekly half-holiday is provided, but in the case of the Post Office manipulative staff there is no weekly half-holiday provided. The Minister as a member of the Executive Council, is responsible for seeing that the Attorney-General does his duty in respect of private employers under the Acts I have referred to; but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who ought to be in the dock more frequently than any private employer in relation to this matter, is, apparently, enabled to escape completely his obvious obligation to provide a weekly half-holiday for his own staff.  That is an anomaly that has gone on for too long, and I hope the Minister will realise that in these days, and especially in view of the principle enshrined in the Conditions of Employment Act that a weekly half-holiday shall be provided for all industrial workers, a principle which is likely to be extended to other measures dealing with workers in other employment, he should take steps to ensure that a half-holiday is provided for the staff of the Department of which he is the administrative head. If he does that he will confer a substantial boon on the staff, and in any case he will ensure that they will have the same period for recreation, in respect of release from work, as the State is obliged to ensure that the outside employee is entitled to.  A very grave anomaly at all events exists at present.  It should not be allowed to continue, and I hope, now that the Minister has moved on the question of <Col N="277" /> hours in respect of the stores and engineering staffs, that he will open his mind in a sympathetic manner on the question of arranging that the Post Office staff will no longer be denied the weekly half-holiday which has been withheld from them for all too long.</P>
    <P>There is another question to which I must again call the Minister's attention, and that is the question of part-time labour in the Post Office.  I have already told the House that there are 3,700 part-time officers employed in the Post Office.  One finds it difficult to believe that it is beyond the wit of man or the organising capacity of the administrative staff of the Post Office to devise a scheme by which that substantial number of part-time officers could be reduced by providing them with full-time employment.  So far as the Minister is concerned, he is the employer of more part-time labour than any other single industry in the country.  Part time employment is socially and economically unsound and it is particularly so when the persons concerned are paid wretchedly low rates of wages as occurs in the case of the Minister's employees. These 3,700 part-time employees perform very responsible work which calls for a very high standard of honesty and integrity.  They serve the Post Office and the community with a zeal and enthusiasm which is remarkable, and all the more commendable because of the very poor reward which they receive from the Minister in the form of wages.  When we come to examine the problem occasioned by the employment of these people, part-time, at lower rates of wages, we see at once the obvious inequalities which arise in the matter. Many of those who are employed by the Minister, part-time, receive less in wages than they would receive if they were in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, and although the rates of benefit provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act are lower than the rates of benefit provided under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, the Minister will find, if he consults the wage scales in respect of his part-time employees, that many people are working for him for a rate <Col N="278" /> of wages which is less than they would receive under the Unemployment Assistance Act if they were not working at all.  You have got, therefore, the peculiar anomaly that the Minister is employing persons for wages in the Post Office and is paying them less than they would get for doing nothing under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    <P>That gives Deputies an idea of the measure of munificence which characterises the Minister's wretched wage levels so far as his own employees are concerned.  It may be suggested, of course, that these persons can obtain outside employment, and that, in fact, many of them do that.  Last year, I think, the Minister tried to get away with the suggestion that the Post Office took a test at certain offices as to the number of persons in part-time employment who had outside employment, and found that quite a considerable number of them had it.  I do not know at what office the authorities took the test; I do not know whether it was in a town, city or a small rural area or whether it was confined to a few places where they knew the results they would get; but I have no hesitation in saying that the return is about as remote from realities as anything I have heard put up by the Post Office in defence of its action in any particular matter.</P>
    <P>It is the sheerest nonsense to pretend to anybody who knows anything about the condition of part-time employees in the Post Office that a majority of them have outside employment. Let the Minister inquire how many of the 35 part-time employees in Dublin have outside employment or how many in Cork, Waterford, Galway, Limerick, Mullingar, Thurles or Nenagh have outside employment.  Let the Minister inquire in Roscommon, in Castlerea and in Boyle how many people have outside employment and I am sure he will get an answer which will completely surprise him.  What is the prospect of these persons being able to get outside employment?  There are 143,000 people available for whole-time employment, registered at the employment exchanges and available for work at any hour of the night, <Col N="279" /> noon or morning, available to work eight, ten or 12 hours a day if their services are required.  These 143,000 people cannot get work and what is the prospect then of a man being able to get work who is available only at certain hours that he selects himself. The postal authorities know perfectly well that these people have no outside employment; they know these people are compelled in the main to exist on the Post Office wages; they know, too, that these rates of wages are incapable of sustaining these people, having regard to their civic and domestic responsibilities.  It is nothing short of a shame that the Post Office should expect them to exist on the miserably low rates of wages they are at present in receipt of, wages which are less than these people would get by way of unemployment insurance or in the form of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to share out certain moneys amongst telephone subscribers makes curious reading side by side with these facts.  It has been suggested to the Minister time and time again that if he only had the courage and vision to face up to his responsibilities in respect of part-time employment in the Post Office he can substantially reduce the dimensions of the problem and modify substantially the wretched conditions of employment which exists.  It has been suggested to the Minister that he should make a start in the cities and towns where persons are employed part-time and endeavour to build up part-time duties by the provision of additional services.  In that way, he would help to create in a progressive manner an additional number of full-time duties. If that process were extended to the head offices throughout the country, and if the problem were tackled with vision, courage and some measure of sympathy, I have no hesitation in saying that not only could part-time labour there be abolished, but the public would receive a substantial improvement in the local services.  In the course of time the examination might be extended to other offices, all aiming at the one objective, namely, <Col N="280" /> reducing the amount of part-time employment in the service generally. There is no insuperable difficulty in the way of the Minister getting rid of part-time employment in the cities and towns.  His advisers must know it if he does not happen to know it himself. Whatever justification you may try to advance in respect of rural areas, you cannot defend part-time labour in the cities and towns.  The problem in the cities and towns could be solved almost immediately if the postal authorities would only recognise their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Department has been asked to effect a remedy by the organisation representing the staff.  I would like to know from the Minister whether we can look forward to a substantial diminution of part-time employment in the cities and towns and if we could have an assurance that efforts will be made by the Minister to ensure that those persons whose posts are extended from part to full time will be automatically established when the full-time positions are created for them.  To suggest that persons of 45 and 50 years of age should sit for a literary examination is something which will strike any Deputy as an unreasonable imposition.  In the case of those people who have served for 20 or 30 years, there can be no question as to their efficiency.  Indeed, no such question has ever arisen.  If the Minister will only bestir himself, take a personal interest in the matter, and give instructions to his officials to spend some of the Post Office surplus in taking those people out of the wretched conditions in which they find themselves, I can assure him that he can come to the House next year feeling that, in so far as that portion of the surplus has been spent in improving the conditions of wretchedly paid people, it has been well spent, and the Minister will derive more satisfaction from so spending it than by devoting it to other purposes which, in the last analysis, simply mean giving something more to some who have already a substantial sum.  He might well direct his expenditure amongst those who find it extremely difficult to exist on the present low rates of wages.</P>
    <P>These are matters that intimately <Col N="281" /> affect the Post Office staff.  It is through their brains and energy and ability that the Post Office service is maintained.  I think it will be agreed by all sections of the House that the Post Office staffs have served the community faithfully, zealously and efficiently.  It has always been their objective, no matter what they might think of the curious wage mentality of the authorities, to realise that they are the custodians of the interest and well-being of the public.  They have not allowed their own domestic difficulties to intrude themselves in the matter of serving the public, and they have carried out their duties in as efficient a way as it is possible for any staffs to do.  The Minister ought to recognise that that kind of service imposes an obligation on him to reciprocate.  He has now reached the affluent stage of being in a position to command a surplus of £206,000.  We earnestly trust that he will show his sympathy with those in the Post Office service in a practical way and that he will treat them in a much more liberal manner than they have been so far treated by this Government or their predecessors.</P>

      <P>I really do not know what to say after that speech.  I think this is the fourth year in succession that I have listened to that speech and, if I were a Post Office employee, having listened for the fourth year to the same speech, under the circumstances that exist I think I would require a cocktail to brace me up a bit.  What is the position of Deputy Norton in this matter?  I do not question any allegation he has made with regard to the position of the staff&mdash;I accept that&mdash;but for four years he has been in weekly or fortnightly consultation with the Government in relation to policy and administration and what has he done for those whom he represents?  He is the direct representative in this House of the Post Office Workers' Union and for four years he has come here and delivered the same speech, using all the adjectives he has used describing the conditions of these people.  I do not know what Deputy Norton thinks, as representing the Post Office workers, but I <Col N="282" /> know what I would think if I represented them in the same capacity.  I would think that it was about time I was silent in representing them.  That litany has been dished out here for the past four years.  Apparently Deputy Norton has been in fortnightly touch with the Government during all that period and yet the position is the same as it was four years ago except for some little improvement in working hours with regard to the stores staff. Apart from that, there has been no improvement.  Then he asked the Minister to call a mass meeting of the Post Office workers to tell him what the Post Office staff think of the Minister. I wonder would Deputy Norton think of calling a mass meeting of the workers and let them tell Deputy Norton what they think of his efforts during the past four years towards improving their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I hope that all Deputy Norton's speech was not irrelevant and I was only referring to that point.  I am very glad to see these accounts presented so very efficiently, but there are one or two matters about which I should like a little explanation.  I welcome the concessions that have been made, but at the same time I must say that I am disappointed. In the time of the Minister's predecessor, I appealed to him, in connection with this Vote, to take his courage in his hands and bring about reductions in the charges for the telegraph and telephone services.  Of course, no attention was paid to that. I complained of various things, such as the charging of the extension of lines to built up areas, and the putting of the charges on the new subscribers, with the result that those coming on afterwards will reap the benefit of these things after these <Col N="283" /> people have paid for them.  What I regret about this is that the Minister, as representing this country, is apparently keeping in step with the Imperial Government in the step he is taking now.  I notice that it is a common phrase up in the north of Ireland that the Belfast Parliament is keeping in step with the British Government.  Could we not here have a bit of vision?  Could we not have had it two years ago, or even last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested two years ago that this step should be taken because it was obvious, from a commercial point of view, that the charges being made were strangling these two services.  It was obvious that you were not going to extend a business such as this or any other business so long as you had such charges as then existed.  They strangled the services and they strangled the prosperity of the Government. Here we come along now in 1936, a year after the English Postmaster-General, in April, 1935, introduced his Budget and brought about the reductions the counterpart of which we are now getting.  Are we merely limpets that we have to step in the trail of these gentlemen?  Are we to sit like oysters in our shells and only open when some other oyster opens and when we are compelled to do it? It is only now, 14 or 15 years after this State was created and took over these services, that we have these reductions. One could understand the State being conservative for the first few years and not doing anything revolutionary, but as the country was expanding and developing and new industries were being inaugurated in the country, it was obvious that a little courage and vision was required in this matter, and I think that nobody can say now that this was done for that reason at all. It is simply being done in order to keep in step with Great Britain.  That is the feeling I have about it.  It is not a hostile criticism at all.  I have a feeling of regret that we should have to come along now and do this a year after Great Britain introduced these concessions.  The Minister's predecessor and the Minister himself should have thought of reducing the charges <Col N="284" /> for telephone and telegraph services a year, or two years, or even three years ago, but instead of that we come limping along in 1936 and the taunt can be thrown at this country that we are merely keeping step with Great Britain, marching along step by step with Lord Craigavon in Ulster and step by step with the British Government.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to these concessions&mdash;they are quite satisfactory, as far as they go, in some respects.  There are concessions on the parcel post service.  That is all to the good in developing the trade and commerce of the country, but I think the Minister will agree with me that there should also be a reduction in the letter post, and I think that perhaps the Minister will regret that he was not a bit bolder and that, when he did make a concession in regard to the parcel post service, he did not, conjointly with that, reduce the ordinary letter postage to 1½d. or 1d.  I think that, when he took the step of reducing the parcel post in an effort to help the trade and commerce of the country, it was incumbent on him to reduce the letter post also.  I suggest to the Minister that, between this and July, he should take steps to see that a reduction in the letter post will come into operation along with the reduction in the parcel post.  As I said before, courage will pay in this matter.  Time has proved that, but of course we had to wait for Great Britain, and then the Minister was prepared to do the goose-step along with Great Britain!  I appeal to the Minister to take steps between this and July to reduce the letter post to 1½d. or 1d., because the surplus here is quite equal to meeting that burden.</P>
    <P>I have said here before that a little courage is needed in dealing with the telegraph service.  Again, I repeat that that service is being strangled by the charges.  No sensible person would think of sending a telegram to any distance nowadays at a charge of 1/6.  If a person wants to send an urgent message he has got to plank down 1/6 in the Post Office.  That would strangle anything.  If you want to have a good service, a service that is going to be popular, you must give value, and you are not giving value.  It looks, apparently, <Col N="285" /> as if it were the policy of the Post Office to completely wipe out the telegraph system.  I wonder is that a wise thing for the future commercial development of this country; because you can walk in at any moment, or any firm can send a message over the telephone to the Post Office to send a telegram, and it goes away immediately, whereas in the case of commercial trunk calls&mdash;and a commercial house may urgently want a trunk call&mdash; you may have to wait for an hour or two hours, according to the time the line is occupied.  I think that the Minister should go a step further in that direction also and reduce the telegraph charges.  He gives a reduction here with regard to porterage, but that does not touch the core of the question at all.  If the telegraph system is to be of any use to the commercial life of this country, the question of porterage does not arise at all. Large factories are always situated in towns or villages in which the Post Office is situated, and so the question of porterage does not arise in such cases.  The question of porterage only arises in the extended use of the telephone or the telegraph.  If the Post Office is making a concession to telephone users in cities and urban areas, surely some concession should be made to the rural population.  Surely the Minister should realise that there is an agricultural community, and that it is a very important community.  What advantage is the agricultural community getting out of these concessions? None whatever.  Somebody sends a wire living in the country because they cannot send a telephone message.  What is the Minister doing for those people?  He is taking steps to help the factories and the ordinary industrial concerns.  What is he doing for the great basic industry in this country?  Nothing, except that there is to be relief in the parcel post rates. Otherwise nothing is being done for them.  That great industry is completely forgotten.  Like the slaughter of calves, this great industry is being slaughtered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three suggestions over and above those put by Deputy Norton that were made.  First there is the suggestion of the reduction of the letter post; secondly, the reduction of the telegraph rates, which would be of great relief to the agricultural community.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  I think he will agree that in these concessions he is giving the agricultural community no relief.  The agricultural industry of this country is a greater industry than the manufacturing industry.  The Minister has given concessions costing £70,000.  What is the value of the concession he is giving to the basic industry of the country&mdash;agriculture? He is giving a concession to the industrial or commercial houses, when sending out parcels, by reducing the rates of the parcel post.  In some cases, if not in all cases, where farmers or their families purchase parcels up to 10/-, they are sent free by the firm from whom they are purchased, so that in that respect there is no concession at all to agriculturists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of matters in the Minister's statement that I suppose are technical.  I do not quite understand them.  I notice in one paragraph it is stated &ldquo;The general effect of the rental and free radius charges will be that the rentals of about 2,550 existing subscribers, including subscribers in suburban districts, such as Cabra and Mount Merrion in Dublin, will be reduced by amounts varying from £1 to £22 10s. according to the circumstances in each case.&rdquo; That seems a very wide gap.  There is a range of from £1 to £22 10s. That, of course, may be dealing with something technical, and the Minister might deal with it later.  I asked the Minister about the telegraph business. The porterage concession is futile. I think it is miserable, and one might say contemptible.  If the Minister was out to do a pretty decent thing in regard to part-time workers and had some courage I think he should have widened his radius further.  That <Col N="287" /> concession of 3d. on porterage is useless and will have no effect. The Minister says in the second last paragraph of his report that his concessions are going to amount to £70,000 on a profit of £202,000.  But with that profit there is ample room for him to take the steps I have suggested.  They would not cost anything approaching the balance he has.  I suggest that he ought to meet Deputy Norton's demand and increase the wages of the workers.</P>
    <P>Now on the question of trunk calls the statement as put into the Minister's report is misleading.  The paragraph in regard to this matter states there is to be a:&mdash;&ldquo;General reduction of charges for trunk calls, including the introduction of a maximum fee of 2/6 for day calls to all places within the Saorstát, and a 4/- maximum to all places in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  For night calls there will be a maximum fee of 1/- on all calls to the Saorstát, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  But then the statement goes on to say there will be:&mdash;&ldquo;The supplementary cable fee of 1/- on day calls and 6d. on night calls to Great Britain will still be charges in addition to the normal trunk fee&rdquo;... I submit that will prove to be misleading. The public will think that they will get night calls to Great Britain, for the sum mentioned, that is 1/-, whereas, in fact, they will not. They will be asked for 1/6 while they will think that they should only be asked for 1/-.  The 6d. is a cable charge and does not go to the Post Office.  But the public will not see that.  It will have gone out to the public that the charge is 1/- whereas it is 1/6.  In the leaflet issued, or to be issued it would be better that that charge be put down as 1/6 or not 1/-; otherwise it will lead to a lot of endless trouble for the staffs and the exchanges.  I congratulate the Minister on making these reductions.  I am very pleased about it but I regret that the step was not taken sooner.</P>
    <P>The question of wages which is a major question, from the human <Col N="288" /> standpoint, should have been dealt with first.  It was very elaborately dealt with by Deputy Norton.  I join with Deputy Norton in appealing to the Minister to use some of the profits of the Post Office for the increase of salaries and wages, particularly seeing the way they run now.  I suggest to the Minister that it is immoral that profits of £202,000 should be made out of the labour of a body of people who are underpaid.  I do not want to put it any stronger than that and I do not want to put it on any lower basis either.  It is immoral and cannot be defended either inside or outside this House.  There is a very large number of those full-time and part-time workers who have given priceless service to the Post Office of this State not only with work but with integrity.  It is that work, that loyalty and that integrity which have produced this profit of £202,000 for the State.  I think the Minister should definitely make up his mind that the Department of Finance must not be permitted to gobble up this huge profit&mdash;because for a small State like this it is a huge profit&mdash; while the people who make that profit are underpaid.  I do not think the meanest employer could contend that there is not a large number of those people who are underpaid.  I hope that before this Vote comes before this House next year some steps will be taken to improve conditions with regard to the pay of those people.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental moral reason why their pay should be increased.  If you have a huge staff, either in the service of the State or in private employment, who are underpaid and who are producing great profit, you are at once laying the door open for dishonesty. It is a remarkable tribute to the workers of the Post Office that, in the circumstances of their employment&mdash;they take this employment simply because there is nothing else, and it is a question of getting a few shillings in some way&mdash;they maintain such a standard of integrity and honesty.  I think the State is bound, now that the Post Office is making this huge profit, to give immediate consideration to this question.  As a matter of fact, I would almost go as <Col N="289" /> far as Deputy Norton and say that the demands of the employees take priority over those of the telephone subscribers.  I am a telephone subscriber myself, and much as I appreciate the reduction made here, I would forego them on behalf of the staff.  I do appeal to the Minister on their behalf, and urge that in the future if any concessions are being made they should be made to the staff.  Again, I ask the Minister to reduce the letter postage and the telegraph cost.  He has sufficient time to do that between now and the inauguration of those concessions in July.  Secondly, I ask him to make up his mind between now and next year that the employees will reap some benefit of the profits made out of this organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long with the small contribution I have to make to the debate on this Estimate.  I had intended to raise only one matter, but having listened to the previous speaker, I decided to deal with one or two other matters.  Some years ago in this House when the Estimate was being introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at that time I could not help contributing to the debate, and in my opening remarks I remember distinctly referring to the Parliamentary Secretary as a psycho-pathological optimist.  I was reminded of that in a slightly different category when listening to the last speaker.  I came to the conclusion that he was a psycho-pathological pessimist.  The Deputy seriously wanted us to believe that he had given some thought to the remarks he was making.  He took great pains to point out that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was just marching in step with the English Postmaster-General, and that because a reduction had been made there a reduction was being made here, but he completely neglected the fact that the reason why we have reductions here in the various postal services is because we have a surplus; it is not because we are marching in step with the English Postmaster-General.  I think the Minister is to be congratulated <Col N="290" /> from all sides of the House on the wonderful progress he has made in his Department since he took it over, and on abolishing the very considerable deficit which had occurred year after year consistently until he took over the administration of this particular Department.</P>
      <P>Another amusing thing was to hear the Deputy from Donegal pleading with the Minister on behalf of what he referred to as the underpaid workers.  I could quite appreciate Deputy Norton taking that line and expressing his views quite sincerely. He has intimate knowledge of the matter, and he has a certain function as a result of the position he holds in this country as leader of the Labour Party, but I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House know that when it comes to making a case for the workers, particularly for the lower grades, we would be only wasting time in pushing an open door, because I think it will be agreed that there is no man in this House who has greater consideration or greater desire to do something for that class of worker than the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wanted to ask the Minister was to arrange, if it was possible, to give a night service in many of the smaller towns or urban districts that have no telephone service after a certain hour.  The Minister is aware, as the House is aware, that for the past few years there has been a considerable number of industrial undertakings established in various parts of the country outside of the City of Dublin, and it is most inconvenient for some of those establishments to have their telephone connection cut off at 8 o'clock and not available until the next morning.  On previous occasion when I approached the Minister on this matter he assured me that every thought was being given to this angle but that it was a matter of technical and engineering difficulty. Now, in view of the extensive increase in usage of the telephone services throughout the country, I would ask him to make a very special effort to give this extra service in those places where there is no night service.  I <Col N="291" /> believe, incidentally, that if he did give that extra service it would help to put some of the part-time officials on full time.  I understand that even before the considerable reductions which have been given in the telephone charges were mooted a great number of the persons who are telephone users were prepared to pay extra for the service they would get.  Deputy McMenamin surprised me when he said he was a telephone subscriber, because from his expressions in regard to the telephone service I was convinced that he did not use the telephone at all.</P>

It is not always convenient for people to go to the Gárda station to make telephone calls and I hope the Minister will seriously consider making an attempt, within this financial year, to give these services.</P>

      <P>My purpose in rising is not to demonstrate to the Minister that it is quite possible, within the rules of relevance and the rules of the House, to raise the economic war on this Estimate.  That was not my purpose, although I should like, as he has raised the point, to direct his attention to item P of the Estimate for the Post Office Savings Bank on page 279, and also to an item on page 285 for Colonial, Foreign and British Packet services, and then pass away from them, much I am sure to the relief of the Ceann Comhairle.  Item P is: &ldquo;Provision to meet deficiencies due to the withholding by the British Government of sums in connection with claims for superannuation payments and telephone annuities disputed by the Saorstát Government&mdash;£33,892.&rdquo;  The sum you are paying to the British Government for carrying the Irish mails is £26,000, referred to on page 285.</P>

      <P>You are paying £33,000 out of the taxpayers' money and not setting off the £26,000, because you know that the British will not carry the mails unless you pay spot cash.  My point is not to raise the economic war on this Estimate, nor had I intended even to refer to the two items I have referred to were it not for the interruption of the Minister.  Nor do I intend to refer to the fact that one of <Col N="293" /> the principal reasons explaining the increase of the Estimate for the Post Office services this year is the increase in the bonus due to the rise in the cost of living.  But I cannot refrain from commenting on the fact that one of the Minister's colleagues within the last few weeks drew attention to the fact that the cost of living had come down very considerably.  Now, we find the Minister telling the House that one of the reasons for the increase in the Estimate is the increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The real reason why I rise on this Estimate is to associate myself in some way with the remarks of Deputy Norton in connection with the Post Office employees.  I think it is not proper that the House should be used for the purpose of giving bouquets to the service.  I think none of the civil servants in any branch of the service require public representatives to get up here and present them with bouquets and comment on the fact that they are giving good service.  Their attitude is that it is all in the day's work.  I agree with Deputy Norton that it is a tribute that should be paid to the Post Office employees that, although they have laboured under extensive grievances for the last fifteen years&mdash;I shall include the previous administration period as well as the present administration period&mdash; in fact, they have given very loyal, efficient and zealous service to the public and have not allowed their grievances to obtrude on their public duties.  I think it is right that an exception should be made in their case, and that a tribute should come from this side of the House to the Post Office employees in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken, I presume, a certain pride in the fact that he is able to announce that he has on the Post Office services, a surplus of £206,800.  It has always been the policy of Governments in this country &mdash;it was the policy of the Administration that preceded the present one&mdash; that the Post Office services should be self-sufficient, and that the charges paid by the people who got the services should be sufficient to enable the services to be run without any demand <Col N="294" /> being made on the taxpayers.  Each year successively since the establishment of the Irish Free State the Post Office has been so efficiently run and the charges to the public who use the telephone, telegraph and other services made with such precision, that progressively each year there has been a diminution of the deficit that the Post Office showed for some years, and, consequently, there has been less and less demand on the taxpayers to keep the Post Office running.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage when there is no demand on the taxpayers' pocket.  Not merely is there no demand on the taxpayers' pocket, but there is a surplus of £206,000.  I think that, following the principle on which the Post Office services have been run since the establishment of the Free State, they were to be run as a business proposition, when there is a surplus on the running of these services, that surplus should be put into the business, just as would be done in connection with any private enterprise, and that no portion of the £206,000 should go to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is intended by the Minister, after he has given the benefit of the reduced charges to telephone subscribers and to other public users of the services, and after he has made provision for the reduction in the working hours, and the increases in pay to certain classes of the Post Office employees, to hand over the residue to the Minister for Finance.  If he intends to do that I think we ought to register a protest against it.  I suggest that portion of that surplus should be used in a businesslike way, and that the way any business house, running an enterprise of this kind, would use its surplus should be adopted by the Minister. In other words, that he should continue the policy so far as it is possible, of reducing the charges to the public, on the principle, not merely of reducing the charges to the public, but because these reductions of charges would themselves result ultimately in increased revenue to the Post Office, and that the balance of the sum, if not the greater portion&mdash;I would go the length of saving the greater portion of this sum&mdash;should be devoted to the <Col N="295" /> improvement of the conditions of the Post Office employees.</P>
    <P>I take the stand, and have always taken the stand, that you will not get properly efficient service from any body of employees, whether employed by outside firms or by the State, unless their conditions are stable and unless they are satisfied with their terms and conditions of employment. We have here a certain surplus. Undoubtedly the employees of the Post Office have been the most badly paid servants of the State, not merely in the time of the present Administration but in the time of the last Administration, and in the time of the British Government.  Anomalies exist there that do not exist in any other portion of the Civil Service.  The one referred to by Deputy Norton is rather incomprehensible&mdash;that a certain class of these employees have no weekly half-holiday.  My primary purpose in rising here was to support the proposition that the greater portion of that surplus, so far as it cannot be granted towards the reduction of charges&mdash;which by reason of the fact that their reduction may probably result in increased revenue are really not a liability&mdash;should be given towards the relief or part relief of some of the difficulties of the Post Office employees.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  Everyone likes to make his own pet suggestion to the Minister as to how he should employ his surplus.  Deputy McMenamin has made one suggestion.  I want to make one purely personal suggestion.  I would like to know what revenue is produced to the Minister by the 6d. tax delivery on parcels?  That is a tax which annoys me personally.  In the course of and for the purposes of my profession I get certain books and whether the parcels are small or big I have to pay a 6d. tax each time.  I want to know whether that charge could be removed or whether it is of sufficient importance to justify its retention.  It is to many people a very irritating charge.  A tax of 6d. on a small parcel is a very heavy burden.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> The last thing to which I want to refer is the question of promotion.  I put down a question some time ago on information supplied me about a certain Post Office in the County Dublin. I do not propose to reopen that matter.  It was suggested to me that the office in question had been filled in a way that was not proper or which did not commend itself to the staff; that it was in itself unfair and unjust to the senior members of the staff.  I do wish to say this&mdash;that there are certain indications that promotions in the Civil Service are not being given in the ordinary way to officers who have gone into the Civil Service in the usual fashion and who have spent all the years of their lives there where they had been led and properly led to believe that the usual customary promotion would be given to them. There are indications that the rule is being departed from in other branches of the Civil Service.  It may be that the information that was given to me about the particular postal official about whom I asked the question was inaccurate.  I do not know. At all events the Minister stated in answer to my question that it was inaccurate and I accept that.  I do want an assurance from the Minister that in connection with all promotion in his Department he will give it to serving officials and that no question of political considerations will be taken into account in making these appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great activity on the northern front, there is great activity on the southern front, and further engineering activity on the eastern and western fronts in the erection of further telephone pill boxes. Some years ago I think I referred to this great activity of the Department. I suggested then that some improvements might be made in the way of embellishment but those suggestions were not accepted.  I do not want to submit to the Minister any further embellishments beyond the geranium pots.  Does the Minister understand that he is planting these boxes in the pedestrians' way?  I had occasion recently to get quite a start at finding where these boxes were put.  One of <Col N="297" /> them was certainly the cause of a loss of memory, a thing that had not happened before, but it was too soon. About Harold's Cross or Rathgar I met one of these boxes right in the middle of the pathway.  I walked around it twice.  I could not actually place the spot where it is.  It is the first time that I lost my memory and I was perfectly sober at the time.  It would have been some consolation to me if I had not been perfectly sober, for then I would know the loss of memory was only trivial.  Leaning up against the newest erection in the street the other day waiting for a bus, I came to the conclusion that telephone users were so many that it means that almost every man now has his own telephone.  If we are not to have a surfeit of these boxes, I suggest that they be decently painted.  Some time ago when I raised the matter they were daubed all over with blue.  That was supposed to be the winning colour at the time.  Those who thought that were, in my opinion, colourblind.  They are now painted green, white and yellow, and still sustain the national cause.</P>
      <P>College Green is one of the most magnificent thoroughfares in the world. Every Dublin man is proud of it, and must naturally be.  What do we see there?  I was not there to-day, but I was there yesterday and saw twin boxes there.  Why not add another one and make it triplets?  You might get a bounty for doing it.  They are in College Green fronting the back of Grattan's statue with their backs exposed to the people.  They are a dirty yellow and have not been painted for 12 months.  I do not regard that as a laughing matter at all.  I regard it as a very serious thing.  I am not blaming the Minister.  I am blaming his officers who oversee these things. These officers ought to be commanded to keep them in decent repair and not allow them to become eyesores.  I do not know whether the resources of civilisation are yet exhausted in the planning out of these constructions. Surely in other cities and towns there are receptacles for public telephones, and receptacles that do not become eyesores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why these special erections were made I do not know.  I asked a couple <Col N="298" /> of people and they told me it was well planned out in the Department.  I was told that archaeologists were consulted about them.  Designs were submitted to the Post Office; it took a long time, but eventually one man's designs were accepted.  One man told me that they were really a relic of the stone age, that these were the sort of things that people used throw at one another in the stone age.  Another man suggested that over 200 years ago some sort of piers like these were erected in Scotland by the then Duke of Argyle.  At the time the Scottish people suffered from some skin disease, and it was thought necessary to erect those posts or milestones.  The Scottish people offered a prayer for the Duke of Argyle every time they used them. Now we have them in the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer the Minister to a point of which I am painfully aware every day and that is, that his Department is responsible for removing seven or eight houses out of St. Andrew Street within the last two years.  St. Andrew Street is a very important thoroughfare close to College Green.  As everybody knows, it was a centre of professional life.  These seven or eight houses have been removed in the last two years.  These ruins or remains lie there now with a wooden paling round them.  Only for the fact that the Town Planning Act&mdash;which gave some protection to this class of place by putting a paling over it&mdash;has been passed, I think I would get the corporation to move that they take over that derelict site now. I say that because, unfortunately, the Minister's Department, or whoever is responsible for the decision in connection with this place, is apparently not going to move.  It is not good enough to have in the centre of commercial Dublin the sites of six large houses lying derelict.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us when he proposes to rebuild on these sites, if his Department is responsible at all.  I think when I spoke to him some time ago, in regard to the matter, he referred me to the Agricultural Co-operative Company and <Col N="299" /> said that they were the people responsible. Whoever is responsible for it should see that that eyesore&mdash;and it is an eyesore&mdash;should be removed.  It may seem a commonplace thing for me to say, but it would provide a good deal of employment.  I am perfectly certain that if these sites were available they would be rapidly taken up by speculators of one type or another. I know one man who has built a house in that street and it cost up to £2,000 or £3,000.  I hope the Minister will bear my representations in mind and take steps to have these eyesores removed.  We must always remember, as I have frequently stated here, that Dublin is the metropolitan city of Ireland.  In no other city of its class would this condition of affairs be tolerated.  Having drawn the Minister's attention to it, I hope that when his Estimate is introduced next year, I, like other members, will be able to congratulate him, not on an avalanche of pill boxes, but on the reconstruction of these derelict buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on this Estimate last year, I drew the attention of the Minister to certain aspects of the postal service which are very unsatisfactory from the public point of view.  I regret that I could repeat almost <i>verbatim</i> to-day the complaints I then made as in regard to none of them has any improvement been made.  We recognise that the Minister is anxious to give better services and we welcome the promised cheaper telephone services in the near future. In the first place, I wish to draw attention to the fact that the postal services of Dublin still remain on the war basis on which they were established about 20 years ago, and that they are much worse than they were 25 or 30 years ago.  No attempt has been made to improve the services since the end of the War.  The postage, of course, is dearer than it used to be.  The last delivery in the day being about 3 o'clock and the last hour at which a letter may be posted in Dublin for delivery the same day being about 12.30 p.m., it follows that in ordinary cases it takes 48 hours to get a reply <Col N="300" /> to a letter posted in Dublin.  A letter posted at 1 p.m. is not delivered until the following morning.  Only replies to such letters posted about noon, or shortly afterwards, would be delivered within the city that day.  Unless a reply is posted about noon or shortly afterwards, the reply cannot be received within the city until the following morning.  That practically means that business men or professional men cannot hope to get replies to their letters within 48 hours.</P>
      <P>I may, of course, be told by the Minister that the citizens of Dublin rely more on the telephone than on the post, but he must recognise that for many purposes the telephone is not a satisfactory means of communication. Many people will not use the telephone and have to rely on the post.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of re-establishing the evening services as formerly.  We had two evening deliveries, one about 7 or 8 p.m., in which letters which had come across on the English mail were delivered, and another on which letters which had come up on the late evening trains from the country were delivered. Surely it is within the Minister's power to arrange for at least one evening delivery, so as to enable citizens to get their country letters and the foreign letters which come across from England on that evening.  At present, of course, the day mail service from Holyhead to Dublin is of no use to the citizens of Dublin because the letters are not delivered until the following morning, an hour or two before the letters which come across by the morning mail, both being in time for the opening of business.  It is hard to understand why we should, after so many years, have to put up with a worse service than we were getting 25 or 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drew the Minister's attention last year also to the amazing charges for letters sent out from Ireland by air mail.  He gave me an explanation which, as far as it went, was entirely satisfactory, but it did not cover the whole ground.  He said that the charges were those imposed by the people who ran the air-mail services and that he had no power to reduce <Col N="301" /> those charges.  I should like to know, however, why people at the other end are able to send letters back here for considerably less than we are able to send them out.  A letter by air mail to South Africa from the Irish Free State costs 1/3 or 1/4 while a letter from South Africa to the Irish Free State by air mail costs only 6d. How is it that the people in South Africa are able to get a service at less than half it costs us for an exactly similar service in the reverse direction?  We hear a great deal of talk about the extension of air mail services and, of course, such services are of enormous value to those who have business connections in faroff countries.  It seems to me amazing, however, that it should cost twice as much to send a letter from Ireland to South Africa as to send a letter from South Africa back to Ireland.  If the South African Ministers are able to make good bargains with the British Government, surely the Free State Minister should be able to make equally good bargains.  I can quite understand that he may not be able to get for us all the benefits that the British Government would give to its own people, but we ought to be able to get as much as any other Dominion can get out of the British Government. I trust that by this time next year the Minister will have redressed some of these grievances which I have brought for the second time to his notice.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a word to the protest made by Deputy Norton in connection with the treatment meted out to some postal workers.  Deputy Costello a few moments ago said that he was glad to see that the Post Office Department was becoming self-supporting.  I do not think it can be said that any undertaking is self-sufficient or self-supporting so long as it has people working for it who are not getting anything like a living wage.  I suggest to the Minister that before any concessions were given the public, no matter how welcome they are, some attention should have been paid to the representations made in recent years to the Minister by Deputy Norton on behalf of the postal workers.  It is apparent to everyone that there has been a considerable increase in postal traffic of every description during the past one or two years, and that it is in consequence of that there is a surplus.  That means that the postal workers have had a considerable amount of extra work thrown on their shoulders.  Notwithstanding the benefits that accrued from greater activities in postal circles, these workers have not benefited to any extent.  I suggest to the Minister that he could not withstand the statements of Deputy Norton if he had any desire to do anything on behalf of the people who are working in the Department. Deputy Norton dealt with the position of part-time workers and auxiliary postmen.  Some time last year the Minister told us that in a great many cases these people had other work.  If he had gone into the matter more carefully he would have found that very few of the auxiliary postmen or part-time workers have other work, because they are not available every day in the week or for many hours each day.  Seeing that there are large numbers unemployed at present, no employer is going to take advantage of the services of the other men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to the position of postmen in the Wexford area.  On the 21st of last December a certain increase in basic rates was announced for postmen. <Col N="303" /> Unfortunately, Wexford did not come under that increase, which was given in towns like Cobh and Bray.  I am not going to admit that a Wexford man is any worse worker, so to speak, than the men in Bray or Cobh.  Up to that the basic rate in Wexford was 34/- and in Bray and Cobh 37/-.  It is regrettable that there was ever any difference there.  One would have thought when the basic rate was altered in Cobh and Bray that it would have been altered in Wexford, and in towns which are as important as Cobh or Bray.  The difference before the increase was given was 3/- a week; it is now 4/- a week.  I would like to know from the Minister why no increase was given to postmen in Wexford town.  As far as auxiliary postmen are concerned it will be admitted that the miserable rate of pay of these people would be a disgrace to any private employer or any State employer, when it is remembered that in the rural areas, where they are only working two or three days weekly, the rate is generally 9¾d. an hour.  While one can understand the small rate of pay, one cannot understand how these persons exist.</P>
    <P>We know the arduous work that auxiliary postmen have to do.  They have to be out in all weathers and the pay for the first five years is the munificent sum of 9¾d. an hour.  I suggest to the Minister that he has certainly no reason to feel pleased with himself for giving a reduction of telephone charges, as long as men are working in the Department for such disgraceful wages.  The wages of the permanent postmen are bad enough but the wages of the temporary men are infinitely worse.  I thought I heard Deputy McMenamin saying, when he was speaking, that the reduction in the porterage charges on telegrams was not worth speaking about, that nobody bothered about them. When the Farmers' Party was in this House I remember distinctly that hours and hours were wasted&mdash;we must assume now that the time was wasted seeing that no benefit is said to be derived by a reduction of these charges&mdash;by the Farmers' Party advocating <Col N="304" /> such reductions.  It is now suggested that a concession of 50 per cent. is not a concession.  I think none of these concessions should have been made until the demands of the postal workers were dealt with by the Minister.  He should have taken cognisance of what was said by Deputy Norton, and some of the surplus money which has accrued during the past twelve months should have been made available immediately to enable him to do something for workers who have certainly been treated in a disgraceful manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to the Minister on some of the reductions that have been made, but I wish to point out that there have been appeals for increased services, for night calls and other things from Deputies representing areas that have services, the expense of which has been borne by the ordinary taxpayers and farmers for a number of years. As far as I can see none of the reductions announced is of any benefit to farmers.  I suggest that the Minister should consider the position of ordinary farmers who only get the post two or three times weekly.  That is the only service they get for this expenditure.  Before there was any reduction in telephone services or anything else that question of giving farmers a daily post might have been considered, seeing that it is the taxpayers who have for the past 15 years carried these services on their backs. We heard appeals from one source or another for more services.  I wish to point out that the provision of extra services would help out in connection with the employment of part-time men about whom Deputy Norton rightly complains.  Deputies opposite knew of the small wages paid these men for twelve years but they closed their eyes to the position.  Now we have them and the Labour Party appealing for increased wages.  From my knowledge of the Minister I say that no Deputy has more at heart the case of the ordinary workers than he has.  I suggest that he would like to be generous, but before he gives other reductions he should spend money on ordinary postal workers.  I <Col N="305" /> commend to him especially the case of the auxiliary postmen.  It is all right for the gentleman here in the city who can turn out in a good coat and do his rounds in a couple of hours. It is different altogether with the poor fellow down the country who has to travel along bohereens and climb over ditches to deliver letters to houses many of them scattered far apart, and all that for a miserable wage.  As Deputy Corish has pointed out, I think that this class of postmen should receive the first measure of the Minister's generosity if he finds it possible to increase wage payments.  That should be done before reductions are made in telephone charges.  When heavy losses were sustained on this service in years gone by they had to be borne mainly by the farmer who only gets a delivery of his letters two or three days a week.  I suggest to the Minister that he might now look into the matter and see if he could not arrange for a daily delivery of letters in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>I think it was said here previously in debates on this Estimate that the only letter the farmer received by post was a bill for his seeds, and for that reason that he would much prefer to have only a weekly delivery.  Still, when a notification is sent out to a farmer that his seeds have arrived in the local town it is only right that it should not be held up for two or three days.  I think that if the Minister has any reductions to give he should first consider the taxpayers down through the country who have been carrying the city people on their backs for a number of years.  It is about time that the people for whom I speak got something out of this service.</P>

      <P>I am not excluding anybody. I must say that I compliment Deputy Norton on the success he has achieved.  He got away with it last year when I was left with only about <Col N="306" /> ten minutes to reply.  Of course, if I had moved to report progress the debate might have gone on during the whole of the following day, but having had experience as a Whip and realising the value of parliamentary time, I did not bother to move to report progress.  I did get an opportunity afterwards of replying in a debate on a motion for the adjournment.  I am not going to admit that, in comparison with the wages paid to people doing the same kind of work in outside industries, the Post Office people are badly paid.  I admit that there is a low level of remuneration for manual workers all round, much lower than I would like to see.  I maintain that the Post Office workers are, comparatively speaking, as well paid as any other class of worker in the country.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that it is not possible to do away with part-time labour.  I give Deputy Costello credit for feeling very keenly on that matter as I also do.  I do not like to be put in the position of having to pay people less than 20/- a week.  The fact is that, as far as I know, no Post Office service in the world has been able to eliminate this part-time employment.  One would think that in the City of London it would be possible to do away with it, but even there it has not been found possible.  Deputy Norton knows quite well that if he were Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he could not do away with it either.  It was not done away with in England when the Labour Party was in power.  Of course, I do not blame Deputy Norton or anyone in opposition for criticising us about this.  I feel a bit more inclined to blame Deputy Corry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he ought to know our difficulties.  I do not blame the Opposition for trying to squeeze all they can from us.  Everyone is demanding better services and at the same time a reduction of postal charges.  People want a daily delivery of letters no matter what the cost is. Deputy Costello objects to having any of this surplus surrendered to the Minister for Finance.  I suppose if we could manage to do that, we would all <Col N="307" /> agree with him.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that when the change of Government took place in 1922-23 the deficit on the three branches of the postal service was £1,180,000.  The general taxpayer had to make good that deficit.  In the following year, the deficit was down to £773,000, and it progressively decreased until 1931-1932 when, for the first time, we had a surplus. Since then, we have had a surplus each year on the commercial side. We get that surplus by taking credit for the work done for all the other Departments of State.  I think we are entitled to do that.  But, so far as the actual cash position is concerned, there is a deficit of roughly £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>About that.  The actual position is that there is a cash deficit of in or about £100,000, although, as I say, as a Department we are strictly correct in claiming credit for the work we do for other Departments.  These are facts that have to be borne in mind. When there was a deficit up to the year 1931-1932 the taxpayer had to shoulder the burden, and now when we have a surplus on the commercial accounts I think people cannot say that we have not acted in a fairly generous way with that surplus.  Last year we had only a nominal surplus of £35,000, and that was the reason why I did not hold out any hope then that we would be able to do anything in the way of giving reductions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was insufficient, at any rate, to enable me to express any hope that we would be able to reduce charges this year.  I would not do so to-day if I did not feel quite sure that <Col N="308" /> we were in a position to do it.  When I expressed the opinion last year that, as a result of our policy I thought our financial position was going to improve, I did not think then that the improvement would come about as quickly as it has come.  As I remarked in my opening speech, the signs at present are that we will have a bigger surplus next year.</P>
      <P>I would like to give some figures as to the rates of pay for some of the classes referred to by Deputy Norton. I do not claim any credit for any of the concessions that were given to postal workers.  I told the Deputy on a few occasions here that I was not prepared to concede his claim.  I have already indicated that as things are until the position of the ordinary outside worker is improved&mdash;that the Deputy had not got a case.  Let me give some particulars.  Take Post Office clerks (male) Grade A in Class I Offices. Their maximum weekly payment is £5 0s. 9d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that is the maximum pay of Grade A clerks.  The maximum weekly payment of Grade B clerks in Class I Offices is £4 9s. 3d. Take Class II offices.  The maximum weekly payment for Grade A clerks is £4 13s. 1d.; for Grade B, £4 5s. 5d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not happen to have them with me.  I can say this much, however, without fear of contradiction, that they compare very favourably with any outside comparable work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Let Deputy Norton produce any comparable figures he likes. We have seen what he has alleged in <Col N="309" /> his statement of claim and we are quite satisfied that our rates compare favourably with them.  In the case of female clerks, Grade A, as regards Class I Office, the amount is £3 11s. 4d.; Class II Office, £3 7s. 6d., and Class III Office, £3 3s. 8d.  In the case of Post Office clerks, female, Grade B, the rate of pay is&mdash;Class I Office, £3 2s. 5d.; Class II Office, £2 18s. 7d., and Class III Office, £2 14s. 5d. In the case of postmen, Grade A, the pay is&mdash;Class I Office, £3 15s. 2d.; Class II Office, £3 10s. 9d., and Class III Office, £3 6s. 3d.  In the case of postmen, Grade B, the rates are&mdash;Class I Office, £3 3s. 8d.; Class II Office, £2 19s. 10d.; Class III Office, £2 14s. 5d.  In addition to that, they have, of course, regular employment and they have pension rights and also holidays. Although I would personally like to see them better, I am not prepared to ask the Minister for Finance or the Government to increase these rates until I see people in the country much worse off brought up to the same position.</P>
      <P>Auxiliary postmen are paid a maximum of 13.6d. per hour in Class I Office; in Class II Office, 12.8d. per hour, and Class III Office, 1/- per hour. That is the maximum.  I do not happen to have the minimum figures with me. Because I paid a tribute to the way the Post Office engineering staff did their work when the storm was on it was suggested that I was simply paying them a hollow tribute and that I did not mean it and the only way to show I meant it was to give them an increase.  Let me mention that the skilled workmen, Class I, are paid at the rate of £3 17s. 9d., and skilled workmen, Class II, are paid £3 5s. 0d.; labourers are paid £2 14s. 0d.  They did the extra work and they did it well.  I am glad to be in a position to pay them as high a tribute as I possibly can.  Whenever they worked overtime they were paid overtime rates, rates which compare well with outside rates.  I am not going to let these cases go by default any more. Deputy Norton need not expect that I am going to advise any great increase until I see the general level lifted up. That is my answer to this question.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  The fact is that there were several drops in the cost-of-living figure since we came into office and it has not come up to the same level as when we took over office.

      <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of the pay of postmen in Wexford.  There is an old classification applying in which Wexford is lower than Cobh and Bray.  It was established in 1908.  It was established by the British Administration and it has obtained ever since.  Deputy Norton referred to the cost of living in the different areas and Wexford does not happen to be in the same category as Cobh and Bray, in which the cost of living, on the report of the experts, was higher than in the Wexford area.  That is the reason for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rowlette has complained about the bad services since the War. That is explained by the fact that when we took over from the British the position was that there was a sum of £1,100,000 on the wrong side.  This country was not able to afford such services and we cannot afford now to restore them to what they were in the War period, because we believe that would put us back in the same position. I cannot hold out any hope of a restoration to anything like what the services were in those days.  Even an extra delivery in the city would cost an unreasonable amount&mdash;more than the service would be actually worth. We think the postal services, generally speaking, are fairly adequate&mdash;that is the Post Office opinion.  As regards the air mail, we have to pay exactly what we charge extra on air mail correspondence.  The matter is still under consideration with the British Air Office and we may have a more satisfactory arrangement shortly, but I cannot say definitely that we will.</P>

Deputy Costello raised a point in regard to Dun Laoghaire.  The officer appointed in that case was, in my opinion, the best possible man for that position.  I would say that the Deputy apparently did not get correct information. As regards the 6d. tax on the parcels, that was a revenue tax imposed by the Deputy's own Government and I do not think he has much grievance there.  If you want it off now, you evidently want us to do all the reducing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I cannot give the Deputy that information at the moment.  Now, as to the night service in small towns, it is very difficult to provide that now, but we hope, if not in the near future, at any rate as soon as possible, that by using these small automatic exchanges we may be able <Col N="313" /> to provide a night service, but from what we know of the probabilities of getting traffic in most country places, it certainly would not be justifiable to keep on a staff.  There might be only one or two calls in a night in such places, and in any case, as far as possible, the Civic Guards will always be glad to help people if they want to get a call through.  Most of the Civic Guard barracks are connected up, and they will facilitate people in that way. There is an arrangement with the Post Office to have that done.</P>
      <P>I could not understand Deputy MacMenamin's point at all.  I remember well the debate that took place when the 6d. was put on the telegrams, and all the country Deputies were insisting that this porterage question was a very big matter, but the telegraph service was losing very heavily, and it was simply a concession to the country districts to reduce that 6d. charge by one half.  I think that that will be admitted.  I think I can also claim that the extension of the free radius in telephone rentals, from one mile to three miles, is a concession to the country districts also.  We have already got a letter from one creamery in the country telling us that it means a difference of £20 a year in rent, and in addition will mean a farthing off for every local call. In trunk calls the local fee is dropped altogether in subscribers' trunk calls. Accordingly, I think that this concession really does benefit the country districts, and I feel sure that Deputy MacMenamin, if he thinks it over, will admit that that is a fact. That is, for the people who use telephones in the country.  For instance, if a person lives three miles from the exchange, under the old arrangement he would have to pay, say, £5 for the first mile, and the standard rental of £10 for each additional mile; that is, £25.  Now, if he is a private subscriber, he will only have to pay the £5, even if he is three miles from the exchange, and I think that that is a considerable concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton, of course, is still anxious about Pearse Street, and so am I.  I admit that I would not like to have to work in Pearse Street myself. I have said that time and again, and <Col N="314" /> I can assure Deputy Norton that the Department is as anxious to have the matter settled as, I am sure, he is.  I am afraid I was young at the time I said that we would have it finished by September.  I did not say it since. However, we hope to be able to get it done as soon as possible.  At any rate, the garage part of it will be proceeded with very soon, and everything that is possible to be done in the way of speeding up the work will be done.  Now, with regard to the part-time labour in the towns, I think that Deputy Norton will have to admit that we have done something to try to remedy that matter. In the year, ten of these part-time posts have been abolished in Dublin and the average wages of the 35 men still on part-time work have been increased by 10/- each.  I am anxious to eliminate all part-time work from towns if possible, but it is not as easy to do as Deputy Norton would lead one to believe.  If you try to better the service in the towns by giving an early delivery over an extended area, it means the employment of more men, and then if you have not got the same service in the evening time, you have got to pay the men for not working. Deputy Norton knows quite well that it is not easy to solve the problem, and he also knows that we are doing our best.  I do hope that by next year we will have a considerable advance in that direction.  Waterford, evidently, is the hardy annual, and we will have to try to do something about it.  I cannot say anything further on that matter at the moment.  I do not know that I have anything more to say in connection with this Vote.</P>

      <P>There is one point about which I should like some more information from the Minister.  In dealing with the point I raised about Wexford, he said that there was a difference in classification.  Of course, one knows that, but I want to know why there was a difference in classification.  There was a difference of 3/- a week up to the 21st September, and now the difference is 4/- Surely the Minister will concede <Col N="315" /> that the difference of 1/- would not matter so much.  Why is there this widening of the difference in classification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as I say, the claim was actually turned down.  The demand was for something like £260,000.  Minor adjustments were, however, considered warranted.  In the case of postmen Grade B, an increase of 1/- was given at the class of office which includes Dublin, Bray and Cobh.  An increase was not given in the class which includes Wexford.  I did not arrange this classification.  It has been there for 30 years.  It might not have been a good thing, but the whole cost-of-living basis was a matter of scientific arrangement, and I, certainly, am not prepared to say that the thing is not justified.  It may or it may not be justified, but I am not prepared to say whether it is or not.</P>

I think that this is a matter for special consideration, and that there should not have been a widening in the difference of classification.  I think that the Minister ought to consider the question of the 1/- and that he could still keep the difference of classification.  Would the Minister undertake to reconsider the matter?</P>
      <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £38,700 chun slánuithe na suime is gá <Col N="316" /> chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1937, chun na dTuarastal agus na gCostaisí eile a bhaineann le Fóirleatha Neashrangach (Uimh. 45 de 1926).</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £38,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
    <P>The amount of the Estimate for the broadcasting service for the year 1936-37 is £57,700 as compared with £40,838 for 1935-36 showing an increase of £16,862 mainly under sub-head F which provides for expenditure on plant and apparatus in connection with the projected increase in the power of the Athlone High Power Station.</P>
    <P>The revenue from wireless receiving licences last year amounted to about £42,500, showing an increase of about £8,500.</P>
    <P>Fees for advertisements and miscellaneous receipts amounted to about £24,000, which shows an increase of about £10,700 compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>The total broadcasting revenue amounted to £66,500.</P>
    <P>The direct expenditure on the broadcasting service out of all Votes last year amounted to about £50,000 so that revenue exceeded direct Vote expenditure by about £16,500.</P>
    <P>The number of wireless licences issued last year was 85,000 (approximately) which represents an increase of 18,800 over the previous year.  The number of licences in the current financial year may reach 100,000, showing an increase of about 15,000.  Special inspectors are employed throughout the country in detecting licence defaulters with very good results, and a large number of defaulters were prosecuted during the year.</P>
    <P>The revenue from licence fees in the year 1936-37 has been estimated at £50,000 and from advertisements at <Col N="317" /> £26,000, making total estimated revenue of £76,000.</P>
    <P>The direct Vote expenditure during the year is estimated at £69,208, showing an estimated surplus of £6,792.</P>
    <P>I have to explain, however, that no commercial account is prepared for broadcasting as for the Post Office and in considering total expenditure on the broadcasting service it is necessary in addition to the direct Vote expenditure to allow for capital charges in respect of cost of erection of stations, interest depreciation, etc., and if full allowance is made for these charges, broadcasting revenue would fall considerably short of broadcasting expenditure.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made to increase the power of the Athlone High Power Station from 60 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts, which is the maximum allowed under international regulations.  It is hoped to have the work completed before the end of 1936.</P>
    <P>1.  Programme hours have been extended during the past year by three and a half hours per week.</P>
    <P>2.  A beginning has been made in schools broadcasts.  In the light of the experience in countries which have spent considerable sums on broadcasts to schools, it is advisable to go slowly in this direction.  The subject is being considered with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>3.  The microphone has been brought to the rural areas, wherever suitable telephone trunk lines were available and it is intended to develop this method of finding talent outside the cities.  Some committees have been established informally, to offer suggestions for regional broadcasts.  This form of direct co-operation with listeners has not been attempted outside of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Eleven symphony concerts were breadcast in the season.  Five of these were Station productions; five were given by the Dublin Philharmonic Society and one was from University College, Cork.</P>
    <P>The total number of &ldquo;outside&rdquo; broadcasts in 1935 was 208.</P>
    <P>Broadcast debates were introduced last year and subjects of public interest were discussed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> The broadcasting organisation has assisted musical endeavour by broadcasting from concert halls.  It has in particular helped An Ceoil Cumann, which gives low-priced concerts in Dublin, and the Dublin Philharmonic Society.</P>
    <P>A feature of special importance and considerable educational value is the reconstruction in dramatic form of historical events&mdash;great moments in Irish history.</P>
    <P>Both of the important United States broadcasting chains&mdash;Columbia and N.B.C.&mdash;broadcast programmes from the Saorstát on the 16th and 17th March, 1936.</P>
    <P>I think I am justified in claiming that there has been a considerable all round improvement in the broadcasting programmes during the last financial year, and I can promise that every effort will be made to make further improvements in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The very reason the Minister gave us, when asking us to pass this Vote is, I suggest, a very good reason why the Vote should be referred back for reconsideration. First of all, I think in the circumstances something in the way of praise ought to be given to the management, or shall I say to the new director of the broadcasting station.  It is very useful to find that Ministers could discover at least one ordinary graduate to be proud of at a time when they are trying to get rid of University representation in this House altogether.  I think the director ought seriously to complain, and could justly complain, that all his efforts to put some life and interest and a little bit of novelty into a hopelessly inefficient station have been hampered because he has not enough finance in his hands allocated to that station.  We have a Broadcasting Vote which this year is up by £16,500, and amounts to £57,700 as compared with £40,838 in the previous year. The Minister received from licences £50,000, and receipts from advertising were about £26,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that at the time taxation was first put on wireless apparatus and wireless parts coming into this <Col N="319" /> country, a definite pledge was given, and was repeated, that the money derived from that particular taxation would go to the improvement of the entertainment for listeners-in.  Will anyone say that when we have over £50,000 from 85,000 listeners, and when we are getting nearly £26,000 from advertising, we have that improvement of the entertainment which we should have?  I doubt if that is the full tot. It does not include the money got from this same development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The money coming into the station should be double or more than double.  If there was more money available, as there should be, is there any doubt that better entertainment would be given to the people subscribing to the station?  I may say that, having previously remarked that I think the new director has done a great amount of meritorious work in improving the station, and that if he has not been a greater success, that is due, on the face of it, to the fact that he does not get enough money.  I do not think anybody, no matter how patriotically inclined, could honestly and conscientiously say that the station in this country compares at all favourably with any of the other big stations.  I am as inclined as anybody to listen-in when there is anything broadcasted from this country and which gives native talent an opportunity of developing itself, but I find myself more and more tuning away in disgust from what is put on.  I do not think that we get the benefit of any of that extra £88,000 from broadcasting taxation.  I do not think there is any <Col N="320" /> proper consciousness of the value, both for good and bad, of what is broadcasted night after night, or whether what is allowed to be sent out is an advertisement for the Irish station.</P>
      <P>I, personally, believe there is much more talent in the country than what has been discovered, and the reason that the director is not thinking about getting it, as he would like to get it, is because he is conscious of the fact that he has no means of inducing people to come forward to offer their services.  There is much highly-specialised talent awaiting exploitation, not only for the good of that talent, but, also, for the good of the country generally.  We get no advertisement from that because the director is cribbed, cabined and confined in his attempt to do good by the fact that he is deprived of the money promised to the station from the taxation of wireless parts coming in.  If it was for no reason other than to call attention to the fact that the station is starved, I think this Estimate should be referred back for further consideration.  That motion should be agreed to by anybody who will take a course of listening-in night after night, then switching off at random to anywhere else and seeing whether he can really support a vote of any confidence in the station after a comparison in a lengthy course of a month, or two or three months with a group of other stations.  The Minister referred&mdash;I do not know whether it was because he thought it was a new item or that he was proud of it&mdash;to what he called great moments in Irish history. Are these the great escapes from jails? These are part of it, I suppose.  There was novelty in one or two of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You should not refer to those.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are events which I must refer to, because they were no tribute to the ingenuity of the person who thought of them, and no tribute to the imagination of the person who continued them.  There was a spice of novelty about the first one or two, but the novelty was somewhat spoilt when you opened the newspaper the next morning and found a few people writing in to say &ldquo;I had a whole lot to do with it, and my name <Col N="321" /> was never mentioned.&rdquo;  The men who had, so to speak, done good for the country by stealth, blushed the next day to find their deeds broadcast, while others who wanted them broadcast found that it had only given rise to newspaper controversy as to whether they did anything at all or not.  I do not know if that is to be found under the heading of &ldquo;Great Moments in Irish History.&rdquo;  There are some moments in most peoples' lives, and I suppose also in the life of the nation, which are better forgotten.  Those things might have been expressed and presented in a different way; there might have been something spicy and attractive about them; there might have been something that would lure the ordinary listener-in to listen-in again; but certainly after one or two had been given in a particular way, why they were persevered in passes my comprehension.  Of course, to recreate events of that kind was an almost impossible task, except for people of terrific imaginative powers, and a certain amount of delicacy in self suppression.  I do not know why anybody should ever have thought of entrusting to the people to whom it was entrusted, the matter of trying to recreate a night out with or in attendance on some flying column or brigade in Tipperary or elsewhere, which might have been made a good thing of if properly done.  Could anybody who listened-in, except perhaps the immediate relatives of two or three people who were themselves interested, have felt that it was something that he would have brought a stranger or an alien to listen-in to, and that he could have sat in his own house while that was being poured forth and been easy in his conscience or his mind about the whole thing.  However, those are, so to speak, minor matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I complain of mainly about the station is that at the moment it is being used as an instrument in politics. The station and its political uses have gone to a point that has probably not been excelled anywhere except in Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany.  Of course, there is a variety of ways in which it operates.  I am amazed at times when I hear some of the things put up there under Government <Col N="322" /> auspices.  I know there must have been a battle-royal between the sort of silencing effects of the Government Publicity Bureau and the sort of natural tendency to talk about something which must attach to a person in a broadcasting station.  There is, on the one hand, the method of suppressing things via the Government Publicity Bureau, and, on the other hand, there is the giving out of information, with a difference, through the station.  I wonder will the Minister accept it or will he require examples when I make the statement that a considerable amount of censorship goes on with regard to items that are broadcast by people who are asked to deliver lectures on important matters, people who are asked to present their views about a variety of subjects to the country through the medium of the broadcasting station.  Does the Minister know or does he agree that anything which is said is subject to quite a severe and rigid type of censorship?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A censorship might, of course, be easily tolerable with regard to say, preventing the broadcasting of matters that would shock the public taste.  If anybody would ever think of stooping to such a thing as obscenity over the air, that has to be guarded against, and there is nothing to complain of in the director seeing the manuscript of what is going to be said.  But does the Minister know that views which are about to be expressed by individuals who have been invited to give, say, their experience in different places, or their theories about different matters are subject to a censorship which operates in a variety of peculiar ways?  May I say also that I think there is more than one hand at the censorship? Sometimes an unfortunate person who is to broadcast thinks he is free when he has escaped from one person, only to find that there is another individual who lops off some of his sentences, destroys some of his theories, and disturbs some of his thoughts.  The way it operates, I understand, even as between individuals, is that in some cases people have their manuscripts <Col N="323" /> returned to them with what are called suggestions.  Of course if the suggestions are not accepted there is another way of handling that.  At other times the manuscripts are rewritten.  Of course the writing is only a suggestion again, but if any person has the hardihood to go down to the station intending to say over the air what he has previously written, he finds that just as he goes before the microphone there is put into his hands a document which is part of his own manuscript with part blotted out and he has got to extemporise in order to fill the gap. That is not rewriting but, at any rate, it is definitely made clear that such and such a sentence is not going to be tolerated, and you can make up whatever you like to fill the gap.  Sometimes the manuscript is rewritten.  The Minister has admitted that there is censorship&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of what I know.  I thought the Minister might have sufficient knowledge of the principles on which he is trying to operate the broadcasting station to let me know off-hand whether he thinks it proper to censor people who are invited to speak.  Is it proper that they should find their manuscripts scored and their thoughts distorted and warped by comment and sometimes by counter-suggestion?  We find during the year that it is a growing feature of the wireless programme in the country that all sorts of persons, distinguished and otherwise, are made to mount the stairs, go into the room, <Col N="324" /> and lecture this country on how well it is getting on.  I suppose there never was such a variety of American accents as we had this year telling us how lucky we were to be in this country and not in the United States of America.  We had all sorts of city folk, as they described themselves, telling the farmers of this country that they never were better off.  Recently here on St. Patrick's Day, in answer to the President, Archbishop Mannix told us&mdash;it is only hearsay, of course&mdash; that they were glad to know that the standard of living of the masses in this country had been raised.  I am sure that on the day when that particular sentence smote the ear of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he must have groaned, because at that time he must have been preparing the elaborate defence which he gave us a few minutes ago, when he said that the reason why the standards of the Post Office workers had not been raised was that the masses of the people could not have their standard raised.  Yet Archbishop Mannix told us from far-off Australia that they were glad the standard of living of the masses had been raised.  I should like him to go out and broadcast that in person to the masses, and see would he get just as enthusiastic a reception as, at the far end of the wireless, he thinks he gets. That was only the climax to what went on continuously through the summer and autumn.  The least known of the people who were able to come here under the auspices of the Tourist Development Association, after having a quick run round the island of from ten days to three weeks, spent one very valuable half-hour or so of that very short period to let the people of this country who are living through all the mess know that they are in some way mesmerised if they think they are doing badly, and that if they only knew what these people knew from knocking around in tourist coaches they would be able to bear the ills the Lord has sent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it a fact that these people were chosen because their views had been ascertained beforehand or how were these people selected?  Were the names put in a hat?  As my mind runs <Col N="325" /> back over the four or five people, I do not see any reason why they should have been invited to speak even in a fast-moving tram-car not to speak of broadcasting.  They were in no way distinguished, did not mark themselves out as economic experts, and had played no part in the economic life of their own country that one can hear of.  They certainly had not such a recent attachment to this country as to enable them to speak with any experience.  It seems to me strange that all the people chosen, as they went into the doorway or mounted the stairs of the broadcasting station, were seemingly seized straight away with the terrific idea of the pleasure of living here with the raised standard of living.  There was not a soul invited to broadcast who had not found it the pleasantest of all places to live in.  I do not think that was an ordinary selection.  I do not think it was a selection except by a peculiar choice. Does the Minister think, however much he may want to develop through the people of the country the idea that they are doing so well, that it is good policy to have the station used for that sort of thing?</P>
    <P>We are used to the activities of certain people and know how to rate the activities of those people who, after a fortnight here, cannot keep themselves from writing to the newspapers. Most of the newspapers willingly give a couple of columns of vacant space to these people.  They rather invite them, in fact.  Of course, letters lead to counter letters and sometimes there are debates, and sometimes controversy.  At any rate, there has been, as far as the newspapers are concerned, something in the way of an interchange of views. But, as far as the station is concerned, everybody who goes in seems to be moulded immediately into this tremendous optimism.  As I say, I should like to have some idea whether the censorship is working in a new way there and whether people have been rejected, not part of their thoughts abstracted from manuscripts, but have been rejected <i>in toto</i> because it was found that they were not going to give the stuff the Minister more or less feels he is paid to get given out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> That is one side of it.  Then there is another matter.  It seems to me to be an incredible thing, but it has been remarked on so much to me by people that I must take it as a definite fact until I get an explanation.  I do not know if it is pettiness, or if it occurred at all.  I am inclined to think it is incredible.  I do not know, but if it is a fact, what is the explanation?  It seems to me so petty that I hardly like to say that there is anything like political significance attached to it. There was a show here at which there was a particular animal, bred by, I will call him a very distinguished individual of this country which got the maximum price at the show.  The broadcast that night gave a lot of prices and never mentioned this animal although it was the best there. I wonder is it a fact that it was not broadcast?  I have been told it was not.  It has been remarked upon to me by dozens of people.  I did not listen-in that night myself.  If that is a fact, is it not the pettiest of petty spite that a matter like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Really, Deputies opposite have very little belief in themselves. If it had happened, it was only to be related to what I call the general politics of the situation.  The whole explanation the Minister had to offer with regard to what he called Deputy Norton's propaganda on the last Vote was that until outside people are raised to a particular level he is not going to raise the Post Office workers. He said he would not ask the Minister for Finance to increase the wages of the low grade Post Office employees until people outside are getting as much as these low grade employees.</P>

      <P>Not by any means, any more than I think we should be frightened of mentioning anything else <Col N="328" /> that is broadcast.  The President said that only he was in a weak position he would not have made a certain bargain. He told us before that certain moneys were being extracted with more dislocation than if they were paid straight away.  Was there any appreciation on the part of anybody who listened to the St. Patrick's Day broadcast that it had been stated by the President that we were in a weakened condition?  If anybody is afraid to talk about the pact, let us not say why we are in a weakened position, but let us say that that statement was made authoritatively here by the President.</P>
      <P>What was the use made of the air as far as this country's President was in control of it on St. Patrick's Day? Everything was lovely.  The Minister told us to-night that it was not.  Archbishop Mannix, after hearing the President, wires back: &ldquo;Was glad to hear that the standard of living of the masses of the people had been raised.&rdquo; The President did not tell us that beforehand, and the Minister denies it to-night.  In addition to that, the President decided that part of his St. Patrick's Day performance must be the thrusting on the eyes of the world of the economic war.  If people are engaged in a conflict with their neighbours, I do not see the necessity of letting the world know about it on a special occasion like that.  There were three relays being made that day, not entirely on that subject.  The President added a statement which one of his own Ministers previously denied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission to-day at Question time, I gave notice that I would raise the matter of the very unsatisfactory reply which was given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands to the question which I put to him relating <Col N="329" /> to the division of a farm of land in the Country Mayo.  The facts will show that there is very little room for dispute or for justification for the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude.  He certainly did not attempt any justification and I do not see how he can attempt it to-night.  The facts are these:&mdash;Certain lands at a place called Brize, situate between Claremorris and Balla, in the County Mayo, were taken over compulsorily by the Irish Land Commission.  It was on the property of Senator MacEllin and another.</P>
      <P>To begin with, the Land Commission proceeded to act in a perfectly right, justifiable and proper fashion, and they did act in a proper fashion and justifiable fashion.  That, however, did not please certain persons.  The original plan was completely and entirely upset. Around these lands there are various townlands upon which there are people living upon small holdings of land. There are two townlands, one of them called Coolaghbawn and the other Derrowel.  The original plan of the Land Commission was to take two men, one from each of these two townlands. These two men had each in these townlands a small holding of land.  The two men are the men whom I mentioned in my question to-day. One man is Lavin of Coolaghbawn, and the other is Higgins of Derrowel. These men were appointed by the inspectors of the Land Commission, and holdings were to be allotted to them in exchange for holdings which they were surrendering.  They actually signed, as I was informed, purchase agreements.  The fact that they signed purchase agreements was denied by the Parliamentary Secretary to-day.  But having regard to the answers which were made to me yesterday, completely contradicting the previous answers which had been given, I am afraid that the Parliamentary Secretary is not always supplied with correct information when he is answering questions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I prefer to believe the information that I have received&mdash;that these men were not only appointed to these holdings, but that they actually signed purchase agreements for them.  Suddenly the whole thing was upset.  Why? That is what I would like the Parliamentary <Col N="330" /> Secretary to explain.  What occurred?  What underhand influence was at work?  I want to know when quite a proper scheme is arranged by the Land Commission officials, how it can be completely set aside?  What happened?  Five unmarried young men from the neighbourhood are given part of these lands.  These men are not even owners of holdings of land.  They are merely, at the best, farmers' sons. These are the men who are selected and given five holdings on these particular lands.  They are unmarried young men with no ties to bind them to this country.  They can put up the holdings for sale to-morrow, put the purchase money in their pocket and clear away.  Yet these men are selected by the Parliamentary Secretary as being fit and proper persons to receive land to the detriment of small holders in the neighbourhood whom the Land Commission officials had known to be fit and proper persons, and who obviously were fit and proper persons to receive part of these farms of land.</P>
    <P>How were these men selected?  What particular file and on what grounds did the Parliamentary Secretary pick them?  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is aware that one of these men is not a farmer at all?  He may be a farmer's son.  He had been manager of a co-operative store which got burned, and then I understand he was doing some clerical work in the county council offices.  He is one of the men selected to get a holding of land while the congests and small-holders around are not given any portion. I have dealt with the two townlands of Coolaghbawn and Derrowel. The congests there naturally expected and were entitled to expect that when a large farm in their neighbourhood had been broken up, they would receive additions to their own lands.  Or else they expected that, by the transmigration of their neighbours to other land, the neighbours' land would be divided between them.  Anyhow these men did not receive any benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another townland also in that neighbourhood called Knocknakill. That is a townland in which there is very little arable land indeed, so much so that the inhabitants have been for <Col N="331" /> years past in the habit of going outside and buying con-acre on the larger farms about them.  When these large farms had been acquired and broken up the small-holders in Knocknakill might reasonably expect to receive portions of tillage land so that their farms could be properly balanced and properly worked.  But these people are not going to receive a perch of these tillage lands.  The Parliamentary Secretary has arbitrarily selected instead five young men with no claims to these townlands.  They are given these holdings because they are special favourites of some individuals who can bring influence to bear on the Parliamentary Secretary.  That seems to me to be the only possible explanation of how the original sound plan provided by the Land Commission was set aside.</P>
    <P>I cannot digress into other matters which I have already raised on the adjournment here.  But I point this out as cumulative to the other matters I have raised as to the distribution of land in the County Mayo.  It is the primary duty of the Land Commission under the Statute which this House has passed, the Land Act of 1933, to relieve congestion.  That is the primary idea which underlies the whole of our land code now.  It is the main principle which has been accepted by every Party in this State.  It was a principle that was accepted before there was self-government here.  The policy of the old Congested Districts Board for dealing with congestion was to acquire large farms for the purpose of relieving the congests.</P>
    <P>Now we discover the Parliamentary Secretary acting&mdash;I will go no further than this&mdash;with very doubtful legality, and certainly acting against the entire spirit of the land code, and proceeding to choose haphazard individuals who are landless, who are unmarried and who have no claims at all upon this land.  I should like to know what his explanations are.  I am perfectly aware that, as he stated to-day, two workmen who were working on this farm received land.  So far as that is concerned, I am not raising any question. It was correct and proper and <Col N="332" /> that must have been in the original plan drafted by the local officers. What I do object to, and what, in my judgment, amounts to a scandalous misuse of the powers of the Land Commission, is this giving of these holdings of land to these five unmarried young men and leaving the men who are living in the vicinity, who are looking forward to getting portions of this land and endeavouring to rear their families and to support themselves and their families as best they can out of their small holdings, without land. It is an abuse of power, not merely against the spirit, but, in my opinion, against the very letter of the Land Acts, and I am anxious to hear how the Parliamentary Secretary will justify, or should I say, attempt to justify, this very extraordinary and highly improper proceeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a few questions which I hope he will answer when replying.  He is aware that the Irish Land Commission agreed with Thomas Lavan, Coolaghbawn, and Thomas Higgins, Derrowel, to give them new holdings on the MacEllin farm at Barneygreggaun, Claremorris, in exchange for their existing holdings, which then would be divided among their neighbours, and that agreements were signed by these men last August. These men were then told to be ready to migrate early in the new year. They have incurred considerable expense in making preparations for moving into the new holdings.  Will the Land Commission now come to their rescue and defray the costs and expenses incurred by these men?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that acute congestion exists in the townlands of Coolaghbawn and Derrowel from which these men were about to be migrated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he know that there are a large number of tenants with large families whose valuations are under £7 living in those villages, who were looking forward to getting additions to their holdings out of the lands to be surrendered by Messrs.  Lavan and Higgins, and will he have the provisional scheme for division referred back to <Col N="333" /> the Land Commission?  He must now be aware of the number of petitions that were forwarded to the Land Commission from the townlands of Knocknakill, Facefield, and other townlands adjoining the MacEllin farm requesting additions to their holdings, as their holdings cannot be cultivated on account of the rocky surface of that area.  Perhaps he will tell us if it is the Land Commission or the Department of Justice is paying the Civic Guards for watching those lands since they were divided.  I mentioned in this House when we protested against the action of the Land Commission in giving land to a dispensary doctor in Hollymount and to two school teachers that if we were going to have a recurrence of agrarian crime in County Mayo the Land Commission and the Government would be responsible. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House the number of grazing ranches in South Mayo now under police protection due to the failure of the Land Commission to do its duty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that. The Parliamentary Secretary must be very well aware that petitions were sent from all these townlands in the vicinity of the MacEllin farm during the last year.  Promises were held out to those people by the Land Commission inspector who went there that they would, first of all, see that only tenants with large families, who would be in a position to give up large tracts of land in the vicinity, which would be afterwards divided amongst the congests in that area would be migrated.  He knows very well that that has been happening for some time, and I think it is nearly time the Parliamentary Secretary took some action against the Land Commission so that there will not be a recurrence of what happened in Hollymount six or eight months ago. He must also know from the Department of Justice that the Civic Guards are on those lands ever since the Land Commission divided them and, as I said <Col N="334" /> before, you are going to have a recurrence of agrarian crime if the Land Commission continues that class of work in Mayo or in any other county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate at all, but, on account of certain statements made and certain impressions that may have been created, it might be well if I said something.  I want it to be understood that I have nothing to do with this land division beyond this fact &mdash;and I do not run away from it&mdash;that I gave a recommendation to one man who did get land, as I am quite aware that it has been the custom of the Land Commission for the past year at least to give land to landless men in Tipperary, the midlands and other portions of the Free State.  The man to whom Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney refers came to me, and I gave him a recommendation for land, as I was aware that he had a fair amount of capital. I want that clearly understood.  I was as much against giving land to any of the other landless men who got land in Brize as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Nally.  I will go further and say that I supported the application of Higgins for land in MacEllin's farm at Brize, because the people of that district made representations to me that the bringing out of Higgins would relieve a considerable number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give me and the other Mayo Deputies a guarantee that what has been done in Brize will not be continued in Mayo. I am not against the principle of giving land to landless men where land is available, but it is not available in County Mayo, and if this practice is continued, I agree with Deputy Nally that it will give rise to trouble, and serious trouble.  I therefore appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to bring his influence to bear against continuing the practice, as it will mean the creation of a very serious situation in the county.  This has created considerable trouble, and what Deputy Nally says is true.  The Civic Guards are there and will probably have to continue there. It has created a very ugly situation, and if there is any method, within the powers of the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="335" /> or the Land Commission, of righting the matter, I appeal to them to do so.</P>

      <P>As usual, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney tries to make political capital out of every case he raises here, and especially in connection with land division.  That particular Deputy knows, at least as well as any other Deputy or any person in this country, that the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, for that matter, has no right to interfere in the determination of allottees in the case of any lands which are to be divided.  As a matter of fact, for the first time in the Land Act of 1933, the Minister took special care to divest himself of any such powers or of any right of interference with the decision of the commissioners.  I shall not deal further with the ugly insinuations and allegations of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to these alleged purchase agreements signed by the two tenants to whom the Deputy had referred, Messrs. Lavan and Higgins, no purchase agreements were signed. Undertakings to migrate were signed at the instigation of the local inspector but when the commissioners came to peruse the scheme, they, in their wisdom, decided that other allocations of the land should be made.  As I have stated, it was not a matter in which either the Minister or myself could possibly interfere.  The Deputy and Deputy Nally referred to a townland called Knocknakill from which a petition had been submitted to the Land Commission on behalf of the congests there.  I have before me a list of these congests or, rather, to be more accurate, of these tenants.  The first of these is John Barnicle, whose valuation is £20 18s. 0d.  The list goes on: Thomas Ruane, valuation £19 15s. 0d.; John Reilly, valuation £15 0s. 0d.; <Col N="336" /> Thomas Lavin, valuation £15 15s. 0d.; James Biesty, valuation £16 5s. 0d.; Michael Higgins, valuation £16 0s. 0d.; Michael Tuohy, valuation £15 10s. 0d.; Pat Kilcourse, valuation £18 2s. 0d.; John Conlon, valuation £17 14s. 0d.; Robert Quinn, valuation £16 15s. 0d.; Edward Goodwin, valuation £15 0s. 0d.; John Moran, valuation £17 15s. 0d.</P>

I did not have time to look up the details in regard to the other townlands.  It would be well nigh impossible to give a list of all the applicants in the time at my disposal. There were 27 applications altogether, <Col N="337" /> some of them from persons living 50 miles distant from the land.  It could be argued, and reasonably argued, that it would be perhaps wiser to migrate one or two of the tenants and to divide their holdings amongst others.  I agree that that argument is sound but the Commissioners in their wisdom decided otherwise.  Perhaps if I had the decision I would not decide the matter in that way.  Deputy Walsh has expressed views which coincide with those of the Opposition Deputies.  All I can say in response to Deputy Walsh's suggestion is that I shall have the matter brought to the notice of the Commissioners with a view to having that point considered. <Col N="338" /> Beyond that I cannot go.  I have no power to dictate to the Commissioners what their decision should be.  These powers, whether wisely or unwisely, were taken from the Minister under the 1933 Act and no Deputy in the House knows that better than the Deputy who raised this question.</P>
