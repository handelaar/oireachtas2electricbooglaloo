      <P>An applicant's wife may not be admitted as a dependent within the meaning of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, if she works regularly for wages or other remuneration. The fact that she was in receipt of sickness benefit would suggest that she works regularly for wages, as otherwise contributions entitling here to such benefit would not have been paid. The question as to who is a dependent within the meaning of the Unemployment Assistance Acts is one for determination in the first instance by an unemployment assistance officer.  Any applicant aggrieved by the determination of such officer has the statutory right of appeal to the Court of Referces and, in certain circumstances, a further right of appeal to the Umpire.  I do not propose to give instructions to the Department in regard to this matter, which would be contrary to the meaning of the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

Is it not true also that his increase of the maize meal mixture content of home-grown grain to 50 per cent. has resulted in such an advance in the price of the maize meal mixture that the sales of that commodity have dwindled to almost nothing and that, as a result thereof, the ability of the maize meal mixture to absorb home-grown grain has virtually ceased; and, in view of these facts and of the fact that the Minister himself holds that it takes 6 cwts. of meal to fatten a pig, will he relieve the pig producers of this country of the burden of 18/- per pig which they are at present paying in view of the maize meal mixture scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="610" /> I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the provisions of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, until the 31st March, 1937.  It will be remembered that the Act of 1929 became law on the 20th December, 1929.  It was to continue in operation until the 31st March, 1931.  The Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1931, extended the operation of the Act of 1929 for a further period of five years.  That period expires on the 31st March, 1936.</P>
      <P>The main provision of the Act of 1929 is that it empowers the three local authorities in Dublin City and County to assist able-bodied persons outside of the workhouse or, in other words, to give them home assistance.  The necessity for this provision arises from the fact that a scheme in pursuance of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, for the abolition of poor law unions was never brought into operation in Dublin City and County.  Had such a scheme been introduced the restrictions on outdoor relief imposed by the Poor Relief Acts would have been removed and it would have been possible to grant home assistance to any person unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide for himself or his dependents the necessities of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the question of adopting a scheme for Dublin City and County was under consideration some years ago.  It was not possible to get the authorities concerned to agree to adopt a joint scheme for the city and county, and the project was abandoned. In the absence of a scheme under the Act of 1923, the only means of bringing the city and county into line with the rest of the country as regards home assistance was legislation.  The legislation was necessarily temporary in view of the proposal to make comprehensive provision for public assistance in the whole country.  It has not yet been possible to have permanent legislation enacted.  As stated in the memorandum circulated in connection with the Expiring Laws Bill, a permanent measure to supersede the temporary legislation is at present under consideration and will be introduced shortly.  Meantime it is thought well <Col N="611" /> to continue the provisions of the Act of 1929 for another year so that the authorities concerned may be able to assist the classes to which it applied without requiring them to enter the workhouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that this Act is being extended only for another year because other legislation will be introduced in the meantime that will take the place of this Act and no doubt take the places of other Acts before the year, contemplated as an extension under this Bill, is finished.  The present occasion, however, provides an opportunity that should be availed of to make some remarks in regard to relief in the City of Dublin and to show to what extent the unemployment assistance scheme has been made a real swindle on the ratepayers in the City of Dublin. There was a very considerable amount of talk from the Ministerial Benches at the time the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced as to the great relief that would be afforded local authorities in the City of Dublin by that Act but, so far from its being any relief to the local authority, it has piled on additional burdens on the ratepayers of the city as if the workers, the employers and the citizens of Dublin as ratepayers were not also paying considerable sums towards the general work of relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the assistance of the able-bodied in the City of Dublin was given solely under the Outdoor Relief Act of 1929, for the year ended March, 1932, the total amount of expenditure from the rates was £111,900.  Again, in the year ended March, 1933, when the relief of the able-bodied was provided entirely from the rates, the amount paid out of the city rates was £125,000. The year ended March, 1934, saw some of the developments in unemployment in the city which arose out of the general policy of the Government and the fact that such a large amount of national income had been lost through the reactions of Government policy on the agricultural industry.  The total amount provided for relief of the able-bodied from the rates rose from £125,800 in the previous year to £173,000 in the year ended March, <Col N="612" /> 1935.  In the following year the unemployment assistance scheme began to operate.</P>
    <P>What is the position for the coming year?  The position in the coming year is that the ratepayers of the city have to provide, through the rates, a sum of £41,000 towards the relief of the able-bodied.  As well as that they have to provide a lump sum equivalent to 1/6 in the £ towards the maintenance of the unemployment assistance scheme. In order to provide the Government with the produce of that 1/6 in the £, a sum equivalent to 1/8 in the £ has to be levied on the City of Dublin so as to provide for the cost of collection and other incidentals in addition to the sum which has to be contributed towards the unemployment assistance scheme.  A penny in the £ on the City of Dublin realises £7,500.  The amount realised by that rate of 1/8 in the £ is, therefore, £150,000 and, in addition, the ratepayers have to pay £41,000 directly for relief.  The total bill to be paid by the ratepayers of the City of Dublin for the coming year is, therefore, £191,000 or nearly £20,000 more than they paid for outdoor relief in the city before the Unemployment Assistance Act was ever introduced. If that is not a swindle on the ratepayers of the City of Dublin, I do not know what would be.  Instead of bringing relief to the ratepayers, this huge amount of more than £190,000 is going to be paid from the rates in the city towards the general scheme of unemployment assistance and relief to able-bodied persons during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin provides, as I have said before, additional contributions by workers and by employers, and additional imposts on the general taxes of the country, in order to keep up the position of relief.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary where that peculiar circle is going to end, of a rising cost in the rates, in spite of the Unemployment Assistance Act and considerably rising figures in unemployment.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will take the trouble of looking at the records of the Dublin Board of Assistance for the last few weeks, he will see that, for the eight weeks ending 18th January last, compared with the eight weeks <Col N="613" /> immediately preceding, the cost of assistance to the able-bodied has risen by an average of £127 a week.  In the period of eight weeks we have just passed, compared with the similar period of eight weeks in the year before, the cost of relief, through the rates, to the able-bodied in the City of Dublin has risen by 21 per cent.  If he takes the actual position on 18th January last, he will find that whereas 1,552 men were assisted last year, 2,046 had to be assisted this year in that particular week, commencing 18th January, 1936.  That is, 494 additional cases of men had to be assisted from the rates in that week as compared with the same week last year.</P>
    <P>In the case of women, there is an increase of 317 cases in the same period, from 1,453 to 1,760.  The percentage increase in the number of cases that had to be dealt with that week as compared with the same week last year is 26.5.  The citizens of Dublin expect to know where they stand with regard to a continuance of this increasing burden.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was kind enough to warn industrialists in Killarney the other day that, as time went on, they would have to shoulder increasing burdens in order to provide the cost of government, according as the Customs duties fell.  We ought to be told in Dublin, at the beginning of 1936, how long we are going to have a continued rise in the total number of unemployed in the city and a continued rise in the amount of money that has to be taken from the ratepayers in order to give those unemployed people some kind of relief, because if the position, from the viewpoint of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is that industry will have to bear increasing burdens in the future to pay for the cost of government, it is nearly time we took stock of the general situation, in the interests both of the ratepayers who have to provide the money and the people who are unemployed at present and who have to be relieved.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter that calls for very close consideration, and for very close co-operation between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for <Col N="614" /> Industry and Commerce.  Recently, in Dublin, unemployment assistance had been withdrawn from a certain number of men.  They have been given relief work, but that relief work has been of a spasmodic and desultory kind.  Take the case of a man who, because he was an army reservist, with a wife and eight children, got only 16/- through the unemployment assistance scheme and 6/- from the rates.  He was denied unemployment assistance and was put on work.  He was delighted to get the work, and he would be delighted to get 28/- a week for doing three days' work if he could get it, but he did not get it.  He was removed from the operation of unemployment assistance and was put on work, but the work gives him three days' payment one week, two days' payment in another, and two days' payment in another.  The result was that between the withdrawal of unemployment assistance and the withdrawal of relief he found himself worse off when he was working than when he was idle.  The case had to be retaken up by the Home Assistance people in the City of Dublin and dealt with as an urgent case.</P>
    <P>It is only a sample of what is going on in the city, and the Minister for Local Government should demand and get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce much more co-operation in dealing with whatever relief schemes are going to be instituted in Dublin to substitute unemployment assistance than he has been getting in the past, and particularly than he has been getting for the last few weeks, because it seems to be nobody's business.  An arbitrary decision is taken that unemployment assistance is to be stopped and that there is work to be got, but nobody has any concern for the man and his wife and their expectations of income.  Very great hardship can be caused in cases like that, and very great bitterness of feeling amongst men who gladly turn aside from the getting of unemployment assistance to work, and who find that they are being fooled in the matter of work and deprived of the income they expected.</P>
    <P>Very urgent and very important questions require to be discussed in connection with it, and I think the <Col N="615" /> Parliamentary Secretary should tell the House what he has to say at this stage of the Bill on the points I have raised.  Before the Bill passes through the House, the House should have an opportunity of hearing from the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister a more detailed statement than has been given of the general position with regard to our expectation in respect of the employment to be given to replace the unemployment assistance scheme here, what hopes the ratepayers of the City of Dublin can have that this huge burden of rates is going to fall instead of rise week by week, and what hope the people who are paying these large sums in rates have to seeing the large number of unemployed in the city decreased.</P>

      <P>I do not care to complain about a generous application of the Standing Orders, but it seems to me that Deputy Mulcahy has wandered over a rather wide field.

      <P>The Deputy knows, perhaps better than many people in this House, that it is not so easy to fool the ratepayers in Dublin as some people imagine.  The Deputy himself has had a long experience of trying to <Col N="616" /> fool them, and to an extent, I think, he must agree that he has been found out.  He has quoted figures showing the number of able-bodied unemployed at certain periods in recent weeks.  He naturally selected such figures as would bear out the impression that he wished to convey.</P>

      <P>I have figures before me dealing with this matter for the quarters ending March, June, September and December, 1931, and for the corresponding periods in the year 1935.  In 1931 Deputy Mulcahy was himself Minister for Local Government, and the Party opposite were responsible for administering the affairs of this Twenty-Six County area.  I find that in December, 1931, there were 3,052 able-bodied persons in receipt of home assistance, and that in December, 1935, the number was 1,202.  Now, I think that these figures are correct, and it seems to me that, if we have succeeded in reducing the figures by over 100 per cent., we have nothing whatever to apologise for either to this House or to the country in general.</P>

I, at any rate, find it hard to convince myself that there is not a certain amount of hypocrisy about their whole approach to the unemployment problem and their whole approach to our social services. They encourage the Government to spend lavishly on our social services, and then immediately when an increase in taxation is necessary in order to provide additional social services, they go down the country and make all the political propaganda that they possibly can out of that.</P>

      <P>Under the Principal Act &mdash;the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929&mdash; the local authorities are given power to organise schemes to provide work for, and to absorb, the unemployed.  Now very little has been done under that heading, and if Deputy Mulcahy has not changed his view since he was Minister for Local Government in 1931 when he was piloting a measure such as this through the House, he will agree now, as he agreed then, that the local authorities are very suitable bodies &mdash; well-equipped and well-informed&mdash;for dealing with this problem, and for putting up schemes that would assist in absorbing the able-bodied unemployed on their home assistance books.  The fact is that practically nothing has been done under that heading, and I am quite sure that Deputy Mulcahy is still of the opinion that the local authorities could make some kind of a more practical and effective contribution towards the solution of this problem than they have been making.</P>

I would like him also to explain the figures he has quoted which I am not prepared to controvert at the moment.

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the National Health Insurance and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill. The matters dealt with in the Bill are four in number and I shall refer to them in the order in which they occur in the Bill as drafted, though that is not necessarily the order of their importance.  The four matters are:</P>
      <P>(1)  An amendment of Section 17 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1923, so far as it refers to the insurability of seamen;</P>
      <P>(2)  the constitution of the committee of management of Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte;</P>
      <P>(3)  the position of soldiers under both the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and</P>
      <P>(4)  the recovery from employers of contributory pensions lost owing to their default.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Amendment of Section 17 of the National Health Insurance Act</i>, 1923.&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 (1) (d) of the Act of 1923 empowers the Minister to enter into reciprocal arrangements with the British Ministry of Health with a view to determining whether, in the case of a ship registered in the Irish Free State or Great Britain (including Northern Ireland) the owner of which resides or has his principal place of business in Great Britain or the Irish Free State, as the case may be, health insurance contributions payable in respect of the persons employed on the ship are to be paid under the Acts in their application to the country in which the ship is registered, or under <Col N="621" /> the Acts in their application to the country in which the owner resides or has his principal place of business.  In 1924, reciprocal arrangements were entered into between the two countries, making the place of registration of the ship the criterion of liability for payment of health insurance contributions.  Those arrangements are still operative.</P>
    <P>Certain anomalies have emerged under these arrangements and the British seamen's societies are pressing for the amendment of the arrangements with a view to their removal. To change the basis for health insurance from country of registration to country of ownership of the ship would not provide a complete remedy. If, however, it were decided that the question of paying health insurance contributions at the British or Free State rate should be determined by the residence of the seamen, the anomalies would, it is believed, disappear.</P>
    <P>The powers held by the Minister under existing legislation do not permit of the reciprocal arrangements being amended so as to make the residence of the seaman the test so far as health insurance is concerned.  Any such amendment of the reciprocal arrangements will require enabling legislation and the proposed amendment of Section 17 of the 1923 Act is designed to enable such revised arrangements to be made with Great Britain if it is considered desirable and equitable to do so.  In Great Britain, amending legislation to that effect has already been passed in the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act of 1935.  It will be understood that the legislation of itself will make no change in the existing position of seamen, but will merely place the Minister in a position to agree to the amendment of the reciprocal arrangements, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, if he is satisfied that it is in the best interests of seamen to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Constitution of the Committee of Management of the Unified Society.</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the Unified Society was established by an Act passed by the Oireachtas on the 14th <Col N="622" /> July, 1933 (the National Health Insurance Act, 1933).  Provision was made in that Act for the appointment by the Minister of three persons to act, for a period not exceeding three years, as a provisional committee of the Society and for their replacement by a committee of management of 15, composed of three trustees appointed by the Minister, three representatives of employers appointed by the Minister, and nine representatives of members of the Unified Society to be elected in the prescribed manner by the members. The provisional committee must go out of office on or before the 13th July next.  Unless, therefore, new legislation is passed to alter the composition of the committee of management, it now becomes necessary to make regulations providing for the manner in which the representatives of insured persons are to be elected. This question of the election of members' representatives, however, raises a very difficult problem.  An election by ballot by all the members could be carried out at considerable expense, but the real difficulty lies in the nomination of candidates.  It is impossible to say how many candidates would be nominated, or whether, if elected, they would be suitable members of a committee of management of an important body like the Unified Society.  Moreover, with such a large and widespread electorate, the names of the candidates would convey nothing to the electors and voting, if exercised at all, would be haphazard in the extreme.  In all the circumstances, it seems clear that an election by ballot among all the members of the Society is not a practical proposition.  The Government have explored every avenue with a view to finding some practical method of overcoming that difficulty without interfering with the principle that the management and control of national health insurance business should be in the hands of the insured persons themselves. To leave the nomination of the members' representatives to labour organisations might possibly have met the difficulty but for the fact that such organisations include in their membership only a small proportion of the working population.  (In Table 251, on page 175 of the Statistical Abstract for 1935, the total trade union membership <Col N="623" /> for 1933 is given as 91,890). It is probable also that that membership is mainly concentrated in the borough and urban areas, and that in many cases the labour organisations would have no claim to the nomination of representatives for the rural areas. In these circumstances, the Government believe that the problem of the insured persons' representation on the committee of management can best be solved by giving to labour the right to nominate three insured persons to be members of the committee, and by adopting what may be described as the delegate system of election for the remaining members' representatives.</P>
    <P>Under this system, delegates, who must be insured persons, will first be chosen for each county and county borough area, on the basis of one delegate for every 5,000 members.  These delegates will meet and elect from among themselves the balance of the members' representatives to the committee of management.  The difficulty here is the selection of the delegates. An attempt to elect them would be open to the same objections as apply to the direct election of members of the committee, and it is, therefore, provided that they shall be nominated by bodies which can be regarded as competent for the purpose.  In the absence of any body directly representative of the insured persons, it is considered that the county and county borough councils are sufficiently democratic to be entrusted with the duty.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the committee of management is responsible for the direction and control of a scheme which is financed by contributions compulsorily collected from insured persons and their employers, and supported to a very appreciable extent at the cost of the taxpayer, the Government take the view that, in order to ensure a proper standard of administration, there should be an independent chairman, who should be appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the proposed new committee of 15 members will be composed as follows:&mdash;A chairman to be appointed by the Minister; the three trustees for the time being, appointed by the Minister; three members representative <Col N="624" /> of employers of insured persons, to be appointed by the Minister; three members to be nominated by the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress; and five members to be elected in a manner to be prescribed by delegates nominated by county and county borough councils.  It is to be noted that the insured persons will be in the majority on the committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill contemplates that the chairman, trustees, and employers' representatives, who are all to be appointed by the Minister, shall hold office for a prescribed period, and that the remaining eight members shall be appointed annually.  Provision is made in the Bill for the payment to the members of the committee of such allowances, if any, as the Minister may from time to time determine, and also for the payment of travelling expenses and allowances for maintenance and loss of wages to the delegates, who will hold office for three years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Position of soldiers.</i>&mdash;The present position of serving soldiers under the National Health Insurance Acts is as follows:&mdash;(i) a soldier who on enlistment was a member of an approved society continues to be insured during his Army service; (ii) a soldier who was not a member of an approved society on enlistment is not insured during service if the period of service for which he enlists is less than six months; (iii) if, however, a man who is not a member of an approved society on enlistment enlists for a period of service of six months or more, he is insurable during his service provided that within three months from the date of his enlistment he elects to&mdash; (a) join an approved society in Saorstát Eireann, if he resided before enlistment in Saorstát Eireann; or (b) join the Military Forces (International Arrangements) Insurance Fund if, before enlistment, he resided in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The contribution in respect of an insured soldier is at the rate of 4½d. per week, and is paid by the Minister for Defence, no deduction being made from the man's pay.</P>
    <P>Some 1,200 or 1,300 serving soldiers failed or were not afforded an opportunity <Col N="625" /> to exercise the option given them of becoming insured during their Army service.  Under the Acts as they stand at present, these men are not entitled to be insured in respect of their Army service, as the option was not exercised within the statutory period of three months allowed for bringing them into insurance.</P>
    <P>Power is sought in the amending Bill to bring these men into health insurance as from the 6th January, 1936.  It is also proposed in the Bill to make health insurance compulsory in future for all soldiers who enlist for long service, or who re-enter the armed forces for long service.  It is not proposed to insure as soldiers men enlisted for short periods of service unless they were already insured persons under the National Health Insurance Acts, in which case they will be insured as ordinary contributors at the full employed contributor rate, 8d. a week.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, this opportunity is taken, subject to the general principles just mentioned, to re-enact the main provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts in relation to the armed forces, with a view to clarifying the entire position.</P>
    <P>Under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, provision is made for the payment by the Minister for Defence out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas in respect of every soldier of a contribution for the purposes of that Act at the rate of 8d. per week, of which an amount not exceeding 4d. is recoverable from the soldier.  The word &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; in that Act is defined as a member of the defence forces of Saorstát Eireann, including the Reserve, in respect of whom contributions under the National Health Insurance Acts are for the time being payable under these Acts.  Accordingly, the proposed legislation in regard to soldiers which I have just outlined will have the effect of bringing all long-service soldiers within the scope of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, as from the 6th January, 1936.</P>
    <P>So far as soldiers serving in the armed forces immediately prior to and on 6th January, 1936, are concerned, <Col N="626" /> legislative authority is sought to treat them as if contributions under the National Health Insurance Acts were deemed to have been paid in respect of them for each week of continuous service in the period from the date of enlistment or re-entry, as the case may be, to the 6th January, 1936.  The effect of this provision will be that all soldiers with over 104 weeks' continuous service immediately prior to and on the 6th January, 1936, will, on that date, become fully qualified for Widows' and Orphans' Pensions at the contributory rate, and that those with less than 104 weeks' continuous service immediately prior to the 6th January, 1936, will become qualified for contributory pensions on the completion of 104 weeks' service. On discharge from the armed forces, or transfer to the Reserve, the soldier will be treated as an ordinary employed contributor and will become liable to the ordinary statutory tests for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in the Seanad on the Widows' and Orphans Pensions Bill, Senator Johnson moved an amendment designed to secure that in any case where an employer had failed to pay contributions in respect of an employee, the widow could take steps to recover from the employer any pension or allowances lost through his default.  Owing to the difficulty in drafting a suitable clause to meet the point raised and to the importance of ensuring the rapid passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, it was agreed to leave the matter over to be dealt with in an amending Bill, to be introduced, if possible, before the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act came into force.  It is proposed, accordingly, to deal with the matter in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recovery from employers.</i>&mdash;Under the National Health Insurance Acts and the Regulations made thereunder, where an employer fails to comply with the provisions of the Acts he is liable, during the period up to four weeks after the date on which compliance is effected, for any benefit lost by an employee through his neglect.  Either the employee himself <Col N="627" /> or the Minister, can sue the employer to recover the lost benefit.  Power is taken in this Bill to secure the recovery of any contributory pension lost by a widow consequent on an employer's failure to pay contributions in respect of her deceased husband.  In such cases the widow may, apart from such contributions, on the death of her husband become entitled to receive a non-contributory pension and where this is so it is proposed that the amount for which the defaulting employer would be liable shall be the difference between the amount of the contributory pension and the amount of the non-contributory pension, if any. The period over which his liability will extend will be from the date of the employee's death up to four weeks after the date on which all the contributions in arrears are paid up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Parts I and III of this Bill are concerned, there is not very much to be said.  I think those parts are an improvement on the existing National Health Insurance Acts and will be a help to insured persons.  I cannot say that I congratulate the Minister on what he has brought forth by way of a scheme for the election of his committee of management.  The Minister said it was a very difficult matter, and I agree it is a difficult matter to find machinery that will give, first and foremost, the insured members the voice in the election of the committee of management to which they are entitled and that will ensure, so far as it is possible, that the Minister will get members elected to the committee who will be useful members. I imagine that if the Minister and his Department had set out deliberately to evolve the most complicated and unworkable scheme that could be found, they could not have succeeded better than they have by the proposals in this Bill.  There are approximately 500,000 insured members in the country and I think I am right in saying that, roughly, one-third of that number are within the city and county of Dublin.  Eight members are to be elected altogether, three by the Executive of the Trades Union Congress, who, of course, in order to be <Col N="628" /> qualified, must be insured members, and there are five others to be elected.</P>
      <P>The Minister has expressed a desire to see that members will have the management and control of the society, but the members are not even going to have a voice as to who is to represent them on the committee of management. The proposal in the Bill is that an electoral council is to be established by the county councils and the county borough councils, but the members of the county councils and the county borough councils will have no voice in the matter at all, because under another sub-section it is laid down that unless there are at least 2,500 insured members within the functional area of the particular public body they shall not be entitled to elect any person to the electoral council. With the exception of the corporations of the principal cities, the other borough councils will have no voice in the matter.  Therefore, it will fall back largely on the county councils. Remember, it is not the members of the society who are to nominate the members of the electoral council, who in turn will nominate the five members of the committee of management, but it will be the county councils or the county borough councils and, as we know, those councils are not composed of members of national health insurance societies.</P>
      <P>I think I could say with a good deal of truth that, so far as the county councils are concerned, many members are persons who are prejudiced and always were prejudiced against the National Health Insurance Acts and some of them are openly antagonistic. The Minister is probably aware of that himself and those are the persons who are to be asked to nominate members to serve on the electoral council.  The insured member as such will have no voice whatever in the matter.  How are county councils to ascertain who are insured members and what is the machinery to be to ensure that the county councils shall select to serve on the electoral council men who are interested in the matter of national health insurance, men who will be suitable to act on the committee of management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> There are, roughly, 500,000 insured workers.  The Minister places the number at 5,000 for each member so that in order to get a body to nominate five members to act on the committee of management we are going to have an electoral council of approximately 120 members.  It seems to me that that is unnecessary, cumbersome, too costly, and it will be much less satisfactory than many of the schemes which, I could gather from the Minister's statement, he and the Department have rejected.  You will have 120 men selected, not by the members themselves, but by persons who are not insured and who in many cases have no sympathy whatever with the scheme of insurance.  I am doubtful if the Minister will get a committee of management that will be of any great use in the working of the Society.  I agree it is a difficult matter; it is not easy to find machinery that will be suitable and that will get the best results.  I shall do all I can on the Committee Stage of the Bill to help the Minister.  I hope to make some suggestions which may be a little improvement on the scheme as it is. I will do my best, after some consultation with people who are interested and who have been working most of their lifetime in the national health insurance business.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter about which I should like to speak.  Having set up this very cumbersome and unwieldy electoral council, the members of that council are to hold office for three years.  That body is set up solely for the purpose of nominating five members of the committee of management, but the five members are to hold office for only one year.  I am sure there is some reason for that and, if there is, I should like to hear it, because it seems to me to be a bad provision. If you appoint a person on the committee of management, at the end of 12 months, when perhaps he is just getting an idea of the work he has to perform, he is deposed and there is a likelihood that some other person may be substituted in his place who, perhaps, has not the foggiest idea of what the duty of a member of a committee of management will be.  I do not say that that will happen, but it <Col N="630" /> is likely to happen and it is all the more likely having regard to the composition of our county borough councils and county councils.  The position will be further complicated by having the members of the council selected, not because of their knowledge of the National Health Insurance Acts or their interest in national health insurance, but simply because the particular party that holds a majority on the council or the county borough council are of a certain political persuasion and the person who is the most valuable member and has the loudest voice in the local Fianna Fáil Cumann will probably find himself on the electoral council and, eventually, on the committee of management.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt about that as members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but I should not like to say the same as to their knowledge of the National Health Insurance Acts. The Minister will, I think, admit that these are matters that deserve consideration. This is purely a non-Party measure, and I am sure that every member in the House is anxious to see, now that we have a Unified Society, that it will be made a success. A great deal depends on that.  I want to suggest to the Minister that with the best staff in the world he wants a good committee of management, and it will take the best staff and committee of management to make it a success. I am afraid the machinery that is proposed in this Bill is not going to get him the committee of management that is most useful.  With other members of this House, I may be able to suggest improvements in Part II of this Bill. With regard to Part I, I am glad that the Minister has introduced the new matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the particular attention of the House to Part II of the Bill which the Minister is now asking the House to read a <Col N="631" /> Second Time.  It is rather strange that within two years of the introduction of the National Health Insurance Act of 1933, the Minister should come to the House and ask for new legislation designed to scrap the scheme of election conceived in connection with the 1933 Act, although no trial whatever has been given to the operation in respect of the election of insured members' representatives associated with the 1933 Act.  I think it is rather an indication that the method of election conceived in connection with the 1933 Act got no proper consideration at all &mdash;that almost anything was put into the Bill at that time, possibly with the desire to get unification through the House, and with the desire not to cause any unnecessary difficulties for the Minister.  But the fact remains that the Minister in the 1933 Bill was apparently prepared to commit himself to that particular method of election. He now comes to the House two years after the Bill was passed and asks us for authority to set up an entirely different method of election, although the method conceived in 1933 was never given any trial whatever. I do not deny that the method of election in the 1933 Act was the proper method of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the Minister, before he committed himself to the 1933 method of election, had discussed all possible alternatives.  He had nevertheless come to the conclusion that the method of electing insured persons' representatives was the best method, so as to have the election decided on the initiative of, and absolutely controlled by, the insured members themselves. Now apparently the Minister thinks that it is better to get away from the method of election which gave the sole responsibility for the election of the insured persons' representatives to the insured members themselves.  The Minister has now proposed a scheme of taking away from the insured members the rights which they had under the 1933 Act. Instead of the method of selecting the representatives of the insured persons, as in the 1933 Act, they are now being handed over to other bodies, I say, because of the magnitude of the task <Col N="632" /> of electing insured persons' representatives as conceived in the 1933 Act.</P>
    <P>There may be a strong practical case to be made for modifying the method of election then conceived.  But I think in the operation of a Bill dealing with this matter the Minister is doing something more than modifying the method of election then conceived.  For instance, in the 1933 Act it is provided that the committee shall consist of 15 persons, three of whom would be trustees appointed by the Minister, three employers' representatives also appointed by the Minister, and nine representatives of the insured persons. So that the insured persons had nine representatives on the committee under the 1933 Act, while the employers had three in addition to the trustees, bringing the total up to 15.  It will be seen from that composition of the committee that the insured persons had a majority on the committee.  Of course it has been the cardinal feature of our national health insurance legislation in these appointments since the Act was introduced that the insured members should have the right to control the Society.  The national health society throughout the country prior to the unification was composed upon that principle.  In Great Britain, where individual societies still exist, it is recognised as the cardinal feature of the structure of the individual societies that the insured members are entitled to elect the committee of management, and by virtue of the fact that they are entitled to elect the committee of management they are in control of the policy of the national health insurance society.  The Minister even recognised that principle in connection with the 1933 Act.  The Minister recognised that it was desirable that insured persons should have the majority of the representatives on the committee of management, because he provided for nine representatives of the insured persons, whereas the other interests on the committee were only represented by six persons.  I say to the Minister now that the preservation of that principle was very important from the point of view of the interests of the insured persons.</P>
    <P>What is happening under the new scheme proposed by the Minister?  It <Col N="633" /> was possible under the 1933 scheme for the committee of management to elect its own chairman, a quite usual procedure for committees of that kind. The insured persons' representatives could be sure that they could elect to the position of chairman one of their own members.  If it was desired that the chairmanship should rotate, it was possible for the employers' representatives to appoint the chairman.  At all events the principle of electing the chairman by the committee of management was recognised under the 1933 Act.  I submit there must have been good reasons which induced the Government to allow the committee of management to have the sole voice in electing the chairman of the society.</P>
    <P>Let us now compare the 1933 scheme with the new scheme or provision enshrined in this Bill.  The new scheme provides, as formerly, that the three trustees will be appointed by the Minister, and the three representatives of the employers will also be appointed by him.  But, not content with maintaining his right to appoint the trustees and the employers' representatives, the Minister is now taking power to ensure that the chairman will also be appointed by himself.  I should like to know from the Minister what good grounds he has for claiming that he should be the person to appoint the chairman?  If we take the personnel of the committee of management under the new scheme it will mean that the Minister will appoint seven persons, none of them representative of the insured persons.  At all events, the insured persons are going to have no voice whatever in the nomination of the seven persons who will be appointed by the Minister.  Against the seven appointed by the Minister, there will be eight representatives of the insured workers, so that the committee of management of the Society, which stood in the proportion of 9 to 6 under the 1933 scheme, is now to be altered to the proportion of 8 to 7. The workers' representatives are to lose one member on the committee of management as originally conceived. The non-workers' representatives are to be increased by one.  The Minister, of course, may tell us that his aim is to secure a chairman who is impartial <Col N="634" /> to both sides, but let us realise that there can be no impartiality whatever about the chairman, having regard to the manner in which he is to be elected.  Insured persons are not to be consulted in the election of the chairman. The Minister may put in anybody he likes there, and may maintain anybody he likes there, notwithstanding any objection by the committee. The independence which the chairman will have will be bordered by his terms of appointment.</P>
    <P>When we look at Section 7 of the Bill we find that the chairman is appointed by the Minister, that the Minister is not obliged to consult anybody in appointing the chairman, and that the chairman shall hold office for a period prescribed by the Minister. In Section 7 (2) (c) we are told that the Minister may remove the chairman from office.  From that, one can see perfectly clearly that if the chairman of the society is going to stand up for the rights of the insured members and the rights of the committee of management against the Minister's Department, the relations between the chairman and the Minister will not be of the most cordial and amiable character.  If the Minister's Department has any trouble from time to time with the committee of management of the National Health Insurance Society we may be sure, no matter what his own desires may be, that the Minister's mind will be inevitably coloured towards the conclusion that this is a particularly troublesome chairman.  Although he may be very efficient from the point of view of safeguarding the interests of the insured members, the Minister may be prone to believe that the troublesome chairman&mdash;even though he is troublesome on behalf of the insured members&mdash;is also an inefficient chairman.  This whole method of appointing the chairman of the National Health Insurance Society makes him a creature of the Minister.  He will just get a certain amount of latitude from the Minister, but if ever he endeavours to get some more latitude, if ever he becomes troublesome to the Minister and his Department, we all know the kind of atmosphere that can be radiated against him.  Consequently, <Col N="635" /> the person appointed to the position of chairman of this National Health Insurance Society will be a person who, if that is his sole employment, will always do what the Minister wants.  This chairman, having regard to the manner in which he is appointed, will become a Ministerial yes-yes man, who will do all that the Minister tells him to do.  He will not dare to annoy the Minister; any time he is tempted to do so, even in the interests of the insured persons, some one will remind him of Section 7 (2) (c) which provides that the Minister may remove the chairman from office.  That is probably calculated to bring the chairman to heel almost immediately.  When the Minister, under the new scheme, has appointed three trustees, three employers and one chairman, he has appointed a group of people over whom he has absolute control.  He has complete control over the chairman, whom he says in his speech to-day he desires to be as independent as possible.  I think the term &ldquo;independence&rdquo; is rather incongruous having regard to the rather brusque language in which the Minister's power over the chairman is embodied in Section 7 (2) (c).</P>
    <P>At all events, the main principle in connection with the new scheme is that the workers' representation on the committee of management is to be reduced.  They are to have eight representatives as against seven nonworkers' representatives.  If there should on occasions happen to be one of the workers' representatives absent&mdash;which is not improbable I suggest seeing that they will be elected from various parts of the country and may for one reason or another find it difficult to be present on all occasions&mdash;a situation will arise where there will be seven representatives of the workers, seven persons who are non-workers' representatives, with a chairman, appointed by the Minister and removable by the Minister, exercising a casting vote.  On any day on which the committee of management meets and there are less <Col N="636" /> than eight representatives of the workers present, while the other elements are fully represented, there is no control by the insured workers' representatives over the policy of the society.  I suggest to the Minister that it is altogether unfair, even though he is altering the method of election, that the representatives of the workers on the committee of management should be reduced in the manner suggested by the Minister in this Bill.  I think it is rather unusual for the Minister, in a Bill of this kind, to claim the power to appoint a chairman.  He did not claim that power in the 1933 Act, and I can hardly imagine that that section was allowed to go into the 1933 Act without his Department calling his attention to the fact that the filling of the chairmanship would appear to be left to the discretion of the committee. Now it is proposed that the Minister should appoint the chairman, and I suggest that the only purpose in seeking power to appoint a chairman is to put a particular person into the post, giving the insured workers no voice whatever in the selection of the chairman.  Whoever is intended to be chairman of this society under the new scheme may be a most estimable gentleman; he may be an ideal person from every point of view, but it is wrong in principle that the Minister should appoint the chairman and give the workers' representatives no say in his appointment.  It is wrong that the workers' representatives should be denied the right to have a chairman of their own choice.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the part of the new scheme under which not alone shall the number of the workers' representatives be reduced in the interests of the non-workers' representatives but under which the whole method of electing the workers' representatives is, I think, needlessly cumbersome. The Minister says that the scheme provided for in the 1933 Act was unsatisfactory, was cumbersome and was costly.  I rather think that the new scheme, in so far as it provides for the nomination of the insured workers' representatives by loyal authorities, is almost as cumbersome <Col N="637" /> as the original scheme.  From the point of view of giving control to the workers' representatives, it is altogether undemocratic, having regard to the provisions of the original scheme. At least under the original scheme the workers were enabled to take the initiative in selecting their representatives. Now it is provided that the county councils and borough councils will nominate the persons, and constitute a kind of electoral college.  As Deputy Morrissey has rightly pointed out, that really means that the nomination of the workers' representatives will be in the hands of persons who detest the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts, and who detest the provisions of many other Acts designed to improve the conditions of the workers in economic and social matters.  It is well-known that the members of county councils and other local authorities throughout the country have little knowledge of the provisions of the Act, but they see in legislation of that kind what many of them are pleased to call a burden on industry and on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Many of those persons, therefore, who dislike the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act will be the persons who have the right to say who will constitute the electoral college for the purpose of electing the workers' representatives; in other words, it may really turn out in this way, that instead of the workers initiating the movement to select their own representatives, the employers on the county councils and borough councils will be the persons who will initiate the movement for the election of the workers' representatives.  Every employer who is represented on a local authority, every large farmer and rancher who is represented on a local authority or county council, will now under this scheme be the person who decides who will constitute the electoral college to select the workers' representatives.  We have, therefore, the strange position that instead of giving the workers the power to initiate the movement for the election of their own representatives, we now find ourselves confronted with a scheme where the movement will not originate <Col N="638" /> with the workers themselves, but will originate in many cases with their employers.  In any case, it will originate with persons who are not insured contributors themselves, but are persons liable to pay contributions in respect of workers.  That seems to me to be a truly undemocratic method of electing workers' representatives.</P>
    <P>Then, to have an electoral college of anything from 100 to 120 persons to elect five representatives drawn from all over the country, where members from Cork will not have the slightest notion of the qualities of a nominee of the Donegal County Council is an entirely unsatisfactory method of providing for the election of workers' representatives.  Representatives of the Dublin County Council will meet representatives of the Galway County Council and of the Cork and Donegal County Councils and out of that assortment of persons, who meet each other for the first time, five persons are to be elected to represent the workers.  All of the 100 or 120 people there will have been sent by county councils and borough councils who are not themselves solely representative of insured persons.  I could not imagine a more undemocratic scheme, or a scheme which more effectually takes the power of initiation out of the hands of the workers and puts it into the hands of persons who are not workers, than the scheme provided in the section.</P>
    <P>I concede that the National Executive of the Trade Union Congress are permitted to nominate three representatives. There, at all events, we have the safeguard that these are people who are representative of the trade union movement.  They are workingclass representatives who hold their positions by virtue of the confidence reposed in them.  At least we can ensure that these people are responsible to those who elect them and that the method of their election ensures that they can be held accountable for any of their actions.  In that case, at all events, we have a definite guarantee that those who are selected by the Trade Union Congress will be workers' representatives of a type that can be depended on, in the judgment of the Trade Union Congress, to look after <Col N="639" /> the interests of the insured workers. But we have no such guarantee in connection with those who will be nominated, in the first instance, by the county and borough councils.</P>
    <P>I would prefer, even though the method may not be entirely satisfactory&mdash;it would, however, be more satisfactory than the scheme provided in the Bill&mdash;that the Minister should endeavour to see to what extent he can frame a scheme providing that the representatives of the workers should be elected in consultation between himself and the Trade Union Congress so as to ensure that we have workers' representatives who are not nominated by employers in the first instance.  It ought to be possible for the National Executive of the Trade Union Congress to co-operate with the Minister so as to ensure that those who will represent the workers, as the result of consultation between the Trade Union Congress and the Minister, would be drawn from the different portions of the country.  The Trade Union Congress' assent to the nomination would at least ensure that they were bona fide representatives of the insured persons.  We could therefore avoid the possibility of persons being elected through the electoral college, who may not be in fact bona fide representatives of the insured workers and who may just be rubber stamps for persons who can control the greatest amount of influence in the county councils.  The method of selecting representatives through the National Executive of the Trade Union Congress offers a better guarantee that those elected to represent the workers will be equipped to do so.  I would prefer therefore if the Minister could see his way to have the workers' representatives nominated by the Trade Union Congress in conjunction with himself.  He could then feel satisfied that they were genuine representatives of insured persons and he could be satisfied that the difficulties and the objections associated with allowing employers to initiate the movement for the election of workers' representatives would be definitely avoided.</P>
    <P>But, whatever the method of election is, the Minister should certainly restore <Col N="640" /> to the workers' representatives on the committee the proportion which existed under the 1933 Act&mdash;that is, to give the workers' representatives their original strength on the committee which was then proposed, namely, nine representatives of the workers and six representatives of the non-insured persons. In that way, at all events, the Minister would make it clear that this Bill is designed, not to reduce the workers' representatives, but to give them the same power and the same control as they formerly had.  As I said, I hope the Minister between now and the Committee Stage will consider the question of abandoning this method of election, because I think it is ineffective, unsatisfactory and undemocratic, and it is introducing in respect of national health insurance legislation a principle which has never been there before, namely, allowing the employer to initiate the movement for the election of the workers' representatives.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister credit for being a democrat.  The Minister frequently has protested in this House that he is a democrat, but I am sure that he cannot reconcile this scheme provided in the Bill with any canon of democracy applied to national health insurance legislation in the past.  The proposal is undemocratic, and it certainly is not there to serve the best interests of the workers.  Not only does this section reduce the representation of the workers, but it allows the movement for the initiation of the election of their representatives to pass into the hands of persons who in many cases will be employers.  That is undemocratic.  The Minister, I hope, between now and the Committee Stage, will endeavour to devise a scheme by which the election of the representatives of the workers on this committee of management will be at the instigation either of the workers themselves or those who can be guaranteed to ensure that the proper type of workers will be elected to the committee.  I imagine that a consultation between the Minister or his Department and the Trade Union Congress would lead to the initiation of a scheme which would be more satisfactory and certainly much more <Col N="641" /> democratic than the scheme provided in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I should like the Minister to explain.  I am at sea as to what the functions of the committee of management are to be and what really will be the work which the committee will have to do.  I understand that the administration will be carried out generally by the officers, but I do not know what the real functions of the committee will be, and I should like the Minister to tell us.  With regard to Section 18, it lays down that if an employer has failed or neglected to pay certain contributions he may be liable to the dependents of a person who has died and who may leave a widow and dependents, and that they can sue him.  I think a more reasonable thing to do in a case like that would be that the Department should decide whether or not the person concerned would be entitled to a pension if the contributions were paid.  Then the pension should be granted in the ordinary way, and it ought to be the business of the Minister to follow up that employer in law.  Of course I see that the Minister has the right to do that, but it ought not to be thrown on the widow or dependents to take action.  The Minister himself ought to grant the pension in the ordinary way, and it should be laid down in the Act that he should recover from the person whatever moneys ought to have been paid in the ordinary way.  That is really a matter for the Committee Stage, but I think the Minister ought to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only one or two points to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention in connection with this amending Bill.  I was rather disappointed that, when the Minister was bringing in an amending Bill, he had not thought fit to put in the amendment he has committed himself to, and which, I believe, he would like to put in.  It is a good many years since the Minister, when in opposition, opposed in an amending Bill on National Health Insurance&mdash;a very small measure and one of less importance than the measure now before the <Col N="642" /> House&mdash;any amendment of the existing code of national health insurance unless it contained two important reforms: one of them being the unification of the approved societies, and the other&mdash;which I think Deputies would consider a very important reform, though the Minister still postpones it&mdash;the introduction to the code of some reference to health or of some method of providing for dealing with health.  Our code has practically no relation to health except in so far as it makes money payments to those who are temporarily or permanently disabled. There is no provision in the code concerned with the improvement of the health of the community, and none of its funds ought go for that purpose.  The Minister himself declared at the time that no reforms should be accepted by this House until that reform was included in the measure, but I am disappointed to see that he has now come for the second time with an amending Bill which does not contain the two reforms of which he approves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess to some sympathy with the views expressed by the Leader of the Labour Party with regard to the constitution of the committee for the Unified Society.  I think he is justified in saying that the provisions for the election of insured members' repretatives are cumbrous and do not give a guarantee that insured members will in fact be represented.  My criticism would tend perhaps to the same thing in saying that I think that the constitution of the committee of the Unified Society will not give us a sufficiently progressive management to give us confidence that it will proceed to the important measure of reform that I mentioned a minute ago.  As far as we can judge from its constitution, it will be a committee of a somewhat unprogressive nature.  We have not found in the past that employers' representatives, with regard to national health insurance, were concerned to any great extent with devoting funds to the preservation of the general good health. There is a good deal of substance in what Deputy Norton has said, to the extent that the so-called insured members' representatives will be, to a considerable <Col N="643" /> extent, persons who are not representative of insured members but rather representative of the employers' interests.  I confess that I am not able to suggest another method for appointing this committee.  I recognise that some amendment is necessary in the method of appointing the committee, but I cannot suggest a better committee. I cannot say, however, that in some of its provisions the method set forth in this Bill is one that would give confidence as to having a society with a progressive committee at its head.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in a unified society in itself through the mere fact of monopoly.  There is the danger that it is not likely to be progressive when there is no competition between different societies.  That being so, I think it should have been present to the Minister's mind that it was necessary, in framing this constitution, that he should give all the strength he could to progressive elements but, as far as I can see, the constitution does not bear that complexion as the Bill stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The few Deputies who have spoken have made some strong criticisms of one or two parts of the Bill.  Deputy Morrissey, who opened the criticism, agreed that it is a difficult matter to devise a scheme of management for the newly constituted Unified Society&mdash;a scheme of election of a committee of management that would be satisfactory to all concerned. I, perhaps, am subject to criticism for not having gone more thoroughly into the scheme that was embodied in the Act of 1933 and not having examined it in as great detail as perhaps it should have been examined, as to how it would work out in practice.  I did, of course, and the Party did, give consideration to that matter and to every other section of that Bill, but I have to admit that, when it came to implementing that section in the 1933 Act, and to thinking out how we were going to provide the necessary machinery for electing the committee of management, we found that we were up against many practical difficulties that were not apparent to us before, and I had to decide to come to the House and ask <Col N="644" /> leave to change the method of election. That gave rise to discussion on the whole question of the committee of management and I went again into the financial relations of the various contributors to national health insurance &mdash;the worker, the employer and the State&mdash;and, roughly, the employer and the State contribution between them is 60 per cent. of the cost of national health insurance, while the worker contributes 40 per cent.  That is in round figures.  It was put up to me that it was not fair representation to have the whole scheme of national health insurance controlled by those who paid the lesser portion of the cost of national health insurance.  I agrued that basically national health insurance in the past had been controlled, to a very considerable extent&mdash;at any rate since the Free State was established&mdash;by the workers: that the workers controlled their own society, and I desired, and continue to desire, that the control&mdash;a majority, at any rate, of the committee&mdash;should rest in the hands of the workers.  I think I have secured that that will be the effect when it comes to be put in operation under the present scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Norton and Deputy Dr. Rowlette, all three, agree that the members are not to have a deciding voice as to who is to control their organisation.  I do not think that is correct.  First of all, even in regard to the five who are to be elected by what I think Deputy Norton called an electoral college to be set up by the county council, we must remember that the system of election for local authorities, county councils and county borough councils is on the most democratic basis possible, adult suffrage.  I cannot conceive anything more democratic than that method of election for the county councils.  You will get persons democratically elected representing all sections of the community and it will surprise me very much if the workers are not represented.</P>

      <P>I believe that any member of any Party acting as Minister with a sense of responsibility, knowing his actions are subject to criticism here and elsewhere&mdash;even if he had not that sense of responsibility very strongly defined&mdash;will regard it as a solemn obligation and duty to see fair play between all parties concerned in the carrying on of National Health Insurance.  I believe with Deputy <Col N="646" /> Morrissey and Deputy Norton that there are persons, members of county councils of different political complexions, who are opposed to national health insurance as they are opposed to many other laws of this State.  That is common knowledge, but other parties are represented on these bodies too.  You have the workers already pretty strongly represented on them. You have the farmers represented on them and I know farmers and employers who are more progressive in matters of social legislation even than some Labour representatives I know.</P>

      <P>The delegates will be selected by these local authorities and there is no reason in the world why these local authorities cannot be influenced in making their choice by workers outside.  Deputy Norton made a strong point that the initiative is taken out of the hands of the workers. That is not so.  In my opinion the initiative is not taken out of their hands because the trade union councils, in rural as well as in urban areas, are pretty vocal and pretty active. They can meet and make representations to the local authorities and to the local elected representative who has to rely on votes.  If he does not respond he will hear about it later on.  In my opinion the initiative is certainly not taken out of the hands of the workers, if they wish to exercise it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey raised a point about the annual election that I raised myself in the early stages when I was going over this scheme with the officials of the Department&mdash;the fact that these five members are only elected for one year.  I got an answer in that discussion that convinced me that it was a good scheme to have them elected for one year.  The idea now is that there will be an annual meeting of these 120 delegates.  The calling together of these delegates for the purpose of electing the committee of management gives them an opportunity of holding an annual meeting and for the discussion of the grievances, whatever they may be, of the members of the Unified Society.  They <Col N="647" /> get a platform, an opportunity of discussing and arising their grievances and of getting a publicity for them that would not be provided if they met only every two or three years.</P>

      <P>Their expenses will be paid.  I think it is a good idea to have them coming together to air their grievances and to get all the publicity they can.  Even if they are called for that one work of electing their delegates, it provides a useful outlet for the views of people selected from all parts of the Saorstát.  It gives them an opportunity they otherwise would not have of discussing this big problem, the question of national health insurance.  It will help to educate public opinion and help to make people more interested in the work.  It will help the other things that Deputy Dr. Rowlette has in mind, the reforms that are necessary in national health insurance and social legislation in general.  In every way I think the idea of the annual meeting is a good one.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear it.  I hope that there will be all that interest in the work of national health insurance.  Unquestionably there have been changes and modifications in the nature of the committee of management, and I put it to the House that in view of the financial relations of the three parties, it is not an unfair thing that the State should nominate the chairman.  When the State with the employers pays 60 per cent and the workers 40 per cent it is not an unfair thing to ask the House to modify the scheme of the committee of management to the extent of giving the Minister power to nominate the chairman.  There is no reason on earth why the Minister could not see to it if he wished that a particular employer or worker should be chairman.</P>

      <P>I think that would not be a bad idea.  I think that any Minister, as I said earlier, should see to it that there would be fairness all round.  I think that anybody with a sense of responsibility, and desiring that good relations should exist between the two parties and anxious for the good management of the Society, <Col N="649" /> should see to it that all parties got consideration when making his nomination. In reference to that matter, I gathered, not exactly from the words Deputy Norton used, but from what seemed to be at the back of his mind, that he thought I have some person in mind.</P>

      <P>The principle of democratic control is still maintained and there is a majority of elected persons.  We differ as to the manner of election of the five.  Deputy Norton and others think it is not thoroughly democratic.  I think it is, and it would be difficult, in view of the nature of the work to be done, to find a more democratic way of doing it.  I have had a variety of schemes before me and many suggestions, and there was difficulty and very considerable trouble and expense in relation to all of them. The form in which we have the scheme now is, I think, as fair and as democratic a form as is likely to be suggested here.</P>

      <Col N="650" /> Deputy Rowlette was rather nervous about the type of committee and rather feared that it would not be progressive. I have one or two employers in mind who have spoken to me on the subject of social legislation&mdash;really progressive men&mdash;and I can say, without giving away a secret, that there is at present in control of the Unified Society an entirely undemocratic body &mdash;a temporary committee of three nominated by the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  A commercial agreement, operative for one year, was concluded on the 1st April, 1935, between the Government of the Saorstát <Col N="654" /> and the Spanish Government, and was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for External affairs.  Under clause 7 of that agreement, the Government of Saorstát Eireann undertook to take all the measures necessary for the purpose of preventing in its territory, during the duration of the agreement, the wrong ful use of the geographical appellations of origin of wines produced in and exported from Spain, the names of which appear in the annex to the treaty of agreement, and the importation of which should be subject to the production of certificates of origin delivered by the competent Spanish authorities.</P>
      <P>The classes of wines covered by that paragraph of the agreement are those set out in the Schedule to this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to enable us to give effect to that part of the agreement. This is done by giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce power, under Section 2 of the Bill, to afford the necessary protection of the particular name, and also to require that the particular wine, when imported, will be covered by a certificate of origin.  A somewhat similar measure was passed in 1930 in connection with the trade agreement made with Portugal, with this difference that the legislation introduced in that year in regard to Portugal itself applied the protection and imposed the requirement in respect of the certificate of origin.  Under this Bill that will be done by Order, and the reason for the difference is that the agreement with Spain is for a period of one year.  If it is continued beyond that period, then Orders can be made extending the provisions of this Bill accordingly.</P>
      <P>Provision is made under Section 5 of the Bill that an Order made under it will not apply within one year from the date of the passing of the Bill to any wine or other liquor imported into the Saorstát before that date.  That provision is made so as to ensure that there will be ample time for the disposal of stocks of wines which were imported without the certificate of origin but which will become necessary for importation as soon as Orders are made under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the introduction of this Bill is just throwing dust in the eyes of the farmers.  This Bill is introduced to implement, to some extent, an agreement that was made with Spain on the grounds that Spain was going to help to take some of the surplus agricultural produce that was left here in this country because the British market was cut off by Government policy.  In return for safeguarding Spanish exports in certain classes of fruits, vegetables and wines, Spain undertook to take a certain number of eggs from this country.  The agreement is put over by the Government as a kind of bluff policy, that it is establishing alternative markets for the farmers of this country.  We have heard complaints here that the eggs exported from this country to Spain are not being paid for.  I do not want to go into that question, but I do want to go into the question that it is simply nonsense and fooling the people of this country to go on making these agreements on the pretence that agreements of this particular kind are establishing alternative markets and are going to improve the agricultural situation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us what has happened as a result of this agreement. For that information we have to turn to the trade statistics published the other day for the nine months ended December last.  When we do that, we find that this is another of the three to one agreements by which we send £3 to Spain and we take our chance of getting £1 back, with some delay.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce what exactly Spain has taken from us under this agreement. In the meantime, I think the House should realise what is happening to eggs, because this agreement is made entirely on the basis that we are going to get rid of eggs out of this country, and that, therefore, we are going to help the farmers.  It would be much better if we scrapped all these agreements and adopted some other policy. This is the position with regard to eggs.  All we know is that during the last 12 months the exports from this country to Spain were value for £70,836.  The direct exports to Spain, <Col N="656" /> therefore, for the last nine months were value for approximately £53,127, as against imports received from Spain amounting to £171,000 during the same period.  The agreement is slightly less valuable in the matter of ratio than the German three to one agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give the Minister the figures for last year, the year before and the year before that, and the farther the Minister went back the better he would find the ratio was of our relationship with trade with Spain.  However, I do not want to confuse the Minister with a large number of figures.  I want to deal with eggs.  We were able to get rid of eggs to the value of £2,269,000 in 1931. Last year we only got rid of eggs to the value of £711,000.  Therefore, as regards the export of eggs, we dropped more than £1,500,000.  When we were exporting eggs to the value of £2,269,000 almost all of them were going to the British market and that at a time when Australia was only able to export eggs to the value of £582,000 to that market.  In the meantime Australia has doubled her export in eggs to the British market, the figure for 1935 being £1,092,000, while our exports to the British market in the same period have fallen from £2,270,000 to over £700,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister explain why we have dropped £1,500,000 in this particular way and, in particular, will he explain why in view of the fact that Britain imported £700,000 worth of eggs more last year than she did the year before we have dropped an additional £180,000 in our exports to Great Britain since last year.  While we are blinding the farmers with some of the sawdust that comes out of the cases <Col N="657" /> from Spain we are in this position, that the whole of our poultry industry is being impoverished.  There is not a single class of poultry laying eggs whose numbers have not been reduced since 1931.  Ducks have fallen by 30 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with one aspect of the trade agreement with Spain.  Possibly it is relevant to refer to eggs.  I have not prevented the Deputy from quoting the figures relating to export of eggs.  The whole poultry trade and the question of exports to Great Britain, comparing one year with another, is scarcely relevant on this minor measure which implements only certain aspects of a trade agreement approved of by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I submit is that we agreed to a trade agreement with Spain before we got a chance of seeing how it worked out, We now have a small experience of it and it is not overburdening the debate to draw attention to the fact that, compared with what we are losing in other lines, this agreement is nothing but an attempt to throw sawdust in the eyes of the farmers.  It is not worth the Minister's while and it is not worth paying a Minister in Spain if they are not able to achieve more than is contained in this agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have seen fit, in introducing this proposal to implement an agreement, to say something which would enlighten the people as to what is happening with regard to the import of oranges.  Take one net point.  A case of Jaffa oranges can be bought in Liverpool for 9/6.  It would cost 1/- to bring them over here.  If any ordinary person goes out to buy a case of Jaffa oranges here, he will be asked to pay 25/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He will pay 25/- if he is able to get them at all.  He <Col N="658" /> may not be able to get them.  He may look merely for oranges and we find an operation proceeding by which apparently, people are being taught to appreciate small oranges and bad oranges, at a very much higher price than these oranges can be obtained in Great Britain.  A letter was published on 7th December last from the Fruit Exchange, Halston Street, conducted by Messrs.  Morgan &amp; Co., in which they gave the comparative prices of oranges in the City of Dublin and in Liverpool.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should quote the figures in this letter, so that the Minister can examine them at his leisure.  The letter is addressed to the Editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Press item of the 4th inst. stated: `The prices (of oranges) were approximately the same as those prevailing in the Liverpool market and, on balance, represented the world price of the fruit....  The establishment of the fruit exchange here will safeguard Irish traders from the fluctuations of the English market.' In the interests of truth in the news, perhaps you will allow space to the following comparison of prices made at the sales in Dublin on Tuesday last and in Liverpool the following day (Wednesday).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The letter proceeds to give details of prices in connection with Navels (Californian-style packing).  The prices at Dublin and Liverpool are quoted as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The letter proceeds:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The figures in brackets beside the Liverpool prices represent the approximate amount per package paid in <i>ad valorem</i> duty to the English Government, which is included in the Liverpool quotations. There is no duty on oranges here. While the public may conclude from the above that Irish orange traders certainly need safeguarding, it will surely see that English market fluctuations are not a source of danger and it may properly ask: `What about us?' especially as the existing monopoly was virtually State-conceded. Indisputably, an increased burden has been needlessly put on Irish Free State consumers.  If compensation in the form of similarly high prices from Spain for eggs and other exports could be pointed to, consumers might be consoled, but we have not heard of the Spanish market sending up the price of Irish eggs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter is signed by Mr. G. Morgan, director of A. Morgan and Son, Ltd.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, from time to time, heard complaints from Cork Deputies as to the position to which the fruit trade has been reduced in respect of oranges and the position in which orange consumers have been placed. Cork people may be a bit pernickety but, if they make a complaint on this subject, it is worth airing.  We have got a Minister in Spain and that Minister is, I take it, responsible not <Col N="660" /> alone for looking after our trade position there but for interesting himself in the constitutional position. Treaties with Spain should be in accord with the constitutional position. On the wrappers in which some of these oranges from Spain came in were printed the words: &ldquo;To the honour of the English Sovereign.&rdquo;  If we have a Minister in Spain, the Spanish people ought to be informed as to what the constitutional position here is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I presume we make agreements with Spain so that there may be good economic relations between the countries, and I suggest that there should be a thorough understanding of our mutual constitutional positions so that our relations may be harmonious.  It may be that these wrappers raise the question as to whether these oranges came from Spain or from some place we do not know of in the backwoods.  On the wrappers are the words &ldquo;Our Sovereign&rdquo; and a representation of the head of Queen Victoria, with the date 1928.  Apparently, they have not yet heard that it should be &ldquo;the late Queen Victoria.&rdquo; The Minister in finicking with trade agreements could have taken measures to safeguard Irish farmers who drink Spanish wine so that they would not have to drink any substitute.  This is simply bluff, bluster and pretence.  I would like the Minister to deal with the Spanish agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a much better ratio I admit than is the case with most other countries we have dealings with, outside Great Britain.  In the German agreement, we find, beside the three to one basis of the Spanish agreement about which nothing at all was said, it works out at something less than three to one. The Minister should take the opportunity on this Bill to discuss the ratio, <Col N="661" /> as it were, that he hopes to reach in an agreement for trade with Spain. The sooner we know something about it the better.  If we knew the Minister's own mind on the subject, then we might be able to get back to the position of getting rid of our eggs in a better market.</P>

      <P>This Bill implements a Bill for a trade agreement which formed part of a series of trade agreements, and it is interesting to recall the genesis of this agreement with the Treaty and the Bill before us now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I think it is desirable that you, Sir, should indicate the limits of debate on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of them said he was gratified to think that he could destroy in 100 days what had been a profitable trade practice that it had taken 100 years to build up.  Why?  Because they had got a Spanish trade agreement; they had got a German trade agreement, and they had got the alternative markets that Ireland had been yearning for for 700 years.  The alternative markets when weighed up consisted in our purchasing £12,735,955 worth of merchandise from countries other than the United Kingdom, and these countries, of which Spain is one, purchased goods worth £623,530 from us.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to the three to one ratio.  In fact, it would be true to describe the alternative markets, which the zeal, foresight and the brilliance of the Fianna Fáil Party have won for us, not as a three to one but a seven to one ratio.  That is all so far as the deals that have taken place go, and we may hope that an improvement will advance with the same rapidity that the Republic advances for this liberty-loving, economic country.  In the Spanish trade agreement there were several considerations. We were to give Spain every consideration that they were to give us.  One consideration we were to give Spain is being implemented by <Col N="662" /> this Bill.  That was that we would restrict the titles under which wines could be sold in this country and that in exchange they were to take eggs from us.  What has actually happened? As Deputies who are familiar with our agricultural produce know, eggs are graded into extra selected, selected, medium pullets' eggs, trade eggs and duck eggs.  Great Britain has consistently taken from this country all grades of eggs at appropriate prices.  Will the gallant Spaniard take them?  Not on your life.  Will the generous German take them?  Not in a month of Sundays. They lay down that they will take only extra selected, and that we can do what we like with the medium trade&mdash;dump them on innocent John Bull.  John Bull is long-suffering and by many is regarded as a stupid nation.  But there are limits to what he will stand for, and if the Fianna Fáil Government think that we can send all the extra selected to the Continent and hope to dump the refuse on Great Britain, they never made a greater mistake in their lives.  Of course, when they discover that, the policy will be changed, and we will have to fight our way back into the British egg market with our hats in our hands, craving readmission to a valuable market out of which we voluntarily walked in order to provide the cream of our trade and production for Spain and Germany, two countries that will not take the lower grade eggs because they cannot use them.  That would be bad enough.  But anyone who has been dealing with Great Britain knows that where you send goods to a reputable British firm they pay for them.  There were no bones about that on the part of the British Government. You get your money, lodge it in the bank and there was an end to the transaction.  Will Spain do that?  Not at all.  If you send eggs to Madrid the merchant there expresses his readiness to pay but the Government says, &ldquo;No, you will not.  We will not release currency for you to pay that debt.&rdquo; There have been delays of three months, and up to five months, in getting money out of Spain to pay for consignments of eggs delivered there. These eggs were delivered to solvent merchants who were prepared to pay <Col N="663" /> if their own Government would let them.</P>
      <P>I suggest when that situation develops we ought to set up in this country a clearing house arrangement so that any moneys that fall due here in respect of Spanish exports to Saorstát Eireann could be ear-marked to liquidate moneys due for products sent from here to Spain.  Nothing has been done along these lines as yet. Even if that is done, we have to consider whether we are in fact getting value for the money we spent.  Whether we are or not, no time should be lost, if the Spanish Government continues to take up the position that they will not admit of free currency export to pay for Irish goods, in establishing a clearing house arrangement.  It is true that we will not have a sufficient fund here to liquidate all claims against us, because we are buying more from Spain than Spain is buying from us.</P>

      <P>It is true that we have a large surplus of money going from Saorstát Eireann to Spain, as we are actually sending to the Spaniards one-third more than the sum in which we are liable to them.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture should take steps to see if that receives consideration. We find that these foreign markets take the cream of our produce. Now we come to the last aspect.  Is what they are sending to us of as good quality as we can get in the markets of the world and as cheap?  At least we are entitled to expect, when we enter into a trade agreement, that we will get fair value for our money.  Are we getting it?  I do not know how many Deputies share my liking for <Col N="664" /> oranges, and I do not know how many Deputies may have business dealings in oranges.  If they have dealings they will know that we are getting the scourings of the Spanish-Valencia trade.  There is rubbish being shipped to this country which should bring a blush of shame to the Spanish Exporters' Association, and we are being denied access to abundant supplies of excellent Jaffa oranges from Palestine except in so far as the quota which the Minister allots to importers will go.</P>
      <P>What has been the effect of the quota?  The effect of the quota which he has placed on Jaffa oranges has been to admit a certain amount of them, but it has also created an artificial scarcity of them, with the result that Jaffa oranges have been sold in this country not only at 25/- a case, but I have bought them at 32/- a case, and I have seen them offered, but did not buy them, at 36/- a case.  I may add that I immediately communicated with the Prices Controller asking him to investigate the matter, and he replied that he had no power unless I made a specific claim, backed by an invoice, showing that I paid the price that had been demanded of me, naming the person who had offered me the goods and a variety of other details which I did not get and could not get, so nothing came of it.  I was not going to pay an exorbitant price for oranges in order to grease the wheels of the Prices Controller's machinery, and I could not get information of a written character from a man who had given me the quotation days before, more particularly if he knew I intended to give the information to the Prices Controller. Thirdly, I was extremely reluctant to be the agent of setting the Prices Controller in motion in respect of an old friend in commerce with whom I had been dealing for years and who simply paid the ruling price for these oranges on the Irish market.  I do not wish to go further into that matter now, for I might stray outside the strict relevance of the matter we have under consideration.</P>

      <P>Certainly not intentionally. I think this Bill is totally analogous to legislation which had its origin in an old Anglo-Portuguese treaty.  I suggest it is not sufficient to introduce legislation of this kind on the occasion of trade agreements of this character.  It would be a much more sensible thing if the Minister would ask his responsible colleague to introduce legislation for the protection of the citizens of this country rather than for external powers who are sending exports here.  It does not seem reasonable that there should be any uneasiness about compelling people to describe wine correctly.  I suggest the Minister should look into the whole question of the trade description of wines coming from Spain and Portugal and such other countries as are sending wine here and then propose legislation compelling all wines to be properly described and such wines as had not got a proper description with them should bear upon the bottle a clear description of how the wine has been manufactured.</P>
      <P>There is stuff being sold in this country since the Irish-Portuguese treaty which cannot be called port but which is being sold as good red wine and which is, in fact, a loathsome, synthetic product which I believe, under certain conditions, can be highly poisonous.  I make three suggestions to the Minister: First of all, that he should insist on the Spanish Government raising the standard of oranges sent here under the trade agreement; that he should, if possible, allow in a larger quota of Jaffa oranges and let in the Valencia oranges after the Jaffa orange season has closed.  Secondly, that he should set up a clearing-house system in order to secure prompt payment for any agricultural exports that we send to Spain.  Thirdly, that he should widen the scope of this wine legislation and extend it to all wines offered for sale by licensed grocers and publicans in order that the Irish public may get the benefit of the correct naming of anything offered as wine in a bottle.</P>

      <P>Whenever any Government proposal is brought before the House.  Deputy Mulcahy always demands <Col N="666" /> some other policy.  The monotonous repetition of that phrase by him day after day is indicative of the complete absence of policy in his own Party.  If he thinks some other policy is possible and practicable and desirable, why not give the House the benefit of his views as to the nature of that policy?  I do not think it is unreasonable that we should ask members of the Opposition, when they purport to criticise Government proposals and demand alternative proposals, that they should give us their own views as to what lines these alternative proposals should follow.  It is indicative of the bankruptcy in policy of the Party opposite that they never attempt any constructive criticism of Government policy.  In fact, even in their destructive criticism they are frequently self-contradictory and ineffective. They have been ineffective on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy juggled with figures, trying to convince himself he was proving something when, in fact, he was proving nothing.  An agreement was made with Spain for a year under which we agreed to take a certain quantity of oranges and in return they undertook to take a corresponding quantity of eggs from us. That is not a 3 to 1 or 12 to 1 agreement. It is an agreement for the exchange of stated quantities of stated commodities.  If Spain sold goods other than oranges she did so without any assistance from us.  She was selling in a free market and our people purchased Spanish goods because they were cheaper or better or more convenient to purchase than similar goods from other countries. If we sold in Spain goods other than eggs, it was for the same reason.  A very large part of the £12,000,000 worth of goods which we import from other countries is represented by goods that we cannot purchase anywhere else except in the countries from which we are getting them. Take petrol, tea, wheat and maize and what is left?  Practically nothing. And yet Deputies endeavour to make a political point out of that.  Such an attitude is completely futile and useless, because everybody knows the <Col N="667" /> facts.  Deputy Dillon's suggestion that we should buy oranges from Jerusalem instead of Spain represents the height of the political wisdom of Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>If there has been a decline in our export of eggs to Great Britain it has been due entirely to the fact that the British Government decided that British hens could lay as good eggs as the eggs exported from this country.  That decline in our export had no relation whatever to the economic dispute between them and us, and was related solely to their own internal circumstances and the decision to protect the egg producers of Great Britain.  This agreement with Spain opened up for the egg producers of this country a new and valuable market, a market which in the present circumstances is more valuable than the British market, a market that is likely to be permanent and offers considerable <Col N="668" /> opportunities for expansion. It is the first agreement we have had with Spain.  Deputy Mulcahy is complaining that our trade with Spain is favourable to Spain.  This is now the first attempt to rectify that.  The Government which preceded us had no interest in any market outside of Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will work it out.  The most remarkable fact about the orange trade with Spain is that during July, August and September, when there were no Spanish oranges imported and no oranges from Spain being sold here, we had debates in the Dáil and we had the columns of the newspapers filled up with letters <Col N="669" /> from people, who knew nothing about the business, complaining about the quality of the oranges imported.  That was happening at the one time in the year when no Spanish oranges were available and certainly none imported here.  The oranges began to be imported here in the middle of last November, and I defy General Mulcahy to produce a single complaint in any newspaper since that date or a single reference in the Dáil debates to justify his contention that there are complaints now about Spanish oranges. There are complaints relating to the regulations my Department made, regulations that have nothing to do with this.  Heretofore the position was that oranges that were intended for this country were imported into Great Britain and paid customs duty to the British Government.  These oranges were handled by British merchants who reaped profits from them and shipped them to this country.</P>

      <P>No, in breaking down the wall that was erected around this country and in helping importers to establish direct relations.  There are now direct steamship services between Irish ports and Spain.  We have availed of the obvious possibilities in implementing that policy in the case of the <Col N="670" /> oranges, using our powers under the Control of Imports Act, to impose certain obligations upon all importers and to give certain facilities to those who availed of the Irish shipping services established between this country and Spain in consequence of these relations. That is good national policy and leads to the fulfilment of what the Nationalists in this country for many generations desired to see operating in this country.  I think that Deputy Mulcahy himself in his Nationalist past probably made speeches as to the desirability of having such an arrangement imposed.</P>

Here were people capable of absorbing large quantities of our eggs and the possible developments are such that the trade is likely to extend.  This Bill is solely to protect and preserve the trade names of Spanish wines.  We will do that with other countries when these countries act by us in the manner in <Col N="671" /> which Spain has.  The efforts made by us to protect our own trade names have not been successful.  There is no reason why we should make an effort to protect the trade names of other countries.  There is no reason why we should go further along that road of international co-operation until those other countries are prepared to act with us.  If we can make arrangements with other nations involving improved trading prospects for this country&mdash;nations that grant protection of that kind to our interests abroad&mdash;we are prepared to do the same for them but there is no reason why we should rush in until there is evidence of a return to follow.</P>

      <P>So far as all our international trade with Spain or with other countries at the present time is concerned, there are difficulties arising from exchange restrictions.  So far as Spain is concerned we have got the rights of the most favoured nation treatment in matters relating to exchange.  The Spanish Government has, however, certain difficulties arising from its own internal economic situation which have resulted in delays in making exchange available for the payment of Irish exports to that country.</P>
      <P>That position may be rectified by voluntary action&mdash;action which could be taken in relation to the Spanish trade similar to what was taken in relation to the German trade, where legislation was not required although some difficulty arose.  It is not improbable that we may decide to put the matter upon a more regular footing by the introduction of legislation.  Whether that legislation will relate only to the Spanish situation or to international trade in general is another question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill deals in a general way with the production and cleaning of seed, and the selling of seed to the purchaser who is about to sow it.  Deputies are aware that we either produce seeds or import them, and provision is made under this Bill that we are to get the best possible type of seed whether it is produced or imported.  There are also provisions about the licensing of seed cleaners, etc.  It is also proposed in this Bill to repeal all existing seeds legislation, so that this, if passed, will be the only Act dealing with that subject.  I think as it is a Bill which deals more or less with a lot of small matters, the simplest way to deal with it is to say a few words on some of the sections. Section 3 enables the Minister to prohibit the importation of any class of agricultural seed which it may be found necessary to control, so as to ensure that only strains of approved varieties will be imported, that is to say, varieties which are suitable to this country; and also that imported seed would bear a guarantee that the seed is true to type, that it is pure, and so on.  The next section, of course, is a section dealing with the usual licensing clauses where the importation is allowed.  Section 5 permits small samples which come in to be exempt from this Order of prohibition, so that seed merchants may be enabled to get in samples without any restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the commercial cleaning of seed.  As this is a very important matter, and as it will be a growing industry in the country, if we are going to produce our own seed and have it properly cleaned, it will be necessary to license those who engage in that business.  The section deals only with what might be termed seed-cleaning on a commercial basis, that is to say, it does not deal with the cleaning of seed, say, by the threshing machine, or with the case of the farmer who cleans seed for himself.  I think it will be necessary to have two amendments to this section: first, an <Col N="673" /> amendment giving the Minister power to prescribe from time to time the classes of seed to which this section will apply, and, secondly, an amendment giving the farmer the right to clean seed for his own use even though he does not produce it.  The section as it stands would not give the farmer that right.  Section 8 provides for penalties for the sale of seed containing an excessive percentage of injurious weed seeds.  It is dealt with in that way purposely rather than by prescribing a certain purity of seed, because it is more injurious to purchase, say, grass seed which contains a small percentage of weed seed than to purchase grass seed that is only impure in so far as it contains another good grass seed.  To take an example: say a person purchases what purports to be Italian rye-grass, but which might contain say 10 per cent. of perennial rye-grass.  That would not perhaps do as much harm as if he purchased what was supposed to be Italian rye-grass and which contained 2 or 3 per cent. of dock seeds.  What we mean to prescribe, therefore, under this section is that it must not contain more than a certain percentage of stated noxious weeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the percentage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be stated from time to time.  We will make it small, naturally.  Packeted seeds are dealt with under Section 9.  There appears to be some abuse in the sale of packeted seeds.  Some traders who have seeds in packets left over sell them the following year.  We have to deal with that abuse as far as we possibly can. We have to see that the packets will be properly dated, and that the origin and any other information which will be asked for will be marked on the packet.  There is, by the way, a mistake in line 31.  The word &ldquo;box&rdquo; should be &ldquo;bag&rdquo;.  That will be amended on the Committee Stage. Section 10 enables the Minister to prescribe, if necessary, the form of invoices, so as to secure that the purchaser is definitely assured that he is getting the variety or strain which he wishes to buy.  We have not got sufficient powers at the present moment dealing with that matter, and I think it is most important that those invoices <Col N="674" /> should give the necessary information to the purchaser.  If that had been the law for the past two or three years we would not have had the same difficulty in the case of certain varieties of winter wheat which were sold as spring wheat.</P>
      <P>Section 11 is to ensure to the producers of pure seed that they will not have their crop either cross-fertilised or injured by certain flowering plants growing in the vicinity.  Section 12 goes a bit further, and would be brought into operation only where Section 11 fails.  Sections 11 and 12 may become much more important sections as time goes on.  If we find that the present experiments, which we are carrying out, are successful and arrive at a stage where we feel we can produce our own root seeds here&mdash;turnips, beet and so on&mdash;it will be necessary to see that there are no flowering plants in the neighbourhood that would injure those crops.  For instance, if we are producing turnip seed we might have to make an Order against having rape flower in the vicinity.  If we are producing beet we might have to make an Order against mangolds and even parsnips growing in the vicinity and coming to the flowering stage.  Section 12, as I say, is more drastic than Section 11 and would be resorted to only if Section 11 proves to be ineffective in any particular area or in regard to any particular crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not exactly know what the Deputy means by that.  Perhaps he would ask me afterwards, as I should like to know what he means by that.  Section 13 re-enacts the provisions in existing legislation in regard to the sale of agricultural seeds.  It gives more power in the taking of samples and in the testing of those samples.  Of course, we have at present power to take samples from seed merchants, and it has been the practice to publish the names of seed merchants where the seeds are not up to standard. If the seed merchant is found to have offended on a number of occasions he is put upon a black list issued by the Department.  This section will run very much on the same lines, except that power is taken to take samples at <Col N="675" /> market places and so on, in addition to the shops where these things are sold.</P>
      <P>I think that that practically covers all that there is to be covered in this legislation upon seeds.  It will probably be necessary to introduce two or three amendments to which I have referred.  The necessity for the Bill, I am sure, is recognised by all Deputies, and I shall be only too glad to get any helpful suggestions that may be given for further amendment if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle of protecting farmers from impure and unsatisfactory seeds is, of course, something in which we would all wish to co-operate and the important thing in carrying out a reform of this kind is, one, to be practical, and the other, not to be too radical, lest popular opinion be raised against your well-intentioned efforts to protect the people from fraud of any kind.  The first question that arises in my mind is this.  Section 1 purports to define agricultural seeds.  It is elaborated by Section 2, which says that for the purposes of this Act the Minister may from time to time prescribe, by order, the classes of seeds which shall be agricultural seeds.  The Minister ought to tell us what class of seed he has in mind, because it is not easy to envisage clearly what is going to be prescribed as agricultural seeds when you read the rest of the Bill.  Do bulbs come under the heading of seeds?  Does the Minister intend to include seed potatoes? Has he principally in mind agricultural or horticultural seeds? Does he consider that the Bill covers tubers, such as are popularly sown for the production of certain types of vegetables&mdash;seakale, rhubarb, and plants of that character?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice heretofore in Bills of this kind has been to annex to the Bill a schedule setting out at least the types of seed which the Minister proposes to deal with.  That practice is here departed from.  We are introduced to the sound old bureaucratic practice: &ldquo;Give us the power and we will do the job.&rdquo;  Section 2 says, in effect: &ldquo;Give us the power to say what things this Bill will deal with and we will inform the public what is best.&rdquo;  I think it is a pity, because it <Col N="676" /> makes it more difficult to offer helpful suggestions of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The seed cleaning provisos, I assume, are really in effect going to create a privileged class of importers, because we are going to have a register of persons engaged in the business of cleaning agricultural seeds. We are going to have powers to prohibit and to restrict imports of agricultural seeds.  Sooner or later the Minister will want to admit a certain quantity of agricultural seeds, and he will have to admit that quantity of seeds through some roster of merchants. I take it that is going to be the seed cleaners.  The Minister ought to let us know what he has in mind in that connection.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the sale of seeds, retail, in packets.  I have a good deal of experience of this trading in agricultural seeds and my experience of it is that you have three types of person engaged in the distribution of agricultural seeds in this country. You have the seed importer, the man who is doing seeds in a big way, probably packaging a large quantity of vegetable and root seeds under proprietary names and selling, wholesale, large quantities of seed oats and seed grasses.  These people are mostly to be found in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Dublin and the ports.  They would do a considerable retail trade and they would also send wholesale supplies to rural distributors&mdash;I want rural distributors to mean the shopkeepers in the larger centres, in the more considerable towns.  They are the second string in the business of seed distribution. In addition to these, you have the smaller shopkeeper, whose place of business is at the country cross-roads and who is doing a small business in seeds.  You want to ensure that all these three types of seed merchants will sell to the farmers seeds which are accurately described for what they are and which have not deteriorated as a result of being kept too long, from year to year, or deteriorated from damp or some other condition that obtains in the places where they have been stored.</P>
    <P>I have often thought of how best that problem could be surmounted and it is very difficult to make suggestions <Col N="677" /> unless one knows what the Minister has in mind.  When you are dealing with grass seeds, perennial and Italian, it is very difficult to sell them in sealed packets, for this reason, that the average small farmer who comes in will tell you how much land he wants to sow and he wants the supplier to weigh and mix for him a perennial rye grass that he will use on that piece of land.  One man will have a rood, another man will have an Irish rood, another man will have two statute roods, and you never can tell from customer to customer what quantity you will have to supply.  So it is very difficult to arrive at a standard package that will fit into everybody's requirements.</P>
    <P>No such difficulty exists in respect to turnips or root seeds, but the difficulty does exist in a very acute form in respect to grass seeds other than Italian and perennial.  I have always believed that one of the great necessities of the seed trade was to introduce Irish farmers, who are sowing grass seeds, to a better variety and a better assortment of grass seeds than they have been in the practice of sowing. In large parts of this country men will buy Italian, perennial and English red clover.  Well, that is an extremely bad assortment of seeds, but it is very difficult to introduce them to Manifesto and Timothy and the other varieties of meadow grasses that ought to form part of any grass-seed mixture.  It would be almost impossible if you were selling any of these minor grass seeds in sealed packages, but there is a great range of seeds that can conveniently be sold in packages.</P>
    <P>I should like to provide that all retailers&mdash;all distributors&mdash;of agricultural seeds should be licensed, and that any person who wished to sell agricultural seeds without taking out a licence would be precluded from selling them except in packages which had been sealed by a licensed seed dealer. Now, that means that you would have licensed seed dealers in Dublin.  Go down to a town like Mullingar and there might be three merchants there who would apply for licences to be seed dealers and they might get their licences and they might sell agricultural seeds in the package of another <Col N="678" /> licensed dealer, or they might buy agricultural seeds in bulk and package them themselves putting their own name on the packet and the statutory information that all packeted seeds would be required to bear.  Then you would have the small cross-roads shopkeeper who, for the convenience of his neighbours, might also wish to sell seed.  I would let him sell them on condition that he sold them in the sealed package of a licensed seed dealer.  He could buy that from the local seed dealer or get his supply direct from a Dublin seed dealer, but you would ensure that no one would be authorised to offer to a farmer any agricultural seeds which did not bear upon the package the date, the quality, and the guaranteed germination.  I do not believe that such a condition is going to be onerous or impossible, and I believe it would be an enormous improvement on the existing arrangement.</P>
    <P>Now, however, when you come to the question of seed oats and grass seed, I should very much like to hear from some other Deputies whether they think it would be practicable to provide that seed oats should only be sold by seedsmen who are holding themselves out as giving a certain high-grade commodity in sealed bags.  At present, I have had more than one case brought under my notice in which merchants who had little or no knowledge of agricultural matters offered and actually sold kiln dried oats for seed oats, and men have gone out and prepared their land, sowed their crop, and of course not a grain ever came to germination at all.  I am afraid that there is very grave danger that an unscrupulous merchant, if he had some feeding oats on his hands&mdash;kiln dried oats that he could not get rid of&mdash;and if he had a considerable trade in seed oats, could very easily mix the kiln dried oats in with the seed oats and sell them.  Mind you, at present the inspectors come in and take a sample of your seeds and send them away.  I grant you that, but there is nothing to prevent any man, after the oats have been tested in the bin, or wherever he is exposing them for sale, once the inspector has gone and the merchant feels pretty sure that he will not be <Col N="679" /> coming back for a certain time&mdash;there is nothing to prevent that merchant introducing some of these kiln dried oats into the seed oats that he has for sale.  I think it should be possible to prescribe that seed oats offered for sale by a seed merchant must be offered in a bag bearing particulars just as a bag of Indian meal at the present time bears certain particulars. When you come to grass seeds, however, I do not see how it could be done, with the exception of clover which, at present, is sold in almost all cases in sealed bags with a full description of its origin and other relevant facts.</P>
    <P>I cannot quite understand whether this Bill would interfere with the ordinary course of trade that proceeds in our markets.  The present practice is that the farmer brings in oats to the market and offers them for sale as seed, or for food purposes, and so on. I do not think the Minister ought to interfere with that practice, at present at any rate, because it would be a very great nuisance and would cause very great loss to many farmers.  The sound general rule of a purchaser going into a market is caveat emptor.  He knows when he is going into the open market that he is buying something that he cannot expect to be of as high a quality or as scrupulously guaranteed as something that he would buy in a sealed bag with a written guarantee, and, to interfere with that well-established practice at the present juncture would be to do something much more radical than the situation would justify.</P>
    <P>The Minister, under Sections 11 and 12, deals with the problem he foresees may arise when we are producing original seeds in this country.  Now, to tell the truth, all this talk about producing original agricultural seeds in this country for the requirements of Irish farmers is moonshine, because so long as we want the right strains of whatever crops we are going to produce, a large part of the agricultural and even of the horticultural seeds we use must be imported. Take, for instance, onions and carrots.  The Minister contemplates urging a wider cultivation of onions <Col N="680" /> as a semi-agricultural market-garden crop in this country.  You cannot grow onion seed in this country.  You have got to import it from abroad&mdash; either from South Italy or, I think, from Northern Africa.  Onion seed will not grow here.  Then take carrot seeds.  You cannot grow carrot seeds here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, go on.  Develop that general statement you made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot grow carrot seeds here, and there are a number of other seeds which, for the ordinary market agricultural business, cannot be effectively and properly produced here.  In addition to that, I do not believe in this business of seriously interfering with the free supplies of the raw materials of an important industry.  Agriculture is an important industry in this country, and our agriculture is the agriculture of the finished product.  It is the greatest folly, in order to promote an entirely subsidiary business, to jeopardise a very important industry like the agricultural industry by interfering with its supplies of raw material.  Good seeds&mdash;the best seeds the world can produce&mdash;are the raw material of Irish agriculture and, in my opinion, any intensive campaign to restrict access to foreign markets for the best seeds that money can buy would be a grave mistake in policy and a mistake into which no other country in the world that I know of has fallen.  A lot of people think that the seeds required for agriculture in Great Britain are grown in Great Britain.  As a matter of fact, less than 2 per cent. of the seeds required for agriculture in Britain are grown there.  Seeds are grown all over the world and the best stocks picked out and distributed to the British farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something has occurred to my mind, however, in connection with these restrictive powers contained in Sections 11 and 12, and I should be glad to hear <Col N="681" /> from the Minister whether the Department of Agriculture has any view on this question or not.  Every good farmer is plagued by an incompetent neighbour.  Under the Thistles Act, or one of those Acts of Parliament, that situation is recognised, and you can compel by law a lazy neighbour to cut his thistles before they seed the neighbouring land.  Here, under Section 11, we can compel a man to remove a crop before it seeds, and under Section 12, unless he shows himself willing to do that, we can prohibit him from growing the crop.  I wonder has the time come to consider whether farmers who grow potatoes, for instance, should not be required to spray before a certain date?  If every farmer in a district sprayed in time to prevent blight striking the potato crop at all, you should be able to keep blight out of the district altogether, for that season in any case.  It is only when the disease gets a grip in a particular district that it spreads round about the particular focus of the disease.</P>
    <P>There are other diseases of that kind which are spread from the land of one farmer to that of another.  I do not know what the cause of smut is, but I believe it is largely a disease which infects wheat seed rather than being air-borne by the plant itself.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether the occurrence of smut in wheat is likely to contaminate the wheat of a neighbouring field, the seed of which was free from that contamination. Can that wheat disease be borne from one crop of wheat to another, and, if it can, can smut in one field affect wheat in another field, or can it affect the seed that would be obtained from the second crop and pass on the disease into the crop that would be grown from that seed?  If so, I think we ought to consider ways and means, possibly through the agency of local associations, to secure that proper precautions will be taken by farmers growing crops in order to avoid the disease attacking their crops, thus jeopardising the crops of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is the usual objectionable kind of section.  &ldquo;The Minister may <Col N="682" /> by order make regulations for the purpose of prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo;  Well, of course, that is the usual practice of legislating by order and we have not the faintest notion of what the nature of these orders is going to be.  The Minister has not told us what be intends to schedule as agricultural seed.  I object, in principle, to any section of that kind.  The Minister ought to inform us what he considers necessary and seek our co-operation in getting whatever powers he stands in need of, without putting in sections giving him power to legislate by regulation. He may rest assured that he will get all the co-operation he wants on this side of the House, in making his purpose effective, but there are a number of points which I have mentioned on which I should like to have information as to what the expert view of the Department of Agriculture is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see this Bill introduced though it deals more with the commercial aspect of seed than it does with the production of seed. Deputy Dillon made the general statement that he hoped there would be no ramp towards the development and the raising of seed on a big scale in this country.  I think that is the gist of the general statement made by the Deputy.  I will agree with him this far, that I hope there will be no ramp merely for the sake of saying a few pounds, for saving the little expense, very little comparatively, that imported seeds cost us.  I have always been a strong believer in the production of native seeds, not for the sake of the few pounds that would be saved, even if the cost of the seeds were to be doubled.  I am a firm believer, however, in the raising of seeds in this country that will have, so to speak, a sufficient infusion of new blood but which, at the same time, are acclimatised to this country.  Ordinary seeds which can be raised in this country successfully will produce better results in the second and third year after importation than the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give what I consider a classic instance of the advantage of seeds being acclimatised.  Some ten years ago, under the Committee of Agriculture <Col N="683" /> for County Dublin, I carried out an experiment with 12 different varieties of Savoy cabbage.  These were obtained from the leading seedsmen in England and they were informed that the seeds were being utilised for experimental purposes.  There was either a half pound or a pound of each variety. It was a large-scale experiment.  The best seeds that these merchants had&mdash; it was in their interests to provide the best seeds&mdash;were provided and they were grown alongside and under similar conditions to an old Dublin strain of Savoy cabbage that had not been raised by any scientific methods other than the methods that were handed down from father to son for about 100 years in the Country Dublin.  There was no comparison between the value of those best seeds supplied us by the British seedsmen and the native variety.  To give an instance, on the same day I had similar loads in the Dublin market.  I got 15/- per load for the British strain and £5 per load for the Dublin strain.  I have heard that the Dublin strain was sent to England but that its cultivation there had disastrous results.  There is a broccoli, a native of County Dublin, a strain which, when grown here, surpasses anything that can be bought from the seed merchants in this country or Britain, but it was brought over to England and it was a failure there. The Minister cannot be expected to know everything or to hear everything, but it would be worth his while to inquire because I know the experimenters&mdash;whether that is the technical term or not, I do not know&mdash;in the Albert College in Glasnevin can verify what I am saying.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is not going to be an end in itself, but that it is going to be the small beginning of a big move, and that the Minister, or whatever Minister may succeed him, will not be concerned to save a few pounds, but that, if necessary, he will spend a few pounds, because the Minister or the farmer who tries to economise in money in the matter of seeds is neither a Minister nor a farmer.  Anybody who buys seeds should buy the best, for an expenditure of a few shillings in seeding is very little compared <Col N="684" /> with the pounds that will be won or lost when the crop is harvested.  I thought Deputy Dillon was developing a point about the mixing of grass seeds.  I do not think the Bill precludes a seed merchant from mixing grass seeds for customers.  I always prefer to get grass seeds mixed by a merchant of repute, and I do not know whether the time has not come to consider whether the cross-roads merchant mentioned by Deputy Dillon should be permitted to continue in the seed trade.  I think the matter should be examined.  Most people consider that the handling of seeds is no more than the handling of tea, sugar, eggs or butter, but the handling of seeds is a specialised trade, and, so far as the commercial end of it is concerned, I do not think it should be let out of the hands of the specialists.</P>
    <P>The same applies to artificial manure although we are not dealing with artificial manure.  The seed must be right and it is not good enough to have it right originally.  It must be handled properly until it is put into the ground. The Minister should consider whether the people who are handling seed throughout the country understand the handling of it, because, after all, on the seed that is put into the soil depends the crop that will be harvested and the volume and quality of that crop.  I am quite sure that the Minister, having taken up this matter, will look after the commercial side of it, but I urge him not to let the grass grow under his feet before we start raising in this country the seeds of all the ordinary crops grown here.  Beet has become an important crop in this country, whatever we may think of it. I had no illusions about it at any time. I knew it could never be grown economically here on the present sugar contest of beet, and neither can it, but if we could raise the sugar contest of beet to 25 per cent., it would be a commercial proposition and it would be a crop that we could grow and which would stand on its own.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should give special attention to having selections made of beet with a high sugar content and breed new strains of beet seed in this country, because in no other way will beet be a success <Col N="685" /> in the future.  It is all very well to say that people are anxious to grow beet now.  Of course, they are, but if we had normal conditions, in which every crop and every animal would pull its normal weight in the agricultural economy, I think the Minister would find it very difficult to get the raw material for his factories. That was my opinion before the factories were established, and it is my opinion still, and the opinion of many others.  Yet I do not think any of us would like to see those factories becoming idle.  We all want to see them working at full tilt and to see the people of this country getting the produce of those factories at a reasonable price.  I suggest that is the only way in which we can make sure of the permanency of sugar beet production in this country.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat rusty as to the history of sugar beet cultivation now, but I think I am right in saying that, when sugar beet production was first thought of, there was only a sugar content of three or four per cent.  By scientific breeding of selected roots and by raising from them a strain of seed, sugar beet has been brought to its present state.  I believe that this country has surprised many experts in regard to the high sugar content of its beet.  If that is so, is there not opened up a very inviting field for plant breeding and the raising of new strains of seed in relation to beet, native to this country? The same applies to nearly all seeds. I am not so sure of onion seed but the carrots and the parsnips which hold their place in the Dublin market in competition with any other strains, are strains generations old, raised in the village of Rush.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot beat the Rush man for carrots.  Whatever can be raised here, the experience of all of us has been that, when it becomes <Col N="686" /> acclimatised, it is better than it was when it was foreign to this soil, and, as we are so very near the wind in the matter of beet, it is very important that the Minister should set his machinery in motion to produce better strains, if possible.  He may go on for years, and if he starts the effort, it may perhaps be the fourth or fifth Minister for Agriculture ahead who may have the honour of producing that prolific strain that may mean the difference between uneconomic sugar production and economic sugar production. But no matter what Minister garners the honour of that experiment, I think the greatest honour will lie with the Minister who starts it, because if it is not started nobody can ever reap the reward of it.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to handle seeds in a commercial way.  I think it is correct to say that those who are seed merchants and nothing else all have their own cleaning machinery.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has taken them into consultation.  My information is that he has not, but I hope I am wrong.  I may say that this Bill has caused something more than a flutter amongst the seed merchants.  I have been in touch with them.  I am aware that they contemplate holding a meeting.  That does not mean that they are in any way hostile to or in opposition to the Minister.  The object is to get an expression of their views. The result of its deliberations may be available for Deputies before the Committee Stage of the Bill is taken.  I think that in matters of this kind people who are specialists should be consulted by the Minister, because they can teach those who cannot claim to have that advantage, and, of course, the Minister appreciates that. I am sure he is not offended with me for saying that.  A specialist can also teach the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything to be said against the Bill.  The Minister stressed the necessity of having to use compulsory powers in a locality where seeds were being raised in order to compel owners of land in which related crops were growing wild and seeding to remove them.  I am glad that it is <Col N="687" /> proposed to do that.  It should have been done years ago.  It is an extraordinary thing that the Department of Agriculture has power to compel farmers to cut weeds&mdash;a very good thing&mdash;but that neither it nor the county committee of agriculture had power to interfere with a man who was raising in an adjoining field bolters of turnips from a nondescript type of cabbage and allowing these to remain in flower and cross-fertilise with a pure breed of seed on his neighbour's land.  The Bill is worthy of support for that one provision alone, as it will put an end to that kind of thing.  My only regret is that the Bill does not go far enough in an experimental way.</P>

      <P>If the Minister uses foolishly the power that you give him then remove him.  The Minister must have power to do these things.  I will tell the Deputy an experience I had a few years ago.  A man who was endeavouring to save a strain of Dublin-Savoy cabbage in the village of Swords came to see me.  He had a promising crop, but beside him was a neighbour who had bolters of York cabbage and wild turnips growing in his field.  This man believed that these were deliberately planted and kept there in order to spoil his seed.  I was Chairman of the Dublin County Committee of Agriculture at the time.  He came to me and sought my advice.  I found that there was no authority to stop his neighbour from what he was doing.  The Department of Agriculture also found that they had no authority to interfere.  What happened? I tried bluff.  I wrote a letter ordering this other man to have these bolters removed.  It worked.  Is it not much better that the Minister should have the power that he seeks in this Bill rather than that the chairman <Col N="688" /> of a county committee of agriculture should use bluff to get the right thing done?</P>

He will also get good advice from his officials, and therefore I am satisfied that the right thing will be done.  In a matter of this kind I would rather see the Minister with too much power than with too little.  I hope the Bill is only the beginning of a development for the raising of seeds here&mdash;for the sake of the seeds and not for the sake of saving a few pounds.</P>

      <P>I think this is a Bill that is badly needed, and I welcome it.  I could not understand which of the two legs Deputy Dillon was standing on in regard to oats.  First, he wanted all seed oats to be sold through a merchant.  Then he went on to develop that argument by saying that the Minister should not throw away the seed oats market.  Farmers find that oats grown on limestone land gives the best return.  Farmers in portion of my constituency are very glad to go out to Glanworth, where they grow a special strain of oats on limestone land.  They buy their oats there.  The farmers in that district take very good care of their seeds in preparing them.  Messrs. Bennett, of Ballinacurra, have been accustomed to give out both seed oats and seed barley to certain special farmers. They visit the crop three or four times a year to see that all weeds, etc., are removed from it, and then pay an extra £1 or £2 per ton for the oats after harvest.  They buy it in again as seed.  In that manner they get special varieties of seed that have been well grown and cared for, and that can be guaranteed in the market.  I hope that we are not going to have the position in which all farmers will have to take in their oats to the seed merchant, sell it to him, and in that way allow <Col N="689" /> him to make the extra profit that should go direct to the farmer from it. With regard to Deputy Belton's remarks on beet, I can tell him that tests were carried out last year with several varieties of beet seed with a view to ascertaining the relative sugar content. My opinion is that the new policy of the Sugar Company is absolutely fatal in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Belton has ever studied the effects of weather on sugar content, or whether he knows that a beet crop pulled this week may have a totally different sugar content from that of the two next drills pulled a fortnight afterwards.  Weather has a very great effect on sugar content.  I could understand the attitude of the Sugar Company where they have to leave the beet over from one month to another before taking it into the factory.  I am sure that Deputy Belton understands that the beet-root with a high sugar content gives a rather low tonnage, and that, when you are paying on tonnage, the natural inclination of the farmer&mdash;more power to him&mdash;is to grow the big fellow, irrespective of sugar content.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to points arising in connection with Italian and perennial rye-grass.  I suggest that the Minister ought to have a very careful survey made of the quantity of good seeds available and that whatever extra quantity of these seeds is required should be allowed in free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Belton, I am an absolute believer in the home-grown strains of seed.  I believe that seeds grown in this country are better acclimatised than seeds grown in any other country and give better results. I went to the trouble of looking up the <Col N="690" /> import lists of grass seeds.  Unfortunately, the seeds are not segregated in that list.  You cannot ascertain from that list the quantities of perennial or rye-grass seeds imported separately.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be worth while to discover these quantities, to find out what quantity of these seeds will be available, and to allow in the remainder free of duty.  My particular interest in this matter is that perennial and Italian seeds are used principally by tillage farmers.  They are not what we call permanent grass seeds.  They are generally used by good tillage farmers, who plough their land very frequently. I think that a special concession should be made by the Minister, and that whatever quantity of these seeds must be imported should be allowed in free of duty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to grass seeds being mixed.  The agricultural instructors in each county give advice free to farmers in different localities as to the varieties of seed most suitable to their soil.  From what I know of the farmers in my district, the advice of the instructors is very widely availed of.  I suggest that when merchants are selling mixed seeds an invoice list of the mixture should be given, just as guarantees are given in the case of oats and barley in regard to germination and purity.</P>
    <P>I think that the Bill will greatly assist in ensuring that the seeds are free from weeds and other growths which ruin the farmer's crop in many instances.  Like Deputy Belton, I hope that this is only the first Bill of this kind.  I hope, too, the Minister will not confine his activities in this line to the introduction of Bills in the Dáil. When grants are being given to committees of agriculture, he should insist on portion of these grants being used for educational purposes in pure-line seeds.  If a little money were given in that way and a little less to the bullring, it would have a far better effect on the farmers.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that the Minister will see that Bills of this type are enforced. Any advice or assistance he requires from the farming community in general will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I agree with the principle of this Bill and I think that it will be of advantage to the farming community to be put in a position to get the best quality of any seeds which they propose to sow.  There is one matter to which I should like to refer &mdash;that is, to the question of grasses and clover seeds.  That is by far the dearest crop put into the land, and a great deal of care and consideration are necessary before a farmer can decide what is the best mixture for his particular farm.  He should be guaranteed when ordering the seeds that they are up to standard in purity and germination.  There are complaints from farmers from time to time that seeds were a failure.  That may be due to many different causes. Seeds could be a failure if they were poor seeds, if the tillage was bad, or if the weather was bad when they were sown.  The aim of the Minister in trying to secure for farmers a pure breed of any particular seed will be very welcome.  The agricultural instructors in the different counties give very useful information and numbers of boys who intend to remain on farms attend the classes that they conduct.  It is surprising how interested these boys become in that work and in testing seeds for quality and purity.  If the Minister could possibly help more in that direction it would be very useful to the farming community.  As to the rougher seeds, such as barley and oats, it is not so very hard to decide on the variety that should be sown.  What farmers aim at is to get seeds that give good quality as well as quantity.  They have also to take into consideration the quality of the straw from oats, from the point of view of feeding.  There is a great difference in the varieties of oats particularly.  A very useful book has been sent around to farmers by the agricultural instructors in which is given an account of what is done on the different demonstration plots, as well as the yield of the various crops in barrels per acre or ton.  That is very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a mistake to think that a particular variety will suit every land.  The variety and the quality of seeds that will grow and do well in one townland may not do well in the next townland. <Col N="692" /> That is well known from practical experience.  A change of seed is looked upon as being more or less essential after three or four years. Very few farmers that I know would think of sowing the same variety of seed year after year.  Even if they wished to continue sowing the same variety they would get a change from another area as there are always better results.  Any help that the Minister can give in securing the best quality of seeds will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the power the Minister is taking in the Bill, I ask him to be slow about using it until he sees how things are going, and what efforts are being made by farmers to do what they think is best for themselves.  Beet seed as far as I know is not produced in this country.  The Minister might be alert about that, considering that the price of beet is on a flat rate per ton. The quality of seed that is wanted is one that would give a fair tonnage and a fair sugar content, so that the farmers would have something decent to get out of the growing of beet.  A high sugar content will not give farmers a very big return, while there is a flat rate in operation for beet.  The Minister should be very careful about that question.  I am sure farmers will be inclined to give the Minister any help they can give.</P>

      <P>For a number of years it is 10.5.  Deputy Dillon spoke about packet seeds.  He may have given me a wrong impression of what he meant to convey, but I want to say that we do not encourage in this Bill the sale of seeds in packages.  The matter is dealt with in Section 9.  It is really a very small and unimportant trade at present as against the total amount of seeds sold.  Perhaps if there is anything that should be discussed it could be dealt with under Section 9. With regard to the sampling of seeds, the procedure followed for some years has been satisfactory.  It will be improved, of course, by some of the additional powers of inspection at markets, and with the better invoicing <Col N="693" /> of seeds, so that farmers will know from the invoice what the seeds are supposed to be, and will also have a better idea of what they get.  There is also more power to take action afterwards if they did not get what they wanted.  It is not proposed in this Bill to deal with bulbs, roots, etc.  The seeds regarded as agricultural seeds are ordinary cereals, grass seeds, clover seeds, cabbage seeds, and root seeds, but not bulbs, potatoes, or any such that do not come under the definition of agricultural seeds.  The provision regarding the taking of samples at markets, to which attention has been drawn, was put in principally to deal with a practice that prevails in certain parts of the country where any amount of inferior grass seeds, the sweepings of lofts, etc., are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked of the danger, perhaps under this Bill, of endeavouring to produce seeds that might not be suitable for our climate.  His argument was that we must have the best and that we must import them.  Deputy Belton dealt fully with that point, and I do not think there is any necessity to go further into it.  I agree with Deputy Belton that even seeds we do not produce at present, such as beet, may possibly be better grown here when we get down to the proper variety.  As Deputy Belton pointed out, it will take many years before that can be done.  At any rate, it is the duty of the Department of Agriculture to carry on whatever experiments are necessary for that purpose, to see if we cannot get a better type of beet than we have at present.  The same thing would apply to other agricultural crops.  Deputy Dillon asked whether we had ever considered the question of compulsory spraying of potatoes.  That question was considered on many occasions by the Department, and the conclusion invariably was that it would be impossible to get every farmer to spray. But without that compulsion it has become almost universal.  It is true perhaps, as Deputy Dillon stated, that the few who do not spray are doing a considerable amount of harm. I am afraid it would be impossible to <Col N="694" /> go further with the spraying arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the case of smut, it is not an air-borne disease.  In fact, I have noticed, and I am sure others have noticed, heads which are isolated and other heads all round them, almost touching them, have remained free from the disease; but when that particular head is threshed and the grain is mixed, then the whole lot of grain is likely to become contaminated.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of sugar beet, one of the clauses in the Bill, clause 12, would be absolutely necessary if we were to attempt to grow sugar beet seed, because the great danger in trying to get the best possible type of sugar beet would be cross-fertilisation with flowering mangolds, parsnips, garden beet and sugar mangolds.  It would be necessary to have the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 in force and perhaps to take over a certain district and keep it entirely clear of these other plants at least reaching the flowering stage, in order to produce the best possible type of sugar beet.  Experiments we have carried out so far with sugar beet have proved that we can produce beet seed here.  We do not yet know whether it is good or otherwise.  It will take a good many years to get that seed proved, as Deputy Belton says, by growing a field of beet from our own seed, taking out all that beet, finding out what is the strain that is giving the highest sugar content and then getting down to half-a-dozen plants of a certain type and growing seeds from them.  It will take years before we succeed in developing here a variety of sugar beet seed that is superior to the one we are growing. But it is worth continuing to experiment and persevering to see if it is possible.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Belton that sugar beet would not be grown if other prices were to improve.  I think what Deputy Belton and others have in mind is if we were getting as good prices as British farmers for all their produce.  The British farmers are continuing to supply the factories in England with beet, even though the price is not superior to ours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the exact figure, but if the Deputy looks up the figures he will find that the price paid by the British factories for this season's crop was not any better than ours on the average, taking the price of pulp and so on into account. We have not consulted the seed merchants in connection with this Bill, because it was felt they were not very much affected by it.  Seed cleaning is meant to apply at present only to the cleaning of grass and clover seeds.  We do not intend to bring that section into operation to deal with the seed merchant who buys oats and barley and wheat, cleans that seed, and sells it again.  As at present intended, that will not come under the regulations, but as time goes on it is quite possible that gradually those people may be brought in, and that is one of the reasons why it is necessary, in legislation of this kind, to have such things done by regulation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Holohan said that he would advise me not to go too fast with the powers that I am seeking under this Bill.  It is intended to go very slowly, but the only way in which we can give effect to Deputy Holohan's advice is to do the thing by regulation. Perhaps after a few years we may bring in the cleaning of oats and cereals, but it would be rather difficult to have to bring in amending Bills every time these changes are made, and the most effective way to do it is by regulation.  If seed merchants have any observations to make, I shall be very glad to hear them, and if Deputy Belton is in touch with seed merchants I shall be glad to get any advice they may be able to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that it is necessary to interfere further with the seed trade.  Deputy Dillon did make a suggestion that it might be better to license everybody in the seed trade and control the whole trade much more effectively than we propose under this Bill.  I think it is not necessary, and I am sure Deputy Dillon will agree with me that if it is not necessary we should not do it; we should allow the freedom that is <Col N="696" /> there, and I think we ought to allow that freedom until we see what can be done under this type of legislation, for the present, at any rate.</P>
    <P>I may assure Deputy Corry that we could never go so far as to prevent one farmer selling some seed oats to another.  Deputy Corry asked me what was the quantity of rye grass available, and whether, if we had not sufficient produced within the Saorstát, we will let it in free of duty. I think there will be no shortage.  In fact, the people dealing with it are very much afraid they will have a surplus, and they are asking us how we mean to deal with the surplus, do we mean to give them any help to get rid of it.  I think there is more danger of a surplus than a shortage, and the question of what we must do does not at present arise.  I agree with Deputy Holohan that the Minister could not decide on a certain variety of seed as being suitable for the whole country.  It does not apply to oats or wheat, but it does to barley.  Barley is grown on land suitable for barley, and it is the same type of land wherever barley is grown. I suppose it would be true to say the grass seeds grown all over the country are the same.  Possibly the only difference is that a farmer will sow a different type of grass seed according to the length of time he intends to leave the field under grass. There would not be any intention under this Bill of confining the farmers to a certain variety of seed.  It is intended to prevent what is considered altogether unsuitable seed coming in.</P>
    <P>Some farmers are impressed by advertisements of seed produced in England or some other country, and they think they ought to pay a fancy price in order to get some of the seed which has been so successful elsewhere. Very often the officers of the Department know all about it and it has been tried out and found a failure, and naturally they want to save those farmers from making the mistake of trying this particular type of seed again.  I might conclude by assuring Deputy Holohan that it is not intended to go too fast with the powers we are <Col N="697" /> taking here, although I do not think they are very drastic powers.  At any rate, it is not intended to go too fast in the pushing of the production of such seeds as beet, turnips or mangolds and so on, that we have not produced up to the present.  Deputy Dillon need not fear that.  We are going to experiment on those seeds, but it is not intended to go too fast with pushing them until we are definitely satisfied that we can produce a better type of seed here than we are producing at present.</P>

      <P>This Vote arises out of the increased entries for the various competitive examinations held during the year by the Civil Service Commissioners.  As an example, I may cite the cost of the examinations which were held during the period for clerical officers, junior executive officers, officers of Customs and Excise, post office learners and writing assistants.  It was estimated that the total entries for these examinations would be 4,000, while, in fact, the actual entries were over 5,000.  It was, of course, inevitable in cases where there had been such an increase in the number of candidates that there should be more or less a corresponding increase in the expenses of the examinations.  It is to meet the increase in those expenses that this Supplementary Vote is introduced.</P>

      <P>I take it that it is also true to say that we may expect the Civil Service Estimates to rise steadily as the personnel of the Civil Service rises.  My mind goes back to the happy days when we were going to reduce the Civil Service by hundreds; when we were going to slash the salaries of men who were drawing inflated incomes; the days when Deputy Corry was going to relieve the <Col N="699" /> burdens on the down-trodden farmers, burdens the weight of which was out of all proportion to the resources of the country.  But since the day the Fianna Fáil Government got into office the personnel of the Civil Service has grown.  It is growing and will grow and we have now to pass a Supplementary Estimate to provide added money to be devoted to recruiting still more numbers into the Civil Service.  I think the Minister would be making a gesture if he would tell us by how many he managed to increase the Civil Service personnel since he took office.  We have already spent £19,940 this year in sucking into the service of the State the hordes of people that the Minister requires to minister to his daily needs.  Does not the Minister think that we ought to know something as to the value we are getting and how many did he manage to gather into the service by this Vote of over £20,000?  Can the Minister give us any indication of what the increase will be during the coming year?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item in the Supplementary Estimate is a sum of £700, expenses in connection with the Local Government (Dublin) Tribunal.  The second item is a sum of £200, expenses in connection with the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.  Under Section 101 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, that is, the Act which made it mandatory on the Minister for Local Government to set up this tribunal to inquire into the working of the Greater Dublin Act passed in that year, the amount provided, £700, is to cover the remuneration of the chairman of the tribunal, the cost of reporting evidence at meetings of the tribunal, and the cost of accommodation for the holding of meetings. The meetings are held in the offices of the Law Society at the Four Courts.  The charge for holding <Col N="702" /> meetings is £1 per day.  The chairman is paid £10 10s. per day.  It is not possible to say when the tribunal will conclude its sittings.</P>
    <P>The item of expenditure in regard to the Therapeutic Substances Act was caused in the following way: The Act provides for the regulation of the manufacture, importation and sale of therapeutic substances, including prophylactic and diagnostic substances, whether used in the treatment of human or animal diseases, so as to ensure proper supervision of substances whose technical purity and potency have to be determined by experiment rather than by chemical examination.  The technical work is carried out by Professor W. D. O'Kelly, who holds the part-time posts of general consultant bacteriologist to the Department and director of the vaccine branch.  This work consists of the exploration of problems arising in connection with the testing of samples, of dealing with correspondence on application for import licences, and advising the Department on all questions of technical importance.  It entails very close study of current scientific literature dealing with problems outside matters which are required for Professor O'Kelly's ordinary work as bacteriologist.  Much of the literature is from foreign journals&mdash;French and German.  A close study of the publications of the League of Nations is essential to keep abreast of new developments.  He has to prepare toxins for use when testing. The preparation of a suitable toxin alone has taken six months before it can be adopted with assurance as to its suitability as a test toxin.  All this entails a very considerable amount of laboratory work. Many months of close and unremitting work will similarly be required in the preparation of other test toxins, and the media required for carrying out the preparation.  Very special care and attention have to be devoted to the sterilising and preparation of supplies of diluents, glass ware, etc.  A careful system of records has to be kept of every laboratory operation. As inspector under the Act he inspects premises of manufacturers, and this <Col N="703" /> involves travelling to England and the Continent when imports of therapeutic substances from these countries are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet anticipated excesses under the following sub-heads:&mdash;Subhead C, Incidental Expenses, £1,300; sub-head F, Solicitor's Branch, Incidental Expenses, £2,500; sub-head <Col N="704" /> I, Improvement of Estates, £120,000; sub-head Y, Assistance to Migrants from the Gaeltacht, £450, together with expenditure under the following new sub-head, A A, Losses, etc., £50.  These items amount in all to £124,300, against which there is a set-off of £48,374, on account of anticipated savings on other sub-heads, leaving the net amount now required £75,926.</P>
      <P>The anticipated excess of £120,000 under sub-head I, Improvement of Estates, etc., which is by far the largest item, is rendered necessary mainly by the increasing rate of division of untenanted land during the past few years.  New holdings are being created in large numbers, and are being equipped with dwellinghouses and out-offices, and existing houses and out-offices on old holdings are being improved.  Fencing, roadmaking and drainage are also required to a greater extent than before, corresponding with the increasing areas of land divided.  For the period of months to 31st December last the expenditure on improvements has amounted to £386,000 approximately, and, as it is expected that there will be very concentrated efforts by the Department on the work during the remainder of the year, it is estimated that the total improvement expenditure for the whole financial year will be £520,000, being £120,000 in excess of the amount provided in sub-head I for this service. In addition to the main purpose of effecting improvements to farms, which will raise their economic and social value by the construction of roads, fences, drains, dwellinghouses, etc., this expenditure is also the means of providing useful employment in agricultural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure under sub-head I may be taken as a rather fair index of the progress being made by the Land Commission in the distribution of untenanted land, and in the arrangement and general improvement of uneconomic and congested holdings. For that reason a statement of expenditure during each of the past five years may not be without interest. The Land Commission spent on land <Col N="705" /> improvements, in 1930-1, £183,054; 1931-2, £155,106; 1932-3, £175,016; 1933-4, £228,012; 1934-5, £318,723, and this year, 1935-6, we expect a total outlay of £520,000.  Even that does not mean that expenditure is keeping pace fully with requirements, for every year the amounts sanctioned for new houses, fences, roads, etc., are greater than the expenditure.  However, the completion of improvement works to a total of over £500,000 in the year represents very satisfactory progress indeed, and has been achieved only as the result of intensive and prolonged efforts on the part of the staff.  It is intended to keep up the pressure, and by the adoption of improved methods of accounting and supervision it is hoped that even that total of £500,000 will be passed next year.</P>
    <P>The anticipated excess of £1,300 under sub-head C, Incidental Expenses, is mainly due to the increased cost of advertisements inviting tenders for the construction and improvement of dwelling-houses, etc., in connection with the division of untenanted land.  The anticipated excess of £2,500 under sub-head F, Solicitor's Branch, is rendered necessary on account of the increased number of appeals to the Appeal Tribunal arising out of proceedings by the Land Commission for the acquisition of land under the Land Acts, 1923-33, involving the payment of costs, surveyor's fees, counsel's fees, etc. The estimated excess under sub-head Y, Assistance to Migrants from Gaeltacht, is due to the fact that it was not found possible to bring the migrants to the first Gaeltacht colony at Athboy, at the end of 1934 or early in 1935, as had been intended.  A sum of £300 was provided in this sub-head last year to meet the cost of the special assistance which it was proposed to give these migrants (i.e., ploughing one acre of winter wheat, turf supply (£6 per family) and provision for one week (£2 per family). In fact, however, the first batch of migrants did not arrive until April, 1935, the second batch came in May, 1935, and the remainder in December last.  In consequence only £65 of the amount provided for these items last <Col N="706" /> year was expended within the year. Moreover, it was necessary for the Land Commission themselves to undertake the winter and spring tillage on the holdings (instead of one acre of winter wheat as originally anticipated) in order to ensure that when the migrants came they would have sufficient crops at their disposal to enable them to live through the remainder of the year.  Furthermore, a larger supply of turf was necessary for those who came in December, as they will not be able to cut and save their own turf until next summer.  Finally, the first batch of migrants who came in April had to be supplied with potatoes to enable them to subsist until the crops which had been sown became available.  The total cost of all these items works out at a little over £800, from which must be deducted the sum of £65 charged against last year's Vote, leaving a balance of £750, i.e., an excess of £450 over the sum originally provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>They seem to be getting on all right.  A new sub-head AA is now opended in order to provide for certain small losses of live stock and for the refund of an overpaid purchase annuity.  One of the losses of live stock occurred in the course of improvement works which were being carried out by the Land Commission, and the other on Land Commission lands which had been set for grazing. There was no appropriate sub-head in the Vote to which such minor matters could be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anticipated savings are under various sub-heads, the principal being: sub-head W, £20,700; sub-head S, £8,500; sub-head A, £4,800; sub-head J, £3,000.  Sub-head W provides for the payment of lodgment fees to sheriffs and court registrars in respect of warrants issued under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, for the recovery of unpaid instalments of land purchase annuities, etc.  In consequence of a recent High Court judgment (Halpin v. Attorney-General) these fees have ceased to be payable and there is therefore an estimated saving of £20,000 on the sub-head. <Col N="707" /> Sub-head S, provides for the amount required to complete purchase proceedings pending under the Land Acts, 1903 and 1909.  All the outstanding cases cannot be completed this year, with the result that there is an estimated saving of £8,500 on the sub-head.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A provides for salaries, wages and allowances of the Land Commission staff.  There is an estimated saving of £4,800 under this sub-head, due mainly to the occurrence of vacancies by death or retirement during the year which have not yet been filled.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J provides for the deficiency of income from untenanted land purchased under the Land Acts and, as the amount of such deficiency incurred up to date is not so great as had been anticipated, there is an estimated saving of £3,000 on this sub-head. Various other smaller savings are expected to make up a total of £48,374, which can be set off against the increased amounts required under sub-heads C, F, I, Y and AA, leaving a net additional charge of £75,926.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>After that moving introduction of an Estimate I will be excused for finding my enthusiasm somewhat flagging.  There are two net points I want to raise.  One is that the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of the fact that he is asking for £450 for further assistance to the migrants in the Gaeltacht might have made this the occasion of telling us what we are very anxious to know-how these people are doing.  It is a great experiment and it looks like one which will be very difficult to bring to a satisfactory fruition.  It would have been a source of encouragement to everybody to know that so far everything was going well.  As there are a good many people in the country who were doubtful and apprehensive when the matter was undertaken, I think we ought to get some fairly detailed information from the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying as to what the situation now is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other is a very simple question that I have raised with the Department time and time again.  The Land Commission are making roads and have been making roads all over the country <Col N="708" /> for the last 40 years and having made the road they walk off and leave it there.  The local authority will not maintain it and nobody else will maintain it.  The Land Commission make the road originally to provide a public right-of-way up to some part of the land that they divide and, having done that, not infrequently people will build houses on the road, or even the local authority will build labourers' cottages on the road, and them the road proceeds to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The local county councillor, as I have often done, draws the attention of the county surveyor to this road and asks him to carry out whatever repairs are necessary.  He immediately replies, &ldquo;I cannot touch that road because it is not a road of public convenience&rdquo; under a judgment given by Chief Baron Palles in a well-known case in the Court of Appeal.  You go to the Land Commission and ask them to repair the road and they say that if the road is vested in the tenants they cannot do anything.  I think that is their stock excuse.  To do the Land Commission justice, I must say that if the land is not vested you can often knock a few pounds out of them for this purpose. Then you go to the Board of Works and suggest that they should start a relief work in repairing the road and the Board of Works will say: &ldquo;Deputy Hugo Flinn is sick of listening to by-roads; will you propose some other form of relief work?  In any case there is no money.&rdquo;  The net result is that the road is not repaired.  Here the disrepair of a by-road seems to be a matter of trivial importance.  But where you have four or five families living on it all through the winter, bringing in turf and doing their business on the road, it is the greatest possible inconvenience to them.  I want the Land Commission to do one of two things&mdash;either maintain these roads or else use their influence with the Department of Local Government to introduce legislation to make the local authorities liable under certain circumstances for these roads.</P>
    <P>I make the suggestion that where local authorities place houses on a Land Commission road they automatically become liable for its maintenance: but that where there is no house <Col N="709" /> built on a Land Commission road, the Land Commission will, say, at septennial intervals restore the road to proper condition and leave it to the residents on the road or the people who have land about the road to keep it in repair for the seven years between the septennial visitations of the Land Commission.  There is one proposal to deal with by-roads.  I have not heard any put up by the Government.  Every Deputy who lives in the country knows what a constant annoyance this problem of Land Commission roads is. The Land Commission is responsible for them all.  Either the Land Commission or the Department of Local Government ought to deal with what is a recurring irritation to the country people.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the principal question that arises under the Supplementary Estimate.  We are asked for £120,000 under sub-head I for the improvement of estates.  I take it that covers expenditure on the improvement of land compulsorily acquired for distribution among congests or for new tenants. I want to ask the Land Commission now to state publicly what principle underlies their policy for the compulsory acquisition of land.  I remember when the 1933 Land Bill was passing I said on the Second Stage that that Bill meant the end of security of tenure in this country, and so it is proving to be. All through the land war the fundamental principle underlying every Land Act was that what the people of this country were concerned to ensure was that if any man was living on the land, making a homestead of it, his holding was sacrosanct, and that that principle went for the landlord just as much as for the tenant: that we were not concerned to rob any man, landlord or tenant, of his holding, but that what we were concerned to do was to ensure that the person living on the land would own the land and would not pay rent for it to somebody else.  So, you will find through all the Land Acts, up to a certain point, that there is never any power given to the Land Commission to break down the demesne wall.  A lot of radicals in the country said: &ldquo;Why would you not go in and break down the demesne wall and take the <Col N="710" /> land off the landlord with his thousands of acres and give it to the man with a few acres; why should he have it?&rdquo; And the answer was clear to any rational man: Because you had to stand on some principle or otherwise the whole system of land tenure in the country would go into a state of flux and there would be no end to the business.  That was the principle that should have been stood upon: that any man living on the land should own the land he was living on.  That principle went in the 1923 Land Act, but safeguards were left, that if you wanted to go in and take land that was bought out under previous Land Acts, you had to offer to the person who was being disturbed land that was equally suitable, and the Land Court held that that did not only mean land that was equally profitable but which, in every sense of the word, was equally suitable to the tenant disturbed.</P>
    <P>Then you got the 1933 Land Act, and we were informed that the procedure envisaged in the former Act was not working and that more drastic powers had to be acquired.  I knew what that meant.  What it really meant was that men who had bought under the previous Land Acts came up to the Land Court and satisfied the Land Court that a substantial injustice was being done through disturbing them, and the court weighed the advantages that would accrue to the neighbours from disturbing this man against the disadvantages of leaving him there, and generally the court gave a fair verdict, removing some men and forbidding the Land Commission to remove others.  That safeguard was swept away and, of course, everything in the garden was lovely so long as you were going around to fairly substantial men and plundering them. Let me give to this House a sample of the unscrupulous robbery that was attempted by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy, but on a Supplementary Estimate the discussion is confined to the actual items there.  I am not clear&mdash;and I should like the guidance of the Deputy and the Parliamentary Secretary on the matter&mdash;as to what is contained in <Col N="711" /> item (I), as I am not conversant with the contents of the item referred to.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to show that the Land Commission were severely censured by the Land Court, and I am going to give a case where their primary offer was multiplied by six.  I am going to rebuke the Parliamentary Secretary in that he has entered into a conspiracy with the Land Commission to rob the people by this amount and that that has been shown by means of the machinery which gives them access to the courts.  Let me give one case in point.  Richard Carroll lives in Kilteely in the County of Limerick.  He is a person that I and the Parliamentary Secretary have <Col N="712" /> reason to believe has no use for our political Party at all.  In fact, he thinks that we are largely responsible for any attack that was made upon him.  This man bought 38½ acres of land in 1924 and he paid £3,000 for that land.  He has three growing boys for whom provision will have to be made when they reach their majority. I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that that very question was raised in the 1933 Land Act.  Suppose a farmer has a growing family and would appear to have more land than £2,000 worth, is he entitled to say to the Land Commission: &ldquo;I may have more land at the moment than the spirit of this legislation thinks I ought to have, but I intend to provide some of it for those boys who are growing up and who will shortly be of age and must be provided for?&rdquo; Richard Carroll has three such boys.  He is not setting the land in conacre.  He has, in addition to these 38½ acres comprised in the farm to which I refer, about 65 acres in the immediate neighbourhood.  None of this land is let.  All of it is being worked by Richard Carroll at the present time and he has seven men employed working on the land.  Now, in the face of those facts which, I feel, constitute the conclusive case against any attempt to acquire at all, the Land Commission proceeded to acquire the lands.  Deputies are as familiar as I am with their procedure when they proceed to compulsorily acquire land bought under a previous Land Act.  They propose a sum with a stipulation that, out of the purchase money, the tenant must redeem all outstanding annuities, and it is only after the tenant has redeemed all outstanding annuities that he can put the balance of the money into his pocket as compensation for the land from which he is being disturbed. Richard Carroll paid £3,000 for 38½ acres, subject to their annuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the annuity was.  However, I think I can astonish Deputy Corry when I tell him what ensued without any reference to the annuity at all.  Mr. Carroll went to the Land Court and in that court the sum of money he was offered by the Land Commission for the land was increased from £138 to £718.  Now, is it right that any Department of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean that what the Land Commission offered was increased from £138 to £718?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy must bear in mind that, supposing the Land Commission offered him £700, it is quite possible that so much of that would go to redeem the annuity. Here we have the Land Commission's offer multiplied by six by the court&mdash; the difference between £138 and £718. I regard that as outrageous.  I here assert that land is being acquired from farmers all over this country at the present time by the Land Commission at prices which constitute highway robbery.  Farmers are being turned out of holdings where they can make a modest livelihood and are being given as compensation a sum which invested would not keep them three weeks out of the 52.  That is robbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me pass to another case which I raised in this House yesterday in respect to the holding of a man called Devereux in the County Wexford. That case, I have no doubt, will come before the Land Court, and the expenses will form portion of a Supplementary Estimate to be brought before this House hereafter.  Devereux and a group of neighbours are farmers on holdings of land of 70 to 90 acres. Their families have been on these holdings for generations.  They were tenants of people of the name of King, whose estate was bought out and they <Col N="714" /> then became tenant purchasers.  One of the tenants is this man called Devereux.  He has 90 acres of land. He employs&mdash;I am now speaking from memory, but I can verify the facts if they are questioned&mdash;five persons on that farm.  Every inch of it he uses himself.  There is no question of his being a practical tenant farmer. Mark this: he is living on the land; he is working that land and he is giving employment to five people on that land.  There is plenty of land immediately around his place, the owners of which want to sell but the Land Commission goes in and serves a notice on Devereux that they are making an inspection of his land with a view to its acquisition.  That case has been raised in this House and it may be that the Land Commission will now turn tail and fly from the publicity attendant on such an outrage. But they have already done the damage.  They have no right to go in on a man's land, threaten him with eviction, and then when the full light of publicity is thrown on the case turn tail and fly.  That man has been caused a great deal of mental anguish, annoyance and anxiety.</P>
    <P>I issue to-day the warning that I issued when the Land Bill was going through the House.  If this Government thinks that it can walk in on the holdings of small tenant purchasers of the country, and shift them round the country as if they were lumps of wood, if they think they can take a man who is farming 70 or 80 acres of land in Wexford, take the land off him and tell him that if he wants land he will have to go to Meath or Louth, they are making a great mistake.  They cannot do it.  If they attempt to do it they will give rise to another agrarian agitation in this country and, God knows, we all know what that means.  I do not believe there is a single Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches who was born in rural Ireland who wants that to happen.  I do not expect men who were born in Dublin to know what it means.  They never did, and never will, but I put it to Deputies who were born in rural Ireland that nothing that the Government, President de Valera, or anybody <Col N="715" /> else can do will make the people submit to that.  You cannot drive them from their holdings, and if you attempt to do it you will drive the country into a bloody land war, and I use that phrase in its literal sense.  That would be a horrible disaster.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, the Land Commission has been looked-up to by the people as their friend and champion as against the landlords.  It is now becoming an infinitely worse landlord than Clanricarde ever was.  You shake the confidence of the people in the personnel of the Land Commission if you make the Land Commission appear in the minds of the people as a menace and a threat to their fixity of tenure; you are going irretrievably to injure the Land Commission as a power for good in this country and that would be a great disaster.  I have no hesitation in saying that if the policy of the Land Commission is truly represented by their activities in the case of Carroll's farm and Devereux's holding, they are a greater menace to the principle of fixity of tenure in this country than Clanricarde or Barrymore ever was, because they are helped by the Legislation of the Oireachtas whereas Clanricarde and Barrymore had no such authority behind them.  They were supported in their activities by British troops and police, but the Land Commission are going out with the Civic Guards.  Eventually they will have to go out with the Saorstát Army behind them if they want to carry out a policy of that kind.</P>
    <P>I implore all Deputies on the other side to make the Land Commission realise what they are doing.  Why cannot there be fixity of tenure in this country?  Why create bloodshed and upheaval in this country?  Why cannot we stop it now?  Why cannot some understanding be come to between the Government and the Opposition, or within the ranks of the Government itself by which some principle will be laid down which will enable us to say that farmers conforming to a certain standard are guaranteed against disturbance for all time because unless that is done now no man knows when the Land Commission will take action against him?  I have ventilated that as <Col N="716" /> the greatest objection to the activities of the Land Commission.  My second objection is that they are creating through the country a belief that, if you are covetous of your neighbour's land, all you have got to do is to start a Fianna Fáil Cumann and move a resolution asking the Land Commission to have the lands of so-and-so divided amongst the members.  Fianna Fáil T.D.s have gone down to a Fianna Fáil cumann and discussed with that cumann the division of a tenant farmer's holding in that very parish.</P>

Now I am not saying that these T.D.s should go and coerce the Land Commission to do this or that, but what I am saying is, that it does create fierce, bad blood in the country and that it should be made most categorically clear that it is open to no branch of a political organisation to dictate to the Land Commission what land they will acquire and what land they will not acquire.  It should be made clear to branches of Fine Gael as well as to branches of Fianna Fáil that if the Land Commission is contemplating the acquisition of land and if there is a resolution passed in regard to that land at a branch of Fianna Fáil or a branch of Fine Gael, the only effect that it will have is to postpone the whole business because the Government is not prepared to allow its judgment to be swayed by either side in the division and acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third, to my mind the most moving and shocking, development of late.  Few Deputies in this House are old enough to remember the conditions that obtained here prior to 1885 but all the travelling diarists, and the personal recollections of those who remember these times, dwell particularly on the steady deterioration in the condition of the houses and the lands of the people so long as uncertainly in respect of fixity of tenure obtained. The reason for that is simple, because, if you were living in a parish and were solicitous to keep your house clean and <Col N="717" /> your land good, you naturally excited the envy of any covetous person living in that locality.  The potential grabber, the bailiff's son, who meant to obtain land by hook or crook when he got his chance, did not covet the run-down place or the rotten place.  He set his eye on the good land, and so, immediately, every farmer in this country who was afraid of the grabber, who was afraid of the covetousness of the bailiff's son, let his land go down.  He dare not improve it for two reasons: firstly, if he did improve it, the rent would be raised, and, secondly, it was quite likely that the bailiff's son, some grabber or somebody whom the landlord wanted to bring into the district, would be planted in the place at the expense of the good tenant.</P>
    <P>Now, if I have 40 or 50 acres of land, and there are a number of people around me with 30 or 40 acres, any if my neighbour's land is getting rushy or dirty, or the ditches are not cleaned and the hedges allowed to grow wild, and if I exert myself on my land and try to keep it good, with the result that, with the passage of years, the land begins to stand out from amongst my neighbours' land, when the grabbing Fianna Fáil cumann sits down to discuss &ldquo;What are we going to grab?&rdquo; what do you expect them to grab?  They are not going to divide up the rushy land; they are not going to divide up the dirty land.  They are going to divide up the land that has made them jealous for the last ten years, and they are going to divide up the land they have been longing for for the previous ten years.  Deputies here may say that, if they think they can do that, the Land Commission will step across their path and say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but the country people do not know that and they do not believe that. The country people believe that representations of the kind I describe carry great weight in the Land Commission, and I know that a number of people, with whom I have recently discussed the putting out of basic slag and artificial manure on land, have said to me: &ldquo;Who would improve his land now?  If you did improve it, God knows but it will be <Col N="718" /> taken from you the morning after you improve it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I implore of the Land Commission, before irretrievable damage is done, to reconsider this business of disturbing farmers who are working their land.  We may consider on their merits cases of persons who have land let out at conacre.  <i>Prima facie</i>, if a person does not work the land he owns, there seems to be a case for transferring it to people who will work it.  It is not always the case, however, because I know of a certain widow in the country who has a boy of 14 or 15 years of age, who is still too young to take over land and run it properly, and who lets it out at conacre until her son comes of age. I think it a great hardship to take that woman's land, even though she has it set.  Where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, and where it appears that land is being let out, that case is worthy of examination and an equitable decision may be arrived at which may involve no reference to the Land Court at all.  But where you have a person living on the land and working the land, I warn you that if you entrench upon the principle that that person should not be disturbed, you are going to be dragged down the slippery slope where you will have to interfere with the holding of every man in the country.</P>
    <P>There are some block-headed idiots in this country who believe they can rob their neighbours and get away with it.  They cannot, and I see some warriors here who imagine that, through a Fianna Fáil cumann, they can rob every person of whom they are covetous.  They cannot.  There is a spirit in this country that will make that impossible.  God forbid that we would smash Fianna Fáil through an agrarian agitation, but if we have to do it, in order to prevent that kind of wrong-doing, I am prepared to take part in the evictions that must ensue if that policy is pursued.</P>

      <P>One has sympathy with the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary who presides over the Land Commission, because, if there is any Department of State which subjects whoever is at its head to criticism, it is the Land Commission.  I believe that if the Archangel himself were put at the head of it, he would be criticised from very many quarters.  However, the person for the time being who is put into that position must accept criticism.  Criticism is levelled at the Land Commission inside and outside this House in very many ways. There are people criticising the Parliamentary Secretary because land is not distributed quickly enough or because this particular parcel of land, or that particular parcel of land is not taken over.  I do not want to go into a general discussion of the Land Commission, but I should like to refer to some of the items in this Estimate, to which the Parliamentary Secretary himself has referred.  For the moment, I should like to refer to the question of fencing and roadmaking, dealt with by Deputy Dillon, and to reiterate what he said as to the desirability of <Col N="720" /> the Land Commission building these roads and fences particularly more effectively.  The fences put up for the division of some of the estates I know are a scandal.  They are narrow, single fences and it will take a considerable time for the grass to grow on them.  If any of the people put any horned stock in these, unless they go to the expense of paling off the fences, the fences will disappear.  If small-holders are expected to farm efficiently, efficient fences ought to be put up.  The same applies to roadmaking.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Parliamentary Secretary is criticised for not distributing land quickly enough and there may be some foundation for that criticism.  We all know that there are large tracts of land in the hands of the Land Commission for a considerable period, not yet distributed, for one reason or another.  There does not appear to be sufficient activity in some counties in that direction.  In almost every county there are large parcels which have been resumed, or otherwise taken over, and which have not yet been distributed. On the other hand, there appears to have been considerable activity amongst Land Commission inspectors and others in the matter of inspecting the lands of ordinary tenant purchasers, and that is the particular matter to which I want to refer.  I, for one, will object to any portion of the expenditure on the Land Commission being devoted to that purpose. The various Land Acts from 1909 to 1933 were, in reality, what we all expected&mdash;a consummation of the land war that preceded them.  Every tenant purchaser, when he had finally made his agreement and purchased his land, believed that he was the owner of that land and that the things which had been fought for&mdash;fixity of tenure and free sale&mdash;were left to him, and until this particular Act was passed he was practically secure in that respect.  It would be a lamentable thing if action taken by any Government should create in the minds of the farming people the idea that their tenure in their land was insecure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many things will arise from that. The first, as Deputy Dillon pointed <Col N="721" /> out, will be a disinclination to make improvements.  That would be a iamentable thing for the State generally, particularly in view of the activities of this Government to increase production on the land.  If this process is resorted to, there will certainly be no inclination on the part of people to improve their land.  To my mind a bigger thing will be this: that owing to this particular action the farmer will be the one class in the community who will be unable to obtain credit.  The reason is that if you make his tenure insecure his chance of borrowing on his land will be infinitesimal.  Owing to present conditions it is a difficult thing for farmers to obtain credit, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to get credit mainly because of the fear that the title to their lands is insecure.  That will have its reactions on the sale of land.  It will be increasingly difficult for a farmer to sell his farm in the open market.  A man for one reason or another&mdash;for instance, he may have no family&mdash;may wish to sell his farm, but owing to this particular action the sale of land will become almost impossible here.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that the free sale of land is looked upon as a good thing by financiers.  It reacts on the credit of the country.  I read with interest the other day the statement made by the chairman of one of our big banking institutions.  He said that at the moment &ldquo;the land market was dead and that it was likely to remain so as long as present conditions prevail.&rdquo; I admit that he was then speaking on another matter, but he went on to say that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;when farming became a marketable asset in the open market, considerable credit would accrue to the State generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is true.  You are going to kill the chance of that considerable benefit ever arising if you approve of the action taken recently by the Land Commission of acquiring the property of average sized farmers, of people who believed they were secure in their land and who had reason to believe that from the words used in this House by the Minister in charge of the 1933 Land Act.  It was because we placed <Col N="722" /> dependence on the words he used on the various stages of that measure that it was allowed to go through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two cases in mind that are proceeding, but I refrain from mentioning them in the House lest, by doing so, I should make the position of the particular individuals concerned more insecure than it is.  I am pointing out to the House the consequences that will follow to the State generally as a result of the action that is being taken by the Land Commission.  One result will be that it will destroy any incentive in individual farmers to improve their farms or to buy land.  You will make it impossible for people to buy land. You will make free sale impossible, and if you do that you will be destroying a thing that financiers believe is of great advantage to the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am altogether opposed to the compulsory acquisition of land that was supposed to be inviolable.  Tenant purchasers believed that they were secure in their farms.  They were told so by the Minister for Defence who was in charge of the 1933 Land Act when it was going through the Oireachtas.  It is not reasonable that the undertaking then given should now be broken by the Minister and officials responsible for Land Commission administration. If necessary, amending legislation should be introduced to make such a thing impossible.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a question that was addressed to him yesterday in connection with land in Wexford, rather implied that action might not be taken eventually.  He said that Land Commissioners go around the country and inspect farms in the ordinary course of their work.  That is a thing that I want to see stopped, because once they go into a district and set foot on a farm the people on the surrounding farms believe that it is about to be made subject to resumption by the Land Commission.  Action of that kind creates consternation <Col N="723" /> amongst farmers.  They believe that sooner or later, possibly sooner, the occupier is going to be dispossessed. The result is that there is no incentive in him to do anything to improve his holding in the interim.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the resumption of average-sized purchased farms, in fact to the resumption of any sized purchased farm provided, as the Minister in charge of the 1933 Land Act said, it is well managed.  It may be necessary, on occasions, to take over in some districts purchased holdings, but I hold that there are always opportunities for taking over farms without compulsorily acquiring them.  In almost every county in the south farms are being continually offered for sale in the open market.  In that connection we were told by the Minister in charge of the 1933 Land Act that, if such farms were resumed, the price to be paid for them would be the price that a man would get in the open market.  Take this Limerick case that Deputy Dillon referred to.  To my own knowledge, there were within two or three miles of that particular farm three or four farms sold in the open market in the last six months.  Why did not the Land Commission go into the open market and buy one of them? The reason, I suppose, is that they thought the price to be paid would be too much to let it to the incoming tenants.  I well remember that when the 1933 Land Act was going through the Minister in charge of it was asked this question by Deputy Haslett: whether the price that the Land Commission would pay for such a farm would be a price which they could reasonably pay so as to give an economic holding to the future tenants, or whether it would be the price obtainable in the open market.  The Minister answered that it would be the market price, thereby making it perfectly clear that it was his intention that the price to be given was not the price that would make it economic to let the land afterwards, but the price obtainable in the open market. I and other Deputies realise that you cannot put people on land without cost to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Donnelly that it is.  No matter how much this House chooses to pay to put people on the land I will back it. We must realise that we have got to pay for putting people on the land, but, on the other hand, the people who get the land must remember that they are not going to get land at their neighbour's expense.  These people must remember that every sod of land that they get, every house that is put on the land for them, is all provided at the expense of the State.  If they remember that they will probably realise more fully the benefit that the State is giving them.  I put it to Deputies that they should look at this as reasonable men.  We should not undo all that our forefathers fought for and won.  Think of all the misery that was endured in the 70's and the 80's and the 90's to win security of tenure for the Irish farmer.  Surely an Irish Government is not going to undo the great work that was accomplished in that respect when the people of this country were under an alien Government, and the great results that were achieved by the Irish Parliamentary leaders of a past generation; the great fight that they made in an outside country to make the position of the Irish farmer secure in his homestead.  Let us, in God's name, not undo that great work.  The tenant farmer suffered in blood and misery for the security of his home and his land and I hope no Deputy would stand over this proceeding.  I shall not be a party to the voting of public money to be devoted to any such purpose.</P>

      <P>We had two or three very moving cases put forward by Deputy Dillon.  I do not know the particulars of these cases, but I think the sums offered are rather extraordinary. Still, land was taken over by the Land Commission in previous years under very peculiar circumstances. I shall refer to some cases of land purchased from the landlord for the tenant under the 1923 Act, which cases may be compared with Mr. <Col N="725" /> Carroll's case and may explain the rather extraordinary price offered. Some extraordinary things happened during that period, and I think that it would be better to deal with them. There is one case at Johnstown, Country Cork, of a farm of 75 statute acres, of which the poor law valuation is £120 and the revised annuity, that is, the halved annuity&mdash;£61 15s.  I do not know who the lunatic was who valued the land, but at any rate the landlord got away with a certain amount of loot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenant would have to pay the Land Commission to take over that farm.  We hear a lot of noise about these 38½ acres.  I shall refer to another farm of 25 acres which was taken over.  The tenant was removed 60 miles away.  He got another holding there and his 25 acres were acquired for the urgent relief of congestion. That man was 7½ years in the farm to which he was removed and paid one half year's annuity in that period.  Then he was taken back and placed on the 25 acres which had been acquired for the relief of congestion. The house which he had left in a good condition was in a tumble-down state when he came back and the Land Commission built him a new house.  They put him back on the same farm, which was lying there for 7½ years.  Deputy Bennett stood over that and Deputy Roddy was the man who was responsible at the time.  If Deputy Dillon chooses to thump the table and go into hysterics over these 38½ acres, he must remember the sins of the Party he has joined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that, in particular cases, you will meet a share of hardship.  But you must remember that you have small farmers with from 20 to 35 acres who have from three to five sons from 35 to 40 years of age with no outlet but the land.  Land has to be provided in these cases.  In one small parish in my constituency, there is a farm of 1,300 acres of the finest land in Cork, valued at over £1 an acre.  There are two men employed on the 1,300 acres to mind bullocks. Bullocks are bad cattle now and the job is not paying, with the result that the unfortunate small holders in County Cork have to foot a bill for that gentleman of about £380 in unpaid rates.  The small farmer with 35 acres and four or five sons, in addition to paying his own rates, has to pay his share of the £385 due on this 1,300 acre holding.  In addition, I suppose he has to meet another lump in respect of unpaid annuities on these 1,300 acres.  Then we are infringing the rights of the land-owners.  Was there ever a land war fought to keep a gentleman of that description on 1,300 acres?  There is another holding a mile and a half from that holding which contains 570 acres.  One man is employed on that holding and it was up three weeks ago for letting on the 11 months system.  There are, in all, about 7,000 acres in that parish in that condition, the smallest holding being 380 acres.  That land is there while the unfortunate small holders who have to provide a livelihood for themselves and their children have to make up the unpaid annuities and unpaid rents on these holdings.  Is it not time that the Land Commission got a little active and took over these holdings for division?  According to Deputy Dillon, any interference with these gentlemen is a breach of tenant right.  I cannot see that there is any breach of tenant right.  The cases of these men go before three Land Commissioners who are paid pretty good salaries and who, I am sure, do their work fairly and conscientiously.  They were sent on to us by Deputy Roddy and they are still there.  If the people whose land is <Col N="727" /> being taken over are not satisfied with the value put on it by these Commissioners, they can go to the Appeal Court.  He cannot complain that he will not get a fair price now, because we provided him with two extra judges in the judicial court, to help Judge Wylie, and to see that the proper price is given for the holding.  I cannot see in what direction his complaint lies.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Bennett that there is any insecurity or any dread in regard to the purchase of land.  During the last couple of years holdings in my part of the country realised very large sums, practically as good prices as ever.  There is another thing being done in that part of the country that I think would disprove portion of Deputy Bennett's argument. Some of these ranchers are now holding what might be called &ldquo;mock sales&rdquo; at which a brother comes along and buys a bit of land, so as to bring the 570-acre farm under the £2,000 mark.  Unfortunately the Dáil agreed to that.  In such cases a gentleman comes along and starts out as the supposed tenant, and then goes back to England the following day.  Meanwhile the holding has been reduced to such a size that the Land Commission cannot touch it, because it is under the £2,000 mark.  That type of gentleman can go away leaving unpaid rates and unpaid annuities piling up.  We are in the unfortunate position of having £72,000 in unpaid rates in Cork County last year, and an examination of the lists showed that practically 40 per cent. of that amount was due on holdings of from 200 to 700 acres.</P>

      <P>When we had it there were very bad results for you.  I regret that I brought that in, but when we hear Deputies on the opposite benches making complaints they have to be reminded of other days and of other times, and told what they did when they had power.  I am glad to see the Minister coming here and looking for an increased Estimate for the improvement of holdings owing to the acquisition of land.  I am glad to see him looking for the money necessary to provide decently for tenants and migrants that have been put into some of the ranches that were divided up. I am glad to see the Minister looking for the finances necessary to compel some of these gentlemen to disgorge land, if necessary.  There is one other matter that I would like to deal with in view of Deputy Dillon's statement about building roads through holdings that have been divided.  We had experience of that in my constituency, but we were able to get over it easily by getting a bit of relief grant.  With the consent of the farmers we were able to extend one road to meet another one and in that way we were able to get practically all these roads taken over by the local authority. Generally on these holdings you find a road which does not connect with another public road, and the local authority has then no power to take it over.  We got a relief grant and built the rest of the road, a couple of hundred yards or so, to join with the public road when it came within the statute.</P>

      <P>Yes, they served through all the wars, and did their bit like men.  The people have been paying for these holdings for eight or nine years because the owners left them idle, and the rates going on.  We want to end that kind of thing.  Small farmers and tillage farmers have enough to do to work their holdings without having to pay annuities and rates for ranchers.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will send a few of those inspectors for whom, apparently, he has nothing to do, down to the County Cork, where they will find plenty of land to divide and plenty of good men to go into occupation of it afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that Deputy Corry must not be attending properly to the business of his constituents when there are so many thousands of acres of waste land there. I am afraid when the report of his speech is read by his supporters in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; to-morrow morning they will not be very much impressed with the case he has put up in their interests to the Land Commission. Deputy Corry has always been in the habit of putting forward extraordinary cases, even when he was in opposition, and when the circumstances were subsequently examined it was found that they bore no relation to the cases he quoted in the Dáil, so that I personally attach very little importance to any statement made by Deputy Corry in regard to Land Commission matters, especially in the days when he was in opposition here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate for the improvement of <Col N="731" /> estates has undoubtedly increased very substantially during recent years and there is no doubt, in expending the money in the manner in which it is being expended, the Land Commission is creating a capital asset, which is more than can be said for a great deal of the money so foolishly expended by the present Government in so many other directions.  I do not understand the anxiety of the Land Commission to procure an increased grant of £120,000 at present for the improvement of estates in view of the fact that the Land Commission at the moment must have some thousands of applications before them for grants recommended during the last two, three or four years by their inspectors throughout the country.  I know of cases where grants were recommended at least three years ago for either reconstruction or for the purpose of erecting new houses and these grants have not yet been sanctioned by the Land Commission notwithstanding, as Deputy Corry has reminded us, that the headquarters staff has been very substantially increased during recent years.  As a matter of fact, instead of the three commissioners who were functioning under the late Government, there are five commissioners functioning to-day, all of them, I understand, dealing with the ordinary work of Land Commission administration.  I have sent numerous letters to the Secretary of the Land Commission in his official capacity complaining of delays that have taken place in the granting of money for the purpose of reconstructing dwellinghouses, erecting new houses, carrying out necessary works of drainage or making the necessary roads on lands divided during the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the policy pursued by the Land Commission in regard to the serving of notices on tenants with respect to the visits of inspectors for the purpose of making reports as to the suitability or otherwise of their land for acquisition.  It does seem to me that a great deal of insecurity has been created amongst all sorts of farmers, large and small, because of the indiscriminate way in which notices have been served on farmers throughout <Col N="732" /> this State.  I will just mention two cases which were brought to my notice during the last few months.  In both cases the tenants had purchased out under the 1903 Land Act.  In one case the man had two holdings.  In the case of one holding, which we will call the home farm, on which he had his dwellinghouse, the area was five Irish acres.  The other holding, which was about 1½ miles distant, consisted of 20 Irish acres.  Both holdings were worked in a most modern way.  They were tilled to the utmost of their capacity and conformed in every respect with the conditions laid down in the Land Act of 1933.  Yet this man was served with a notice that the holding consisting of 20 Irish acres was to be visited by an inspector for the purpose of reporting on its suitability for acquisition.  That happened only two or three months ago.</P>
    <P>In the other instance, a man was living on a holding of 9¼ Irish acres, at least 25 per cent of which was tilled. He had an outlying farm of 15 Irish acres and I am sure that out of that 15 Irish acres three or four were tilled. This holding was managed also in a most modern and efficient way and yet this man was served with a notice that his outlying farm was to be visited by an inspector for the purpose of reporting on its suitability or otherwise for acquisition.  These are two of at least 20 cases brought to my notice during the last six months.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is pursuing this policy indiscriminately in other counties as well as the county which I represent.  I could quote for the Parliamentary Secretary another instance where the area of land is even smaller and where the owner was served with a notice that one of his two divisions of land was to be visited by an inspector. In the neighbourhood of the two farms to which I have referred there are big areas of land, at least two big farms, for which the Land Commission have been negotiating within the last three or four years with the object of acquiring them.  These two big farms would be more than adequate for the relief of congestion in the neighbourhood of the holdings to which I have referred.  Only last week another instance was brought under my notice <Col N="733" /> where a similar notice was served on another man whose holdings corresponded in area with the area of the holdings which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary imagine for one moment that when such a feeling of insecurity exists amongst all classes of farmers, large and small, the State is going to get the results we have been told so frequently they desire to get from the farmers?  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that such a policy, if pursued indiscriminately in the manner in which it is being pursued, will create such a feeling of insecurity that these farmers will lose all interest in their farms and eventually they may be reduced to the position that they are quite prepared to hand the land over to the Land Commission or the Government.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary or his Minister to examine personally into the policy which officials are pursuing in regard to this matter that I have mentioned and for goodness' sake let him proclaim publicly if that is their policy and if they mean to adhere to it.  If it is not, then he ought to see to it that they will stop it immediately.</P>
    <P>There is one item in the Estimate which provides a certain amount for expenses incurred through the settlement of the Gaeltacht colonists in Meath.  I would be very much interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary dilating somewhat on the success which has already attended the settlement of these colonists in County Meath.  It does appear that the establishment of Gaelic colonies outside the Gaeltacht is going on the part of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would like to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is the policy of his Department to go on subsidising indefinitely this policy of migration from the Gaeltacht to the eastern countries?  After all, that policy of migration may turn out in the end to be very expensive, in fact the expense may be so great that it may be entirely uneconomic to continue such a policy beyond the experimental stage.  For that reason I submit that <Col N="734" /> it is necessary to examine and to watch this policy of migration very closely.  I would be very much interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on the results which have attended this migration policy up to the present.  I would like, furthermore, to know if he considers that the expense involved in the migration of these colonies has been reasonable, and if, in his opinion, he considers that it is economic.  Furthermore, as it does appear to be his policy to go on still further with the migration from the Gaeltacht to the eastern counties, will he say if he is satisfied that that policy can be pursued at a cost which, in his opinion, is reasonable and a cost which the State can afford to bear?</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I think bears directly on sub-head A, the Improvement of Estates, and that is the way in which the land is being divided at the present time.  According to the Land Acts, land can only be acquired for the purpose of the relief of congestion.  But I notice that, during the last two years especially, land is being utilised for purposes other than the relief of congestion. Land is being distributed in such a manner as will probably lead to the creation of a new land policy in the course of the next 20 or 25 years.  It has been laid down, I think, by the present Minister for Lands that an economic holding is a minimum of ten Irish acres or, in other words, it represents a holding of a valuation of, approximately, £10, and that any man with a holding of a lesser valuation than £10 does not possess an economic holding.  Is it the policy of the Land Commission to bring these men up to the £10 standard laid down by the Minister, which is part and parcel of the policy at present being pursued?  Not at all.  At the present moment in the division of land, parcels of one, two or three acres are given out to landless men, with the result that instead of making an impression on the problem of congestion you are widening that problem and you are creating a new problem for some Land Commission in the far distant future.  What is the policy of the Land Commission with regard to <Col N="735" /> the distribution of land?  Land can only be acquired for one purpose, the relief of congestion.  That is clearly laid down in the Land Acts.  I submit that the land that is being distributed is not utilised for the relief of congestion.  A good deal of the land divided is being distributed in such a manner as to widen the problem of congestion, and it is increasing instead of reducing the number of congests.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to landless men and men in labourers' cottages getting land.  But if it is the policy of the Land Commission that holdings under £10 valuation are uneconomic, then I ask what is the use in giving an acre or two or three acres of land to a landless man?  Is the Minister satisfied that the man can live on two or three acres of land?  Does not the Minister realise, as well as we realise, that at some future time such a man will, in order to be given an opportunity of making a livelihood, have to be given as much additional land as will bring that man's valuation up to the £10 standard laid down by the policy of the Land Commission.  As a matter of fact, at the moment you have no policy for the relief of congestion. You have a policy really for the socialisation of land.  That is the policy that the Land Commission is pursuing and not a policy for the relief of congestion at all.  Quite a substantial acreage of the land distributed during the last two years, especially, is being utilised in the manner I have just described.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to inform me, and through me the House, what is the policy of the Land Commission in regard to the distribution of land. Does he mean to follow the standards laid down in the Land Acts, standards which only entitle the Land Commission to acquire land for the specific purpose for which land can be acquired?  I have a suspicion that the Land Commission is being drawn to this policy by influences that have recently been brought into it, and that the Land Commission, because of the strength of these influences, has been diverted from the purpose for which it was established&mdash;the only legal pur pose for which it exists&mdash;and if it is allowed to pursue its present policy <Col N="736" /> indefinitely it will land this country into the position that after a certain number of years we will find the problem of the relief of congestion such that it will be necessary to introduce in another Parliament a Bill for dealing with this question anew.</P>
    <P>I notice under sub-head C there is an item relating to &ldquo;incidental expenses.&rdquo;  There is one sub-head under the heading of &ldquo;advertising.&rdquo; But the Parliamentary Secretary did not at all dilate on that.  He offered no explanation as to the purpose for which it was incurred or what was the necessity for this extensive advertising. Does that refer to exclusively to the letting of lands on the 11 or 12 months system, to the sale of the houses, or the letting of timber?  To what exactly does it refer?  I only raise the point because it seemed to me that that expenditure is abnormal.  The Land Commission hitherto did not advertise much.  The amount spent was negligible, but a sum of £1,300 in the Supplementary Estimate for the purpose of advertising alone looks rather abnormal and alarming.  If it was to be spent for the purpose of broadcasting their policy in regard to some points I have mentioned some of that expenditure might be justified.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary was rather shy about saying anything in public about his present policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words before the end of the debate.  One thing struck me as remarkable when the Parliamentary Secretary was dealing with this matter in introducing the Estimate to the House, and that was the extraordinary increase in the expenditure in connection with the Land Commission.  Personally I rejoice at that, because if there is one portion of our policy which I think we did put to the people as emphatically as any Party ever put a policy to the people it was to put the people back on the land.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that there was an expenditure of £155,106 in 1931-2; that it is estimated that £520,000 will be spent this year; and that last year there was an expenditure of £318,723.  Those figures indicate <Col N="737" /> that there is some kind of progress in regard to a matter in which I think every Deputy in this House must be interested.  I was surprised indeed to hear all this talk about insecurity of tenure.  I was surprised to hear responsible Deputies of this House say that the farmers' credit had gone down owing to the action of the Land Commission in the way it was dealing with the distribution of land to the people of the country.  Every Deputy in this House must know that if there is one thing more than another that the people of this country want it is the distribution of land.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Bennett to-night say that every penny of the money about which the Parliamentary Secretary told the House has been well spent.  The only regret I have is that it was not more. I do not want to wander outside the matter which we are discussing to-night.  Some of us perhaps may be inclined to make remarks which would be more relevant on the general Estimates; I do not want to do that. I am convinced that there are very few tenant farmers in Ireland to-night &mdash;and I am sure if Deputy Dillon drops the Party attitude for a moment he will realise this&mdash;who feel themselves insecure as a result of the action of the Land Commission in dealing with land distribution.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that. If the facts are as have been stated here by some Deputies&mdash;if farms of 34 acres have been inspected and are being dealt with by the Land Commission, while large estates adjoining those farms are undivided&mdash;I would not stand for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I presume, will be dealing with those features of the matter.  I cannot believe that the Land Commission would devote its time and attention to a farm of 34 acres, if, as Deputies of the Party opposite have suggested, there are <Col N="738" /> large ranches of hundreds of acres adjoining those farms, which have not been dealt with.  I think that would be very ill-advised, and I for one would not stand for it.  In the first case, it would not be correct; in the second place, it would not be to the advantage of the community; and, in the third place, I believe it would be a very bad precedent to set up, and might eventually lead to confusion. Deputy Bennett also referred to the deterioration in land value.  He said that nobody would buy; that no farmer would have the heart to do any repairs to his houses or to keep his land in good order.  If all this talk about insecurity of tenure is true how do you account for the price paid for land the other day at public auctions?  It has been reported in the Press that land in counties not far from here has been sold at £60 an acre.  I cannot reconcile that with the statements made to-night by Deputies on the other side.  I should like to assure the House, through you, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that there is no Deputy in this House more keen than I am on seeing the land distributed quickly.  I suppose in common with other Deputies of this House I could paper the Committee Rooms of this House with acknowledgments from the Land Commission and with applications from people looking for land.  I believe it is a most urgent matter, and is one of the matters to which the greatest amount of time and attention should be devoted.  I believe I am not exaggerating when I say that I do not think there are better farms in any part of Ireland than those in South Leix.  Everybody knows the intensive tillage that takes place down there. Notwithstanding that, I know that right in the centre of that particular place there are ranches of 1,000 acres which have not yet been divided.  We have tried to get at the Land Commission, I freely admit.  Personally I took a new line of action recently in regard to the Land Commission.  I stopped annoying the officials with letters.  I knew I would get back only the official reply, and I decided that I would take 12 months in which I would write as few letters as possible. I want to state publicly in the Dáil <Col N="739" /> that from the unasked for communications which I got, pointing out the land that had been divided, I found that if I had been writing as many letters as possible in regard to this question I could have got no better results than those which have taken place.  In constituencies like Leix where there is intensive tillage &mdash; I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of this and put the matter to the Minister&mdash;and where those ranches exist they are a source of irritation and annoyance to the people of those areas, and always will be while those conditions exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I received from the office of the Land Commission a letter stating that certain estates had been taken over for division.  Those were estates which I had been harping on for quite a long time, and I presume that the officials in the office understood my interest.  I was particularly interested in ranches adjoining the famous Luggacurran district, where evictions took place, and where people are living up in the hills on bad land. I was glad to see that at least some steps had been taken in the direction of making grass land available for those people.  I am not going to travel outside the scope of this Vote, but I should like to say that during the first year in which the Tuam beet factory was set up had it not been for the intensive tillage that factory would have been a flop.  From Kilbrickin station alone 10,000 tons of beet were sent along to Tuam.  The average size of the farms in many cases was 20 or 30 acres.  Here are farmers with the land tilled practically to the point of exhaustion, and they want more.  Yet adjoining those farms there were ranches which were still undivided. I suppose we ought to be grateful for what has been done, but I do say to the Parliamentary Secretary that speed could not be developed to too great an extent in order to help the people in a community such as that.  I <Col N="740" /> do not think that I have anything else to say on the subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy talked about the purpose of the Land Commission, and asked what was the main objective to be secured by land distribution.  It is to put people back on the land; it is to relieve congestion, if you like to put it in that way; to give land to uneconomic holders and make them economic holders.  Then there was a third point which often cropped up in this House, and that was the purpose of putting back on the land the descendants of evicted tenants.</P>
      <P>These are the three headings of what I always understood and believed to be the policy of the Government in land division.  I still believe it.  It can all be summed up in the words&mdash;get the people back on the land.  When Deputy Dillon perhaps has been making an attack on the Government about certain forms of our policy and saying that we were ruining the country, I have often put the query, &ldquo;Why is there such an urge to get land?&rdquo; My object in putting the query was that a man who is married and has a family and who has a little land is always sure of some food for himself and his family and of shelter and has a stake in the country.  It is an instinctive trait in the character of an Irishman to have a stake in the country.  I believe that one of the greatest things we could do, leaving aside domestic differences that may take place from time to time, would be by the common goodwill of all Parties to pass three times the amount of money we are passing in order to see the land distributed quickly, economically, efficiently, fairly, and justly.  I do not believe in the example given by Deputy Dillon about Deputies urging in their branches of our organisation that certain land must be divided in a certain way.  I would not stand for that.  I believe in justice and fair play.</P>

      <P>I will give the House another case.  A man advertised a portion of land for sale and some man in the neighbourhood bought it.  I do not want to give names or figures because this has to go on.  The man signed a contract for purchase and requisitions on title were served. When the requisitions were answered it was disclosed that the land had been inspected.  When the purchaser saw the answer to this requisition he refused to complete the purchase because he had contracted to give a big price, and the price he would get from the Land Commission would be infinitesimal.  The vendor has now served a writ on him for specific performance of his contract.  The figures in this case are substantial.  If that case goes into the courts and is published in the Press who in this country is going to buy land at any sort of price in future?  Further, counsel have advised the purchaser that in law he is bound to complete his contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that the vendor had asked for specific performance.  Surely that will convince Deputy Donnelly that, if this policy is being pursued and we believe these are things that will lead to trouble and to the depreciation of the value of land in this country, it is our duty to deal with them and bring them before the Government and let them see whether they are true or not.  I believe that Deputy Roddy's allegation is perfectly true&mdash;that the purpose of the Land Commission has become completely diverted.  What is the purpose of the Land Commission?  What was it created for?  The Land Commission was created for three purposes.  First, as a conduit pipe between landlord and tenant, and when the landlords were purchased out to collect the interest on the money advanced and pay the interest thereon.  Secondly, to improve estates; and, thirdly, to relieve congestion by taking over large tracts of land that were not tenanted.</P>
      <P>Is the Land Commission being diverted from that purpose! I am not blaming anybody.  I am not making any allegation as to who is the cause of it.  Surely it has been diverted. What is the result of that?  Take land from anybody.  I submit that no tenanted land should be taken over except at the market price and, if at all possible, that no tenanted land should be taken over at all, because the whole land war was carried on in order that these people should become tenant purchasers.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have got powers to take over land of various kinds.  Now, when the 1933 Act was going through this House, we had a definite undertaking from the Minister that the land would be taken over at its market value.  It is hardly necessary to point out to anybody in this House or in the country that that is not being done, and the result of that is nobody is going to buy a farm of land at any sort of a decent price, or at any price at all, because if he pays a price for it, it will be the market price, and if he pays the market price notice will be served on him the next day and the value of his land will be reduced by one-third.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use in talking?  Where is the use in, say, taking me from a congested district and putting me on a farm in County Meath when, in a few years, you are to come in and inspect that land and put, say, Deputy Donnelly in my place?  Is it going to be a procession of this kind&mdash;put out McMenamin, put in Donnelly, then put out Donnelly and put in O'Leary?  The whole purpose of the setting up of the Land Commission was to get security, and is not this present policy going to strike at the very foundation of security?  If you are going to destroy that security, all this policy of the improvement of estates and the making of roads and so on is not worth anything. <Col N="745" /> All these improvements of estates and building of roads and so on are worth nothing compared with that issue.  You are striking at the root of land tenure in this country, and if you do that, then you can go on improving estates, making roads, dividing holdings, and putting people on these holdings, but it will be worth nothing.  If you destroy security, what is the use of taking a man and his family and putting them on a holding? It is going to be a vicious circle and, as Deputy Dillon says, it is going to lead to worse than the land war. It is going to be far worse than the cases of Clanrickarde or Barrymore or the other landlords.  It must be remembered that this is a country where the roots of the land war still exist.  The agrarian spirit is still there and you can very easily rekindle it.  Even Deputy Donnelly's speech, the burden of which was, &ldquo;Put the people on the land,&rdquo; shows that that spirit is there. It has always been there.  That policy was preached by Irish politicians in this country 40 and 50 years ago.</P>

      <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House <Col N="746" /> on what principle they are proceeding with regard to the acquisition of land. I do not mind them taking over farms of land if they are going to pay the market price for them.  It may be a very expensive thing to take farms over at the market price, but one effect it will have is that the Government will indicate to the country that the man who pays £1,000 for land to-day will be able to get the same amount to-morrow.  I agree with what Deputy Roddy and Deputy Dillon said.  If security of tenure is going to be destroyed I regret it profoundly, and if that thing is going to happen I would prefer to be out of public life altogether. Cases have been given by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Roddy, who is an ex-Parliamentary Secretary for Lands, and who knows more about this thing than any of us.  I also have given my case.  We can prove these cases and can give the facts, and we can give the names if necessary.  They cannot be denied.  Is the Government going to pursue that policy?  If so, the policy is going to lead to chaos and anarchy and another land war which will be worse than ever before because, in the past, it was not a case of every holding in the country but only of a few big landlords in Ireland. In this case, however, every farmer in the country will be affected.  There will be no security of tenure for any farmer, no matter what kind of a holding he has.  Does Deputy Donnelly approve of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <P>Will Deputy Donnelly help us to prevent it happening? I should like the House and the country to get a definite undertaking from the Parliamentary Secretary that this policy will not be pursued.  The making of roads and the improvements of estates, and so on, are not worth anything if that policy is going to be pursued.  On what principle is this land policy proceeding?  That question should be answered to-night, and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of himself and the Government, to give us an undertaking that they will not take any steps to <Col N="747" /> interfere with security of tenure in this country and that men who invest money in land as an investment and for the love of being on the land will be left there in security.  If, on the contrary, there should be hidden or partially hidden influences operating and directing the policy of the Land Commission, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get his back up against that and put his foot down on it and tell these people that that cannot be done.  That policy, if it is pursued, will lead to ruination, and if we are to deal with the land on that principle, or rather lack of principle, the land will not be worth giving to the people.</P>

      <P>That is just the point. I do not stand for these little petty things of trying to do an injustice to any man, but where I find five units with an average valuation of £4 10s. and find five or six people herded into one holding&mdash;willing to earn their living if they were given an opportunity&mdash;I think it is the duty of this House and of the Land Commission to give these people an opportunity of earning their living.  We hear a lot of talk in this House about unemployment <Col N="748" /> and as to what we should do to relieve it.  There are hundreds of young men in my own county, some of them even with a fair amount of money who, if they get an opportunity of working and developing land, would do so.  I am rather shocked that any section in this House should use the argument that the Land Commission should not proceed with the division of land, more particularly when those unfortunate holders in County Longford, to whom I have referred, who have paid their own rates and land annuities, will have to pay an additional rate because of the failure of the people owning up to 300 acres to pay their annuities.  I urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary to proceed with the division of land as quickly as possible, and I only regret that the Estimate for that purpose is not larger.  The country is crying out for the division of land, and it is our duty to proceed with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a commonsense question, a question to which An Leas-Cheann Comhairle might not unreasonably allow the Deputy to reply.  I ask the Deputy this further question.  If he purchased British Bonds or British War Loan, would he like to be compelled to sell them at any time at the world market price? I know of people who support the Deputy's Party and who spoke recently in Cork and one of them referred to the fact that he got more in dividends out of investments he had made in the Free State than he had got out of investments made in England.  I ask the Deputy why should those people who went outside the country to invest their money enjoy security while the unfortunate people who invested all they had in their land, who put their money into land with a view to providing for their families, are to be robbed and punished?  I remember the land agitation over a 50 years period.  I went out in my bare feet in the snow in order to help them to carry on the land agitation.  I have a very lively recollection of it, and I never thought that the effect of that agitation would be destroyed by an Irish Government. I want to be quite clear on this question.  I am out for the division of land, but I am not out for the robbery of people who own land in this country.  Deputy Corry tried to confuse the issue raised by Deputy Dillon to-night by referring to cases of people with 1,100 or 1,200 acres or was it 12,000 acres?</P>

Nobody objects to the taking over of lands such as these and nobody ever did, but we object to taking land from people who put their money quite honestly into it, without any objection from people in the neighbourhood when they took over these lands.  I do not want to carry on the debate much further because everybody knows the injustice <Col N="750" /> of these cases.  I again ask Deputy Donnelly will he say whether the Land Commission have not power to take over the lands he mentioned a while ago?  As Cork has been mentioned, I may say that the special squad have been very busy in Cork for some time past.  The Minister introduced here some time ago a Bill to make the costs of collection of land annuities smaller than they were under the old régime.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain what has become of the money collected by the special squad when they go round to 15 small farmers in one area and collect £2 from each of them?  I would ask him to explain what becomes of that money.  They collected in all £30 from these 15 farmers.  What becomes of that, and where does it go to?</P>

We have no ranchers in Wexford owning 1,200 or 1,300 acres such as Deputy Corry <Col N="751" /> referred to as existing in County Cork and we do not want them.  We want the land for the people, but is it fair to take over the lands of a farmer who has only a farm of 29 or 90 acres? We have ten cases of that kind in Wexford, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get these notices withdrawn.  If the attempt is persisted in it will not be allowed to finish.

He employs four agricultural labourers and two domestic servants and has 80 per cent. of his land tilled.  We have another case of a farmer living on 90 acres who has been served with notice. Remember these men's fathers and grandfathers lived on this land, and the boys of Wexford are not going to stand taking the land off them.  I am sure Deputy Donnelly will not stand for it either.  By all means buy out the ranches, but is it fair to take these comparatively small farms from men who are giving good employment?  I know the farmer holding 90 acres whose case has been referred to.  I know him from childhood.  He employs five agricultural labourers and two domestic servants.  He employs additional hands during the busy season.  He is a man who has a wife and three children, yet he has been served with notice that in due course an inspector will inspect his land. Does Deputy Corry stand for that?</P>

      <P>There are a few remarks I should like to make in connection with the division of land in the <Col N="753" /> country.  From time to time we see advertisements in the local papers in every county of numbers of farms which are up for sale.  If the Land Commission want to get land for division why do they not send representatives to those auctions to purchase land in the open market and pay a reasonable price for it instead of taking land from farmers of the type to which Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Keating have referred who are working their land and giving employment?  If the Land Commission want land for division those farms are being offered for sale all over the country, and they could be purchased and used for that purpose instead of taking farms over from men who are working their land and giving good employment.  There will be very little objection by any member of this House to taking over for division ranches of 1,300 and 1,400 acres which are worked by a man and a dog, and which give little employment, but it is unfair to take the land off the type of man to whom I have referred.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission should seriously consider the harm and damage they are doing to such people in taking over for £300 or £400 farms into which men may have put £2,000 or £3,000 five or ten years ago.  It is not fair play or honesty for a Government to do that.  Whatever purchase is made it should be made on the value of the land, even though the money paid for the land could not be paid back by the intending tenant. There should be some regulation made whereby the Government could step in and pay portion of the money so that the land could be given to the tenant at a rent he could pay.  That is all I have to say in connection with the division of land.</P>
      <P>The other point to which I wish to refer is the question of the giving of land to men without a certain amount of capital, who are not in a position to work that land.  That is useless waste.  It is merely waste to give land to a man without capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In other circumstances, I think every member of the House would welcome a Supplementary Estimate of almost £76,000 for the purposes of the Land Commission Vote, but the uneasiness that exists amongst a very large section of the farming community in this country has found expression here this evening in the speeches made by Deputies Dillon, Roddy, McMenamin, Keating and my colleague from Kilkenny.  There can be no doubt about it in the minds of anybody, even of the non-farming class in the country, or anybody who has any contact at all with the farming community, as most of the members of this House have&mdash;the constituency I repre sent, while a city constituency, embraces many thousands of farmers, although, of course, under the new <Col N="755" /> Constituency Bill that will cease to operate&mdash;that the questions put up by the Deputies whom I have named demand a reply and indeed an explanation as to the whole policy of the Land Commission in future.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the situation which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider.  Indeed, I would go further and ask the Minister for Lands to convey to his colleagues on the Executive Council the message which I think has already been conveyed to him from the country.  It is a very easy step, according to the policy being pursued now, from resuming at their own price land mentioned by Deputy Keating and others, which people have bought at the market price to taking over businesses. There is the famous case in County Limerick which it is not necessary for me to repeat here; it is well known to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government.  I am in favour of dividing land, and I believe the policy of &ldquo;back to the land&rdquo; is a good one, although I might remark that I know very few people who have left the land and who enjoy any kind of lucrative position who are any way anxious to get back to the land.  I can hardly visualise Deputy Donnelly going back or many other members of the Government Benches.  The point I wish to emphasise is that it is a very easy step, under these conditions, and in the circumstances under which land is being acquired now, from acquiring land to the acquisition of business premises. It may be said that some merchants or traders are not carrying on their business to the advantage of the community. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say to me that the Government will take over those premises and those undertakings?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am uttering this note of warning because it is a very easy step from the policy that is at present being pursued by the Land Commission in acquiring the land of <Col N="756" /> industrious farmers at the price that it fixes itself to a communistic State when you can acquire industries and other undertakings in the country. Now, there is a very strong analogy there, an analogy which I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and the Land Commission will bear in mind.  We must have an answer to the question put by several Deputies, as to whether it is the studied policy of the Land Commission to acquire the land of farmers who are farming their land as well as they have been trained to do it.  Is it the policy of the Land Commission to go to a farmer whose father and grandfather fought for the land they hold, and say that they are going to acquire it?  These are questions that, I think, require an answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I emphasise the point that I have already made that it is a very easy step indeed from acquiring the land of honest, hard-working, thrifty and frugal farmers who are farming their land in the best interests of themselves and their families to acquiring the business undertakings in this country.</P>
      <P>It may be, of course, that the urge for this policy comes from outside this House.  It may come from some organisations operating under the guise of national organisations but which are really communistic in character.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware, as I am aware, that there is very grave uneasiness in the minds of many farmers in the country, of many industrious, hardworking men who now believe that the title to their land is not worth a pinch of snuff.  All that, I think, has been brought about by the policy of the Land Commission within recent years.  We want to be assured, the country in general wants to be assured, and the people on the land want to be assured that their title is worth something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with one aspect of the debate, and it is that Deputies on all sides of the House seem to appreciate the good work which the Land Commission is doing in speeding up the division of land. <Col N="757" /> Deputy Dillon expressed anxiety regarding the Gaeltacht colonies.  That anxiety was echoed by other Deputies who have spoken, notably by Deputy Bartley and Deputy O Briain who thoroughly approved of the experiment which is being carried out at Athboy. Deputy Dillon seemed to express some uneasiness, and his views were endorsed by other speakers on the opposite benches.  I would remind the House that it is rather early yet to form a considered opinion as to the value of that experiment, but so far as it has gone I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the first 16 families migrated to Athboy have had a very satisfactory year during the past season.  They have had a bumper harvest; their crops have been well up to the standard which obtains locally, and for the first time in the lives of many of them they have been enabled to kill a pig for the Christmas as well as having what, perhaps, they did not have in the areas from which they came, namely, a plentiful supply of milk, of butter and of all the other necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>So far, so good.  That policy is being watched very carefully by the Government, and if it proves satisfactory, as I think everybody who has the interests particularly of the people of the Gaeltacht at heart will be anxious that it should, I think that no Deputy in this House, will grudge the money which is spent on the migration of these people who in the past have endured untold hardships endeavouring to eke out an existence from the barren rocks in many parts of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which Deputy Dillon referred was the making of roads.  He pointed out that the Land Commission, when dividing estates, makes roads into the houses for the allottees.  That is quite correct.  But the Land Commission consider that when they have divided an estate and provided homesteads for those allottees who require such homes, and have made roads into their homesteads for them, their duty is finished. When the Land Commission have done <Col N="758" /> that: when the lands have been fenced, and the homes provided for these people on that estate, they regard the job as well done.  We think that the obligation for the maintenance of these roads rests upon another authority.  I, personally, would be glad to see either the local authority or the Department of Local Government taking up the question of roadmaking, bearing in mind, at the same time, that there are other old roads all over the country which were made long before the Land Commission came into being, and that the tenants on them would have an equal claim to that of the tenants on the estates which are now being divided to have their roads also made by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Considerable apprehension has been expressed by many Deputies on the opposite benches about the policy of the Government regarding the acquisition of land&mdash;of tenanted land, and the land of smallholders.  I can assure Deputies that we are just as anxious as they are, or as other people outside this House are, to avoid interference with the ordinary tenant farmers.  It is not the policy of the Government to interfere with such, and if any undue and unnecessary anxiety is being created in the minds of farmers all over the country: if, as alleged by Deputies on the opposite side, farmers are uneasy as to their fixity of tenure, and that as a result of that uneasiness the value of land has depreciated in the country, the chief cause of that in my humble opinion are the speeches made by Deputies on the opposite benches for purely political purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the statements made from the opposite benches, the owner of this land paid £3,000 for it during the peak year of values, round about the year 1924.  That land, for which at that time he paid £3,000, has since been acquired by the Land Commission.  It was an outside, nonresidential holding.  Does any Deputy on the opposite benches maintain that £3,000 for a holding of that size is its fair marketable value?  If £3,000 is to be paid for every holding of that size, what is it going to cost to divide all the lands in the country which are to be acquired for division and paid for at that price?  In every instance, the fair marketable value of holdings acquired by the Land Commission is paid for them, and in many instances it is known that even more than the market value has been paid for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that altogether, the question of the price to be paid for land is one that is determined not by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, but by a special tribunal set up under the Land Acts, and in the 1933 Land Act the Minister specially divested himself of the power of determining the price to be paid for any such land.  A judicial tribunal has been set up, and any owner of land about to be acquired has the right to appeal to that tribunal.  In this famous instance, the owner did appeal and made his case before the tribunal, with the result that, through that tribunal was one set up by this Government, which is accused of political victimisation <Col N="760" /> and a lot of other misdeeds, the amount of money which was originally suggested as the proper value of that holding was increased by a considerable sum.</P>

But I should like to assure the House that the question as to the lands to be acquired is one outside the purview of any organisation or any Party or any individual.

It is open to members of Fianna Fáil clubs or any other organisation to make representations to the Land Commission. These are examined on their merits &mdash;and on their merits alone.  The <Col N="762" /> inspectors of the Land Commission have explieit instructions as to the classes of people to whom land must be given.  As I have said, the Minister expressly divested himself of that power in order to establish a machine which would be absolutely impartial and above and beyond the influence of any Party in power, either now or in the future.

To-day, officials of the Land Commission and the inspectorate staff are being driven as they were never driven before, but there is a limit to their endurance and capacity.

      <P>Deputy Roddy referred to the serving of notices of inspection on small holders.  It is not the general policy of the Land Commission to serve notices of inspection on small holders, nor is it the policy of the Land Commission to acquire such small holdings.  As I stated in a reply to a question the other day, inspectors in the course of their duty are supposed to take note of and report to the Land Commission any large holdings in their area, because if the Land Commission is to acquire land it must be in possession of this knowledge.  It is for that reason that inspectors are expected to report on land that comes to their notice in the course of their duty.  Deputy Roddy referred to the relief of congestion and to £10 valuation as the standard of an economic holding.  It is an instruction to Land Commission inspectors that, where land is up for division, they are to give preference to uneconomic holders&mdash;that is, to all people under £10 valuation.  That is probably what has given rise to the Deputy's view that that standard has been set up for economic holdings.  I do not think that any further important point remains to be dealt with and the time limit has been almost reached.</P>

For that reason, the estimate is not exceptional. Deputy Corry referred to unpaid rates by non-residents and to the speeding up of land division.  I can only repeat that everything possible is being done to speed up land division and inspectors have special instructions to look after non-residential holdings and holdings which are not being worked in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry. I think I have covered any points that have been made, except that I might refer to Deputy Anthony's warning against Communism, and that farmers are getting uneasy about the title to land.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture a question to-day, as to whether he would consider abandoning <Col N="765" /> one of the maize meal mixture schemes, owing to the fact that it was costing pig producers from 3/6 to 3/- per cwt. more for maize meal than it would cost if no such scheme was in force.  I pointed out that the maize meal mixture scheme had signally failed to do what it was supposed to do; that it had signally failed to effect what was held out as the only justification for it.  We all know that the Minister has progressively increased the home-grown grain content of the maize meal mixture during the last six months.  It was first 10 per cent., then 20 per cent., then 33? per cent., and finally 50 per cent.  With every increase in the mixture the price of meal was raised, and finally a situation developed in which a protest grew up all over the country, that there were piles of barley and piles of oats that were quite unsaleable at any price.  It was after that protest grew that the Minister finally increased the content of the maize meal mixture to the record figure of 50 per cent., innocently thinking that by doing so it would relieve the situation.  Anybody who knew the Indian meal trade could have told him before he did that, that by increasing the maize meal content to 50 per cent., instead of disposing of more home-grown grain through admixture, he drove up the price of the mixture by over 8/-, and made it an entirely uneconomic commodity for the feeding of live stock.  The people stopped using it.  Whereas in the past that might have got rid of a certain amount of home-grown grain, now it has virtually got rid of none of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Minister turned to a firm which has at its head a one-time Senator of this State.  Arthur Guinness Son &amp; Co. is the kind of firm that Deputy Corry is so fond of denouncing as a stronghold of the ascendancy, as a force of reaction, and an enemy of Irish freedom and progress. Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. was turned to by the Minister, and they stepped into the gap, as they had frequently done before, and took off the market an enormous quantity of barley which, for the moment, has removed the emergency in which the Minister for Agriculture for Saorstát Eireann found himself through his own <Col N="766" /> fault.  The Minister for Agriculture for Saorstát Eireann could not get out of it without the assistance of Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co.  It must be said for Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. that when anybody applied to them for any information as to the actual position, and what they were asked to do, they were informed that the firm had no information to offer.  With that quixotic gallantry which characterises certain of the old-established business houses in this country, they do their job.  They refused to reveal a single word about a transaction which they thought might be used to embarrass a Party which has denounced them in all moods and tenses.  However, fortunately there are other ways of finding out what actually passed without getting it from Messrs.  Guinness. If there were not such other ways we could not get the information, because Messrs.  Guinness would not give it. The fact is that Messrs.  Guinness, as far as my information goes, were approached directly or indirectly&mdash;not by the Government.  I should think it highly probable that it was indirectly. The Minister will be in a position to say that he never approached them, just as he said a few days ago that he never approached the Bacon Marketing Board with regard to the price of pigs.  He knows he approached the board, and I know he approached it, and he knows that I know he approached it.  Yet, I admit, he is in a position to say that he made no direct approach.  He told someone they ought to say to someone on the Bacon Marketing Board that such a thing should be done, and he told someone here that something should be done, and Messrs.  Guinness did it.</P>
    <P>What they did was, they let grain dealers know that, for one reason or another, they were prepared to take large parcels of grain at a price which was substantially better than the price the unfortunate grain growers could get in the open market&mdash;the market created by the Minister for Agriculture, the Fianna Fáil market, which was to spell prosperity for every grain grower.  They instructed the grain dealers to put this considerable quantity of barley into the hands of the <Col N="767" /> maltsters.  The people are finding out the consequences of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to quote a speech of Mr. Daniel Corkery, T.D., which was delivered a few months ago to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  He was fortified by a resolution from Macroom Comhairle Ceanntair.  Mr. Corkery's speech is reported in the evening newspapers of December 4, 1935.  He moved a resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Requesting the setting up of a commission to inquire into existing conditions in congested districts and in the Gaeltacht with a view to improving the marketing facilities of agricultural produce, and reporting on the advantage, if any, which the people in those districts had derived from the different schemes initiated by Government Departments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of these schemes was the maize meal mixture scheme.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The commission should be empowered to examine useful schemes because,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;this thing has come to breaking point with the people living in the poorer districts. They are barely existing at present, and it is the duty of the Government to see that some means be devised by which they will be able to live at least in some kind of comfort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must say that I sympathise with Mr. Corkery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that statement was quoted here before, I think, by Deputy Dillon, and Deputy Corkery gave a full explanation of it. It does not coincide with what has been said by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the schemes which Deputy Corkery found is conferring no benefit on the people of West Cork is the maize meal mixture scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="768" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he mentioned it in that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies do not like this&mdash;I knew they would not.  One of the things Deputy Corkery is feeling very much in West Cork, and I do not blame him, is the maize meal mixture scheme&mdash;and why?  Because Cork is the biggest pig-rearing county in Saorstát Eireann and the Cork pig producers have got to sell their pigs very largely in the British market as a result of a trade agreement entered into by the Minister for Agriculture with Great Britain, with the base, bloody and brutal British Saxon.  The Cork farmer has to sell his pig in Great Britain or to the producer of bacon who is going to sell his bacon in Great Britain, and the farmer in Great Britain with whom he has to compete is buying Indian meal to-day at 4/9 per cwt., while the farmer in West Cork is paying 8/1.  That is at least a difference of 3/- per cwt. in the price of meal; it is rather more, but let us say 3/-.  According to the Minister for Agriculture, it takes 6 cwts. of meal to fatten a pig.  That means that on every finished pig the Irish farmer has to expend 18/- more than the British farmer with whom he is competing. I assert that the best expert opinion is that it takes between 800 and 900 lbs., avoirdupois, of Indian meal or maize meal mixture to fatten a pig and on that basis it costs the Irish farmer £1 per pig more than it costs the British farmer to finish a pig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maize meal is used for pigs, fowl, live stock of all kinds, and the small farmers, because it is principally the small farmers who are engaged in pig-feeding and fowl-rearing, are carrying the whole of this burden.  We could proceed to assess whatever burden they were carrying against the advantage this scheme was conferring on the farmers of the Midlands, but the farmers of the Midlands cannot sell their grain, and, despite the most energetic exertions of the Minister for Agriculture under the maize meal mixture scheme, he was quite unable to sell the grain for them and they did not dispose of it until Messrs.  Arthur <Col N="769" /> Guinness &amp; Son intervened and took it off their hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get his full ten minutes, and I hope he will be able to justify the fact that he has saddled every farmer who has to buy the maize meal mixture with 3/- per cwt. for every cwt. he buys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any doubt or confusion in the minds of Deputies as to the accuracy of the prices I quote, I have taken special precautions to get from the City of Derry the prices ruling there a few days ago, and I ascertained that it was £4 15s. per ton.  In the West of Ireland to-day it is 8/1 per cwt., inland.  Perhaps it is about 4d. or 5d. less than that at the Port of Sligo.  You may say 7/9 in Sligo and 8/1 in Dublin.  About a week ago the price in Derry was 4/9 a cwt. and I have had that figure carefully checked.  Let Deputies also bear this fact in mind, that Indian meal with 50 per cent. of oats or barley in it is not a balanced ration.  When farmers were buying pure Indian meal they could mix it on their own farms with the cereals they grew at home and with meat-meal or other mixtures in order to make the balanced ration for the stock.  Again, the balanced ration that suits the pig will not suit the fowl, and the balanced ration that suits the fowl is not going to suit the calf.  You now have to take Indian meal with 50 per cent. of home-grown cereals in it for all stock and try to adjust that as best you can with other meals you buy elsewhere or with roots <Col N="770" /> in order to restore the balance in that ration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it not been proved by demonstration that barley meal is much better for pig-feeding than whole Indian meal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should pay close attention to what I say, because he will learn a lot if he does. It may be true the food value of barley is very high and the food value in connection with the feeding of pigs is undoubtedly high.  Barley meal unblended with any other food product is not a balanced ration for a pig or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>A perfect ration for a pig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a barley grower and does not know anything about the production of pigs or livestock. But the Deputy will learn.  I have opened his eyes to the fact that in that regard he is as ignorant as Deputy Tom Kelly, and I could not say more.  The difference between Deputy Tom Kelly and the Deputy from Kilkenny is that Deputy Tom Kelly does not want to learn about matters agricultural and the Deputy from Kilkenny does.  I have no doubt that Deputy Gibbons will apply his mind to this problem and learn something about it.  When he has done that he will not interrupt so gaily. Indian meal is better in the hands of an intelligent farmer who knows how to mix it with other foodstuffs in order to make a balanced ration.  A 50-50 per cent. mixture of oats and Indian meal is an unbalanced ration and an extremely awkward commodity to use.  The Irish farmer is not only paying 3/- a cwt. more for what he is buying, but he is buying something which is not as good for the purpose for which he requires it. It is costing him 18/- to 20/- per pig more than his British competitor is paying and there can be no justification for that.  We are getting no advantage <Col N="771" /> from the maize meal mixture scheme and the Government ought to wind it up and let the people get foodstuffs as cheaply as they can when such are the raw material of the invaluable livestock industry of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Doctor Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I will have time to reply fully to Deputy Dillon, but I will say right off that every statement he made was untrue.  You may take it everything he said was untrue and if I do not reach all his points in the time at my disposal, at least you will find that so far as I can go it will be easy to prove that the Deputy is merely drawing on his imagination.  He says the maize meal mixture scheme has failed.  For the four years before this scheme came into operation the import of maize amounted to 7,439,000 cwts.  Last year the mills turned out 7,949,000 cwts. of maize meal mixture.  Let the Deputy make enquiries about that from the maize millers, just as he made enquiries about the cost of meal in Derry.  The Deputy would like to see the scheme fail.  He said that I went to Messrs. Guinness indirectly.  No, I did not, but Messrs Guinness came to me directly and they said they were doing a better trade than they expected in this country.  For the first time in about ten years trade had improved.  They had not bought enough barley and they wanted to know if they could get another 40,000 barrels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Minister do about that&mdash;could they buy barley from the Minister?  Why did the Minister go to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not want to hear this.  I did not go to Messrs.  Guinness directly or indirectly. <Col N="772" /> I would not mind going to them, but I did not.  I had no idea they would take more barley.  I knew they had done an increased trade last year, but I found that they had done even better than I thought.  They took more barley last year than in any of the ten previous years.  The managing director of Messrs.  Guinness came to me three weeks ago and said that though he had taken more barley last season than in the previous years, still he wanted 40,000 barrels additional.  He asked me if I thought it was available in the country, and I said that I thought it was.  I have not heard from him since.  Deputy Dillon talked about my indirect approaches to the Bacon Board.  I did not approach the Board.  They approached me.  I told them that whether they put up the price or not an increased bounty could not be given them.  Deputy Dillon talks about the price of maize.  He said that maize could be bought at 3/9 per cwt. lower than the mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 3/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If any Deputy will work out for himself the cost of a balanced ration he will find that what the Deputy is saying is absolute nonsense. Maize is £4 4s. a ton in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the price in Derry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what the price is in Derry.  If we were to take half maize and half barley, is it not obvious that the greatest difference would be 1/3 per cwt.?  At the same time I want to point out that, as a result of our cereal legislation, pollard is being sold now in Dublin more cheaply than in Liverpool.  The average price of pollard in Dublin for the last 12 months was 15/- to 20/- per cwt. less than in Liverpool.  But before the flour-milling scheme came into operation here pollard in Dublin was dearer by 15 per cent. than in Liverpool&mdash;naturally because we had to import our pollard the price in Dublin was the cost in Liverpool plus the freight.  The same thing held good with regard to the price of bran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> Now we come to the question of the balanced ration.  Deputies ought not to talk about matters of which they know nothing.  A balanced ration means a different thing from what many Deputies think.  An intelligent person understands this&mdash;whether Deputy Dillon understands it or is capable of understanding it I do not know.  An intelligent person understands that a balanced ration means a certain proportion of carbo-hydrates, a certain proportion of proteins and a certain proportion of fat.  Whether you are using oats, maize, barley or potatoes as one side of the mixture, you must work up a balanced ration. You will never get a balanced ration between maize and barley because they have the same constituents. Deputy Dillon talked about the farmer feeding maize to pigs, and he said it would take 8 cwt. or 9 cwt. of maize to fatten a pig.  It would take at least that much, perhaps more if any farmer were foolish enough to fatten a pig by feeding maize meal to it, but not if you have a balanced ration.  Just imagine any farmer trying to fatten a pig on maize meal!</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister forgets that the farmer himself can make up a very good mixture from pure maize the food produced on the farm, and separated milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a lot of nonsense this evening.  It is no wonder we hear so much about its taking 8 cwt. or 9 cwt. of maize to fatten a pig.  Take the ordinary mixture that any farmer who knows how to feed pigs is using.  You take, say, 8 cwt. of maize, 8 cwt. of pollard and 2 cwt. of meat meal&mdash;take the simplest balanced mixture and compare the price the British farmer is paying for it with the price we pay, and Deputy Dillon, if he does any research in prices, will find that the British farmer is paying 6/- a ton less than we are paying here.  That 6/- a ton is the difference between the cost of the ordinary balanced ration here and in England.  That is what a ration made out in a proper way between maize, barley, meat meal, pollard and <Col N="774" /> bran would cost in the fattening of a pig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us what are the respective prices of Indian meal and Indian meal mixture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Down in Deputy Corry's county.  I am quite sure that if Deputy Corry goes to any mill in his area he will get this mixture at £6 15s. a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but I should like to ask him to make inquiries in Bally-vourney, which is in the Gaeltacht, as to what price is being charged for this maize mixture.  Some of his friends are in the business there and I can prove that they are charging £8 5s. Od. a ton for maize mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the price ex-mill.  If there is anything wrong about the price after the mixture leaves the mill it is due to some other reason.  I repeat that the price in the South of Ireland is £6 15s. Od. a ton.  If you take one of these mills and you give them pure maize at £4 4s. Od. a ton and oats at £7 5s. a ton, what does any Deputy in this House think as to the price at which the mixture can be turned out?  For some years before this scheme came into operation the ordinary charges for delivery came to over £1 15s. Od., it may be less in the North of Ireland.  But suppose they did it for £1 a ton.  I think any Deputy would find that the difference would be about 1/3 a cwt.  That <Col N="775" /> is the only difference there is between the two schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in his usual way, has of course not only no belief in Irish products, whether barley, oats or anything else as compared with maize but no belief whatever in anything that is produced in this country. He evidently believes that unless we follow the same old traditions that were laid down for agricultural schemes in England we must be wrong.  I do not believe we are wrong and I would advise Deputy <Col N="776" /> Dillon&mdash;if he is honestly trying to get at the truth&mdash;to compare the price of maize meal mixture here with the price of meal in England; to compare the price of pollard here with the price of pollard in England and to compare the price of meat meal here with the price in England. I would advise him also to get an advice from somebody as to what should be a balanced ration for pigs and he will find that the difference is not as much as 10/- a ton.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, February 19.</P>
