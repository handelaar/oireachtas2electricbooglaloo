      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether in view of the relatively small number of houses erected by the Dublin Corporation during the past six years and the urgent need for the erection of a much larger number of houses to accommodate families at present compelled to live in slums and under overcrowded conditions he proposes to take any special steps to accelerate the erection of houses by the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>The rate of building progress by the Dublin Corporation continues to receive my attention.  Owing to temporary financial difficulties on the part of the corporation which are now at an end, progress was retarded last year. I am satisfied that every effort is being made by the corporation and the manager to secure the maximum amount of rehousing and the immediate prospects can be regarded as satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the Civil Service Compensation Board has given permission to two attendants in Dundrum Asylum to retire with compensation on account of the excessive number of hours they were compelled to work and whether he proposes to take action now with a view of reducing the hours of work in that institution in accordance with the declared policy of the Government in regard to working hours in non-Government employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Service (Compensation) Board decided that two transferred attendants at Dundrum Asylum were entitled to retire under Section 14 of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929.  I am not aware that the board held that the hours of duty of attendants in the asylum are excessive.  The existing arrangements in Dundrum provide for two whole days off duty in every six days and, in addition, for occasional leave and annual leave.  The proportion of attendants to patients is much higher than in any public institution for mental cases in this country.  The scheme regulating hours of duty, which was brought into operation 15 years ago, is a considerable improvement on the old arrangements and I do not see, having regard to the circumstances, that it is contrary to the policy of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been called to the fact that by reason of the age at which solicitors are normally appointed to the positions of county registrars, the existing provisions for pensions for such county registrars do not enable them to obtain <Col N="1698" /> an adequate pension on retirement; and if, having regard to the responsible duties carried out by these officials (who are now also sheriffs) and to the increased duties proposed to be imposed on them in the Courts of Justice Bill, he will introduce proposals for legislation to provide county registrars with pensions calculated on a basis not less favourable than those proposed for district justices in the Courts of Justice Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is prepared to take into account the numerous complaints made against the manner of assessing the means of applicants under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 to 1935, and take such steps as may be necessary to secure that the assessment will not be made in such a way as to preclude the possibility of really poor people getting benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When it was decided to make provision in the Unemployment Assistance Act for taking into account the means of applicants for qualification certificates, it was foreseen that there would be complaints by those applicants who were assessed to means, and provision was accordingly made which enables any person dissatisfied with the assessment to appeal to an appellate tribunal.  Any <Col N="1699" /> person who is dissatisfied with the assessment of his means has, therefore, a right of appeal to an appeals officer and, with his permission, to the Unemployment Appeals Committee. Poor persons who have no means are, of course, not affected by the existing means test, or by the prescribed method of calculating means.</P>

The various Memoranda and the Minutes of Evidence on which these reports were based were not published and the commission expressed no opinion regarding their publication.  It is the opinion of the Government that the expense of publication of these documents (relating as they do to an inquiry which terminated five years ago) would not be justified by the <Col N="1701" /> interest that has been shown in them.

      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is not readily available and has to be compiled from the correspondence and accounts.  I am satisfied that the compilation of the figures for each of the nine years separately would involve an expenditure of time and labour which the results would not justify.  Indeed, the results compiled on a yearly basis might prove misleading, as there is no immediate connection between the ordering of coins, which is naturally undertaken in bulk, and the steady issue of these coins into circulation. Accordingly, I have had prepared and am circulating with the Official Report a return giving the information required over the whole period from the enactment of the Coinage Act, 1926, to the 31st December, 1935.  The coins were minted in all cases by the Royal Mint, London.</P>

In the circumstances, I do not propose to modify the existing practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Doyle (for Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state how far the terms of the reorganisation scheme, which was submitted to the staff of the Ordnance Survey for agreement in 1927, have been given effect to up to the present; the number of non-civil servants who have been appointed to positions in the Ordnance Survey, and the circumstances under which it was not considered practicable to have existing members of the Ordnance Survey staff appointed to carry out the duties now being discharged by non-civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reorganisation scheme to which the Deputy refers in the first part of the question was put into effect in its entirely, but it has since been found necessary to modify details of the scheme in the light of the <Col N="1705" /> day to day requirements of the work. In recent years only one non-civil servant has been appointed to a position in the Ordnance Survey in a grade above that of technical assistant.  This appointment and an arrangement whereby members of the defence forces are seconded for duty in the Survey were made primarily in the interests of the service and of economy in administration, and also with a view to co-ordinating the activities of the civil survey and the military topographical section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Doyle (for Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether, in view of the dissatisfaction expressed by civil servants with the draft scheme of conciliation and arbitration machinery he put forward last year, he now recognises that no scheme of this kind, which does not provide for negotiating bodies and an arbitration tribunal, on the lines in operation in the British Civil Service, is likely to be acceptable to civil servants here, and whether he is prepared to arrange, at an early date, for a conference between Government representatives and representatives of the Civil Service staff associations, with a view to the negotiation of an agreement between them on the basis of the British scheme referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to a similar question he addressed to me on the 23rd July last.  The position in regard to the letter issued by my Department generally to the staff associations on the 8th June, 1935, inviting their written observations on the draft scheme of arbitration remains substantially the same now as when the Deputy previously raised the matter.  When the staff associations furnish their written observations on the draft scheme, I will consider what further action it may be desirable to take by way of consultation with staff representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the fact that certain organisations, at all events, have submitted certain views to his Department on the <Col N="1706" /> subject of the provisions that should be embodied in the proposed scheme of arbitration, and has requested an interview with the Minister to discuss that aspect of the scheme?  Is the Minister aware that that letter is now in his Department for over a month and can he say when a reply will be sent to the organisations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that two organisations have made representations to the effect referred to by the Deputy in his supplementary question. I know that the majority of the associations have not, so far, replied to the draft proposals, and I must assume the draft proposal to be acceptable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister is it not a fact that only one organisation has intimated to him its acceptance of the draft scheme, and that that organisation does not represent 1 per cent. of the Civil Service?  And may I remind him that he has been requested to receive a deputation from the two largest organisations in the Civil Service?  If the Minister is still a democrat should he not take that as evidence that the overwhelming majority of the service rejects his scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the majority of the staff associations have not so far replied to the letter asking for their observations on the draft scheme submitted to them.  I must assume, on the principle that silence gives consent, that they are prepared to accept the scheme in its draft form. Quite obviously, this is a scheme which must apply to the service as a whole and, accordingly, I cannot consider sectional representations until I have the view of the service as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a second time.  The purpose of this measure is to give statutory authority for the issue from the Central Fund of the total of the supplementary grants for the current financial year which were not covered by the Appropriation Act in 1935, and, secondly, the amount of the Vote on Account in respect of the coming financial year, which the House granted yesterday. The measure also, in accordance with the usual form, confers on the Minister for Finance powers to borrow, issue securities, etc.  In the current financial year, 20 Supplementary Estimates, totalling £930,879, were presented to the Dáil and passed.  Of this total, £5,086, representing the amount of the Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs passed in the early part of the year, was included in the amount authorised to be issued from the Central Fund by the Appropriation Act, 1935.  The balance of the Supplementary Estimates, £925,793, is similarly provided for now in Section 1 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total of the estimated expenditure on the Supply Services for 1936-37 is, as I explained to the House yesterday, £27,514,783, to which there has to be added £370,000 which, in due course, the House will be asked to authorise by way of an additional Supplementary Agricultural Grant.  Of the £27,514,000 odd, £9,850,000 has already been voted on account and Section 2 of this Bill authorises the issue from the Central Fund of this amount.  The balance will be covered in due course <Col N="1712" /> by the Appropriation Act, 1936. Section 3 of the Bill, in the usual form, empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to £10,775,000 odd, which is the sum of the amounts mentioned in Sections 1 and 2.  It also provides that the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister any sum or sums not exceeding, in the whole, that amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister yesterday parted with the important discussion that took place here with the statement that the Opposition did not want a settlement of the dispute with Great Britain, which is causing so much economic havoc to this country, because they realised that if this dispute were settled, their occupation would be gone.  It is just as well that the Minister would understand that we all realise that these statements will inevitably and frequently come from him and from his associates, and I should like him to understand that just as inevitably and as frequently as they do, he will be told from these benches that they are quite appropriate, coming from a Minister, who, when he became the bearer of Ministerial responsibility here, thought it part of the necessary plan to improve conditions, to improve the atmosphere of this country and to develop its culture to characterise the leader of the Opposition as a Judas Iscariot, a Pitt and a Castlereagh.  It comes quite appropriately from people who accepted parliamentary institutions here only when they had figured out mathematically that they could control them from the very day on which they entered them, who were disappointed and who from the day they did enter parliamentary institutions were as destructive in their policy of the economic, the national and social interests of this country as they were when they were outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the Minister can address himself in suitable terms to the national and economic questions of the day, and as long as he attempts to hide behind statements such as that which I complain about, he is going to be reminded of how suitable, both to their past and to their present, these utterances are.  Yesterday he listed all the various sums to the extent of £6,700,000, the difference between the <Col N="1713" /> Estimates presented to the House to-day and the Estimates presented to the House at the beginning of 1931, and suggested that the difference between these two sets of Estimates represented, as it were, the difference between the efficiency, the Christianity and the modern spirit of the present Government as compared with the Government which they succeeded.  He attempted to persuade the House that this £6,700,000, more than was expended in 1931-32, was being spent on wider and more kindly administered social services, and because of the Government's more fatherly, or, if you like, more motherly, interest in the development of agriculture and the building up of Irish industry.  He said that this £6,700,000 of an addition was wanted, and wanted only, because of better social services, better development of agriculture and the development of industry.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the items the Minister mentioned.  A sum of £1,000,000, he indicated, covered work under the Land Commission&mdash;the improvement of estates and the contribution to the purchase price of lands now being purchased for the settlement of either the present tenants or other tenants on them.  The amount needed for the reduction of the land annuities by one-half was given as £2,180,000, and the amount for bounties and subsidies as £349,065.  Under the Department of Industry and Commerce for the development of the industrial alcohol business, for turf development and for mineral development generally, he gave us a figure of £230,146, these being all additional to the Agricultural Estimate.  These items make a total of £3,759,211. There are three other items that I should like to mention, namely, old age pensions, unemployment assistance and relief.  The increase in respect of these three items make a total of £1,632,636.  The Minister remarked that the increase of £3,759,000 in the total of the items to which I first referred entirely applied to the agricultural industry.  I submit to the Minister that three-fourths of the additional sum, representing the increases in old age pensions, in unemployment assistance and in relief, is <Col N="1714" /> also going to bolster up the present agricultural situation, so that out of the figures he mentioned yesterday, we find an increased expenditure of £4,959,000 going to agriculture.  In our opinion, that is going to bolster up, in a miserable, incompetent and futile way, an important industry, the foundations of which are being destroyed and due from under the industry by the Ministry's policy.</P>
    <P>It is important for the House to understand that all this additional money is being spent not on the development of agriculture, not on the satisfactory development of industry, not on better social services for those people who require, because of their circumstances, to be assisted by the State, but on a miserable attempt to bolster up the most important industry in the State which is being destroyed as a result of Government policy. The Minister claimed in his address to the House late last night that they are neither extravagant nor incompetent. He challenges all and sundry to say whether any of these additional items can be saved.  The answer I give to him is that practically all these additional items could be saved if the Ministry, instead of destroying the agricultural industry, were to pursue a policy that would help it.  Whatever industrial development, whatever social services, whatever fabric of commercial machinery we had in the country, they were all fed, built up and kept alive by the fact that our people made the best use of their agricultural resources, developed them, extended the industry, increased the profits of the industry and did it in their own intelligent way, guided by the experience of the people who went before them and their own intelligence applied to modern conditions.  This Government, which boasts that it is going to spend £6,700,000 now, more than the previous Government was spending at the time the members of the present Government were complaining about expenditure, instead of creating conditions here that would enable the people to develop their resources and make a profit out of them, is doing nothing but interfering with the people, preventing people <Col N="1715" /> from pursuing their avocations and making a profit from their industry that is not only necessary to the well-being of agriculture, but necessary for the future well-being of every interest in the State.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that we have a condition of affairs here in which we are asked to face Estimates of £6,700,000 more than the Estimates put before us before the present Government came into office. Instead of that sum being applied to work that would show itself in the increased betterment of the people here, it is being poured down a sink that is the joint making of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kissane is sometimes spoken of as a person who is almost of Ministerial rank or, at any rate, as a person worthy of Ministerial authority, such as a Parliamentary Secretary. We understand from the Estimates that the only difference in capacity between a Parliamentary Secretary and a Minister is that represented by a sum of £100 a year.  We, for instance, pay within £100 a year of the salary paid to the Minister for Finance to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. Deputy Kissane was addressing himself to the position of agriculture <Col N="1716" /> recently and the conditions of unemployment. He reiterated the cry that is so often uttered as a Fianna Fáil achievement&mdash;that our population is increasing to-day at the rate of 20,000 persons a year, that there is unemployment as a result of that and that the only solution for that unemployment is a back-to-the-land policy. Whether we are to have a back-to-the-land policy or a policy of industrial development here, we cannot solve the unemployment problem and we cannot provide for our increasing population if we continue to squander our agricultural resources in the way in which they are being squandered. It is for that reason that I want to put in front of the Minister some facts that he himself must have and that his colleagues must have, so that he may address himself to them, and tell us in what way the £5,000,000 that I speak of is in any sense assisting agriculture to-day, giving promise of assisting it or any other industry to-morrow, or helping to assist the unemployed.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out before that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government may be put briefly as replacing the production of live stock and live-stock products to some extent by the growing of cereals.  I know it is difficult to see completely what is happening in this country by simply standing at our ports and observing what is happening there.  To stand at our ports, however, gives us some idea of what is happening in the country; but what is actually happening in the country is infinitely worse than the situation as disclosed at the ports would indicate.  The substitution of live stock and live-stock products by cereal growing is the Government's policy.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can cut down some of those products that we are producing in quantities above our own needs; we can cut down the export of these and the import of cereals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last year, to take the net figures for the export of live stock and live-stock products, our farmers lost £11,000,000.  There was a fall, in other words, of £11,000,000 in the net exports of live stock and live-stock <Col N="1717" /> products.  There was a fall in the net imports of cereals and feeding stuffs to the extent of £4,000,000.  Let us assume that these cereals that went unimported to the extent of £4,000,000 were actually grown here by Irish farmers and that they got the profits from them.  Even if that were so, looking at the situation only from the ports we see our farmers lost £7,000,000 last year as compared with the year 1931.  If our farmers lost in exports £11,000,000 on live stock and live-stock products and if our ports were open to receive all the feeding-stuffs that could come in, no one would believe but that the feeding-stuffs that would be brought in would be infinitely lower than were coming in before the gigantic reduction took place in the exports of live stock and live-stock products.</P>

      <P>If that comparison is not good enough, I would like Deputy Moore to give us his comparison, because it is most desirable to understand what is the position to-day in the country.  I say that, standing at the ports, our farmers lost £11,000,000 one way and they did not gain £4,000,000 in another way.  The condition that is brought about in the country is shown by the figures the Minister for Industry and Commerce has put before us in respect of employment in this industry of agriculture last year, and the wages that were paid by those paying workers in that industry.  It would be quite convenient for the House if Deputy Moore could give us some particular index that we could relate to imports and exports in 1935 as against imports and <Col N="1718" /> exports in 1931, so that the quayside happenings can be seen in their true perspective.  For all practical purposes a pound is as valuable to-day as in 1931; if there is any difference in it, it is that it may be worth less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to hear the Deputy applying himself systematically to this subject and I would be also glad if he will apply himself systematically to what I am going to say now.  Deputy Kissane told us that 20,000 additional persons have to be catered for, in the provision of work and otherwise, here every year, and he says the only way of dealing with the unemployment problem that they would otherwise provide is by work on the land.  It is for that reason that I would like to hear Deputy Moore applying himself to the conditions that exist on the land in respect of work.  It is shown by last year's statistics that 20,000 acres of subsidised crops were being grown, as part of the assistance to agriculture, over the crops grown in 1931.  Although we are offered by the Minister to-day Estimates which ask us to give £5,000,000 for the assistance of agriculture, his own Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce tell us that less money is being earned and less permanent paid labour is being employed on agriculture now than there was before ever they began their policy.  Deputy Moore is astonished.</P>

It is worth while to get Deputy Moore clear on the matter and for that reason I will mention a few facts.  In the first instance, additional wheat acreage was grown in 1935 over 1931 to the extent of 142,625 acres, and additional beet acreage was grown to the extent of 52,276, a total of 194,901.  The employment given in agriculture in 1935 over 1931 was:&mdash;additional members of families employed on the land, 9,079; additional temporary labourers employed on the 1st June, 2,496; permanent labourers, a reduction of 617.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Moore will take the figures given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to a recent Parliamentary question and compare them with the figures recently published he will find that there were seven counties in the whole country in which there was a smaller number of male persons employed on 1st June, 1935, than on 1st June, 1931, and he will find that those counties are Donegal, Roscommon, Longford, Offaly, Kilkenny, Limerick and Kerry. He will find that of the remainder of the counties there were ten counties in which the number of permanent agricultural labourers employed on 1st June, 1935, was less than the number employed on 1st June, 1931, and that those counties were Sligo, Galway, Monaghan, Cavan, Meath, Kildare, Leix, Carlow, Wexford and Tipperary.  He will find that of the remainder of the counties there were three in which on 1st June, 1935, there were less temporary agricultural labourers employed than were employed on 1st June, 1931, and that those counties were Leitrim, Mayo and Clare.  He will find that there were only six counties in regard to which you could have any satisfaction in feeling that there was any growth, and that growth was very little compared with the subsidised acreage that was in them; those counties were Meath, Westmeath, Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford and Cork.  The Ministry know as well as any farmer in the country, but <Col N="1720" /> they cannot admit it, that wheat growing or beet growing is not going to revolutionise Irish agriculture, nor is it going to improve the condition of the Irish farmer, and that whatever wheat growing will be done or whatever beet growing may be done can only be sustained and helped if the agricultural industry generally is run along proper lines, and if the workers in it are given an opportunity of making profits out of their work.  Here we have a pretence being carried on for political purposes, to save Ministerial faces to-day and to save the kind of faces they had on them some years ago.</P>

      <P>They are not the same kind.  To-day it is a question of &ldquo;smile, smile, smile&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Kennedy's new motto.  The smile is to be regarded, of course, entirely as a business proposition, like the coal-cattle pact.  The faces are not the same, but, nevertheless, they require as much hiding to-day by newspaper headlines and by misrepresentation of fact and policy as ever they did in the past, but as long as it is a matter of Ministerial expediency to keep up a pretence that wheat and beet are the big things, and that cattle, poultry, butter, and everything else may be neglected, so long are the Government going to continue to dig the grave of even their wheat policy and their beet policy.  It is essential that both Deputy Moore and the Minister would face up to what the conditions in Irish agriculture are as regards the employment of paid labour.  The position last year was that there were 617 less permanent paid agricultural labourers in employment than there were in 1931. There were 2,400 extra temporary labourers in employment.  If you take the estimate of the amount of employment in the year that is given to a temporary labourer, the Party opposite will have to admit that there was no increase in 1935 in the paid agricultural employment given to males throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will have to admit more than that.  I do not know what the wheat subsidy does mean per acre, but it <Col N="1721" /> has been stated very often before that the beet subsidy means £25 an acre.  If that is so, the amount of subsidy that went in one way or another out of the pockets of the Irish people to the beet industry was £1,300,000.  I should like the Minister to give us the figure as to what the wheat subsidy means per acre; then we can get the sum of the two.  In the meantime, as well as having no increase in paid agricultural labour in 1935 over 1931 there was a gigantic fall in the wage pool out of which the persons engaged as paid labourers in agriculture have to be paid.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us, modestly I submit, that agricultural labourers' wages fell by 3/- per week in 1935 as against 1931. Eliminating any consideration such as might come into our minds on hearing the reiterated statements, as I have said before, of the county committee of agriculture in Wexford that the average wage of agricultural labourers in the country was 8/- a week, and taking the official figure that the wages of agricultural labourers in 1935 have fallen by 3/- only as against 1931, on that figure the wage pool for paid labourers in agriculture in 1935 had fallen as against 1931 by £840,000, and it is perfectly clear that the 9,079 additional members of farmers' families who were working in agriculture during that year were working on a much lower family income than the family workers in agriculture were working on in 1931. As long as we have the position that the Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party are completely dodging their responsibilities, seeing problems affecting land annuity payments and affecting agriculture and industry and running away from them behind big development headlines in their Press, behind the nipperisms of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The nipperisms. As long as we have that, we are going to have a position in which there is going to be no hope for the growing population of getting an <Col N="1722" /> entry into the agricultural industry or into any other industry, and there is nothing but disaster and bankruptcy facing the people who are responsible for the agricultural industry to-day. I should like the farmer Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches to look at one of the things on which the Minister for Finance challenges us to-day, asking whether we would wipe it out of the Estimates.  I mention it, not so much to get their opinion on this as to try and stir their imaginations in regard to what is wanted in their industry, rather than the patches and props that are so ineffectually being put to the industries to-day at such a terrible cost to the people of the country.  The Minister is providing something like £290,000; at any rate he is providing part of £349,000 for the development of the industrial alcohol industry for the purpose no doubt of assisting agriculture.  There are countries in Europe which are described in a book issued a short time ago by Tiltmann, under the title of <i>Peasant Europe.</i>  Here is an extract from that book:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In most countries the primary producers still grow food for human consumption; in Czecho-Slovakia they are producing it to feed motor cars! In the hour of the greatest need the authorities remembered that sugar beet, potatoes, rye and maize-in fact, any vegetable material rich in starch or sugar&mdash;can be used to manufacture industrial alcohol.  A cwt. of potatoes or sugar beet will yield an imperial gallon of alcohol, which, in turn, can be mixed with petrol in a proportion of 30 per cent. alcohol to 70 per cent. petrol.  In Germany over 100,000 tons of home-produced alcohol is consumed in this way every year; is it so surprising therefore that the 650,000 Czecho-Slovkian farmers who are officially recorded to be growing sugar beet and potatoes in 1930 remembered this fact in their darkest hour for a generation, and, with corn, cattle, sugar, and most other products sinking to record low levels, exerted pressure to provide a new market for their products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" />&ldquo;The result was a victory for the peasants.  To-day Czecho-Slovakia is the only European nation, apart from Latvia, in which the sale of petrol undiluted with alcohol is forbidden&mdash;and the price of that alcohol, as fixed by law, is 2/11 per imperial gallon.  By this means large quantities of sugar beet and potatoes have been taken off the normal market and have at least yielded some profit to the producers. With petrol available in 1933 at less than 4d. per gallon (excluding duties) the victory for the peasants has been purchased at the expenses of the motorist and the national revenue, for less petrol imported means less in taxation. But with nearly 40 families out of every 100 engaged in producing the nation's harvest it is natural that the peasant should play a prominent rôle in influencing public opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the position here that more than 40 per cent. of our people are farmers and we have the position that we have people on the Fianna Fáil Benches who pretend to speak for the farmers.  Are these Deputies satisfied to continue the policy to-day by which they destroy the natural operation of the agricultural community in respect of the agricultural resources of this country?  They put a taobhín on one of the farmer's soles in the pretence of developing this country's industrial alcohol that will use up some of the potatoes; and we are told that a sufficient number of industrial alcohol factories is going to put agriculture on its feet here to-day. We have all this pretence about the turf industry which has been so boosted, placarded and advertised in the last few years, with the result that less turf was cut last year than in the previous years.  The Minister put advertisements about turf in the Government Press&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>There was more turf cut before this campaign started than there is cut now.  Is the farming <Col N="1724" /> community, so far as it is reflected on the Government side, satisfied to stand up and say that what they want is £2,000,000 in subsidies; £200,000 for industrial alcohol; so much money for sacks for wrapping the turf in, and so much money for advertisements about the turf scheme?  Does the Government want to pursue a policy that will force the farming community in this country with their own natural skill and intelligence to pursue a policy that will make it impossible for this country to have any industrial success or to have any decent farming community here?  We are only just after entering into a pact with Great Britain whereby we are to take cement, coal and certain other industrial products from Britain if they will take our cattle.  Is the long view of that policy this&mdash;that by the time we have our own cement factories here; by the time that we have done what the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks can be done, that then the turf industry shall be so developed that we will not want coal&mdash;is the long view that by that time we will not have a surplus of agricultural produce to get rid of in this country?  If that is the long view I would like to hear Deputy Moore on the subject.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the other Fianna Fáil members on these matters.  Ministers have to-day taken to pushing ahead industrial development, while the agricultural industry is being stifled and starved.  I say that because by the position brought about in the country manufacturers themselves are complaining. The clothing industry, the confectionery industry and a number of other industries are saturated. Even the cosmetic industry is saturated. The position in the country is that there is not a farmer in the country who has got a new suit of clothes for the last two years.  I would invite Deputy Moore when next he dares to address a meeting of his constituents to put these questions to them: &ldquo;How are you getting on; will you hold up your hands and say if any one of you <Col N="1725" /> has got a new suit since Easter, 1935?&rdquo; Then he might ask how many of them have got a new suit since Easter, 1934?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and no wonder.  Last year we had to draw the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the fact that there was a substantial reduction in the consumption of some of the very necessaries of life.  We found that hosiery, boots, shoes, soap and candles were being consumed in lesser quantities.  That was what the 1933 census of production figures revealed. We have now the same figures for 1934 and we are still in the position that essential commodities such as boots and shoes, soap and candles and confectionery are still below the consumption point of 1931.  It is for that reason that I ask the Minister for Finance to stop his hypocrisy as to what this money is wanted for.  It is not to give better or more kindly administrative social services.  I would ask the Minister to just ask the Labour Party in some of their fortnightly conferences with the Government what they think about the kindly administrative services?  It is not given for the improvement of agriculture which, after three or four years of high subsidisation, is giving no more boot-making employment to-day than in 1931 and is giving less wages for the employment given.  It is not helping industry, because the industries that have been hustled into existence by monopolies, subsidies and tariffs by the present Government are even to-day crying out that they see no future in front of them and I doubt if they have any future in front of them. As I have said, the Minister by this £5,000,000 additional expenditure is only putting taoibhíns on the soles of industry; he is only putting props to industry by the policy he is carrying out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure which the Minister asks us to sanction may or may not be justified, but I am sorry that, at any rate, he does not reassure us by adopting a different tone when recommending it from the <Col N="1726" /> tone of triumph in which he spoke to us yesterday.  If anybody in the Government has to represent the cause of economy, it must be the holder of the public purse.  I should like him to pay the tribute of vice to virtue of pretending to be economical, even if in fact he is not.  I do not know whether he is really quite as spendthrift in his outlook as he represents himself as being, or whether he has not come to the conclusion that the popular thing to do is to boast of expenditure.  Possibly behind the scenes he is really not quite as prodigal as he appears to be on the surface. I think it would be a good thing for preserving the sort of balance there ought to be between the needs of the people and the needs of the public purse that the Minister for Finance, at any rate, of all the Ministers, should adopt a conservative tone in these annual speeches that he makes to us on the subject of expenditure.</P>
      <P>The question whether we are over-spending or not is by no means an easy one.  I will not pretend that it is. The present Ministers, before they came into power, spoke about the matter with very great confidence.  I am not going through the tale that has been told thousands of times of the statements they made about our national expenditure before they took over the reins of office.  But, on hearing Deputy Mulcahy just now committing himself to the proposition that if the economic war was settled some £6,000,000, I think he said, could be knocked off the present expenditure, I felt that he was being almost as rash, though not quite as specific, as the Fianna Fáil leaders were before they came into office; and that, if Deputy Cosgrave resumes the reins of Government once more, Deputy Mulcahy is running a very grave risk of having the sort of speeches made about that statement that Deputy McGilligan so often makes here about the statements of the Minister for Finance and others before they came into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I confess that I do not see much prospect of great reductions in our expenditure.  The programme of the Fine Gael Party includes several points which will call <Col N="1727" /> for greatly increased expenditure.  They are points of which I approve personally. For example, old age pensions at 65&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 65&mdash;the raising of the school-leaving age, not to speak of the relief of agricultural land from rates.  All these things will certainly put increased burdens on the Exchequer.  I do not think it is reasonable to suppose that the savings which would accrue, as I am sure they would accrue, on the settlement of the so-called economic war, would be any more than sufficient to balance the extra expenditure that would be called for by these points in the programme of the Opposition themselves.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is very difficult to judge whether a country is over-spending or not.  I suppose if a country is over-spending the result ought to show itself every year in increasing difficulty in balancing the Budget.  The Minister for Finance does have his difficulties in balancing the Budget, and it has on more than one occasion been very questionable whether he really has balanced the Budget.  But, at any rate, there has not been any such grave disproportion between revenue and expenditure in this country as there has been in many other countries, and as there still is in many other countries. Another sign of over-spending by the State is an increase in unemployment. It is very difficult to tell here whether unemployment is increasing or not, because a proper system of figures for the unemployed did not exist and exact comparisons are really impossible.  It is plain that there is a great deal of unemployment; but it is very hard to say whether unemployment is increasing or not.  Then there is the question of wages.  If a country is being overtaxed, you expect the result to be that the taxpayers are unable to give such good wages as they used to be able to.  But there again, outside agriculture, it is not easy to prove, and I doubt if it is possible to prove, that the state of wages in this country is such as to give indications that the Government is over-spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> However, if we are not over-spending, if these Votes that the Minister invites us to make are within our means, there are certain consequences that inevitably follow.  One is that which was alluded to yesterday by Deputy Dillon, and which has been alluded to by several of us last year and the year before, and, I think, the year before that&mdash; the ratio of 1 to 66 as a ratio between our means and those of Great Britain must be all wrong, because nobody would suggest that Great Britain could bear an annual expenditure at the present moment of over £2,000,000,000. Another consequence that follows is that the claim, to which once again the President alluded last week, that Great Britain owes us a bill of £300,000,000 or £400,000,000 for over-taxation is all wrong.  There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about this question of our having been overtaxed during the 19th century by Great Britain.  I imagine that nine people out of ten who say that we were overtaxed are under the impression that it has been proved that during that period £300,000,000 or £400,000,000 more was extracted in taxation from this country than was spent in this country. This is not the case, and nobody who examined the facts has pretended it was the case.  It is not what the Financial Relations Commission decided at all.  They were given an inquiry to carry out of a limited scope.  They were asked to decide what the taxable capacity of the two countries was and to say, on the basis of that taxable capacity, whether or not we had been taxed too much during the period since the Union.  If you actually compare what was spent in the country with what was taken out of the country you get a very different result indeed.  Certainly, for the 20 years or so before the European War there is little doubt that Great Britain was spending considerably more in this country than she was extracting from it by taxation, and that even before that time the extra amount, over what was spent locally, was no more, and probably much less, than Ireland would have been committed to if she had control of her own defence, she being an entirely independent country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done with the subject now, Sir.  I admit that it is ancient history in a sense, but unfortunately it is contemporary in relation to the main problem that threatens the financial structure of this State, because it is one of the matters that are impeding the President from settling our financial relations with Great Britain in a rational manner.  In any case, Sir, I pass from it.  I insist, however, that it is quite clear that, if we are not being taxed beyond our capacity now, the case that we were being taxed beyond our capacity in the 19th century is so weak as to be non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the amount of comfort or prosperity that can be distributed through the country by means of Government expenditure is trivial compared with the amount of the benefits that can be distributed through the country by flourishing industries.  Accordingly, the main thing to be considered is whether or not the general financial policy of this State is favourable to the development of our industries, including, of course, our main industry, agriculture, on sound lines.  I suggest that there is really much less difference of opinion on these subjects between the different Parties than may appear at first sight.  People continue to talk as if there were two entirely different philosophies still held by the Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael Parties on Irish economics.  I do not think there are.  I think that they were different a few years ago, but I do not think they are different now.  I do not think there is any part of the Government's economic policy to which the official Opposition are radically opposed, apart from the dispute with Great Britain.  They may consider&mdash;in fact they do consider&mdash;that the Government over-rate the importance of such matters as wheat and beet, but the Opposition themselves, if they came into power, are pledged to continue those wheat and beet schemes.  Therefore, there is no great difference between the two <Col N="1730" /> Parties&mdash;there is only a difference in emphasis&mdash;as far as these schemes are concerned.  There used to be a great difference on the subject of our cattle and the British market.  The Fianna Fáil partisans used to talk as if there was something immoral and unpartiotic about the rearing of live stock, and also used to preach the doctrine that the British market was done for and was becoming less valuable as every year went by.  Now, however, only the most out-of-date Fianna Fáil speakers, such as, perhaps, Deputy O'Reilly, who spoke here last night, say so any longer.  They not only have to admit in words, but to admit much more eloquently by their actions, that the British market and our live stock trade are of the utmost value to this country.  The fact that the British themselves have adopted a policy of agricultural protection, so far from detracting from the value of the British market to us, is, on the contrary, calculated to enhance it. The Fianna Fáil supporters themselves have to admit that.  All sorts of schemes and regulations have come in, and have come in to stay, in connection with that policy of agricultural protection for the British farmer.  The market for agricultural products in Great Britain is being every day more scientifically organised so as to secure that good prices shall be obtained by British farmers for their products, and, consequently, by Irish farmers too, assuming that we conduct our business with any common sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be failures and exceptions here and there. No doubt there are.  The business of revolutionising the position of British agriculture is a long business, but it has been undertaken.  For the first time in a very great number of years, there is a determination in Great Britain to see that the farmer there gets a fair deal&mdash;and a fair deal for the British farmer means, inevitably, a fair deal for the Irish farmer also, unless, of course, we are engaged in <Col N="1731" /> the sort of economic strife in which, in fact, we are engaged.  The condition of English agriculture has often been described as deplorable, and so it may be still as compared with the position of other British industries. The fact remains, however, that I do not think there is any agricultural labourer throughout England getting a wage of less than 35/- per week, and that the average weekly wage of agricultural labourers in this country is, I suppose, certainly not more than half the rate of wages of the agricultural labourer in England.  That is an indication&mdash;whatever may be said with regard to the state of British agriculture&mdash;that we have a long way to go to catch up with conditions there and to be in as good a state, from the point of view of the agricultural industry, as the British are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it does not appear to me that there are fundamental differences of philosophy between the Fianna Fáil and United Ireland Parties on the subject of these agricultural matters; nor, I think, are there such differences with regard to the policy of industrial development.  There, again, the difference is only one of emphasis.  The Government, of course, indulges in a much louder flourish of trumpets about the benefits of the work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce than the Opposition would be inclined to do; but I do not think that any Deputy in this House is against the policy of developing Irish industry, and I think that, probably, there is not a Deputy in this House who does not, in his heart of hearts, admire the extraordinary energy and determination with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in spite of much discouragement, has, in fact, built up a very respectable volume of new industrial production in this country. Certainly, I admire him for it and I take off my hat to him for it.  However, neither the industries he has started nor any other industries in this country can be put permanently in a flourishing condition, or felt to be on a sound basis, unless we see that the buying power of the community as a whole is being maintained and is likely to be maintained and to improve. <Col N="1732" /> So, we come right back to agriculture and to the question of the extent to which agriculture is being hurt by the policy of the present Government in relation to Great Britain.  I do not think that anyone on either side of the House would deny that agriculture is being hurt, although, naturally, the Opposition would say that it is being hurt much more than the Government would admit.  I, Personally, think that it is being hurt much more than the Government will admit.  The Government are fond of saying that the Opposition do not want a settlement with Great Britain, and the Opposition are equally fond of saying that the Government do not want a settlement with Great Britain.  Personally, I believe that both Parties want a settlement, but the Opposition are not in a position to do anything about it.  The responsibility of making a settlement is in the hands of the Government. After all, what can the Opposition do? The Government have talked vaguely about the duty of everybody to fall in behind them in regard to this dispute, but, as far as I can make out, that means that the men who made what they regarded as an honourable agreement with Great Britain a few years ago should now come forward and say that that agreement is invalid. Well, now, surely it is not reasonable to ask anything of the kind, even if Ministers believed that the Opposition had a doubt about the validity of that agreement, and I do not think that they have a doubt about the validity of it.  I am quite sure that they thoroughly believe in the validity of that agreement, and that they would be guilty of an act of dishonesty and weakness if they were induced now to repudiate that agreement and to declare that it was invalid.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputies not belonging to the Government Party have quite frequently shown their desire to co-operate, so far as they could co-operate in a practical manner, towards a settlement.  I do not know of anything in the history of the official Opposition, unless it be their vote against the trade agreement the other day which I, personally, think was a very mistaken vote, that could be reasonably argued to be a proof of <Col N="1733" /> their not desiring a settlement.  I believe the Government also desire a settlement, but unfortunately they desire it in far too remote and academic a manner.  It is no practical use desiring an end unless you desire the means to that end, too.  I am convinced that the Government have not, up to the present, made an earnest attempt at a settlement.  I do not think that the British Government either have made as earnest an attempt at a settlement as they should have, but I am convinced that our own Government have not done so.  Every time that I hear the President speak, including his speech in the Dáil last week, I am more convinced that proper steps have not been taken towards obtaining a settlement.</P>
    <P>As has been said over and over again there are only two ways to go about it: one is by having the matters in dispute adjudged by a tribunal, the other is by negotiating, by meeting face to face, and arriving at some compromise.  I see no likelihood of the Irish Government ever convincing the English Government that it is right to treat the Cosgrave financial agreement as a scrap of paper.  I see no likelihood of the British Government ever convincing this Irish Government that it is right to treat the Cosgrave financial agreement as being perfectly valid.  If the positions of the two Governments were reversed, I think it is perfectly possible that their opinions would be reversed.</P>
    <P>Supposing it was the British who had agreed to pay us such and such a sum per annum under an agreement which we had no desire to keep secret, and which we had pressed them to publish: under an agreement which at the time seemed fair to all parties, under an agreement which introduced no startling novelty, but continued the payment of sums that had always been paid before: supposing then that our Government having, as I say, come to such an agreement as that, and having received for a number of years moneys from Great Britain on the basis of that agreement, and suppose in two British general elections, just as happened in this country, the Government that made this agreement with us was returned to power, even though the British people knew that the money <Col N="1734" /> was being paid over to us; and then supposing some future British Government came into office and repudiated the whole agreement and said it was waste paper just because the British Government had neglected to get a formal endorsement by Parliament&mdash;I suggest that President de Valera and everyone of his colleagues would be making Europe ring with denunciations of the perfidy of Albion in ceasing to carry out the agreement that had been come to.  On the other hand, I do think that for anyone who lets his mind run back over Irish history it is very difficult to reconcile oneself to paying the British anything that one can honourably help paying.  I quite admit that. I also admit that the conduct of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in not getting the formal endorsement of the Oireachtas, even though it did in effect disclose that agreement&mdash;the country knew what was being done whether it knew the terms of the actual agreement itself or not&mdash;and even refusing the request of the British that it should be published was amazingly foolish and I have never yet heard any intelligible explanation of it.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I can understand the point of view of our own Government about this matter, and as I said a few minutes ago, I cannot quite see our own Government ever being brought to adopt <i>in toto</i> the British point of view, nor can I see the British ever being brought to adopt <i>in toto</i> the Irish point of view.  What is to be done about it? Only two things can be done.  One, a tribunal to judge, and the other, compromise. I think it makes it plainer to say compromise, because negotiations can come to nothing unless both sides are prepared to compromise. Now, as regards the tribunal, the President certainly has not done all that might have been done to get a fair tribunal.  He says that, on the ground of principle, he cannot accept a Commonwealth tribunal.  I wonder why? Why is it that principle comes in just about that matter when there are so many other matters that it does not come in about.  Principle does not prevent us from accepting every possible advantage that the British Empire has to offer us; it does not prevent <Col N="1735" /> us from accepting and granting, of course, Imperial preferences; it does not prevent us from allowing our young people to accept positions in British Government services of all kinds; it does not even prevent us from allowing recruiting to go on for the army and navy here; it does not prevent us from allowing our goods to be exhibited at the present moment at Olympia under the title of British industries at the British Industries Fair.  In all these matters our principles seem to be lamentably weak, but principle comes out very strong just over this matter of a Commonwealth tribunal.  Personally, I think that in order to adopt this very high line about principle, the Government should have walked out of the Commonwealth.  If the Government had declared a republic here, they would have been in a perfectly good position to say that principle made it impossible for them to accept a Commonwealth tribunal, but they did not do that.  They have no intention of doing it, in my opinion, and it is very sensible of them.  But, while they are prepared to accept whatever advantages may flow from the British connection, it seems to me to be a little inconsistent that they should erect this point of the Commonwealth tribunal into a matter of such fundamental principle, because nobody will persuade me, or I think will persuade any Deputy in the House who considers the question for a moment, that it is on the point of fairness that a Commonwealth tribunal is rejected.  So far as fairness goes, there is not the slightest doubt that we could refuse to start proceedings until we had got a tribunal so composed that we were satisfied it would give a fair decision.  I have not the slightest doubt that if representatives from Ireland and representatives from Great Britain got together and looked around to select a chairman, they could easily find one from within the Commonwealth.</P>

As a matter of fact, there is no reason why we should have this intense suspicion of British tribunals.  I certainly admit that the Border tribunal was a frightful disappointment, but it has also to be admitted that the Treaty was exceedingly vague and uncertain about the question of de-limiting those areas, that the thing was very chancy, and, furthermore, that we were represented by a very distinguished historian, but not by an advocate.  We would probably have done far better if we were represented by someone like Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  At any rate, I do not believe that any fair-minded man can quarrel with the fundamental soundness of my point, that as far as fairness goes we could have secured it in a Commonwealth tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor am I at all satisfied, if we were absolutely pig-headed on the subject of a Commonwealth tribunal, that we could not have secured a tribunal with a chairman from outside the Commonwealth, supposing any serious effort had been made to do so.  I personally have been very officious in the matter. When the economic war first started I went over to London and I obtained an interview with Mr. Thomas.  I pressed him as hard as I could to accept an international tribunal.  I may say that since that time-there is no reason why one should not say it, as people are so fond of throwing accusations about that one does not want a settlement, and that one is trying to hamper the Irish Government-over a period of three years, I have interviewed no less than five members of the British Cabinet and have written innumerable letters and articles in English newspapers pressing for three things in connection with the dispute, (1) that a more serious effort should be made to establish a tribunal, and if needs be an international tribunal: (2) that there should be a recognition of <Col N="1737" /> the right of this country to secede from the British Commonwealth, if they want to do so, and (3) that the financial dispute should be isolated from the political question, and should be separate from any of these Constitutional problems.  So that I am conscious of having done everything I could&mdash;little as it naturally is&mdash;to help on the Government towards arriving at some sort of settlement, or an approach to a settlement of this economic war.  I do think that there are other difficulties in connection with arbitration and that the definition of the terms of reference would be hard to arrive at.  The Government, in fact, have never made plain what it was they offered to arbitrate.  Did they offer to arbitrate as to whether Deputy Cosgrave's agreement was a valid one, or did they only offer to arbitrate, whether the annuities would be legally due if there was no Cosgrave agreement?</P>

      <P>What I am trying to say is that the President told us that he offered arbitration, but he never told us what the arbitration was to be about.  It would be interesting, and might help towards a settlement, if one knew just what it was he was prepared to arbitrate about.  If the subject of arbitration is only to be, whether the annuities were legally due before Deputy Cosgrave's agreement was made, then we have to realise that the fence of Deputy Cosgrave's agreement has still to be got over.  Perhaps that fence can be got over by compromise. I am not clear that that matter could be judged by a tribunal, or whether there is any code of law available to a tribunal to decide whether such an agreement is legal or not.  As a matter of fact, international custom we know has treated secret agreements as valid quite frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> There are a lot of difficulties in connection with arbitration, though I believe that with earnestness they could be overcome, and arbitration brought about.  But I would rather see a frank effort at compromise.  When one has said that, one has really said enough in the way of complying with requests constantly made by the Government to suggest a solution.  The Government say that everyone who criticises the economic war is calling upon them to surrender, and any such person is asked to state on what terms he would settle. That seems to me to be unreasonable and unfair.  One would naturally settle on the best terms one could get, if one has made up one's mind that compromise is desirable.  The thing to do is to go into a conference and start bargaining, just as at the sale of a heifer or any other commercial transaction, to see what is the most you can get the other party to concede, and what is the least distance you have to go.</P>
    <P>The case for compromise is overwhelming. It is overwhelming from one point of view, because in actual fact these sums of money are being collected by means of tariffs, whether we like it or not.  Any compromise on the basis that we have to pay half instead of the whole amount, for instance, would be a gain, especially as the President admitted that we are paying the full amount in a more injurious form than in the old days.  I think from the British point of view, also, a compromise is desirable, because it does serious damage to their prestige all over the world that this conflict with us is going on.  They have dozens of good reasons for wishing to be on good terms with us, and I believe-and I am not a bit ashamed to say it-that the British, as compared with most nations, are a generous nation, and that their natural inclination would be to deal fairly and even generously with us financially, if only the right atmosphere could be created.</P>
    <P>The desirability, too, of segregating this financial question from the constitutional question seems to me to be obvious, because any constitutional settlement that had a financial taint about it, and that gave people an opportunity of saying that we were selling Ireland's rights for money, any <Col N="1739" /> such arrangement would be open to attack, and would eventually lead to bad relations again between the two countries.  Of course, economic considerations cannot be disregarded when we come to consider our constitutional relationship with Great Britain, because to become a separate republic would certainly mean grave economic misfortune. It would seriously complicate our employment problem by shutting avenues of employment that are open to our young people, and it would, no doubt, greatly interfere with our getting the favourable treatment in the British market for our farmers that is accorded to Great Britain's own farmers.  Penal tariffs might be removed by financial adjustment, but we would still have to face other economic difficulties, if we took the constitutional step of separating ourselves from the Commonwealth and repudiating our allegiance to the King.  But, for the moment, what we are concerned with is this financial dispute.</P>
    <P>I conclude by pressing on the Government with all the earnestness I can, the point that, up to the present, the sort of attempt to settle that one would expect to see made by men who meant business has not been made, that the two opposing sides have climbed to the mountain tops of principle and have stayed there enunciating grand phrases about national rights instead of coming down to earth and getting to business. Business in this matter means compromise, and without the spirit of compromise nothing can be done.  With the spirit of compromise, I believe everything can be done.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot is still very young.  I should like to believe that all he has stated here to-day was true, but we know from experience that his deductions and assumptions are based on altogether wrong foundations. This nation has never found the British Government generous.  Never at any time were the British Government prepared to admit that we here had ordinary, human rights.  They looked upon this nation as a convenience for themselves.  We had to do not what we wanted to do or what was good for <Col N="1740" /> our people but what suited the British and what they wanted us to do.  I should be prepared to compromise with the British.  I would compromise with them on the basis that I would not sue them for the wrongs they did in the past&mdash;and to that extent only. I should make jolly sure that they were not going to commit wrongs in the present or in the future.  We have got to see once and for all that this nation is not going to be the servant or the slave of the British Government's will.  If we once compromised on this matter by admitting that the British had any right to control our actions we should be doing a thing for which future generations would curse us.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot asked what the Opposition could do about this dispute.  Personally, I think that it would be too much to expect that Deputy Cosgrave should admit that he was tricked over the 1923 Agreement. He made the agreement and he is standing for it.  But all the Deputies on the opposite benches have agreed with me that we should not be paying this sum of £5,000,000 a year.  If they would only take up that attitude as a positive attitude, instead of the negative attitude they have taken up here to-day; if they would only tell the British straight out that, no matter what Government comes in here, they are not going to get £5,000,000 a year from it, they would be doing good national work.  They can take up that attitude without any reference to the 1923 Agreement.  They can point out to the British that, as they are refusing to pay American the £30,000,000 a year which they agreed to pay, we are not going to pay them, £5,000,000 which Deputy Cosgrave, unfortunately, agreed to pay them.  That is an attitude which they could take up.  They could go further.  They could point to the sums granted by the British Government to the Six-County Government. Instead of paying the British Government £9,000,000 last year, the Six-County Government did not pay them £9,000.  If the Opposition want to do something good, from the national point of view, they can take up that attitude without hurting Deputy Cosgrave's feelings over the 1923 Agreement.  I only wish that, from a national point of view, they would strongly adopt that attitude. One of the reasons that have kept the British from settling with this <Col N="1742" /> Government is that they think that by putting economic pressure on the present Government they will be thrown out and replaced by a weaker and more amenable Government.</P>

I hope they will carry that view to its logical conclusion and declare that if they are returned to power they are not going to pay that £5,000,000.  If they do that, they will make it easier for this country to settle with the British, no matter what Government is in power here. When they think that by putting on pressure here they can get some Government returned that will accede to their request and pay them £5,000,000, £3,000,000 or £1,000,000, they would be fools if they did not keep up the pressure.  If Deputy MacDermot's assumption is correct, that the Opposition want to see this dispute settled, they will accept that policy and stand publicly over it.  In my humble opinion, there is much more involved in the present dispute between ourselves and England than the mere payment of £5,000,000 a year.  With the help of goodness this country is going to progress sufficiently that £5,000,000 a year will be a bagatelle in our national Budget, and it is going to do that in spite of the British and in spite of any want of assistance from some people at home.</P>

If we paid the whole, how much better off would we be?  We would be still paying it.  If we acceded to the British demand, and through fear of the British were to pay them that £5,000,000, or nine-tenths of it or half of it to-day, what is to prevent them putting up tariffs against our goods and £4 per head on our cattle or anything else?</P>

Would any Deputy, would even Deputy Mulcahy, who, I suppose, has left the House in order to attend the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, assert in an honest way that the £736,000 to be provided or which may be granted to public authorities and private individuals for the construction of houses, is being poured into a sink?  That sum and sums previously provided have helped already in the erection of 42,000 houses for the people of this country.  Probably 50,000 will be erected through the agency of these grants in the coming year and through facilities of this kind. Would they assert that the 40,000 or 50,000 people who got the benefit of these grants to provide themselves with decent houses, are going to add to the number of alleged Communists in the country at the present time?  Is that the opinion of Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan and other people with elastic consciences of that kind? Was that their policy when they gave these grants in the past?  Would Deputy Roddy assert that the £606,000 provided for the improvement of estates was devoted to better and more effective work in his régime than at present?  Would he suggest that that money is now all going down the drain pipe that Deputy Mulcahy talks about? That £606,000 has found work and wages, and assistance for thousands of people who otherwise would have no work in the areas where it is being spent.  I want a straight answer from Deputy O'Leary, and I am sure that all the Deputies in Dublin will come in <Col N="1746" /> to hear him giving his views on where the £750,000 provided for the dairy farmers is going.  It is a subject on which he can talk with some authority, and it is about time that he gave his honest opinion on a matter he knows something about.  The same applies to Deputy Roddy in respect of the £606,000 provided for the improvement of estates.</P>
      <P>We support this Government because we know that they are providing these additional sums for social services never provided hitherto, and if, through the mistaken judgment of the people, the present Opposition came back to office they would probably wipe out all these social services which were not provided in their time. They are, of course, telling the people now that they would adopt the policy of the Fianna Fáil party, but if it is only a question of the difference between the individuals who are to administer the same policy, I prefer to continue to support the people who have made it possible for these social services to be initiated rather than other individuals who did nothing when they had the opportunity.  The only complaint I make with regard to these additional social services-and it is a complaint which I hope the Minister will deal with-is that the moneys provided annually are not being spent within the year for which they are provided.  The Minister can give some information regarding the extent to which money will go back to the Exchequer under these various subheads at the end of the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on these benches know that, in accordance with the public promise given by President de Valera in 1933, a sum of £250,000 was provided in the 1934-5 Estimates for widows' and orphans' pensions.  Not one penny of that very large sum found its way into the pockets of the widows and orphans of this State, simply because the Government did not implement the legislation and bring it into operation in time to enable the money to find its way into the pockets of the proper people.  I also know that in previous years a large percentage of the sum allocated for the improvement of estates went back into the Exchequer <Col N="1747" /> at the end of the financial year.  We also know that the manner in which the present widows' and orphans' pension scheme is being administered will make it utterly impossible for the sum allocated in the present year to go into the pockets of the proper people.  The Ministers for Finance and Local Government are responsible for that.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance-and it is a matter of policy-to state quite frankly was it the intention of his colleagues in the Cabinet and of the members of the Party, when passing the Act, to provide weekly payments which would be lower than the amounts previously given to necessitous widows and orphans by the local authorities.  I am assured by the General SEcretary of my own Party that there are hundreds of cases throughout the country, and I know several cases in my own constituency where pensions have been granted to widows and orphans which are much below the amount previously paid by the local assistance authority.  I want to know definitely if that was the intention of the Government and, if so, how it was that this sum of £250,000 is provided when it is well known that it is not likely to be spent if that is the clear-cut policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Army Pensions for Able-bodied Persons&rdquo; we find that 3,254 persons are receiving service pensions amounting to £154,960 per annum, under the terms of the 1924 Act.  Under the 1924 Act there are, I believe, applications to the number of 50,000 odd persons, and we find that up to the present only 490 persons have been granted pensions, amounting to £25,985.  Under the 1934 Act we have, under the title of &ldquo;Probable Additional Charges,&rdquo; the extraordinary sum of £286,260 included in the Estimates for the present year.  I want to know, and before I vote on this matter I am entitled to know, how many service pensions that sum represents, or is it put there as a round figure as the £250,000 was set out as the provision for widows' and orphans' pensions in the last financial year, and none of the money paid out. <Col N="1748" /> We all know, and the Minister better than anybody else, that this Government, not alone publicly pledged itself to refuse to pay pensions to able-bodied persons, but pledged itself to repeal the 1924 Act which made provision for that purpose to the number of 3,254 persons.  The members of this Party have some responsibility for persuading the Government to change their point of view on that question, with the result that the 1934 Service Pensions Act was passed, and, having some responsibility in that respect, we are entitled to know what this figure of £286,260 represents, and how many pensions it covers provided that it is intended to be paid out during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see that figure in the Estimates, and the taxpayers asked to find that sum by way of direct taxation, if the money is not going to be paid out, particularly when the Government are reducing the provision for unemployment assistance allowance by that £110,000.  They intend, I pre-sum, to cut the unemployment assistance allowance by that £110,000, but I want to know if they honestly intend to pay out that sum of £286,000 odd during the coming financial year, and, if so, how many persons will be covered by that payment.  I hope the Minister will not forget that point, and that he will make his position a little clearer than it appears to be from the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Approximately 15 per cent. of the sum to be raised by taxation is being raised for the purpose of providing bounties and subsidies for either industry or agriculture.  Out of the amount provided, £2,000,000 odd is being set aside for subsidies and bounties for the farmers.  I assert positively that the sum of £750,000 provided for subsidies and bounties for the dairy farmers is definitely finding its way into the pockets of the dairy farmers, and must find its way there, under the existing organisation of the dairy farmers, unless the managers of the co-operative creamery companies are robbing the local suppliers.</P>

      <P>I agree absolutely with the Government in withdrawing the <Col N="1749" /> bounties on exported live stock and, by doing so, saving the sum of £400,000 a year which was previously provided for the purpose of giving bounties on live stock exported to Great Britain. I always held the view, and nobody has ever been able to convince me to the contrary, that that money was going to the middlemen and not to the producer for whom it was intended. I should like to ask the Minister whether it is intended to divert that sum into the pockets of the producers by means of derating, or by some other method by which it will find its way directly into the pockets of the farmers, or if it is intended to save that money and not to make provision for the payment of a similar amount to the producers by some other better method.  I am glad that this sum of £400,000 has been saved to the taxpayers, because I think it has not been finding its way into the proper pockets at all, and I do not see why the taxpayer should be compelled any longer to provide money for the middlemen, who have been making a fairly good living out of the live-stock producers of this country.</P>

It has been stated here on several occasions, and also outside, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that roughly 300 factories have been established in this State since this Government came into office.  I <Col N="1750" /> wonder is the Minister for Finance yet in a position to give us any definite figure under that particular heading?  If he is, I should like to hear from the Minister how many of the 300, more or less, factories established are at the moment being controlled by Irish directors with Irish money and to what extent we have financial control, or personal control of these concerns by outside persons.</P>

      <P>All right, then.  This is notice of my future intention to ask the Minister to reply to that question if he can do so.  I admit, and nobody can deny it, that this policy of tariffs, bounties, subsidies and guaranteed loans to farmers and industrialists, has had the effect, particularly in cases where high tariffs have been given to certain industrialists, of putting up the cost of living in this country to a figure for which there is no justification. The members of this Party have, on innumerable occasions, drawn the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers to the high prices charged to the community for flour, bread and other necessaries of life.  It appears to me that the commission called the Prices Commission has not taken, and is not taking, any effective steps whatever to control prices or to keep them within reasonable limits, so far as the population of the country is concerned. If this Prices Commission is a failure, then cut it out altogether and save the money which can be saved by abolishing that body, that is if the Minister cannot hold out some hope that it will do more effective work in the future than it has done up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with interest a statement made by the Chairman of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade at a recent function <Col N="1751" /> at which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was entertained, in which he alleged-and the Minister agreed -that certain classes of articles which were being turned out by some of our new industries were of a bad type, of an inferior quality, and that the price charged in some cases was unnecessarily high.  There is no use in the Minister for Industry and Commerce making these admissions at a function of that kind, or here in this House, if he is not prepared to take the most effective steps to deal with the people who are fleecing the community and who, at the same time, are getting assistance by way of bounties and subsidies from the taxpayers of the country as a whole. Some steps should be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>I understood it to be the policy of the Government to endeavour to control the price of manufactured articles and the necessaries of life.  As a result of the adoption of that policy they have set up the Prices Commission, and I merely say that they should either take the necessary steps to compel that body to deal effectively with the manufacturers, the flour millers, the bankers, and other individuals who are charging excessive prices or drop the Commission altogether and save the money which can be saved by abolishing that body. I refer to this matter because I want to issue a friendly warning to the Government.  It is my considered opinion that the attitude of the Government in allowing these manufacturers to charge excessive prices for the necessaries of life is going to create trouble in the industrial sphere in this country, unless some measures are taken to stop it.  The purchasing power of the wages of workers employed in the cities and towns, and rural parts of the country, is being seriously affected by this tendency on the part of manufacturers and others <Col N="1753" /> unduly to increase the price of the necessaries of life and unless the Government take some effective steps in the near future to stop the tendency in that direction, the Department of Industry and Commerce is going to be confronted with constant demands for increased wages to meet the increased cost of living.  I am giving a warning to the Ministry that unless they take proper steps the trouble will come from that direction.</P>

One naturally must assume &mdash;and I should like to hear Deputy O'Leary on this&mdash;that a fairly high percentage of that money is finding its way into the pockets of the farmers. I know, and Deputy O'Leary knows, that the dairy farmers are getting some benefit out of it.  I know, and every Deputy who knows anything about rural conditions must admit, that the farmers are getting something out of the subsidy provided for the beet growers of the country.  Deputy O'Leary knows, and I am sure he is honest enough to admit, that the farmers have been doing pretty well this year out of the subsidy, or guaranteed price provided for those who were sensible enough and intelligent enough to grow wheat.</P>

      <P>Arising out of these various ways of helping the farmers, I am quite certain that the tillage farmers are benefiting by the policy of the Government, although I admit that there is a counterbalancing factor by way of the losses incurred upon the production and sale of live stock.  Is it not fair that the agricultural labourers, who have suffered to the tune of 3/- a week by way of reduction of wages since 1931, should get some share of the benefits which are finding <Col N="1754" /> their way into the pockets of their employers, the farmers?  If this money is intended to help the farmers to produce at a profit, and if it is actually having that effect in the case of those growing wheat and beet and engaged in the dairy farming business, it is not unreasonable to expect that some of the subsidies and bounties should find its way into the pockets of the agricultural labourers.  The Minister for Finance knows, from the records of the Department of Industry and Commerce, that the wages of agricultural labourers have decreased by 3/- a week since 1931.  What action does the Government propose to take for the purpose of improving the wages and the working conditions of the agricultural labourers?</P>

We also put forward a proposal for the establishment of an Agricultural Wages Board, which would have power to fix district minimum rates of wages for agricultural labourers.  The Government have not taken effective steps to deal with that proposal; they have neither accepted nor rejected it.  That is why the Labour Party have a motion on the Order Paper for the purpose of asking the House to compel the Minister for Agriculture, the Government, to set up an Agricultural Wages Board.

I am reminded by a colleague that it was a very friendly warning, but I am afraid the Minister will treat it in the way in which, apparently, as I gather from Deputy Davin's speech, he has treated all the other friendly warnings he has got from the Labour Party.  A very useful contribution to the settlement of the question of the wages of the agricultural labourers, that very friendly warning coming from Deputy Davin, perhaps much more friendly than it was a warning!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin pointed out the amount the farmers were getting.  He also made reference to their losses. He did that <i>en passant.</i>  It was a little thing that could not altogether be ignored.  He did admit there was some counter-balance&mdash;I think that is the phrase he used&mdash;that there was a setoff to what they received in what the farmers were compelled to lose.  He pointed out that in recent years the wages of the agricultural labourers have gone down.  He did not try to find the underlying cause of that decline.  He did not explain how it was that his Party, in the last three or four years, have been entirely unable to cope with the problem of the wages of the agricultural labourers.  They have been able to make no advance to secure any improvement in those wages.  Neither they nor their allies, the Fianna Fáil Party, have made any advance in that direction.  As a result of the mighty efforts of his Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, the wages of the agricultural labourers have gone down.  That is what Deputy Davin has <Col N="1757" /> to show this House as a result of the activities of the Fianna Fáil Party, of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, which the Labour Party so heartily supports on every occasion.  They continue to support Fianna Fáil despite the very friendly warnings given now and then which, I have not the slightest doubt, the Minister for Finance by this time knows exactly how to treat.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot, in the course of his speech, expressed some doubt as to whether the amount raised by way of taxation this year to meet the services the Government have imposed on the country is not too much for the country to bear.  He pointed out how various Parties had learned a lot since they came to this House.  Apparently Deputy MacDermot has also learned something.  He used to say&mdash;I hope he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the burden of taxation, especially in so far as it has to be borne by the agricultural community, was one of the great evils from which this country was suffering. But, leaving aside the question of the absolute amount of taxation, whether it is the £27,000,000 confessed to, plus the £5,000,000 confessed to by the Minister for Finance, or whether several more millions will not have to be added to that in the way of concealed taxation and concealed services &mdash;concealed, I mean, so far as the general annual statements are concerned&mdash;there are the £2,000,000 that we are withholding from Great Britain, in addition to the annuities.  Those £2,000,000 were on the Estimates in 1931.  They are no longer on the Estimates, but the people of this country are being taxed in order to raise that £2,000,000.  They are being taxed according to the bargain to which the Government have agreed.  They are being taxed by Great Britain so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult, as I pointed out yesterday, for anybody who merely takes up this book of Estimates, to know the actual amount of taxation that is being levied in this country at the present moment.  The question I should like Deputies to turn their attention to is whether value is being provided in return for these immense sums that the Government are going to <Col N="1758" /> raise; whether value in the way of permanent reproductive services is being provided in return for those sums; whether value is being provided for that £32,000,000, £36,000,000 or £38,000,000, as the case may be.  To that, none of the apologists for the Government, either from the Labour Benches or from the other Benches, has addressed himself.  Deputy Davin made great play with the question of the money being &ldquo;poured down a sink.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious to anybody who looks squarely at the situation that as long as the economic life of this country is kept in the unhealthy position in which it is being kept by the policy of the Government, a great deal of this expenditure is not reproductive. We might be in an entirely different position if the economic life of this country were put into a healthy condition. Then I should not have the slightest hesitation in saying that this money would be three or four times as useful and reproductive as it now is, and it would not then be true to say that a great deal of that money.  There is no permanent return for a great deal of it on account of the policy of the Government&mdash;a policy which is being supported in this House by Deputy Davin and his colleagues.</P>

      <P>I will come to the various points.  Housing is an exceedingly useful work.  It is absolutely necessary work, and a great deal of the few thousands increase in employment, of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce boasts, is due to housing, and I do not think the Deputy will deny that.  But useful as it is and necessary as it is, it is not reproductive in the ordinary sense. It does not produce further work beyond itself.  It is useful and necessary, <Col N="1759" /> but not in the ordinary economic sense reproductive.</P>

      <P>I explained the manner in which that phrase must be understood.  It is most necessary work, and it must be undertaken.  That policy has been advocated as strongly from those benches as from any other benches, but it is not reproductive economically.  It does not lead to further creation of work, like industries properly managed and properly progressing would lead to.  We listened yesterday to an opening statement by the Minister for Finance.  What was it? It was a comparison.  That Government has been almost four years in office now, and the best way they think they can justify their policy is not by justifying the real value of it, but by making comparisons.  They are the Government.  Let them occasionally in this House remember that.  Let them remember it is their policy that is before the country.  If the policy is capable of being stood over on its merits it should be stood over on its merits.  But it is not capable of being stood over on its merits.  Not in any Bill, nor on the Estimates, nor in that speech of the Minister for Finance is any effort made to deal with the real merits of that policy.  How often have we heard here when discussing amending Bills, this statement: &ldquo;Ten years ago, when the original Bill was introduced, this was the proposal put forward by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&rdquo;?  That is the end of it! That is sufficient justification! Now I can appreciate compliments and bouquets thrown at us as well as anybody else, but it is time that we should cease to be regarded, in a country which is supposed to progress from time to time, as the high-water mark of efficiency in absolutely everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say we had a most extraordinary display of Ministerial irresponsibility to-day from the Minister's colleague&mdash;the Minister for Defence. I have been in this House for some time, but never did I hear a more irresponsible and more scattered <Col N="1760" /> statement than that.  It is almost incredible that a man who was capable of making a statement like that occupies a position of Ministerial responsibility.  I think the House will agree with me when I say that it is time the Ministry should make some attempt to stand on their own legs.  I may tell the Minister that beyond a reference, perhaps, now and then, we would never think of justifying our policy by any comparison with that of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday some of the increases that were involved in those particular Estimates.  Deputy Davin is glad of some of the omissions from those Estimates.  He is glad of the ommission of the bounties.  Is that a confession that this money was wasted for the last couple of years?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it it possibly a little more reliable.  But glad as Deputy Davin is, let us realise that the Treasury is being saved that expense&mdash;unless the Government have completely recanted their policy in that respect&mdash;by savings effected from an attempt to come to the help of the wounded soldiers of this so-called economic war.  That is the way they <Col N="1761" /> save! They made the coal-cattle pact, which, in the words of the President, they do not trumpet; therefore, he cannot have been the responsible man in the initiation of that particular pact. Some other Minister set that particular ball rolling.  He does not trumpet it, but still it is the coal-cattle pact that the Minister and that ally of his here have stood over.  Although £200,000 is supposed to be lost to the Treasury, that was more than made up by the withdrawal of the bounties, which Deputy Davin is so glad have been removed from the book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Reference was made here in the course of one of the speeches on the Government side to the growing population of this country.  On what is the claim of 20,000 a year of an increase in our population based?  On ignoring altogether the actual emigration that is going on.  We had to-day an answer from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that made his outlook quite clear.  Mind you, from the Fianna Fáil Benches we had this reply, and it is instructive&mdash;that the emigration figures do not include emigration to Great Britain.  Therefore, Irish emigrants must be at home there.  Surely Ministers know that that emigration is going on.  I ask the House to bear in mind that during our tenure of office, once the American Government set up a quota, that quota was never filled.  At the time we left office emigration to the United States had practically stopped.  People did not go to the United States in our time in office because they did not want to go there. Is there a Deputy in this House who does not know from letters got from his constituents that if people do not now go to the United States it is because they will not be let go?  Are Deputies on the other side ignorant of that?  It is quite true that emigration to the United States is stopped.  It has been stopped by the United States Government.  That is their policy. People do not now emigrate to the United States for that reason.  They go to Great Britain, and they are going in numbers that never left this country while we were in office.</P>

      <P>I know what I am saying is quite true, and if the Minister consults the people of Kerry he will know what is happening there. I cannot speak for the people of Mayo and Galway.  Other Deputies can do that.  The Minister, because he has not published the figures, thinks he can get out of what everybody knows is happening in the County of Kerry.  In that county it is practically impossible at the present time for a farmer to get labour.  No young man or young woman can be hired.  For a wage of £26 a year few young women can be found to work for a farmer in Kerry. Labour cannot be had at that price. They are leaving the country.  The Minister can ask the farmers of Kerry. He is content to deny this fact because these Departments, which cost such a lot of money, have no figures about this matter.  That is the situation so far as the farmers of Kerry are concerned.</P>
      <P>I read in to-day's newspapers that the Kerry County Council adjourned the consideration of a scheme submitted by the County Secretary to help the ratepayers willing but unable to meet their obligations.  How does he propose to help them to pay their rates?  Remember this was before a Fianna Fáil county council.  The consideration of it was adjourned.  Here is the scheme&mdash;&ldquo;By giving them employment on roads repairing work, each alternate week's earnings to be made payable to the county council's rate offices until such time as the amounts due by such ratepayers are met.&rdquo;  That is the result of the policy over which Deputy Davin and the Minister stand.  We are to have payment of the rates in Kerry in kind! Because through the economic war the people's money is gone.  It is gone as a result of the brilliant policy which Deputy Davin backs up here, the policy which his Party so loyally supports with their occasional little warnings to the Government.</P>

Apparently Deputy Davin thinks that the benches here on this side of the House are the Government Benches and not the benches on the other side.  That is what one must deduce from his remark.  Here we have the proposal that farmers anxious to pay rates will be helped to pay them by paying them for their work only on each alternate week.  The wages for the other week is to go against their rates.</P>

      <P>What has the Deputy and his Party done to get an increased wage?  Why have they not got an increased wage from the Government?  I mention this matter to show the condition to which the farming community is reduced as a result of the Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see very little trace of a policy in the doings of the Government except the things I mentioned last night.  In return for this policy we are asked to consent to this particular Vote and to go on at all costs with the economic war.  About a portion of that policy Deputy Davin now has rather considerable doubts. He has considerable doubts about the policy of tariffs.  Irrespective of the lower purchasing power of the market, irrespective of the damage that Government policy has done to the purchasing power of the people, <Col N="1764" /> Ministers are making an effort to create every kind of industry in this country. Nobody denies that all these things can be artificially kept up for a time if the country is willing to pay.  Elsewhere in every sphere of their policy and in every phase of their policy the Government are driven from post to pillar.  No sooner have they taken up one position than they find it untenable. They change to another position which they find more untenable. That is the history of this Government since it came into office.</P>
    <P>Another phase of the Government policy is that they have deliberately set out to revolutionise the whole economic life of this country.  I mean not to revolutionise without loss but to revolutionise in a way that involves tremendous loss to the existing interests in the country.  They have set out in that policy and they were backed in it by their allies of the Labour Party, if they are allies.  They are practically now one Party.  They did not consider what was involved in this particular revolutionary policy nor did they consider whether the people would be able to stand it.  They did not consider the costs nor how far the country would be able to bear them. They did not want to develop the existing system of economy but they wanted completely to revolutionise the system.  I am using the very phrase used by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. A complete revolution and nothing less would suit these idealistic Ministers, men for whom no task was too big to be attempted.  It is a pity they could not push it through.  Ignore facts! That is their policy.  Why should idealists pay attention to economics or to facts?  These things must be ignored and they must be bent to the Minister's will! To-day we gather from a speech here that the whole British Empire will have to bend.  The British, we are told, are trembling in their boots lest the Saorstát should become a wealthy, powerful nation.  We have a responsible Minister of the Government treating the House to that sort of thing and getting the applause of Deputy Davin and, I presume, his absent leader.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>These men were determined no matter at what cost to the country to carry out their policy of ruin and damage to the farmers and to revolutionise the whole agricultural industry.  The whole thing is childish but they thought they could do it.  In the way they are carrying it out they are doing as much damage as possible to the people. That damage is uncalculated because it is incalculable; there is no means of approximately estimating what actual damage has been done to the farming community of this country. They never thought of these things at the time they unwisely determined to engage in the attempt at revolutionising the whole farming system of the country.  What did the Government care?  They had a policy and the interest and the welfare of the farming community had to give way to that policy.  Eggs to Spain and cattle to Germany&mdash;that would do instead.  These are the best substitutes we can get for the British market.  Is the Spanish market a satisfactory substitute, so far as eggs are concerned&mdash;to take them alone&mdash; for the British market, which that Party, backed up by its allies, so wilfully and so determinedly threw away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a little tax!&mdash;that means nothing to the Deputy! Whether the farmer sells his produce at an economic or an uneconomic price is the same thing to the Deputy and when, as a consequence of it, the agricultural labourers' wages go down, he can issue a very friendly warning to the Minister.  The contention of the Government was that the economic system which existed in this country before they took office was unsound.  What are we living on now? They say that policy was unsound, but we are able to carry on, even to the length we have carried on, as a result <Col N="1766" /> of the accumulated savings due to that policy and to nothing else&mdash;the accumulated savings of that policy that has been condemned, root and branch, and that an effort was made to uproot completely. If we are able to go on with the economic war, even to the length we have been, it is due to the fact that that policy was fundamentally and basically suited to this country.  It is due to the fact that under that policy there were accumulations of wealth, invested both in this country and in Great Britain, which are now being drawn upon to help the Government to eke out an existence and to continue the economic war.</P>
      <P>The cattle industry has been described by one Minister after another, in various speeches through the country, as uneconomic.  It was nothing of the kind until the Government policy made it uneconomic; until the Government determined to make other rather fantastic schemes economic by heavily subsidising them.  But, supposing for a moment, merely for the sake of argument, there was something in that contention that the cattle industry was uneconomic, does anybody think that in order to put it on a sound basis it would require anything like the help or the funds which have been poured out by the Government on the other fantastic schemes, from turf to tobacco? Nobody in his senses surely can consider that these other schemes are alternatives to the cattle industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from Deputy MacDermot here to-day that he was convinced that the Government had changed their views on the cattle industry.  I have tried in vain to find out what are their views on the cattle industry.  We have tried again and again to elicit any definite line from the Government as to what their policy was.  For six months it is one thing and for the other six months it is another thing.  A person would imagine, from the concluding of the coal-cattle pact, that they were beginning to open their eyes to the unwisdom of their economic policy, but then we see the bounty for calf skins still apparently the policy of the Government.  We see the Government bidding high prices for bulls and live stock, for what?  In order, apparently, to enable the Government to spend <Col N="1767" /> their bounty upon calf skins.  How else can they spend it?</P>
    <P>I have dealt, both to-day and yesterday, with the position that the Government, either wilfully or otherwise, set themselves out to arrive at, and that is the destruction of a certain type of economy in this country.  Whether that meant the destruction of a class apparently did not matter.  It is sometimes extremely difficult not to believe that in aiming at the destruction of the established agricultural economy in this country the Government were not also aiming at the destruction of the particular class who were responsible for the carrying on of that particular economy.  Certainly, if they wanted to destroy that class they could not have acted in a more efficient manner than they have done.  Now, when they see the people at last awakening to some consciousness of the injuries inflicted on the country, we have an effort on their part, I will not say to go back, they never do things, as I said, wholly or fully but half, to draw back and we had the coal-cattle pact.  Whether or not, as I say, they set out to destroy the class of independent farmer, and by that I simply mean the man who can exist without Government subsidy of one kind or another, who can exist on the produce of his farm and of his work, certainly their policy had the effect of largely wiping that class out of existence.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that something of that kind was not in their minds when we see the particular way and the particular manner in which they are pushing the division of lands. We had the case in County Wexford. That was not a case of the division of ranches.  It was a case in which nine farmers were given notice that their land would be acquired by the Land Commission and the biggest of these farms was 90 statute acres.  In a county well known for its tillage, the owner of that particular farm tills more than the average.  He employed five men and two women permanently&mdash; and that is the farm the Government proposed to take over! What conclusion can anybody draw from that, except that it is the settled policy of the Government to do away with any farmer who gives employment?  There <Col N="1768" /> were nine farms altogether, and the biggest was 90 statute acres.  Seven of them, I am told, were in a good condition, even for County Wexford, from the tillage point of view, and the smallest was 15 acres.</P>
    <P>I had occasion a couple of years ago to call attention to what I thought were the unwise, thoughtless speeches of some members of the opposite Party that seemed to be cutting at the root of a certain kind of proprietorship in this country; that seemed to regard the employment of workers almost as a crime; that in this House denounced large employers as if they were people who did not give employment but were grinding the faces of the labourer and the poor.  A lot of that kind of talk is finished, but some 12 months ago I heard it on reliable authority, although the speeches were no longer of the same fiery character, that action was going to be taken in connection with farms of this kind.  The speeches are more moderate but the conduct is less moderate.  When I mentioned this Wexford business, it was not so much for what it is in itself as for what it portends for this country and for the evidence that it offers to us of what must be the considered policy of this particular Government; and I think that it is well that the farming community of the country should realise that, just as well as they have been made to realise what are the consequences of other aspects of the Government's so-called agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>It is not alone that particular class of the community that suffers.  In a modernly organised community, if you hit at one class&mdash;especially at a class so basic as the agricultural community of this country&mdash;you must hit at all classes, such as the ordinary workers in the country towns.  It is folly to think that you will not hit them.  It is folly to think that you could hit one class and at the same time benefit another class.  Possibly you can do it for a year or two, but not for very long.  As a result of this policy of the Government, the people in the country towns are being damaged, and they are also being damaged by the development of modern means of transport, such as buses.  That being the case, surely it should be the policy <Col N="1769" /> of the Government to see that their measures did not further damage the situation of these people; but yet we have various proposals that only have the still further effect of damaging the country towns, such as the proposal to do away with pig markets.</P>
    <P>Barring the appeal to the national instinct and the exploitation and abuse of it by members of the Government, the great plank of their policy was to provide employment.  Deputy Mulcahy to-day gave figures which throw a considerable light, after three and a half years, on that aspect of the Government's policy.  Out of the famous 85,000 additional that were to be put into immediate employment, according to the promises of the Government, how many do they claim to have put into employment?  I am not asking how many they have put into employment.  I am merely asking what is their claim, and does the country think that that is a sufficient return for the increased expenditure to which the Ministry stands committed to-day?  They give money in relief.  What does most of the boasted expenditure of the Government amount to, except in relief in one or another form?  Has there been any really effective attempt to deal permanently with this problem of production and employment? Why, the very boasts of the Minister yesterday are an argument to the contrary; and Deputy Mulcahy, in striking language, drew attention to that.  The Labour Deputy, who was present, apparently even did not know what he was talking about.  If you take away the numbers engaged in the housing industry&mdash;a very necessary undertaking, as I say, but certainly not economically productive in the ordinary sense&mdash;what inroad have you made in that 85,000?  No wonder the people are flying the country! It is a sad commentary on the whole policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin had a mild word or two to say in reference to labour conditions in the new industries that have been set up.  He had to call attention to that matter, and he did call attention to it, despite the efforts of the Minister to prevent him doing so.  He called attention to the increased cost of living involved in the policy of the <Col N="1770" /> Government; but when speaker after speaker stood up from these benches here and pointed out that the policy of the Government meant increased prices, did we get any support at the time from Deputy Davin or his colleagues? Did they not blindly accept the word of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that the higher was the tariff the lower was the price?  Now, the Labour Party, because they do apparently come in touch with labourers occasionally, acknowledge that one of the deplorable results, or at least one of the regrettable results, of the Ministerial policy is the increase in the cost of living; and I have no doubt that a friendly, a very friendly, warning will go forth from that Party to the Government.</P>
    <P>Whether the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a good or a bad policy, or whether he has not run a sound idea to death, may be debatable, but at least the Minister can claim that his policy is not getting a chance: that whether his policy of going all out for industries in this country, and putting up every kind of industry in this country, is sound or not, it cannot be tested as a result of the wretched policy of the Government with regard to agricultural matters.  How can any Minister who believes in his policy, when he is faced, perhaps in a couple of years, with the failure of these industries, believe that his policy is unsound, when he knows that one of the causes of the failure of these industries is the decreased purchasing power of the community?</P>
    <P>Our attitude on a settlement has been clear all along.  Whenever there was any question of the Government negotiating with the British Government in this matter we tried to help them all we could.  Again and again we have stated that this country is not able to pay the sums of money it was able to pay some years ago.  Again and again we stated that, just as there had been readjustments of the financial relations between other countries, so there must be a readjustment of the financial settlement between this country and Great Britain.  We gave every help.  Even the President himself <Col N="1771" /> acknowledged that the speech of the Leader of our Party, on one of the historic occasions on which he tried to settle this matter, was helpful.  Of course it was helpful.  It was helpful because it was meant to be so.  The Minister stands up and glibly says&mdash;I wonder whether it is worth while paying attention to some of his statements&mdash;that the Opposition do not want a settlement.  He says, in effect, that if there were a settlement it would mean the end of our Party.  Well, then, let him make the settlement and put an end to our Party, if he thinks that that would be the effect of such a settlement.  Let him make the settlement.  But no, he will not make it.  He will not be let make it.  I say that there is every evidence, from the conduct of certain Ministers, that they would make a settlement if they were let, but they will not be let make a settlement.  The policy is that industry and agriculture and finance can go to ruin, but that the one thing that must go on is the war.</P>
    <P>We were told last night by the Minister for Finance that the Government are anxious to settle this question, that every member of the Government is anxious to settle it.  What we should like is not a statement of that kind from the Minister, but some tangible evidence of an effort to honour that particular statement, and some real approach to a settlement by the Government.  We want now what we have always wanted from the Government, not words, but deeds. We all know perfectly well that on one occasion when there were great hopes of a settlement of this dispute, when the President himself and others undertook it, when there was hope that after the previous failure the two parties might be nearer to each other than they were before, we found that they were much further apart as a result of new claims put in by the President.  Yet, we are told that the man who is capable of conducting negotiations in that way&mdash;the Minister, when speaking last night, was speaking for every member of the Government and, therefore, I presume, for the President&mdash;and the Government are still anxious for a settlement.  All <Col N="1772" /> that I can say is that if that Party and that Government are anxious for a settlement, then there is not the slightest doubt that they are as inefficient in diplomacy as they are in everything else.</P>
    <P>I referred last night to the fact that there was only one really thriving industry in the country, namely, the Civil Service.  I do not wish to say a word against the hard work performed by civil servants.  Members of the Opposition who have had experience of Government know the very hard work they do, but the Civil Service, I say, is the principal industry that the Government has promoted.  The reason is that they have advanced step by step since 1932 in the direction of more and more State control.  They blindly in that year plunged into certain lines of policy that led them very much further than they ever contemplated. Not a day passes in which we do not see greater evidence of State control, not in furtherance of any thought-out plan, but as a result of the hand-to-mouth policy pursued by the Government.  We have more and more State control for business men and farmers, and by reason of the number of documents they are obliged to fill up an effort is being made to turn them, practically speaking, into civil servants.</P>
    <P>I have still to learn, and I would be surprised to learn it from the Labour Party or from the Government Party which used to be so eloquent on it, that relief works are any real contribution to the solution of the problem of unemployment.  All that the Minister had to boast of yesterday was more relief works of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>The Estimates placed before us are a clear indication of the healthy financial position of the State.  The decrease shown is over £823,000.  As a result of that, I think the people can anticipate a satisfactory budgetary position this year.  The members of the Opposition have made very feeble efforts to criticise the Estimates.  I regard that as a very good sign.  Of course, they told us, as they always do, that bankruptcy is facing the country and facing its <Col N="1773" /> principal industry.  They told us that 12 months ago and two years ago, and again during the course of this debate. It is rather a peculiar thing that bankruptcy should be facing us at a time when we are in a position to reduce the Estimates by a substantial figure.  The Opposition have not told us why, in their opinion, bankruptcy is facing us.  They did not tell us that two years ago, or even last year, when the Estimates were higher than they are to-day.  But, whenever the opportunity presents itself in this House, that is the line of argument they pursue: that bankruptcy is facing us. They even tell us that when there is a tax reduction of 35/- per head on the finished cattle that we send to the English market.  They have the same story when a pact is concluded that is favourable to our farmers.  That is the attitude of people who, a year ago, appealed to the Government to get for this country the same terms which, they said, were then being enjoyed by other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations: to get for us the terms that those countries got at Ottawa.  Yet, when our Government get very much better terms for this country the Opposition come out with the story that we are faced with bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Government do, whether they reduce the Estimates or increase the price paid to the farmer for his wheat, they are told by the Opposition that their efforts are leading the country into a state of bankruptcy. The efforts of the Opposition to criticise the Estimates were, in my opinion, feeble and non-constructive. They are never able to put up a constructive argument on any matter that might be of use to the Government.  Perhaps I should say that in this debate their arguments were non-destructive.  We have now reached the position when it is immaterial whether or not the English people read the speeches made by the Opposition in this House.  At one time certain classes in England were inclined to take their speeches seriously, to hold them up as an example as showing that our people were whining, and that it was only a matter of a few months until England <Col N="1774" /> had brought us to our knees.  We have got beyond that now, and the English people cannot be influenced any longer by the deplorable speeches made in this House from the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan said that the erection of houses was nonproductive. That proves quite clearly to me that it is at least one reason why the last Government did not promote house building.  When these Estimates came up in the past, why were not larger sums of money devoted to the erection of houses? According to Deputy O'Sullivan that work was unproductive.  The Deputy also said that it was necessary work, even though it was unproductive.  If it is unproductive now, it was unproductive in the past, but if necessary now it was equally necessary in the past.  Yet the Deputy has the audacity to come along and criticise the spending of money on the erection of more houses.  Very few social services are reproductive.  Perhaps that is the reason why the last Government did not provide more money for necessary social services.  Deputy Mulcahy spent a good deal of time trying to prove from statistics that even though there was increased tillage there was less paid employment in agricultural districts.  It is reason able to expect that the Deputy spent a good deal of time preparing his figures, but it is quite clear that more employment is being given in country districts.  I know that ranches of 200 acres, on which one man was formerly employed, have been divided into ten holdings upon which at least ten families find employment.  Of course that is not considered employment according to Deputy Mulcahy's figures. Nevertheless, employment is now being given on the land that was denied to the people in the past, and they are getting a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>The non-co-operation of the Party opposite with the Government has resulted in a number of people being placed on unemployment assistance.  I will be generous and say that the followers of the Deputy's Party did not give extra employment, and in numerous instances dismissed men <Col N="1775" /> who in the ordinary course would have been employed.  The best answer to the Deputy's statement is that there has been a reduction of £110,000 in the vote for unemployment assistance. That is a healthy indication of the new conditions that are developing in the country, as the Government does not anticipate that they will be called upon to provide for the same number of unemployed this year as during the past year.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked if value was given for the money expended on social services.  I say definitely that value for the money is being given in the different services. No Deputy can point to any of these social services in which value is not given.  Value is certainly being given for the increased Vote of £133,000 for the Land Commission.  There has been increased activity on the part of the Land Commission in putting the people back on the land.  That money is being well spent.  There is also an increased Vote for housing, and an increased Vote to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  A good deal of play was made with the suggestion that farmers were not able to buy new clothes.  I can assure the House that woollen mills that were working halftime, or that were closed during the regime of the late Government are now working full time.  If they are not making cloth for farmers they are making it for somebody else, because some are working overtime.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot went to great length to prove that conditions in England were much better in the agricultural districts than they are here. He said that higher wages were paid in England.  I should like to refer the Deputy to newspaper reports of proceedings in the House of Commons on March 2, where there was a censure motion expressing profound regret at the inability of the Government to provide any effective policy to deal with fundamental causes which rendered whole areas derelict.  In the course of the debate Mr. Dalton, whose constituency is Bishop Auckland, Durham, said that in the surrounding areas more than 50 per cent. of the population were unemployed, and more than 80 per cent. had not worked for over a <Col N="1776" /> year.  In some of these areas he said that 90 per cent. of the whole population was unemployed.  When Deputy MacDermot was telling us of the good conditions that exist in England, and of the high wages paid to the workers, he should have mentioned that in some districts very few people were working, and that in other areas 90 per cent. of the population was unemployed.  I suppose Deputy MacDermot can see very little good in anything Irish.  The very fact that he went to Mr. Thomas and asked him to make a favourable settlement with Ireland, and also interviewed five British Cabinet Ministers, and impressed upon them the necessity of making a favourable settlement, should show him that the English Government is as hard-hearted now as it was when Mr. Cosgrave went to it for a remission of £250,000.  The Deputy should know that England is not going to give anything to this country for the love of it.  Anything we are going to get from England we are going to get because of our ability to get it.</P>

      <P>They hailed it with delight, even though there was then a tax of 5/- on coal.  Now, when that tax is taken off coal, and when more cattle are going to the British market, we are told that the flag was hauled down.  That proved that the Opposition were not sincere in their arguments. They thought that the people would not accept the first coal-cattle pact and they let it pass.  They were afraid the people would welcome the last coal-cattle pact, and that is why they opposed it with vehemence.  Of course Deputy Cosgrave wanted to set out to look for a more comprehensive settlement.  The pact was so good that he wanted still more pacts along the same lines.  I think Deputy Belton also wanted a comprehensive settlement along those lines.  Yet the Party opposite stated it was a bad pact.  We have the Party saying one thing and the Leader saying another thing.  We had Deputy Dillon stating that he would have no wheat or beet schemes <Col N="1777" /> when his Party got into power, but we have the Party stating that they would still continue wheat-growing and beet-growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition misses one point when they discuss a settlement of our economic problems, and that is the attitude of England towards our agricultural produce if we find it necessary to develop more industries here.  If we find that it would help us to give employment to our people at home by having an industrial arm, it would be necessary to raise tariffs against foreign goods, and England might retaliate by placing a tax on our agricultural produce.  That is quite reasonable. When Deputies opposite say that the Government should go and settle, they should remember that there are many things to be settled if we are to have the liberty that we wish to have for the benefit of our industries. Deputy O'Sullivan taunted the Minister for Finance with stating that a settlement of the dispute would eradicate the Deputy's Party.  It was not the Minister for Finance made that statement in the first instance.  It was made by Deputy O'Sullivan's late leader, and was broadcast in the newspapers. He said that when he was striving to get that Party to fall in and to offer a solid front to England, in an effort to win the economic war, he was told that if the economic war was finished it would eradicate their Party, as it was the only thing they had to depend upon to keep them in existence. I can assure them that we made the recent pact without hauling down the flag and without diverging one step from the position we took up.  That Mr. MacDonald has chosen to meet us where Mr. Thomas refused to meet us is a clear indication of better things to come.  We were told that the farmers are losing and have lost by the economic war.  We agree that those farmers who were interested in the cattle trade have lost.  Some of them have lost heavily, but I submit that that is merely like the payment of a premium of insurance.  Their loss will guarantee them against future adversity. How could the farmer have existed with the English market as it was?  How could he have existed by devoting his attention to the production <Col N="1778" /> of cattle for a market which was dwindling in price?</P>

Instead of reading the fanatical speeches delivered here by members of the Opposition, they will be able to devote some thought to bettering their own position with the resources at hand.  I hold that these Estimates prove that we have taken the first step on the road to prosperity.  If the Estimates had been increased, we would have had some bitter speeches from the Opposition. They would have some foundation for holding them up to ridicule. But the amount shows a decrease. The few items which show an increase are for the provision of necessary social services&mdash;services for which the people have been calling out for years and services which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party should be ashamed they had not introduced many years ago.</P>

      <P>You do not seem to realise it.  Deputy J.P. Kelly, when he saw me rising, cleared.  The farmers of Meath who supported him on the platform asked him to come here to the Ministry and put their position before them.  He would not come with them.  I challenge him to contradict that.  I challenge him to meet me at Ballivor and tell the farmers what he handed out here. Farmers gathered on the streets of Ballivor to give a reception at the last general election and at the local elections to Deputy Kelly and Deputy O'Reilly.  What would they think of the stuff he served out here to-day? He said that those who voted against the pact were, in effect, voting against a reduction in the tax on cattle of 35/- per head&mdash;a reduction which would make agriculture prosperous. If a reduction of 35/- per head in the tax would make agriculture prosperous, what would a reduction of £6 per head make agriculture?  And what a crime that Government has committed against agriculture by being responsible for having that tax of £6 per head imposed and levied on the cattle exported from this country for almost the last four years. If it is such a great thing to get a reduction of 35/- what must one think of the crime of the people responsible for the imposition of this tax of £6 per head?</P>

They would not come in here to look after the interests of the country.  If we were entitled to these annuities in 1935, we were entitled to them in 1925 and in 1922.  What did they do to have these annuities, pensions and local loans reserved for the benefit of this country?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce smiles.  Would he have come in here from 1923 to 1927 if the agreement which he now claims sold the whole case of the annuities to Britain had been under consideration?

      <P>I have not got them by me.  He would be a cleverer man than I am to be able to follow the Deputy and to quote his words.  Is the Deputy not aware, and are we not all aware, that no county suffered more than the Deputy's own county?  We heard a lot of raméis about people with cattle mentality and people who followed the cattle trade.  That shows the depth of knowledge of people who apply themselves from that angle.  I have yet to meet the man who could put up an agricultural policy without cattle.  I want to deal with the Bill and with the agricultural policy which the Government has to put up.  I do not say that they are deliberately putting it up. They have been manoeuvred into the position that this policy has to be followed. We find very little increase in tillage.  It has been said, and I believe it, thought I have not the records, that on the whole there has not been an increase in agricultural labour.  Why? Because the type of tillage followed is not the type that gives labour.  Fancy a full-grown man saying here that 200 acres of land is being run by a man and a dog.  How could it be run by a man and a dog, unless it was left derelict?  I say further that in the case of mixed live-stock farming, where winter fodder is provided, there will be as much labour given on a 200-acre farm as there will be on a wheat ranch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad it is not denied.  Is it not a fact that wheat is being grown very largely upon conacre, because the people who take the conacre are too astute to grow it on their own land and rob their own land?  Is it not a fact that on large tracts of land in Meath and Louth wheat is grown three and four years in succession? I defy contradiction on that. What condition will that land be found in when it is turned up by a tractor?  Wheat one year, wheat again next year.  If the ordinary rotation were adopted you would have to grow <Col N="1782" /> root crops.  You would have to feed these root crops to cattle, and these cattle would have to get to the market. That means that to have tillage in this or any other country you must have live stock.  The produce of tillage with any sort of good rotation, or at least 80 per cent. of it, will be fed to live stock.  That 80 per cent. of your produce will require a profitable market.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the market which the Minister for Industry and Commerce boasted of a few days ago.  I have the reference, but I need not give the exact quotation.  I know if I give the substance the Minister will accept it.  He said that the pact last year enabled us to export 150,000 more cattle, with an increased income of £1,000,000.  Now the Minister may know the price of some goods, but he probably does not know what is a fair price for cattle.  Does he imagine that £6 and a few odd shillings per head for cattle in England is a good price? He gave us the figure of 150,000 cattle additional last year, but tied to their horns was at least £6 per head&mdash;a free gift from a free people.  For what purpose? To pay the land annuities about which we have heard all this tripe and declarations to the effect that &ldquo;We will never pay.  We would not lower the flag.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Play was made with the statement by Deputy O'Sullivan that housing, although a big industry at the moment, was not reproductive.  Of course, that is true and cannot be denied.  We have cases in County Dublin where farmers unable to pay their rates, offered land to the Board of Health of County Dublin on which to build labourers' cottages, so that they, the farmers, might have enough money to pay the rates.  How are these labourers to live if agriculture is reduced to that position?  What is the use of building houses if you have no employment to give the people? Deputy Davin wants to know what attitude I will adopt when his motion for the appointment of a wages board comes up here for consideration.  I welcome a wages board.  This motion for fixing agricultural wages is rather belated sympathy, coming from the Labour Party, with the agricultural worker.  The policy that has <Col N="1783" /> driven away the income from agriculture is the policy that has reduced agricultural wages.  It is an old saying: &ldquo;You cannot get more out of the meal-tub than you put in.&rdquo;  If there is only a certain amount of wealth to be distributed out of the agricultural meal-tub you have to share what is there.  If that amount is small, those looking for a share must take a small share.  That is the position, and that is the condition that has reduced agricultural wages throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There will be time, as the Ceann Comhairle has pointed out to many speakers, including myself, to go into the details of this Estimate, but, in view of the scanty information the public got with regard to the coal-cattle pact, and the decision of the Minister for Agriculture to withdraw the cattle export bounties from 19th February, I wonder to what this sum of £2,180,000 for bounties will be given. It was mentioned in the debate that bounties are given for the export of butter.  That is so, but the producers of butter have to pay a levy of 39/-per cwt. on their butter to provide that, and the butter consumers of this country have to pay it in the inflated prices of butter here.  When we had any butter to export, we exported it at a loss and we were almost paying the British for taking it.  I should like the Minister to say a few words in explanation of the meaning of this provision of £2,000,000 odd for export bounties and subsidies.</P>
    <P>The bounties have been withdrawn from agricultural produce exported and a reason, a very flimsy reason, given that they did not, in their entirety, find their way to the producers, but it has been stated by Deputy Davin that there is a way of enabling them to find their way to the producers. It could be done by increasing the grant in relief of rates on agricultural land.  But that is not being done.  The Government acknowledge that agriculture is paying the entire amount of the withheld moneys and this Estimate shows no variation of, or departure from, the previous policy of the Government.  While they have agreed to a pact which acknowledges <Col N="1784" /> Britain's right to collect the payments under the coal-cattle pact, and while they admit that the agricultural produce being exported will pay that sum of £5,000,000, they have made no provision in these Estimates to compensate agriculture for that payment.</P>
    <P>All the compensation given is a reduction of the land annuities by half. That total benefit amounts only to about £2,000,000.  There is a further sum of £3,000,000 which agriculture has to pay and would it not be the merest justice to say that, while this economic dispute lasts, the farmers should be relieved entirely from the payment of any annuities to our Government here, not by way of relief, but by way of justice, because they are paying them to the British, and for no other reason. They are also paying the Local Loans and Pensions and those two items together amount to considerably more than the entire agricultural rate on the agricultural land of the Free State. Would it not be mere justice, and not a privilege or a relief, if the Government made provision in these Estimates to provide the Guarantee Fund with sufficient moneys to cover the entire estimates of the county councils for the current year and on to the conclusion of the economic war?  Those are items which are absent from this White Paper.  There is no need for special pleading for any particular section of the community, and if I am pleading for this consideration for the agricultural industry, I am not doing so on personal grounds of pleading for the farmers, or for the agricultural labourers, but the agricultural industry is the very foundation of the State and the only possible market for Irish industry.  If that is bankrupted, I do not see what hope or future there can be for the industries which, we are told, are springing up here every day.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on the Estimates, we shall have a better opportunity of going into the details of these various items and debating more fully how the economic war is affecting agriculture in its different departments, but, in general, the Government is conniving at the robbing of the agricultural industry while claiming to be developing the industrial arm.  Taking as the starting point the need for an industrial <Col N="1785" /> arm as well as an agricultural arm, it is essential, if we are ever going to have industry in this country, to preserve the agricultural arm in a healthy condition.  The Government, however, is going the best possible way about amputating that arm, and the method adopted by that attempted amputation is making impossible the development of the industrial arm.  I do not think I will take up the time of the House any further with this matter, as it has been fully debated in a general sense this week and last week, and to debate it in a particular sense would, I think, be more or less in conflict with the ruling of the Chair and certainly against the spirit of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that having listened for the last two or three hours patiently to the arguments which have been adduced, I presume for the benefit of those who intend to support this Bill&mdash;whether those who adduced them will persist in voting against it or not I do not know&mdash;I am as much in the dark as when the debate began.  It is possible that that is due to my want of grey matter, although I do not plead guilty in that respect. The Fianna Fáil Party may have erred in their past career and in their present one but I say one thing is certain, and that is that in our previous incarnation, we must have been guilty of some terrible crime, to have fathered on us now all the round platitudes of Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and company and the tiresome, though well-intentioned and well-equipped oratory of Deputy Belton.  After all, Deputy Belton knows what he is talking about, but I must say the same does not apply to Deputy O'Sullivan.  By what authority Deputy O'Sullivan speaks for the farmers I do not know.  He spoke during the course of this debate about emigration from Kerry.  All I know is that at one time he set a bad example himself and did not return there in any case.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made of the fact that the Opposition do not want a settlement of the economic war or any other war.  I think, after all, that there is some truth in that, because what would the Opposition do once the ghost of the economic war was laid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> It stalks across the stage twice nightly chanting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Maid of Britain, ere we part</P>
    <P>Give, oh, give us back our mart?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the song of the siren, and apparently if it be once laid, the Opposition will be like Othello&mdash;their occupation will be gone.  I am sure if the economic war were settled the Party opposite would be at a loose end for something to do.  Consequently there is something to be said for the allegation, humorous or otherwise, that really they do not want this dispute settled at all.  I did not quite follow Deputy Belton in his arguments as to the production of stock and wheat, although I recognise he is an expert on this subject.  After all, he speaks differently from the rest of the Opposition when it comes to that.  Deputy Belton talks clearly and authoritatively about beet and wheat and about protection and subsidies.  On several occasions he has confessed himself a whole-hog protectionist and a whole-hog believer in the policy of growing wheat.  I for my part am quite prepared to accept the testimony of Deputy Belton as against that of Deputy O'Sullivan or any other member of the Opposition on the question of tariffs or of increased tillage.  He knows at least what he is talking about, which is one of the reasons why I suppose they took care to eject him from their Party.</P>
    <P>On the question of stock, after all, is it necessary to have an &ldquo;all-stock&rdquo; policy for this country?  Is it not necessary that stock should have its proper proportion with the rotation of tillage in the agricultural economy of this country?  It has a place undoubtedly, but need Ireland be studded with stock?  Deputy O'Sullivan used a very sinister phrase&mdash;and I may say that Deputy O'Sullivan and other members of the Opposition are very fond of using that adjective &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; and applying it to the motive and the alleged machinations of the Government. Deputy O'Sullivan was singularly unhappy in one phrase which he used in his long and platitudinous oration.  He referred to the accumulation of wealth in this country for several years past, and he dwelt long <Col N="1787" /> and lovingly on the advantages of that accumulated wealth, due, I suppose, to the existence of cattle and everything connected with cattle.  Deputy O'Sullivan should have remembered the famous couplet of a very famous Irishman:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it cannot be gainsaid that the history of Ireland before the advent of the present Parliament was one of desolation owing to the exaggerated importance of stock.  It can hardly be denied that stock has a place in the agricultural economy of this country, but that place should not be unduly magnified.  On the one hand, the present Government has brought about increased tillage by providing subsidies and tariffs and on the other has ensured that the country shall not be overburdened with an undue prevalence of stock.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan pleaded petulantly, or rather commented sarcastically, on the export of cattle to Germany, and on the inadequacy of the German and Spanish markets as a substitute for the British market. I do not think anybody said that they would be a full substitute for the British market or that they are an adequate substitute, but at least they are something worth having.  Following the policy of not putting all our eggs in one basket, I do not see what is wrong in opening up these other markets, and in developing them as far as possible.  After all Deputy O'Sullivan should be the last to complain of opening up a market in Germany as Deputy O'Sullivan resembles his British prototype, Haldane, not necessarily in ability, but in the fact that his spiritual home is in Germany.  Deputy O'Sullivan's objections seemed to be concerned less with his allegations that Ministers or Deputies here are mishandling these matters than with the fact that we exist, certainly with the fact that Ministers exist and occupy their present positions at all.  His <Col N="1788" /> objections seem to be to the fact that they have the temerity to occupy the seats of the mighty which Deputy O'Sullivan and his colleagues at one stage of their career occupied.  That is the whole head and front of the Deputy's attack on this side.</P>
    <P>The economic war has been discussed <i>ad lib.</i> and has formed the stock-in-trade for the orators of the Opposition for the last four years.  I do not hesitate to prophesy that it will furnish the stock-in-trade of the same Opposition for the next six years. I seldom rise to speak in this House; it may be because of my inability to cope with the oratorical efforts of the Opposition, but I do suggest that in all this oratory about the economic war there is not a thing which could not be compressed into a speech of 20 minutes' duration.  Their arguments have been repeated over and over again with a venom and with a personal rancour that we would regard as astonishing coming from an opposition Party in any other Parliament in the world.  If this is a war, as it is,&mdash;it may not be a spectacular war; I do not say it is&mdash;it is a strange thing that we cannot show a united front against the common enemy. Enemy may be a grandiloquent term but that the enemy is there no one can deny.  England is alien to us in a thousand ways.  It must be regarded as our antithesis economically, culturally, and religiously, and it is a strange thing that the state of affairs which obtains in every country which has a foreign enemy cannot obtain here.  I say advisedly, that if the Opposition for the last four years had been less virulent in their attacks and less open-mouthed in their allegations and in suggesting ways in which this Party could be attacked, the British would not be put into the position of saying &ldquo;Leave them alone, let them attack and eat each other like Kilkenny cats.&rdquo;  That has been their traditional diplomacy in dealing with this and other countries for years. The Opposition Deputies by indulging in these virulent personal attacks on Ministers are helping them to carry out that diplomacy in the case of the present economic dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> If this Central Fund Bill is going to be passed, if the Opposition do not propose to hold it up, then what is the meaning of all this pin-prodding? When pacts are being entered into and negotiations are being carried out which tend, in some way, to alleviate the present conditions of distress in various parts of the country, the Opposition are not satisfied.  They tell us that the Government are not doing their best to remedy matters.  They speak of negotiating and then, if negotiations are not successful, it is necessarily our fault.  So far as settling the economic war is concerned, there are two ways of doing that; one is by way of complete surrender and the other is by way of negotiation. Who is to say that the Government have not done their best?  If failure has accrued out of whatever negotiations have taken place, who is to say that it is the Government's fault? Would it not be the duty of a patriotic Opposition at least to assume that the other side are at fault, whether they are or not?  Should not a patriotic Opposition assume that the other side are in the wrong?  Unfortunately, the members of the Opposition think more of having a week-end display in the provincial press, and letting their constituents know they were doing something, and they concentrate all their endeavours on prodding the Government for all they are worth.</P>
    <P>I am not a politician in any sense of the word and I speak very seldom in this House, but I cannot let this occasion pass without saying that the Opposition, on this occasion, have done a mean thing and a low thing, a thing that would not obtain in any other country.  We are fighting a battle, and I can assure the House that we are going to get there in the end. The Opposition in this case have adopted a very unworthy attitude. They are willing to wound, but are yet afraid to strike.  They suggest amendments which they hesitate to support in the Division Lobbies.  They have lost no opportunity of criticising the Government and they have taken up a stand which is unworthy of any Opposition. This country is not in a normal state.  If it were the Opposition would be normal.  We are engaged in a <Col N="1790" /> highly important struggle, but there are many people in this country who do not want to realise that; they prefer to shut their eyes.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a question of tariffs and subsidies and the economic war, I think Deputy Belton and myself find ourselves on sure ground.  Suppose we were to remove the tariffs, what would be the position?  If we took the tariffs off we would let our market be flooded with English flour, bacon, and everything else.  Why, the position is unthinkable, and yet there are some members of the Opposition who would recommend adopting that course. There are all sorts of complaints about tariffs and subsidies and bounties.  Do these things not obtain in other countries?  Have not many other countries their systems of tariffs and subsidies?  Some may consider it folly, but if so, we are in very good company, because there is a ring of tariffs around almost every country in the world.  Of late years the tariff question has assumed immense dimensions, and if we err in the matter of tariffs we are in good company.</P>
    <P>I trust the Opposition will not oppose the passage of this Bill.  To be quite candid, it will make very little difference whether they do or not.  I suggest there is always one effective answer.  In view of the ultimate fate which awaits you on this debate, just as on any other, I suggest it would be at least good manners to conduct your controversies with less acrimony and with less virulence than you do.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kehoe has certainly introduced an element of lightness into this debate that was hitherto lacking.  After listening to Deputy Kehoe, I have come to the conclusion that it is a tragedy for this country that he was not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in opposition.  If he were a member, I am quite certain, by virtue of the sermon which he has preached to the Dáil this evening, he would have prevented them bringing that note of acrimony and bitterness into debates which was so characteristic, and he would have prevented them misleading the country in the way they did prior to the elections in 1932 and 1933, by the <Col N="1791" /> number of promises which they made and which they knew perfectly well they could never hope to fulfil.  As long as they are in power in this country they can never fulfil those promises. It is amazing to me how Deputy Kehoe, who stated he is not a politician, ever became a member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;a Party of politicians.</P>

      <P>I think the first question we have to ask ourselves in discussing this Bill is whether the country can endure the expenditure proposed in the Vote on Account.  If we want an answer we have to go back to the speeches made by the members of the Government when they were in opposition. I do not think there was any Minister so eloquent on that subject as the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I would be inclined to give that Minister pride of place, and after him I would select, perhaps, the Minister for Finance.  Other Ministers, of course, were also eloquent on the subject. I remember an historic debate here when we were discussing a similar measure to the one under consideration to-day.  The members of the then Opposition Party, now the Government Party, one after another stated at that time that this country could not endure a Vote for supply services of more than £20,000,000.  To-day we are asked by the Minister for Finance of a Fianna Fáil Government to vote a sum of approximately £28,000,000 for identically the same purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently we were told by a very distinguished professor that the purchasing power of the agricultural community has decreased by £20,000,000 during recent years.  I forget the exact words, but that was the substance of it&mdash;that the purchasing power of the agricultural community has decreased by £20,000,000 since 1931.  If that is so, I ask the Government how do they consider that this country to-day is able to endure expenditure to the amount of £28,000,000 for the purposes of supply services alone, apart altogether from Central Fund services and other hidden taxation, the amount of which we know nothing about at the moment?  Surely there is not a Deputy <Col N="1792" /> on the Fianna Fáil Benches who does not know, if he speaks his mind quite truthfully and honestly, that the conditions in his constituency, especially amongst the farming community, have worsened considerably since the start of this so-called economic war?  If he speaks his mind truthfully, he will also state that the conditions amongst the trading community have also worsened since the beginning of the so-called economic war.</P>
    <P>We have merely to look at the rate position in the different counties to realise that conditions have worsened considerably.  Even the arrears of unpaid Land Commission annuities have increased very substantially as compared with 1931 and 1932.  As a matter of fact, there has been an abnormal increase since the present Government came into office.  All these facts show quite conclusively that this country cannot possibly endure expenditure on the scale proposed in this Vote on Account.  If, as the distinguished professor said, the purchasing power has decreased by £20,000,000 during the past few years&mdash;which statement, by the way, was not contradicted by any Government Minister or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure given by the professor was £20,000,000.  The Minister is not going to draw any red herrings across the trail.  If the purchasing power of the agricultural community has been reduced by £20,000,000 since 1931, is it not quite easy to envisage the effect it has on the industrial programme in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is engaged? If that £20,000,000 was in circulation amongst the traders, the agriculturists, the business people, the manufacturers and other sections of the community, would it not help enormously the industrial policy in which the Minister is engaged&mdash;would it not enhance enormously the prospects of the success of that industrial policy?  Would it not increase considerably the output of the different factories in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce takes so much pride?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday asked triumphantly: <Col N="1793" />&ldquo;What items in this Estimates can you reduce?  Can you reduce the Land Commission Estimate?  Can you reduce the Local Government Estimates?  Will you reduce the Estimates for Social Services?&rdquo; I hold, and I have always held, that the expenditure on public services in this country should be proportioned to the ability of the people to meet it.  Apart from what I conceive to be the whole fundamental weakness of Government policy, the position is aggravated&mdash;and aggravated considerably&mdash;by the fact that they are trying to put a policy into operation in a period of five years which normally should take 100 years.  The same thing can be said to be literally true of almost every other activity of the Government.  As the Minister for Finance yesterday mentioned the question of social services, I should like to ture on social services, I should like to deal just briefly with that matter. There is an enormous amount of money being spent on social services at the present time.  I admit that, under normal conditions and normal circumstances, those social services are necessary, but I further submit again that that expenditure on social services should also be proportioned to the ability of the people to meet it.  I also think that in existing conditions and circumstances the people of this country are not in a position to meet the enormous amount of money that is being spent on social services at the present time.  Public boards throughout this country are being forced by legislation, ministerial orders and otherwise, to embark on a series of schemes of social services, to such an extent that the expenditure on social services alone, as one item in the Government catalogue, has increased enormously during the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>I do hold that, whilst those schemes are necessary, there is no justification on the part of the Government for forcing public boards to go ahead with schemes when the people are not in a position to pay for those schemes. After all, if you are going to have a normal development in this country, if you are going to have a development policy in regard to social services, then it is only fair to the people of this <Col N="1794" /> country that that policy should be spread over a reasonable period of years, and that that policy and development should be put into operation in a normal way over a period of years.  It is unreasonable and unfair to interfere with the natural social and economic development of this country by a policy of that kind, involving as it does the expenditure of a very big sum of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister also told us with a certain amount of pride that the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture had been increased by 50 per cent.  I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied in his own mind that this country and especially the farmers of this country are getting value for that increased expenditure of 50 per cent.  The earning capacity of the farmers of this country has been reduced by anything from 15½ per cent. to 25½ per cent. since the Fianna Fáil Government came into power, and, mind you, those figures are very conservative.  Notwithstanding the fact that the earning capacity of the farming community has been so reduced, the expenditure on services that were ostensibly designed to benefit the farming community has increased, according to the Minister's own statement, by 50 per cent.  You have, by virtue of that policy, diverted <Col N="1795" /> the whole natural development of the agricultural economy of this country. You are trying, at enormous expense to this country, to graft on to our agricultural economy certain things and certain activities that are not indigenous, in a sense, to our agricultural economy.  If the expenditure on those schemes continues to increase at the rate at which it has increased during the last three or four years, what, I ask, is going to be the expenditure at the end of another two or three years, or&mdash;assuming that the present Government gets back to power&mdash;at the end of another six or seven or eight years?  If expenditure on the present scale is to be shouldered by the people of this country, surely it is the primary duty of the Government to provide them with the opportunity of making such a profit out of their industry as will meet this increased expenditure. Under existing conditions, the whole trend of Government policy is designed to lower their profits as compared with what they did make out of their industry in the days gone by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the cost-of-living figures.  He asked the Minister for Finance if something could not be done to check the increasing price of commodities.  As compared with Northern Ireland, there is a difference of some 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. in the price of almost every commodity which is used by the people of this country.  In the price of ordinary commodities, such as sugar, meal and other commodities of that character, there is a difference of approximately 30 per cent. to 50 per cent., and on top of that increased price we have still to pay a tariff to sell the produce of agriculture in exactly the same market as the farmers of Northern Ireland, and proportionately we have to bear in addition a very much higher expenditure on our public services in this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us on one occasion that &ldquo;the success of every industry is dependent very largely on the success of the plans that we devise for the restoration of prosperity in agriculture.&rdquo; By that, I assume, the Minister meant that the success of his industrial policy in this country depended <Col N="1796" /> entirely upon the success of agriculture. On the one hand we have a distinguished University professor stating that during the last few years the purchasing power of the farming community has declined by £20,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government of which the Minister is a member has increased taxation during the same period by approximately £6,000,000.  It is something more than that, but we will agree on the figure of £6,000,000. In addition to that, the farmer has to pay a tariff on the produce he sends across to the only market in which he can sell his produce, even yet, at any sort of a reasonable profit.  In addition, the Minister for Agriculture has recently taken off the bounties, at least some portion of which, I think, did pass to the farmer, although it is very difficult to say exactly what amount of the bounties did pass to the farmer.  However, he has to bear all these handicaps, and yet he has to compete against the farmers in Northern Ireland and in England who are buying the raw materials of their industry at 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. below what the farmers in this country have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On yesterday the Minister for Finance boasted of the fact that they had increased expenditure as compared with 1931 by £6,000,000.  Deputy Kelly referred to the fact that Deputy MacDermot mentioned that the maximum agricultural rate of wages in England was 35/- a week.  I am not in a position to say whether that figure was right or not, but I do know this, and there is no question about it, that in England they are endeavouring to put the agricultural industry on what may be called an organised and scientific basis.  As a result of the efforts they are making in that direction, they have succeeded in increasing the wages of agricultural labourers in England.  It is only an indication of the extent to which we would also benefit if we had a free entry into the English market.  We would have benefited by the efforts that are being made to put the agricultural industry on a <Col N="1797" /> sounder basis.  Our workers would also benefit by whatever advantages the farmer would get as a result of this improvement in the agricultural industry.  I should be very glad to think that this figure of £27,000,000 does represent a reduction of £800,000 in the Estimates for this year as compared with last year, as was stated by the Minister for Finance.  However, I have not had an opportunity of examining the Book of Estimates for the very good reason that I did not got a copy of that book.  But from a cursory examination, I am of opinion that there is no such reduction as stated by the Minister.  If all the factors and figures were taken into account, we would find that there is an increase rather than a reduction.  If there were such a reduction in the Estimates it would be some consolation as an indication of what the taxation to be imposed by the Budget would be.  If that were the case there would be some hope of a revision of the taxation. Unfortunately, it will be found that this Estimate is no indication as to what the real expenditure is, and it is no indication of the taxation which this country will have to bear in the coming year when the Minister for Finance introduces his Budget.</P>

They have to come forward with a statement of their intentions and set out seriatim what it is they propose to do.  They may believe they have done that but I do not agree with them.  The majority of the people of the country do not know where Fine Gael stand.  Their own supporters do not know where they stand; even the members of the Fine Gael Party in this House do not know where they stand, for if they did they would surely tell us, particularly when taunted again and again with the absence of a policy and invited to enunciate such a policy if it does exist.  If they have a policy it is the best kept secret that I know of; it is the best kept secret that anybody living in this country ever heard of.  I do not believe that the Fine Gael Party is a secret society but if it had been a secret society the members of it could not have kept its objective as a secret so successfully from everybody.  At all events, the Party has kept the secret from everybody outside their own ranks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Old age pensions at 65 are going to involve an increase of £2,000,000 in the Vote.  Deputy Roddy says the country cannot afford to provide the money for the existing services. We thought that the policy of the Fine Gael Party was to increase the social services in that direction by about £2,000,000.  Surely that is inconsistency gone mad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Roddy is in disagreement with the policy of the Party opposite.  It may be that we may soon see him sitting on the same benches as Deputies MacDermot and Belton.  Perhaps the policy of the Party opposite to increase old age pensions by £2,000,000 has not been approved of by him.  Deputy Norton asked Deputy Roddy a very definite question.  Deputy Roddy was talking about the ability of the country to bear the cost of its social services and Deputy Norton asked him could the country have afforded the present social services when Deputy Roddy's Party was in office?  &ldquo;Of course&rdquo;, said Deputy Roddy.  But at that time <Col N="1800" /> Deputy Roddy's Party reduced the old age pensions though they could have well afforded to pay the old age pensions on the scale now provided. Nevertheless, they cut the old age pensions.  We have had in the past year many attempts on the part of the Party opposite to justify that particular reduction of the old age pensions.  At that time and afterwards they said it was necessary on the grounds of economy because the taxpayers could not afford to pay the full cost of the old age pensions at the higher rate.  But to-day we are told that the taxpayer could have afforded it, that the ability of the country to provide the money was unquestionable when Cumann na nGaedheal was in office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy went further and talked about the reduction in the purchasing power of the agricultural community. He is not the only speaker from the opposite benches who talked during the course of the discussion about the fall in agricultural prices. Agricultural prices have fallen.  We can get precise data as to the extent to which they have fallen.  There is a monthly index figure for agricultural prices published and, as it is published by my Department, I can vouch for the accuracy of it.  That figure shows that for a considerable time past there has been a decline in agricultural prices&mdash; a decline only arrested last year.  The tendency is now upward.  But from 1929&mdash;mark the year&mdash;to 1935 there was a continuous decline in agricultural prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy tells us that the purchasing power of the farming community has been reduced by £20,000,000.  I do not know what he means by the purchasing power of the farming community, but I take him to mean that the farming community got out of the sale of their products a profit in cash of some millions of pounds, and that the amount of that profit had been reduced by £20,000,000. I do not know if Deputies take the same meaning out of his words as I do, but when he spoke about the decline in purchasing power he obviously meant a decline in the cash profit which they get from the sale of their produce.  £20,000,000!  The total value <Col N="1801" /> of agricultural products sold from Irish farms in 1929, in Ireland or outside Ireland, in any part of the world where a market could be found, was £43,000,000.  Is it seriously contended that half of that total selling price represented a cash profit to the farmers? I do not think anybody will seriously contend it.  Under 25 per cent. of the selling price represented the cash profit, but if 25 per cent. of the selling price represented the cash profit, then the purchasing power of the farming community, according to Deputy Roddy's figure, must be about minus £10,000,000 of it.</P>
    <P>That is the figure for 1929.  Deputy Roddy was talking about the decline which took place since 1931.  £43,000,000 in 1929.  Here is one fact that Deputies opposite should get into their heads and keep there.  Between 1929 and 1931, over a period of two years, agricultural prices in this country fell by to a greater extent than between 1931 and 1935, a period of five years. There was a decline of 30 per cent. in agricultural prices in that period of two years, during which the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in office and when their policy for the benefit of agriculture was in full and complete operation.  That is all the farmers remember about the benefits which the Cumann na nGaedheal agricultural policy conferred upon them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for that £6 per head, and all the evils which the economic war, that they provoked, had brought upon the country, the decline in agricultural prices since 1931 has been less than the decline in the previous two years.  Again I refer Deputies to the excellent statistics which my Department make available free of charge for their information and edification. The agricultural price index for 1929 was 139.3.  In 1931 it had fallen to 110.1, a decline of 29.2 per cent.  In 1935 it was 83.6, a decline of 27 per cent.  There has been a decline, but the decline over the five years of the Fianna Fáil Government, with the economic war in full blast all during the period, was of less consequence to the Irish farmers than the <Col N="1802" /> two years of Cumann na nGaedheal Government between 1929 and 1931.</P>
      <P>Anyway, let us find out where they stand on this question in relation to agricultural prices.  The trouble with farmers is that the price they get for their produce is too low.  That is their sole trouble.  They are not getting sufficient in cash for the produce they have to sell.  We have endeavoured to help them by the reduction of the land annuities.  There is a provision in this Vote on Account for a substantial sum to relieve the rates on agricultural land.  There has been no falling off in the volume of agricultural production.  The total quantity of agricultural goods produced has not diminished.  The sole trouble with the agricultural community is that the prices of farm produce are too low. We have been trying to raise them.</P>
      <P>Every proposal we brought in here, designed to increase the price of agricultural produce, was opposed by the Party opposite, and when these measures were before the House we heard their usual moans about the effect upon the consumers and the undesirability of raising the cost of living. When we increased the price of pigs, who was it talked about the higher cost of our breakfast?  The <i>Irish Independent</i> came out a couple of weeks ago with a big headline announcing that the Government had failed again&mdash;it was going to increase the cost of the Irish breakfast.  Here again the Government were fixing a minimum price for pigs, so that pig producers would get a better return. The Party opposite are opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have them to-day bemoaning the rising cost of living.  What makes up the cost of living index figure? Food prices.  If the cost of living index figure is rising, it is due entirely to the fact that measures designed to increase the prices of farm produce are taking effect and that farm prices are rising.  Yet they want to raise farm prices and, at the same time, they try to get whatever little political capital they can out of the unpopularity of the rising cost of living.  In fact, the cost of living has not risen very much.  It was lower in 1935 than in 1931.  It was lower in 1935 than in any year in which Cumann na <Col N="1803" /> nGaedheal blessed the country by governing it.</P>
    <P>One would think that the value of money had been halved as the result of Fianna Fáil administration when one hears their speeches.  The cost of living is lower than at any time during which they were in office.  It is tending to go upward.  Because it is tending to go upward they are trying to get support amongst the people in the towns who are affected by the rise in the cost of living.  But when they go down to talk amongst the farmers they speak in a different tone.  They say that the prices of foodstuffs are not high enough and they criticise the Government because we are not making them higher.  They want to have it both ways.  Unfortunately for them, however, the people in the country can read in the newspapers the speeches they make in the towns, and <i>vice versa.</i>  There is a general consensus of opinion amongst all classes that they are only humbugs and that in these matters they are only humbugging&mdash;trying to get political support without a vestige of policy to justify that support.</P>
    <P>They have spoken also about unemployment. In fact, Deputy Cosgrave in his speech to-day, when dealing with unemployment, said: &ldquo;I say that the cure for unemployment&rdquo;&mdash;he did not say what the cure is, but he was referring to the cure&mdash;&ldquo;I say that the cure for unemployment, which has been aggravated to enormous proportions by Government policy, cannot be found while the economic dispute with Great Britain remains unsettled.&rdquo; What is the Cumann na nGaedheal policy on unemployment?  The economic dispute with Great Britain started in 1932.  Was there no unemployment before that?  If the cure for unemployment is merely to settle the economic dispute with Great Britain, what is the explanation for the growing unemployment in 1931?  There was no economic dispute then, but there was plenty of unemployment.  If Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues knew the cure for unemployment, then why did they not apply it?  If they had applied it, they might still be the Government.</P>

      <P>Surely the Party opposite have some responsibilities to the people who sent them here.  They have no responsibility to us, but they have come here at the request of certain misguided people who voted for them in order to take part here in the council of the representatives of the people.  We are here as a council. It is here that national problems have to be discussed and solved.  If they have any useful function to serve in this House, it is the function of giving us their contribution to the total fund of wisdom that can possibly be applied to the solution of these problems. They have a responsibility and they cannot shirk it by merely keeping their policy a secret, if they have a policy.  When they talk here about unemployment, they leave themselves open to the charge of hypocrisy&mdash;a mean kind of hypocrisy&mdash;unless they are prepared to back up their speeches with positive suggestions for the easement of the position.  They cannot get out of their responsibility for making such positive suggestions merely by such foolish statements as Deputy Cosgrave made to-day.  As a matter of fact, he went further than that.  He indicated a desire to see industrial development promoted in this country and, what is more, he quoted from some secret document, which, apparently, is an outline of the policy of Fine Gael, and from which this is an extract&mdash;I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the extract as I have not seen this secret document&mdash;but this is the quotation he gave:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be our policy to encourage the development of new and existing industries, suitable to our needs and resources, by every efficient means, giving existing tariffs every chance of justifying their continued imposition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can Deputies opposite remember one single occasion upon which I came in <Col N="1805" /> here with any Bill designed to promote industry in this country, or to promote the development of existing industries, on which Deputies opposite did not vote against it?  I shall not ask them to reply immediately.  I shall give them from now until this day week, during which they can search all the records of this House, and all the Volumes of Debates from the beginning of 1932 up to date, in order to see if they can find one solitary occasion on which the attitude of the Opposition was not one of opposition to the measures proposed.  I agree that they were not always unanimous in their opposition, and that individual Deputies sometimes took an attitude in regard to particular industries of non-opposition, if not exactly of cooperation. For instance, we had Deputy Morrissey coming in on one occasion, just on the ringing of the bell for a division.  I remember that he had got half way up the stairs before I had a chance of telling him that the vote related to the granting of protection to the aluminium factory which had been started in Nenagh. Deputy Morrissey did not vote against it on that occasion.  We must admit that.  No; he went down the stairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, it is only a matter of historical record.  I think, however, that it is a question of major policy that the solution of the unemployment problem is bound up with the question of industrial development. I believe that nobody can suggest any method of solving the unemployment problem in this country which does not involve the development of our resources to the fullest possible extent. Any solution of the problem of unemployment must involve that, but the Party opposite, who are now so anxious to bespeak themselves as friends of the unemployed, have on every occasion tried to sabotage and destroy and defeat the industrial policy of the Government.  &ldquo;Settle the economic war,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;and you have settled everything&rdquo;&mdash;as if there were no evils or abuses in this country to be settled when they were in office and when they were on terms of friendship <Col N="1806" /> with Great Britain and were paying £5,000,000 to Great Britain in order to cement that friendship.  Their cry now is: &ldquo;Settle the economic war, and you can settle all the issues in dispute, including Partition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a speech to-day about Partition, in which he said, in effect, that the major question before the Irish people was the solution of the problem of Partition. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the print.  I am sure that there are Deputies in this House who will not believe that Deputy Cosgrave had the audacity to speak about Partition until they read the report themselves. Who was the first Irishman in this country who ever assented to Partition? Deputy Cosgrave himself! Long before the Free State was established, long before there were ex-Republicans in charge of the administration of the affairs of three-fourths of Ireland, those who stood for the Irish people, those who represented the Irish people, even though they represented them in an alien Parliament, and even though their outlook in national affairs was limited and confined in every way by their affiliations, would not and did not assent to Partition, and some of them chose to go out of public life rather than assent to it; and when the Treaty was brought about in 1922 and accepted by a majority of Dáil Eireann at that time, those who accepted the Treaty used as an argument in favour of its acceptance the clauses that were stated to be designed to make an end of Partition.  It was not until 1925 that these clauses were deleted, and deleted with Deputy Cosgrave's full consent.</P>

Let us ask them what is their policy on the question of the restoration of the Oath, when they say that they stand for the implementing of the Treaty.

      <P>It will be settled as soon as the Party opposite get sufficient moral courage to admit responsibility for it, and to admit their error in instigating it.  We have them here denouncing the penal tariffs on our cattle.  Time and again I have pointed out that the idea of these penal tariffs was conceived and produced by the people opposite, and fully developed before being sent across to the British Government for adoption.  The suggestion was made to them by the Party <Col N="1808" /> opposite at every cross-roads in the country.  I hold, then, that they should at least keep silent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the consequences of the adoption of that suggestion are evident all around the country. However, it did not quite work out as you anticipated.  It did not quite work out as the British were led to believe by the Deputies opposite it would work out.  We will get at some time and at some stage a realistic conception of the position, and when we do, and when the Party opposite have sufficient patriotism to give the Government the assistance of their silence while negotiations are in progress, then we may make more progress.</P>
      <P>It was announced early this year, as I pointed out once before, that negotiations for a trade agreement were proceeding with Great Britain.  Deputies opposite can, perhaps, explain why Deputy Cosgrave chose that moment&mdash; some days following that announcement&mdash;to start his bombardment of manifestoes, statements, interviews and speeches, justifying the British case on the land annuities: justifying their claim for demanding the annuities at that time.  He had been silent about the land annuities for 12 months before. He has been silent about them since. It was only during those few weeks, when he knew that he could do the utmost damage to the interests of this country, that he opened up that campaign. All that we ask from the Deputies opposite is their silence.  We do not ask them to do any positive work for the good of the country.  We cannot expect that from them, but we do ask them to give us the co-operation of their silence when we are doing important work for the nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not agreed. Nobody in this country ever agreed to pay the land annuities except Deputy Cosgrave and Senator Blythe, and they kept the fact of their agreement secret for ten years.  The rise in the cost of living is agitating the Deputies opposite.  We are told that the price of a number of commodities here is higher than in Northern Ireland, and <Col N="1809" /> that consequently we are at a disadvantage as against Northern Ireland. I do not know if a separate index figure is kept for Northern Ireland. I assume that the cost-of living index figure for Great Britain includes Northern Ireland, but what is a fact which can be easily established is this: that the difference between the British cost-of-living index figure and ours in 1931 was greater than it is to-day.  Our cost-of-living index figure is moving closer to the British figure now than when the gentlemen opposite were managing the affairs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Deputies opposite to try and realise that they can serve a useful function here, but if they are to do so they must first of all get their facts right.  They have never done that despite all the free publications that I send them, all the masses of figures that I give them in these documents as well as in reply to Parliamentary questions and in my speeches in the Dáil. Despite all that, I say, they have still got their facts all wrong.  The first thing that I would advise them to do is to get their facts right.  When they have done that, let them consider them, and, having considered them, determine upon some policy for dealing with them.  When I say &ldquo;determine on some policy,&rdquo; I mean agree upon some policy.  I admit that there are individual Deputies in the Party opposite who have ideas as to how our circumstances should be dealt with, but their ideas are purely individual, and they have not succeeded in getting them accepted by their colleagues.  If the Deputies opposite are going to have a political Party they must have an agreed policy, and if they cannot get that they should not be masquerading as a Party.  Having got their facts, and having got a policy, the next thing they must do is to make their policy known.  Let the country see it.  It must be capable of standing the fire of whatever criticism is directed against it.  There is no secret about our policy: there never was.  We let the country know clearly and precisely where we stood, and that is why we are here. It is because nobody knows how the Deputies opposite stand on any matter, important or unimportant, that they are over there and they will remain <Col N="1810" /> over there.  If ever they want to come back to the Government Benches they should take my advice and get their facts right first and their policy clear. Let them get a policy that they can stand over: one that they will not have to run away from when it is criticised.  If it is a sound policy it will be improved by criticism.  If it is not sound, then it is just as well that it should disappear.</P>
    <P>On that basis, and that basis only, have the Deputies opposite any political future to look forward to.  I do not think that it would be a good thing for the country that they should get back into office.  I know that they will not agree with me on that, but if they want to get back, then they should take my advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that it should be passed.  It is going to be passed, because the Deputies opposite will not vote against it.  It is necessary that money should be provided to carry on the services of the State, to pay Deputies their allowances, and, generally, to carry on the machinery of government.  Money must be provided for all these purposes, and Deputies opposite could not possibly conceive the situation which would be created if this money were not provided. Therefore, they will vote for the Bill.  They have that much intelligence, and I congratulate them on it. In conclusion, my advice to them on the major question is to get a policy and to stick to it, and, so far as this Bill is concerned, to vote for it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when at the same time he was simply letting loose a lot of hares in this Assembly in order to avoid facing up to this Vote-on-Account. During the whole course of his speech there was not a single reference to the Vote-on-Account, and <Col N="1811" /> I congratulate the Minister on being able to speak so long, so eloquently and so sensibly, but never a word about the Vote-on-Account.  He was sensible in one reference he made, but I suppose I will be pulled up by the Chair if I develop it.  That was the reference he made to the old Irish Parliamentary Party.  Any time that there is a tribute paid to that Party it is worth listening to, even in this House.  When the White Paper was handed round I noticed on one side figures amounting to £27,000,000.  In this country, as in other countries, we have, since the post-war period, become accustomed to thinking in millions, even though we do not realise what millions represent.  I have been told that if a million men were placed in line along the road they would extend from Belfast to Dublin.  If that is multiplied by 27 we can get an idea of what 27,000,000 would represent.  In the Free State there are 3,000,000 people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash; and if we divide 3 into 27½ we get 9. Therefore, it costs £9 per head to run the country.  In all fairness to the taxpayers, and to wealth producers, whether they are labourers or business men, I ask is that economic administration; is that economic running of a small State?  This is an infant State barely out of its growing pains&mdash;if it is not getting more growing pains.  Is that amount of money a fair and an economic amount to run this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking he referred to the magnificent speeches that he and his colleagues had made up and down the country, east and west, at two general elections.  That was the period in which I entered politics.  We had the very reverse of these speeches to-night.  Originally a plan was placed before the people at the crossroads, in the streets, and almost on the hillsides, showing that the previous Administration was extravagant; that it was squandering the nation's money and frittering away the livelihood of those who had to make it.  They pointed out that if they got into office they would reduce expenditure in the Civil Service by millions of pounds, and also in the Government Departments.  We <Col N="1812" /> find no excuse being made to-day for not reducing expenditure by £2,000,000. When I listen to the humbug and to the insincerity of the Government Benches, and watch the smoke screens that are put up to hide the facts from the plain people, I get tired of having to spend even a few minutes in the House.  A few days ago we had a debate on the coal-cattle pact.  We then heard what a magnificent achievement that was, following the negotiations between the civil servants of the two countries.  To-day we have discussed the expenditure of millions of money, and the coal-cattle pact.  But the question was obscured from the beginning, and no one could find out whether it was on a pound for pound basis or a 50-50 basis.  All we know is that the country is facing a policy of drift.  There is no direct course, and no energetic pursuit of a particular policy.  There is a splashing to the right and to the left-about-turn.  They are playing two tunes on one whistle, with the result that there is no national outlook and no cohesion on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I listened to attacks on ex-President Cosgrave on the question of Partition. I do not think it is right to go back on the past.  We have heard bitter recriminations and personal remarks. If we had unity in the Free State we might do better afterwards in trying to bring about unity with our colleagues in the Six Counties.  This Vote-on-Account should be examined seriously by the Government Party.  I do not believe that it has been investigated by some Deputies.  They will simply walk through the Lobby when the Division bell rings and record their vote.  The machine will do the rest. We sometimes hear remarks about the Opposition Party consisting of people of no ability.  I suppose we may yet have to face the position that the Seanad had to face, and that a Bill to abolish the Opposition will be brought in, to end all opposition.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must agree with the statement recently made in Cavan by Deputy McGovern, that the Ministers were bluffers, and that <Col N="1813" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce was the greatest bluffer of all. Having heard the speeches that were delivered from the Government Benches to-night, I have to agree that Deputy McGovern was right.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, as Deputy Minch stated, did not refer to the Bill that is now under consideration. He talked of many things that happened from 1922 down, and mentioned Partition.  I protest against the Minister's references to Deputy Cosgrave in regard to Partition.  If the Minister had done in 1923 what he did in 1927, and if he had come into this House and had tried to build up this State, I venture to say there would be no Partition.  It ill becomes him to try to throw dirty water at a man who did his best to build up industries here, and also the State.  The Minister talked about the 300 industries that, I understand, he has established.  He said that he was very interested in the development of agriculture.  Knowing what is happening in the country, I can tell the Minister that he has killed that great industry which gave more employment than all the others.  He has killed agriculture while trying to develop the others.  Agriculture at the moment is dead.  It is true that a few are growing wheat and a few growing beet, but out of the 400,000 farmers in this State, how many acres will be required to produce our requirements in wheat and beet?  Is there any record of the wheat being grown in the wilds of Connemara, in the hills of Kerry, or in West Cork?  They can neither grow wheat nor beet there.  They may have a little peat, but, owing to the recent coal-cattle pact, the peat question is forgotten.  On going into Government offices now I do not see the peat fires. We have to burn English coal, and it is back in the fireplaces in these offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the speeches we heard from members of the Government Party, I am afraid that it is not possible to educate them as to the crimes and follies that they have committed against this State.  We had two days last week, and two days this week, devoted to efforts to try to explain to that Party the error of their ways. Still they come here with the cheek for which they are famous and ignore <Col N="1814" /> everything that was said.  They do not realise the demoralisation that they have brought on the State; they do not realise that they have made one vast soup-kitchen here with their doles and free beef.  They do not realise that at the present time this is a nation, practically, of pensioners, officials and idlers.  There is misery and starvation down the country.  I know farmers who have no salt to use with their potatoes.  They are faced with the situation that the flying squad and the bailiff are out to collect annuities that they have already paid to England.  Government spokesmen deny that England is getting the annuities.  The Minister for Agriculture stated last week that the farmers of this country were not paying the annuities to England.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said this evening that the annuities were not being paid to England, yet we had the Fianna Fáil Government sending civil servants over to England to negotiate a trade agreement, while a tariff is still being maintained against us.</P>
    <P>That is a clear and frank admission that the Government of Great Britain has a right to collect the annuities. Great Britain is getting the annuities, and the Fianna Fáil Government is also collecting annuities from the farmers.  Can that state of affairs continue?  It cannot.  If we look back at the promises made by Fianna Fáil before they got into office, when the public services were costing £20,000,000, and which they said they could reduce by £2,000,000, we find that they are costing £28,000,000 to-day.</P>
    <P>The wheat and beet schemes are a success in so far as they are a help to the areas that can grow them, but increase the acreage and where are you going to get a market?  If you increase the acreage of wheat to any appreciable extent and if you have a fairly good year, so that you reach the peak point of production, you will be producing all your requirements.  What are the countless farmers who cannot take advantage of the wheat schemes and who have to depend on the dairying and cattle industries to do so that they can meet their rates and annuities, clothe and educate their families and pay labour, where necessary?  Where <Col N="1815" /> are they going to get the money for that when the cattle exported to the only market available carry a tax of £4 5s. on their horns?  Where are these farmers going to get the money to support their families and pay their way in the State?  When the Government effected the coal-cattle pact, they should have taken their courage in their hands, done the big thing and stopped the humbug.  By doing that, the President would not have been going with his hat in his hand any more than he did by making the settlement he did make.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance dealt last night with the bacon industry.  He referred to a statement made by Deputies on this side that the bacon industry was in a parlous condition. So it was.  He cannot claim credit for having it in the position in which it is at the moment.  It is not his Marketing Board that caused that but the ordinary law of supply and demand. There is a scarcity because conditions were so bad in the country that people had practically gone out of pigs.  It does not pay a man to feed pigs, with the cost of production so high, and it is this law of supply and demand which caused the price to soar.  The Minister cannot claim credit for the present rise in price.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last night to a meeting of the Cork Farmers' Union Abattoir.  He quoted a speech by the chairman and other members referring to the turnover of the Cork Farmers' Union Abattoir but he conveniently left out the important speech.  He read the speech of the chairman, Mr. O'Sullivan, and the speeches of Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Halliden, but he did not give the speech of Mr. Lehane who commented that they were working on an overdraft of £1,100, had a loan of over £2,000 and that nearly three-quarters of their assets were made up of debts and stock-in-hands.  They had debts to the extent of £16,500, he said, or nearly three times the subscribed capital and that struck him as being a colossal sum.  He had heard that some of their shipments to America had been returned and he asked if that was so and, if so, the quantity and why.  The Minister should have read that statement <Col N="1816" /> when he read the others last night.  I may tell him that the Cork Farmers' Union Abattoir had a big turnover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the speech I wanted to read.  I have no objection to reading the statement of Mr. Foran.  I have given you your answer and I may tell you that it is no wonder that those who supplied pigs to the abattoir went out of pigs having regard to the Government's admixture scheme.  Owing to that scheme, they have to buy feeding stocks at practically twice their value.  Whole maize was selling recently at the Cork ports at from £4 10s. to £4 12s. 6d. per ton and the pig feeder in West Cork had to pay for the admixture about £7 a ton.  That was a difference of £3 a ton for a very inferior food.  That ran up the cost to the farmers of West Cork. If the farmers of Cork County or of Munster were allowed to blend and consume the cereals they grow, it would reduce the cost of production to such an extent that pig feeding would be profitable to them.  At present, they have to pay the cost of transport of barley or oats from Kildare, or, perhaps, counties further off, to Cork. They have to pay the cost of the rehandling and then they feed this inferior article to their stock.  The result is that the pig feeders of Cork have not made money on pig feeding. They are not in a position, as the result of pig feeding, to meet the demands of the flying squad or other demands.  It is right to protest against this burden of £6,000,000 which has been added to the Estimates.  It is, of course, only in keeping with Fianna Fáil policy through and through.  It is the policy of the rake's progress. I venture to prophesy that this policy will soon come to an end because the people in the country now realise what they did.  They were fooled once; they were fooled twice, but I can assure the Government that they are not going to be fooled a third time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing this Vote on Account, challenged this Party to state what Estimate <Col N="1817" /> they would reduce.  To make our flesh creep, he asked: &ldquo;Do you want to reduce the old age pensions?&rdquo; He also mentioned other items.  That is a very convenient way of getting out of expounding in greater detail&mdash;as the occasion would require&mdash;the policy of the Government.  Now I would like to refer to some of the matters that we were left in doubt about.  There is very grave doubt as to the capacity of the country to bear expenditure at the present rate, and while the present war is going on.  There has been, in both political and economic spheres, a spread of uncertainty, produced amongst the various sections of the people by the uncertain action of the Government, which leaves many people in doubt as to what policy the Government are pursuing, or in what way they themselves ought to shape their course of action.  I think that question, if it was gone into more fully, would go a long way towards explaining the sort of invisible or unexplainable growth in the figures of unemployment. Undoubtedly the unemployment figures are calculated on a somewhat different basis to what they were some time ago; but, making all due allowance for that, there is a large section of the community at present unemployed. I would like to suggest to the Government that one explanation of that phenomenon is that there is, through the whole community, a sense of uncertainty as to what way the policy of the Government is being shaped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Government is there a war on at the present time? If there is a war on, is there any battle?  I would like to assure nervous people that I am not suggesting that an Irish expeditionary military force should be despatched to the shores of the neighbouring country. But I am suggesting that if there is a war on, the logical conclusion would be to have either an engagement or a battle, and that the place that that ought to be fought would be round a table to see what terms could be obtained. I would, also, like to ask is this an economic war or a political war?  Or are the two questions so inextricably bound up that they cannot be separated?  Deputy Belton yesterday <Col N="1818" /> pointed out that we are paying far more, at the present time, than the £5,000,000 originally demanded by the British.  He said that a cheque should be written for that amount.  Well, certainly if a cheque could be written, without prejudice, it would save us in this country many millions.</P>
    <P>As an instance of the uncertainty that we seem to be living under at the present time, the President states that we ought to be free to leave the British Commonwealth of Nations, and if this country is prepared to go on to a republic, he is prepared to lead them. Now, whether this is to be a workers' republic, or some other brand of republic, does not really matter at the moment.  But I suggest that the President is putting the country under all the disadvantages of leaving the association in which we were, without having yet made up our minds, whether we want to leave it or whether we want to go on to a republic.  I suggest that that is a part of the question that this Party is anxious to get an answer to from the other side.  What favourable turn of events, if we are merely fighting a political issue, are we waiting for?  It is usual in the course of a war to try and manoeuvre the enemy into such a position that one side will lose far more than the other.  I would like the Government to give us some idea as to when they think some turn of events will leave us in a favourable opportunity for a settlement.  We are being importuned by the Government to fall in behind them in the demand for the abolition of the annuities.  Is that the problem? Can that be regarded as the only outstanding question?  I think the Government would say it is not so.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate Deputy Belton suggested that having given our coal and cement trade to England, it left England in a very favourable position, and that we might as well go on and settle the whole question. The President indignantly informed Deputy Belton that we were at present paying the annuities, or rather that England was collecting them from us under protest.  I would like to suggest to the Government that, under protest, they might make a settlement <Col N="1819" /> of the economic war, and that that would certainly leave this country in a very much more favourable position than we are in at the present time. We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Government have settled their policy far in advance, and that everybody knows what their policy is.  We had in the last few days a visit from a German delegation.  That delegation has just left our shores.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that no body of people interested in German goods here were summoned to meet those delegates.  The Government were unable, or unwilling, to give those people interested any advice as to what the trend of their negotiations was, or as to whether our people ought to deal with those Germans or have any association with them in commerce or not, and, in fact, the last agreement we have made with England destroys the last vestige of any excuse for retaining the emergency duties as at present constituted.  These emergency duties were brought in at a time when it was suggested that England might put additional duties on the products of this country, and when the Government wished, to be able to retaliate immediately.  While that was the Government's contention, and this Oireachtas gave the Government these powers, I would suggest that, under the guise of emergency duties, protective duties are being put on from time to time without debate or criticism by this Chamber.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand the Minister saying: &ldquo;Oh, well, of course, the reason we put those on is that when somebody starts, or is prepared to start, an industry we must immediately put on a protective duty.&rdquo;  I would, however, suggest that that is a two-edged sword, because it leaves the people in industry uncertain as to any period they can depend upon without interference with their sources of supply of raw material, or the market for their finished products.  Usually, in most countries, it is the policy for a budget to be brought in once a year. The Government more or less declare their policy for the year, and the <Col N="1820" /> people can shape their plans for the ensuing 12 months, but now we do not know, from day to day or hour to hour, what new tax will meet our eyes when we open the morning newspaper, and, shortly afterwards, we receive by post a synopsis of the duty which is going to be imposed.  I suggest to the Minister that this is one of those cases in which, while he may be increasing employment on the one hand, he is substantially reducing it on the other. In other words, he is losing on the swings what he is making on the roundabouts.</P>

      <P>This must be a great day in the life of Deputy Cosgrave when one sees in the evening papers the great flourish of trumpets with which he has been reinstated, if I may put it that way, as leader of the Opposition once more.  To-day the whole country is ringing, in so far as the Fine Gael Organisation can make it ring, with the cry that there is only one possible hope for this country, and that is to get Deputy Cosgrave back again as President of the Executive Council, and to instal in office again those who were here before we became the Government.  That is an extraordinary turnover for the entire organisation. Two years ago, when the Opposition was reorganising itself, if I may so term it, the principal motto they put on their banner was that Cosgraveism was dead; he would have to be got out of the way, because he was the leader who had led them to ruin and destruction through his weakness, his incompetence and his incapacity.</P>

      <P>With all respect, that is impossible.  Even in the space of two years, they have taken so many turns that I could not hope to trace them, and it is too unsavoury, into the bargain.  However, out of respect to you, Sir, I will not go further into that point.  I did at one time, at meetings through the country, say that I thought it a good job that Deputy Cosgrave was back as leader of the Opposition, because he was a skilful Parliamentarian, and was a man of education, and because I could not see that it was good that the Opposition in this House should be led by people who had not the qualifications he had.  That is why some of the things, which Deputy Cosgrave did when he was President of the Executive Council and which made our position here harder when we became the Government, make the matter all the more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few evenings ago when I saw the report of some of Deputy Cosgrave's remarks in the papers, I saw that he was willing to have a show-down with England, including the question of Partition.  I thought that he had come along and that much as I had condemned him in the past for the part he played with regard to Partition, it was an advance in a certain direction, even by Deputy Cosgrave. But let us pursue that a little further. We on this side have been blamed by several Deputies, and particularly by Deputy O'Donovan this evening, for not being in this House earlier and for not taking our places here as Deputies.  That taunt and that jibe has always been flung across at us but there is nobody going to run away from that at all.  We did not come into this Parliament when it was established. We did not come in for years afterwards, and there is nobody going to run away from the position we took up in the past.  If we could have succeeded by military efforts in defeating the Treaty, which is responsible for some of the things occuring to-day, we would have done so, but after being defeated from the military standpoint, we did what we considered was the next best thing. We adopted constitutional means, and <Col N="1822" /> many of us had to do very distasteful things, but we came in here as Deputies and, after a number of years, we became the Government.  We went to the people and talked to them at the cross roads, as we have been told. We promised that we would do certain things when we came in here as a Government, and, with all respect to the people who think otherwise, we have done some of those things.  We told them that the main aim we had in view was that, until we were in a position to say that the political issue could be solved and the national objective realised, we would go ahead with an economic programme and put the people in a position in which they would have a better standard of life than they had in the days of our predecessors.</P>

      <P>Certainly, most decidedly. There are £27,000,000 in the Estimates for this year.  There was the same figure in certain years when our predecessors were in office.  The difference between this Government and our predecessors is that we have done something with the money we collected and they did nothing.  We inherited a certain position here.  It was not at all a position that anyone who wished to make fast progress wanted to inherit.  I remember at the time of my colleague's by-election in County Kildare the candidate selected to oppose Deputy Harris was one of the men in this country who made the strongest protest against the position into which the agricultural community had been driven by the policy of the late Government.  We told the people, when we went to the cross-roads, if you like, that we would provide housing.  Did we do it?  We told them that we would have extensive schemes of drainage.  Did we do that?  We told them that we would supplement the policy of our predecessors as regards beet.  We have erected three more beet factories.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon used to say, on the opposite benches, that our scheme for the agricultural industry was too fantastic, that he would not be found dead, as he used to say, trying to carry out the schemes that this Government had put into operation.  The British people now are recognising that the sooner they get to the position when they can grow their own food and supply their own wants as far as possible, the better it will be for them.  Our whole policy is directed towards making this country self-supporting, so that it will not have to be dependent on the steamship or on the foreigner for its food or clothing. We have gone a long way towards doing that.

Take the boot and shoe industry.  I read the other morning that the quota for boots and shoes had been fixed at 600,000 pairs.  It used to be almost 3,000,000 pairs.  Have we kept our promises in regard to that industry? Notwithstanding that, at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis to-day, wherever it is being held, delegates are being told <Col N="1824" /> by Deputies from those benches that the country is being ruined and ruined rapidly.

      <P>I am pointing out the inconsistencies and the changes that have taken place inside the last two years in the attitude of Deputies opposite.  Deputy Cosgrave cannot save this country any more than anybody else, because his whole political history is against anybody of ordinary intelligence believing that.  When I hear farmer Deputies&mdash;and I say this to Deputies Holohan and Fagan&mdash; mention Deputy Cosgrave, I would ask: &ldquo;Will you put him one query&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have got alternative suggestions from the Opposition, and we are told that it is time the Government got out of office.  Naturally then, we ask the Opposition what would be their policy if Deputy Cosgrave got into office.  When Deputy Cosgrave comes along in this House and suddenly professes an interest in the people of the North of Ireland, naturally enough any native of that portion of the country is glad of the fact that anybody takes notice that this country has two Governments. The £27,000,000 that is being voted in these Estimates, plus the £11,000,000 that has been voted in Belfast, makes £38,000,000 for the Government of this island of ours.  Deputy Minch was quite right in stating that it took approximately £9 per head of the population of the country as a whole to govern this country.  That could have <Col N="1825" /> been avoided.  I am one of those people who believe that that could have been avoided, and I was astounded when I heard Deputy Cosgrave in this House express his willingness to get back again to the question of trying to remove partition, more particularly when I read in this House a quotation from the late Lord Birkenhead in which Deputy Cosgrave accepted the proposed boundary as a final solution of that end of the Irish question.  He seems to have got another bee in his bonnet now.  Deputy Cosgrave seems to have a very comprehensive alternative policy to that which the present Government has put into operation. The criticism that President de Valera gets for not settling the economic war will fade into insignificance as compared with the praise which will be bestowed on President Cosgrave for this constructive suggestion put forward by him in another place.  Here is the alternative we are going to be faced with.  Here is the alternative to the policy of the present Government to supply money for the carrying out of which these Estimates are introduced.</P>

      <P>Money is being asked in this Bill to finance the policy of the Government.  No money is being asked for in this measure to finance Deputy Cosgrave's policy.

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you came in, Sir, other Deputies suggested alternative policies to the policy which these Estimates are introduced to finance.  I was only dealing, in passing, with one of the items in these alternative policies.  That is, that they are going to do away with Partition and that this country should be possibly one big colony inside the Commonwealth. However, out of respect to the Chair, I shall leave that aspect of the matter. I take it that is going to be their policy in the future, and that it will not be one of barren criticism.  On everything that the Government attempted to do in the past, it did not matter what it meant to the ordinary citizen, <Col N="1826" /> it did not matter what employment it would create, or what town would reap the benefit, we got nothing but barren hostile criticism from the Opposition, who said that the Government can do nothing that is right.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell made one shrewd remark in dealing with the question as to whether the present economic war could be settled in regard to one item&mdash;the retention of the annuity moneys&mdash;apart from the political issue. I think he suggested that the Government should inform the House as to whether it was their intention to go all out for their original objective of the Republic.  I do not think anybody on this side of the House, either here or outside&mdash;I for one did not, and all my colleagues are of the same feeling&mdash; made any secret, good, bad or indifferent, as to what the final objective of the Party is.</P>

      <P>I am only saying, with all respect to Deputy Dockrell, that I do not believe that any Deputy on this side ever in the slightest deviated one iota from what we believe to be the big national objective, and that is the independence of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will come some day or other and if we have to advance sooner than perhaps it might be prudent to advance, I sincerely hope that none of the obstacles of the type we sometimes used to meet with in the past will confront us.  I sincerely hope that they will be out of the way and that we will have more unity amongst our people in making towards the big national objective. The whole life of this movement has been only 20 years, from 1916 to 1936.  We all recollect the strides that have been made during those 20 years. We all have a good idea, and so has Deputy Dockrell, as to where the main opposition came from when that great national advance was taking place.  I hope when we get once more to bedrock, when we think the time is ripe to go forward once more towards the <Col N="1827" /> national objective, that obstacles of the type that existed in the past will not bar our way.  I believe that with a united country, with our people thinking rightly on national lines, there will not be very much to keep us back from attaining that objective.</P>
    <P>Anybody who, 20 years ago, would have told the young men of the country that they would be here as legislators even in a Parliament for only 26 counties, would have been laughed at. There were people who made what was then looked upon as an extravagant claim, and yet that claim was realised. When we give utterance to hopes that we may get to our objective sooner than many people think, let us not be laughed at.  I believe it is the destiny of the country, and if we keep the big national objective in sight all the time, it will be the best method of retaining unity amongst the best elements in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Minch was in an entertaining mood to-night.  He talked about the speeches that we made all over the country and he referred to our promises. He said one thing, however, that I cannot subscribe to, and that was that the sooner this Government got out of office the better for the country as a whole.  That was merely a pious hope, but I expect that the wish was father to the thought.  Let me assure the Deputy that this Government is not going out of office as quickly as he or others think.  I really believe that if we went to the country to-morrow, with the policy we have here at the moment, we would be sent back into office again.  I think that shrewd politicians of the type of Deputy Brennan would hardly disagree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what alternative there is in the country to-day to the present Government.  We have had the examples of the local elections.  No sane man or woman would send back the Opposition.  They have not organised their ranks sufficiently to give any confidence to the people.  The Opposition talked about the last coal-cattle pact, described it as moonshine, and said it did no good. I do not believe that.  Why did they <Col N="1828" /> not have a division on it when it was going through the House?  Deputies opposite should remember that there is an economic war going on between 26 counties of this little country and a very wonderful Empire.  Deputy Dockrell this afternoon, in a nice plausible way, said that the President should write out a cheque and hand it over to England as a kind of final settlement for the annuities.  I remember reading the findings of British experts; I remember reading the reports of the Childers Commission and the Primrose Commission.  Let me take the words of the late Michael Collins, who said that from the time of the Union to the outbreak of the big war England fleeced this country to the tune of £400,000,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave is now very anxious about Partition, but he should recollect the period when the Six Counties were given away and, on top of all that, he wrote a substantial cheque for £50,000,000 of your hard-earned money for the British, and the only receipt he got was a Degree out of Cambridge University.  We are told that the policy that this Government is putting into operation, is standing over and wants this money for, is to be brought to a full stop.  We are told that we should go out of office and allow a better Government to take our place.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that that represents the true feeling in the country.  We have carried out our promises, irrespective of what may be said here.  We carried out our promises in regard to housing and drainage.  The record of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as regards industry and the work he has done for this country will live when he is a very old man, and will live long after he has passed away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never could understand why members of the old brigade over there, men who were in the Irish-Ireland movement, men who were part and parcel of the national movement in the days of Sinn Féin, should ever oppose the policy this Government is putting into operation.  It was Griffith himself, more than anybody else, who preached it.  In the old days we were anxious to give the home markets to the Irish farmers, to give the farmers first claim on the markets in our Irish towns, and <Col N="1829" /> to establish industry.  We have succeeded in doing so to a great extent. We wanted to establish industries in our towns, so that the artisans and workers would have the money to buy from their neighbours, the farmers, who brought their produce into the towns.  We wanted to keep out the foreigners.  From the moment this Government took office we have not had to make apologetic speeches, such as were made for the dumping of German oats into Cork, which took place under the Cosgrave régime.</P>
    <P>We are going ahead with our policy. This Bill will go through.  The social services have to be catered for.  The old age pensioners have been brought back to the standard at which they were before the late Government reduced pensions by 1/-.  The men who fought for their country, and who were crippled and broken in health by doing so, have got pensions, and we do not ask them what views they hold in politics.  The Government are inspired by the sole idea of doing what is right and just.  Above everything else, we are hopeful that, when this economic war is settled, we will have more people than we have now going forward towards the big national objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange that in every Estimate that has been submitted here since Fianna Fáil came into office, it is the same section of the people who are being asked to continue suffering.  If you look over the different Estimates you will be struck by that extraordinary fact.  I should like to make reference here to one particular Estimate, the Gaeltacht services.  I observe that the Estimate for Gaeltacht services has been considerably reduced.  If there is one Estimate that deserves increased expenditure, it is the Estimate for Gaeltacht services.  I think the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Galway, Deputy Mrs. Concannon, for instance, will agree with me that this is a type of service deserving of an increased grant.  We all know the position in the Gaeltacht.  We know the conditions under which the people there live.  There are some Deputies better informed about the conditions <Col N="1830" /> of the people in the Gaeltacht, and I think they will be with me in urging the Government to give more favourable consideration to the claims of the Gaeltacht.  It is the one service in which I expected to see the Estimate increased.</P>
      <P>As regards all the other Estimates, you will find that the Estimate for Agriculture has been decreased by about £300,000.  The Agricultural Grants have gone down from £900,000 to £370,000, and Forestry is down by £76,000.  Against that you will see that in the case of the Office of Public Works there is an increase of £14,000, and their estimate of expenditure for the coming year is down by £57,000. You will also see that the increase in the Office of Industry and Commerce is in or about £118,000.  I see no reason why there should be such an increase in the Office of Industry and Commerce and the Office of Public Works.  The people who were suffering during the whole time are asked to pay again in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have the bounties, and I am particularly interested in one industry. As the Minister for Agriculture is not here to-night I would ask the Minister for Finance to give an answer to what I am going to put to him.  In the year 1932-3 a small industry for the export of seed potatoes to foreign countries was established in the West of Ireland and in Donegal.  There was no help asked from the Government at that time.  The farmers and the merchants who were exporting the potatoes took the matter up with the Department officials, and I know that in County Galway in that particular year 136 tons were exported.  They were exported to different countries outside England.  What is the position to-day? You will find in the Estimates that on farm produce, including potatoes, there is going to be a saving of £450,000.  In 1935-6 we have already exported from County Galway 1,783 tons, and we expect that by the end of the season 2,000 tons will have been exported.  In 1932-3 we worked without a bounty.  In 1933-4 we got a bounty of 17/6 per ton.  We have exported those potatoes to Spain, Portugal, Algeria and the Canary Islands.  There <Col N="1831" /> is great trouble entailed because they have to be graded, and the farmers are under great expense in order to export the 2,000 tons of seed potatoes to those countries.  As I say, the Government had not to intervene in order to form that foreign market.</P>
    <P>I would say that about 50 per cent. of the potatoes grown on an acre of ground are fit for export.  They have got to go through a one-and-a-half inch ring or one-and-a-quarter inch ring as the case may be.  The rest of the potatoes are called ware potatoes and are used for home consumption or sent to the British market.  If the farmers of Galway are to be deprived of the bounty of £1 per ton on those potatoes it will be a great hardship.  2,000 tons for export purposes means about 400 acres.  There is another benefit; in a county where a great deal of beet is grown it serves as a crop for rotation purposes.  If the Minister makes inquiries he will find that a big amount of employment is given.  The price we are paid for the potatoes in Galway is £2 per ton plus £1 per ton bounty. That is the cheapest price at which potatoes can be grown.  The farmers are prepared to grow them at that price, but if the bounty is withdrawn&mdash; and it means only about £2,000 to give a bounty of £1 per ton&mdash;you will for all time be finished with the export market for seed potatoes.  I would ask the Minister to bring that matter to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible the answer will come that alcohol factories are to be established in this country.  What we call ware potatoes can be utilised in alcohol factories, and at the same time we could export the smaller potatoes, which have made a name in practically every country in the world.  They are every day being shipped from Galway, and I suppose the same thing applies to Donegal.  For the alcohol factories here you will have plenty of what we call ware potatoes, but for God's sake let us keep up the market we have made.  We have not asked the Government for much.  The farmers and the merchants in the county established those markets.  We would ask <Col N="1832" /> the Government to help us to keep that market, and the only way in which it can be kept is to give the people who have worked hard to establish that market £1 per ton bounty, which I believe would not amount to much more than £2,000 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only fair to the Minister that I should not occupy more than seven or eight minutes.  I think the Minister will himself admit that I am always fair in those matters.  I understand the Minister is to get from some time about 9.30 to reply; I will endeavour to say all I have to say in about five or six minutes.  I listened to the speech made by Deputy Donnelly here to-night, and really that is the urge which made me get up to speak at all.  Deputy Donnelly spoke about all the things that the Fianna Fáil Government had done, but he neglected to tell us about the things which Fianna Fáil promised and which they have not done.  What about the £2,000,000?  I do not want to go over the plan which has been so often spoken of here&mdash;the Fianna Fáil plan to reduce taxation by £2,000,000 when the Budget represented a sum of £21,000,000.  That would bring the national expenditure down to £19,000,000, instead of which we will be faced this year with a Budget possibly over £31,000,000.  That does not look like reducing national expenditure by £2,000,000.  We were to end partition.  Have we gone the right way about it?  I will leave that to Deputy Donnelly.  Have we solved unemployment? That was another of the promises made by Fianna Fáil. Not alone were we to bring back into industry every unemployed man in the country, but we would have to send for our kith and kin across the Channel and bring them all back, even down to the figure of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that there were two Governments in this country.  Deputy Donnelly, for whom I have a wonderful respect, is one of the greatest assets that the Fianna Fáil Party ever had, and judging by his speech to-night I do not wonder at their success in the country, because Deputy Donnelly <Col N="1833" /> can speak more clap-trap and flap-doodle in half-an-hour-than the whole of that Party put together. That apparently is the kind of thing which is spoken at the cross-roads and which has put Fianna Fáil into power. Deputy Donnelly again fell into error when he spoke about the promises made by Fianna Fáil.  They were published as promises, but according to one of his own Party they were not promises; they were merely statements.  That is on record; they were &ldquo;merely statements.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This may be a very old sort of joke, but I believe there are 70 odd reasons on the other side of this House why this partition should continue.  The Fianna Fáil Party has made no attempt to bring about what they promised to bring about&mdash;that is, the end of partition.  They have done nothing since they came into office here but pull down every institution of the State that had taken years to build up.  They have changed everything and they have attacked everything, many of the things that they should not have attacked.  They made no attempt to act as the men of the North might have expected, and the North are businessmen; they made no attempt even to act as the good Nationalists of the North would like them to act.  I know that there are Nationalists in the North who would not like to come into the Free State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have all these Fianna Fáil promises <Col N="1834" /> now crystallised into one phrase by Deputy Donnelly, who said, &ldquo;We gave utterance to hopes.&rdquo;  These hopes were shattered very early.  Again Deputy Donnelly tells us that we are fighting an Empire.  This is what I would refer to with all due respect to Deputy Donnelly and his Party as clap-trap and flap-doodle.  They are fighting an Empire.  Do they think the Empire is bothering one bit about us? Not one whit.  But this is the kind of thing one hears at the cross-roads&mdash;the eyes of the earth are on Ballymac-scattery to-day.  There was once a little paper published in West Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a matter of fact, the world does not think two hoots about us.  The sooner we get down to commonsense the better.  The Minister might at least give the farmers some little hope, and in his next Budget, at all events, after having almost crippled and paralysed the farmers of the country, he should give them some relief.  The Minister must recognise, as many of the Deputies on his side of the House recognise, that the farmer has been hit and badly hit. Farming is the main industry of the country and when the main industry is hit every industry must suffer.  The people in the cities and towns to-day are very nearly as badly off as the farmers.  I know farmers who before this economic war started were able to send their children to school properly dressed, but to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some of the farmers who may have got into the Fianna Fáil Party may be able to send their children to college, but I do <Col N="1835" /> not know of any such in Cork.  That is the position to which the agricultural industry has been reduced in Cork, where you have the best farmers in Ireland.  These men were not ranchers, as the Fianna Fáil Party would like to describe them.  The Fianna Fáil Party were fond of calling these people ranchers.  There may be a few such men in Meath, but not in Cork.  None of us are anxious to see developed in this country the kind of thing that was developing in Meath. I do not want to see the whole side of a country run by a man and dog, nor do those I represent.  But the pendulum has been swung the other way and men farming a small acreage have been threatened now that their land will be taken from them and split up.  Deputy Roddy can tell you of some of those cases and so can others in this House.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House long.  A definite challenge was made to us as to what was our policy with regard to the unemployment problem. Our policy has been given clearly to-day by the leader of our Party at our Ard-Fheis, and I have not the slightest doubt, if we were in office to-morrow that, with the money at the disposal of the Government, we would make a far better attempt at solving that problem than the Fianna Fáil Government has done.  Deputy Davin talked about wheat and beet.  Very well, let us talk about wheat.  I want to know now what the flour-milling industry <Col N="1836" /> costs this country at the present year? I was in Macroom a short time ago and saw an unfortunate labourer's wife paying 6d. or 8d. more than she should pay for a half stone of flour and that was because of this interference with the milling industry.  I should like to know now from the Minister for Finance what amount of employment does the flour-milling industry give? We pay 10/- to 12/- a sack more for our flour than is paid in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  We use about 3,000,000 sacks.  That means that on this commodity alone there is a tax on the people of £1,500,000.  I remember a few years ago reading the report of the Tariff Commission that went into the question of flour milling in the time of the late Government. They found that if all the flour needed in this country were milled in this country it would give employment only to 153 persons in addition to the people in temporary employment in the industry already.  Let us take it that it is giving employment to 300 hands.  Would it not be good business to give a pension of £3 a week for life to every man engaged in that industry and let them enjoy it, instead of the country paying £1,500,000 a year for this industry?</P>

    <P>We are struggling hard to solve unemployment.  What is happening to-day?  Never before had we so much unemployment.  Fianna Fáil went to the country and they said they would put 86,041 additional people into employment and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, said there would be so much employment opened up that we would have to bring our own people back from America.  What is the position to-day?  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the number of people who are leaving this country for England.  I think it is the duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to get these figures so that the people may see the situation that has been created by this emigration from this country.  I did not hear Deputy Davin speak about the conditions under which the people in industries are working.  I got up for one reason more than another and that is to read <Col N="1837" /> to the House the extraordinary speech that Judge O'Donnell made in Cork yesterday at a meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  Nobody can say that Judge O'Donnell is biased against the present Government, because they put him into his present position.  I will conclude my remarks by reading part of the speech for you.  I ask the Government to investigate what he states and find out the truth of the statements named.  The statement in the paper is headed:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;A Great Risk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say that he considered it an appalling state of affairs to see little girls on the streets at all hours of the night and it was a 100 to 1 chance that these girls would grow up as the Society wanted them to grow up.  There was a great risk for the future of such children, and if parents could realise the great danger to the girls' health and morals they would not allow their children to be out in the streets at night.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am told that young girls are employed here in your city at wages from 4/- to 5/- per week and hours ranging from 9 o'clock in the morning to 7 o'clock at night,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>said the judge.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And if our social system is such, I am afraid there is great danger for the safety of such girls.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Continuing, he said that he could not say if that was true but the statement had been made to him and he simply brought it before the Society.  Probably Deputy Norton knows something about it, because he said on more than one occasion something like this on the matter when he described some of these factories as &ldquo;baby farms and sweat shops.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to have these things investigated and to let the people of this country know the truth with regard to these industries.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary, who has just sat down, always speaks with great earnestness and energy, but very seldom says much to the point.  It is quite obvious that the work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has <Col N="1838" /> very little to do with the economic condition of the country.  There will always be parents who are not capable of rising to their responsibility, and there will always be reports such as that which the Deputy has read.  But it would be as fair and as equitable and as true to say that that report gives a real picture of the conditions in this country as it would be to describe the statements which were made by carrion crows on anti-Home Rule platforms in Great Britain as gospel truth, and the Deputy knows that.</P>

      <P>I have listened to many speeches in this debate and most of those which I have listened to have been dealt with very satisfactorily, I think, by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and by my colleague also on those benches, Deputy Donnelly.  There was, however, a statement made by Deputy Dockrell to which I think a little more attention should be given.  He said that there was in the whole community a sense of uncertainty owing to the way in which policy was being shaped. Deputy Dockrell is a man who usually does not raise these big issues of policy in a debate of this kind.  He generally devotes his attention to matters which seem to affect the trade and commerce of the country, and particularly on occasions raises the question of disabilities under which traders work.  Therefore, I was at somewhat of a loss to know what had moved Deputy Dockrell to raise an issue of this kind in this debate. Thinking over the matter, it seemed to me there was only one thing that would create that uncertainty in his mind, and that was a statement to which I had intended to refer last night in winding up the debate on the Vote on Account; a statement which has been made by a member of the Front Opposition Bench&mdash;I regret he is not here to-night&mdash;by a person who is obviously of great importance to the Party, because I think that he seconded the amendment which stood in Deputy Cosgrave's name to the <Col N="1839" /> motion asking the House to give a Second Reading to the Bill consequent upon the recent coal-cattle pact.  I refer to Deputy General Seán MacEoin. It is quite obvious, no matter what Party he belongs to, that Deputy General Seán MacEoin must be a man of great influence and of great force. He has qualities of character and of mind which would compel any Party and any legislative Assembly to give serious consideration to anything that he might say.  But last night he indicated that he was prepared almost to go the length of voting against the Vote on Account by reason of the fact that it made provision to cover expenditure on the defence forces for a certain period of the year.  He said that he felt he could scarcely agree to give us the Vote and, therefore, I take it he could scarcely assent to the general policy of his Party in regard to the Vote&mdash;the House will remember that there was no division on the Vote last night&mdash;because the House had been told by the President that we would use our forces to defend our shores in case of an enemy attack and to prevent them being used as a base for attack on Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make much difference.  I think that the general sense of what Deputy General Seán MacEoin said, whether it is expressed more exactly in the words I have used, or in the words which Deputy Belton has been good enough to give to the House, was the same&mdash; that he was not prepared to grant any Vote to defray expenditure upon the defence forces, because these defence forces would presumably be used to prevent this country being used as a base for attack upon a neighbouring country.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputy McGovern is feeling a little bit uncomfortable, because he sees the implication of that statement of Deputy General Seán MacEoin.  He is beginning, like Deputy Dockrell, to have that sense of uncertainly which is permeating the whole community as to the way in which policy is being shaped. Deputy McGovern, and people like Deputy Dockrell, and those for whom Deputy Dockrell speaks in this House, are relating that statement of Deputy General Seán MacEoin last night to the attitude which the Opposition took up in relation to the notable statement made by the President at Geneva. They are beginning to put two and two together.  They are beginning to ask themselves, &ldquo;Is this the policy of the Opposition, that we are to allow our shores to be used as a base for an attack on Great Britain?&rdquo; Is that the new orientation of the Opposition in this matter?  I remember that they objected very strongly to the stand that the President took at Geneva. Here we had last night, on the part of a Front Bench member of the Opposition, an expression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I hope I will be allowed to develop this thesis without further interruption.  I say that Deputy General MacEoin made that statement, speaking from the Front Opposition Bench, and we are entitled to know if that is the policy which Deputy General MacEoin would formulate if he were responsible for the government of this country, and is that the policy now of the Fine Gael Party?  I said, speaking last week on the coal-cattle pact, that it was clear from the attitude then taken up that the Opposition did not want a settlement of this dispute with Great Britain.  That seems to me to be quite clear.  It is the only deduction that can be made from what has happened in the last eight or nine months. There was first of all this ill-considered criticism of the President's attitude <Col N="1842" /> at Geneva and the equally factious opposition to the measures to give effect to the recent coal-cattle agreement; and then last night we had this statement by Deputy MacEoin.  Therefore, it is quite obvious that there is something to be said for my contention that the Opposition do not want a settlement of the economic dispute with Great Britain.  I said last night that the reason for that was quite obvious; that if there were a settlement of this issue&mdash;a settlement satisfactory to the people of this country &mdash;and if we did succeed in retaining here for the use and benefit of the Irish people the £5,000,000 that, by the secret agreement of 1923, have been paid over year after year to the British Government, and if we were able to employ these moneys, as they ought to be employed here, in improving our social services and making the Twenty-six Counties a brighter and happier place for the people of this country, the occupation of the Opposition would be gone and, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, the end of the economic war would be the end of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we shall be able to finish this dispute with victory, but the Opposition want us to end it with defeat.  I think that what I said last night is a plain and reasonable deduction to make from the policy which the Opposition have adopted in regard to this question of the dispute with Great Britain&mdash;that if the war were ended there would be no place in the public life of this country for the Opposition and for those who have occasioned and intensified the war&mdash;that their occupation, like Othello's, would be gone.  Deputy Mulcahy to-day was rather annoyed that I should have used that expression last night, and referred to other statements of mine on other occasions. Well, in regard to that, if anything I said last night offended Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;and I may have used many expressions on various occasions, just as Deputies on either side use expressions, for which they and I afterwards feel regret&mdash;I can only say that I did not mean to use that against him <Col N="1843" /> or any of his colleagues in any personal or offensive sense.  I was merely using the kind of speech which characterises the public and political life of this country, and that kind of talk is not any more confined to this side than to the other.</P>
      <P>I wish to advert to the reason we are asking the people to provide over £6,000,000 more than was provided in 1931-32, mainly for the social services. In this connection, Deputy Donnelly reminded the House that, a little more than a year ago, it was the common expression on the Fine Gael platforms that Cosgraveism was dead.  Now, at this moment, I think there is showing at one of the picture houses in this city&mdash;and I am sure Deputies will have noticed it&mdash;a picture entitled &ldquo;The Ghost Goes West.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave's policy died about 18 months ago, we understood, and there we had this ghost in the north talking about Partition. I do not often agree with what Deputy Anthony says, and though his speeches do not always edify me they often amuse me, but I think that Deputy Anthony made the most pertinent criticism in regard to the policy of the Opposition with reference to the Central Fund Bill.  He said that he did not agree with a lot of what Deputy Donnelly said in regard to Partition or with a lot of what Deputy Cosgrave said in regard to Partition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, Deputy. That means that you did not agree with the optimism they expressed.  I am prepared to admit that the Deputy knows better what he did say than I do, and if he says that he did not share <Col N="1844" /> their optimism, I accept it.  He said so because we had not got as good social services here as they had in the North and therefore there was no inducement to the people of the North to throw in their lot with us.  Deputy Cosgrave was pleading to-day very strongly for the establishment of some basis of agreement between the various political Parties in this country, and Deputy Anthony and I just now have established a basis for some kind of agreement.  I agree with Deputy Anthony that we have not as good social services here as they have up there, and as long as our social services are inferior, there is little inducement to those who differ in outlook with us on many matters, to throw in their lot with us.  I say, therefore, that the first and most practical step to take towards ending Partition is to bring the level of social services here up to that which prevails in the North.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to bring Deputy Belton into a debate on conditions in the North.  I ask the House to recollect the statement which I made when introducing the Vote on Account last night.  I pointed out that the large part of the £6,700,000, which we propose to spend over and above what was spent in 1931-32, is being spent on social services.  There is an additional £710,000 for old age pensions; £250,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions; over £100,000 more than was spent in 1931-32 for school buildings; for housing alone, there is being spent in grants to private persons and public authorities, to enable them to construct houses, £736,000, as compared with £212,000 spent in 1931-32; on the working of the Land Commission there is going to be spent this year £1,578,000 as compared with £578,000 spent in 1931-32, so that there is an excess expenditure of £1,000,000 on that Vote alone, for the breaking up of ranches, the dividing of land, <Col N="1845" /> and improving estates which are being divided amongst small farmers, and uneconomic land holders, and, in addition, over £500,000 is being provided in order to give effect to the reduction of the annuities which were due and payable under the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan may not have said so precisely, because that is one of the characteristics of the Opposition, that they will hint at things they are afraid to say.  However, Deputy Mulcahy said&mdash;and I think I got his words exactly&mdash;that practically all the additional items could be saved.  If I have not been able to establish complete agreement between Deputy Anthony and Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, at least I can establish complete agreement with Deputy Mulcahy.  Does the Deputy agree with Deputy Mulcahy that these additional items could be saved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some hope so.  I know that Deputy Anthony, in expressing disagreement with that Party in regard to these matters, is merely expressing agreement with the rest of the country, because I am perfectly certain that not even the followers of Fine Gael want expenditure to be saved on items like widows' and orphans' pensions or old age pensions, and on the provision we are making for housing, afforestation and unemployment assistance.  I think Deputy Anthony is perfectly safe in disagreeing with Deputy Mulcahy on that score.  I do not think the electorate will ever call him to account for that disagreement.  They may call him to account for disagreement with us on certain other things.  Not merely was it the opinion of Deputy Mulcahy that practically all these additional items could be saved, but it was also the opinion of his colleague on the Front Bench, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, because he said that a great deal of the expenditure was unreproductive &mdash; old age pensions, <Col N="1848" /> widows' and orphans' pensions, and expenditure on schools.  Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan was Minister for Education in a previous Government, and we all know that he is a very distinguished educationist, and holds a very important Chair at one of our University Colleges.  Are we to take it that it is the considered opinion of Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan that this increased expenditure upon building, enlarging and rebuilding national schools is unreproductive? Is that the frame of mind in which the Deputy viewed the educational problems and requirements of this country when he was Minister for Education?</P>

      <P>He said that this expenditure is not reproductive&mdash;that it does not produce work in the ordinary sense.  I am quite prepared to agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that expenditure upon housing may not produce work in the ordinary sense. He meant the sense in which it reproduces itself <i>ad infinitum.</i>  But this increased expenditure upon housing does produce less work for the doctor and less work for the police and, in that sense, it is productive of very great good to the community, because it enables our poorer people to live as decent citizens, to bring up their children under decent conditions and to provide them with comfortable homes. That is one of the items which Deputy Mulcahy, who was Minister for Local <Col N="1849" /> Government, and had responsibility for drawing up the housing programme under the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration, says could be saved.  Deputy Mulcahy wants the Government to abandon this housing scheme, to go back to the conditions under which the slums were rapidly spreading and increasing in County Dublin.  (<i>Interruption.</i>) Deputy Anthony was not here when the House heard Deputy Mulcahy on this question. Deputy Mulcahy was, I believe, expressing the opinion of the Opposition Party in regard to these problems. If they were in power they would save all this expenditure and go back to the amount devoted to this purpose in 1931-2.  The provision for housing in that year, which was the last year Deputy Mulcahy held office, was £212,000.</P>
