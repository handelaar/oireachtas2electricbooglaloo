      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why the claim of James Doherty, Porthall, Clonleigh, County Donegal, to unemployment assistance has not yet been determined by the Court of Referees to which it has been referred on appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was necessary to have certain enquiries made for the purpose of determining whether the applicant to whom the question refers satisfied the conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance.  On the completion of those enquiries the unemployment assistance officer instead of himself determining the application referred it to the Court of Referees in accordance with the provisions of Section 20 (2) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.  There was no appeal by the applicant himself.  The case was considered by the court on the 25th May and the court's recommendation that the application be refused on the ground that the applicant was not genuinely seeking employment (Section 15 (1) (b) ) has been accepted by the unemployment assistance officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the finding was based on the allegation that the man had been offered work, which was true, but that the work required him to travel seven miles every morning from his home to the scene of operations and seven miles back in the evening.  Is there any means of defining for the Court of <Col N="1350" /> Referees what this House intended by a reasonable offer of work?  Is the Minister prepared to say if he considers that an offer of work that involved a man travelling 14 miles each day on a bicycle is a reasonable offer of work, and such as to justify the finding that he was not genuinely seeking employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The matter is entirely one for the Court of Referees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I know that the Minister has no administrative check on the court in any decision that they come to.  But will the Minister define what he considers a reasonable offer of work?  Will he say that in his opinion an offer of work which involves a man travelling 14 miles per day in order to get that work is not a reasonable offer of work within the meaning of the Act?</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  But surely it is the Minister's duty to assist us in getting the purpose of legislation passed by this House carried into effect by introducing amending legislation. My contention is that findings such as in this case are not reproducing what this House intended.  If the Minister finds the facts are, as I have stated, will he consider introducing amending legislation for the purpose of defining what genuinely seeking employment means?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the total sums advanced by the British Government for the purpose of erecting labourers' cottages in the area of Saorstát Eireann, the sums payable annually prior to 1932 in respect of principal and interest on the moneys so advanced, and the total sum withheld to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass (for Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the Saorstát advances for labourers' cottages were made (a) by the Commissioners <Col N="1351" /> of Public Works from the Local Loans Fund and (b) by the Irish Land Commission from the Irish Land Purchase Fund.  The advances under (a) in respect of the whole of Ireland up to 31st March, 1922, totalled £3,473,529, of which advances amounting to £81,236 had been fully repaid at that date.  Of the balance, £3,126,404 was in respect of the area now included in Saorstát Eireann.  The amount advanced in respect of that area is the sum of this figure, £3,126,404, and the corresponding proportion of the repaid advances amounting to £81,236.  The Commissioners of Public Works inform me that it would take some time and trouble to apportion this latter figure as between the Saorstát and Northern Ireland.  Advances under (b) in respect of the area now included in Saorstát Eireann amounted to £3,795,985.  The sums paid by way of principal and interest in the year 1931-32 in respect of these advances were as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Delays varying from three months to nine months have occurred in 1935 between the dates on which the consignees in Spain made application to <Col N="1352" /> the Spanish Currency Bureau for authorisations to provide Saorstát currency for payments for eggs exported from Saorstát Eireann to Spain and the dates on which the necessary authorisations were issued.  As a result, however, of representations made to the Spanish Government, I understand that by the 30th April last the necessary authorisations were issued in respect of practically all the arrears.  Negotiations are at present taking place between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the Spanish Government with a view to regulating future trade relations between the two countries, and, in this connection, special importance is being attached to ensuring that satisfactory arrangements will be made in the matter of payments for goods exported from Saorstát Eireann to Spain.  The particular means by which this may be effected will depend upon the results of these discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he intends to take any steps to provide a market for herring which the fishermen on the west coast of Donegal are landing at present and the greater part of which has to be thrown back into the sea in the absence of a market therefor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been doing everything possible in the matter.  Although strongly pressed by our representatives, the German Government could not see their way to grant a quota for the import of cured herring of Saorstát origin, but inquiries are still being actively pursued in respect of other Continental markets with a view to finding an outlet, at reasonably remunerative prices, for that commodity. I cannot find any confirmation of the suggestion that the greater part (or, indeed, any considerable part) of the landings in West Donegal have had to be thrown back into the sea.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, the Bill is a simple measure.

    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> At the end of sub-section (2), line 21, to add the words, &ldquo;provided that in case of any inconsistency between that Act and this Act the provisions of this Act shall prevail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment stands on the Order Paper in order to clear up doubt.  I suppose it is an accepted principle that an Act of Parliament repeals every previous Act, in so far as it directly contradicts it.  Nevertheless, it is deemed expedient to add schedules to many Bills setting out the sections of other Acts which it is intended to repeal outright.  You sometimes apparently get cases in which there is an inconsistency between an early Act and the most recent Act, potential litigants are not quite clear as to their rights, and test cases ensue in order to establish which Act should prevail.  It is, therefore, thought advantageous that a specific note should be made in the first section of the Bill that when the Act becomes law, in the event of any inconsistency manifesting itself hereafter, the terms of this Act should prevail.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for this amendment.

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider putting in such parts of the 1909 Act as he wishes to have clearly made the law of this country at the present moment, so that the one Act will form the one code under which people dealing with insurance matters in this country will operate, and will be enabled to know clearly and precisely what their duties and their rights are, without having reference to a previous Act which was passed prior to this State being established?  Would it not be a simple matter for the Minister to select, with the aid of the Parliamentary draftsman, those provisions of the Act of 1909 which he wishes to operate, and put them in on <Col N="1357" /> Report or another stage, so as to have one Bill dealing with insurance law in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the matter consideration, but I am not quite sure what difficulties will arise in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the definition of the word &ldquo;policy,&rdquo; which may possibly cause some trouble and inconsistency?  I intend to raise the matter later on the definition clause, under Section 3. There might possibly be an inconsistency there; I mention that as one particular instance.  In the Act of 1909 there is no comprehensive definition of the word &ldquo;policy.&rdquo;  There are definitions dealing with certain kinds of policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would indicate his intention of seriously considering, between now and the Report Stage, the proposal to make this Bill a codification of insurance law in this country, then the necessity for my amendment would not arise.  If he does not do that, I think the case mentioned by Deputy Costello admirably illustrates the point I have in mind.  A word such as &ldquo;policy&rdquo; has been used in the 1909 Act, and has become the subject of statutory definition, or, what is more elusive, has probably become the subject of judicial definition, and we may find that what purports to be the statutory definition of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; in this Bill conflicts with the judicial definition of what the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; has meant heretofore, or the part definition of what &ldquo;policy&rdquo; was in the earlier Acts. Therefore, it would be highly desirable that whatever appears as a definition in this Act should prevail against any other definition that was existing. However, if the Minister indicates his desire to consider the matter at his leisure, I have no desire to press the amendment at this stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill undoubtedly represents the queerest piece of Nosey-Parker legislation that has ever been introduced into this Dáil.  There are practically dictatorial powers given to the Minister under the Bill, powers of a kind which should not be entrusted to any Department, and least of all&mdash;judging by the way in which the Department of Industry and Commerce has handled this measure from the beginning&mdash;to the Department of Industry and Commerce. It scarcely seems conceivable that any representative Government would bring into a legislative assembly very far-reaching and important legislation of this kind, without previously consulting those people who are most vitally concerned with the consequences of that legislation.  One would certainly believe that before embarking on such a very hazardous course the Minister would have consulted with the representatives of the various companies who are responsible for the insurance industry in this country. Probably, outside of agriculture, there is no industry in this country so important from the point of view of the amount of employment it gives, from the point of view of the very many and varied interests which it touches, and from the point of view of its importance to the nation and to the Government.  One would certainly have thought that the Minister, before introducing this Bill, would have taken those people into his confidence, or at all events would have consulted them. One could scarcely conceive the Minister bringing in a Bill, for example, dealing with banking in this country, a business which, in many respects, is not as important as the insurance business, and completely ignoring the joint stock banks and the people responsible for carrying on that <Col N="1359" /> particular business in the country. That has been the treatment given to those firms by the Minister in embarking on this particular piece of legislation. The Minister, apparently, in his career in this House, has adopted a technique of his own.</P>

      <P>The amendment we are considering is amendment No. 2, which purports to substitute the Minister for Finance for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It seems to the Chair that the Deputy is making a Second Reading speech on the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely justifying my reasons for asking to have the administration of this measure transferred to another Department.  As I say, the Minister in this, as in other respects, has shown that he has very little consideration for the industries with which he is tampering.  Apropos of the general attitude of the Minister towards industries, it just occurs to me that I read a letter in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of yesterday, in which the Minister is criticised for adopting exactly the same attitude towards another concern in this country.  I will just read a brief extract from the letter, which is signed &ldquo;J. Morgan, Director, A. Morgan &amp; Son, Ltd., Dublin&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It stands to sense that both our bureaucracy and our statesmen were completely without practical experience when the new policy of trade agreements, quotas and new markets was adopted, and one would have thought they would at least have moved cautiously and have claimed assistance in the new ventures of the experienced traders whose life-long trading arrangements they were about to shatter and destroy; but our experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce has been that it moves recklessly, blusteringly and arrogantly, and that it only asks for your views after it has `adopted a scheme' and at a time when it is too late to save itself, because of time limits prescribed by an Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are confronted with a similar <Col N="1360" /> situation.  A Bill was rushed through this Dáil.  First of all, I suppose about 18 months ago the headings of a Bill were introduced, and a First Reading was given to it.  We were expecting from day to day that a Second Reading would follow, but it dragged on from month to month, and the various companies were waiting; none of them was consulted about it.  Eventually a Second Reading was given to a different Bill to the one originally introduced. It was bad enough to have the companies generally treated in that cavalier fashion, and if that treatment had been universally imposed there might have been some palliation of the Minister's conduct, but unfortunately there appear to have been leakages. It is a well-known fact that about the time the first measure was introduced two important foreign insurance companies were about to leave this country, but, apparently, as a result of whatever information they received&mdash; reassuring information that nothing detrimental to their affairs would take place by way of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may object, but he cannot, on an amendment, go through the whole Bill, and the characteristics of the Bill, as a ground for the objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make a case for transferring the functions to another Department.  I am making a charge of favouritism in that particular case. <Col N="1361" /> I say that as a result of the information those companies received they built up palatial offices in Dublin. Apparently they have no fears of what the consequences to foreign companies in this country are going to be.  At the same time, an Irish company was in a similar position&mdash;anxious to improve its buildings and waiting from day to day, after purchasing its buildings, to know what would happen. That company had plans and specifications drawn up.  It had incurred considerable expense in getting rid of tenants and in various other ways. The thing dragged on from day to day, as I have said, and at the end of it all the Bill is introduced, and it is discovered that, after that measure becomes law, all the work of that company will be useless and that it will be at considerable loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, another thing has happened during the interval between the introduction of the original Bill and the Second Reading.  Another company was established in this State and, apparently, that company got such very pertinent information that it was able to draft its Articles of Association so as to fit exactly into the proposed Bill.  That company was floated for a certain amount of capital&mdash;perhaps £100,000 of subscribed capital&mdash; and £56,000 of that capital was subscribed by the Industrial Credit Corporation, and I assume that that was done with the cognizance and, probably, with the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At the same time, another £5,000 of the capital of that company was subscribed from Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company&mdash;a body that was organised specifically for providing funds for public bodies.  On the whole, this Bill has had a very shady origin and I do not think we are entitled to entrust the Department of Industry and Commerce with the carrying out of this particular business.  Apart altogether from that, I believe that the Department of the Minister for Finance is a more suitable Department for the carrying on of this business than the Department of Industry and Commerce, because insurance is a business that will take, in the nature of things, more of a financial colour than a commercial <Col N="1362" /> colour, and also because I believe that you will find in the Department of Finance officials more competent to deal with this matter of insurance than you will find in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Besides that, the tendency being, of late, to increase to an alarming extent the number of officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I feel that, if this matter is left in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, you will have almost as many officials appointed to deal with the administration of this measure as you will have officials losing their positions in the various insurance companies as a result of the passage of this measure. Those, Sir, are some of the arguments that I had in mind in putting down this amendment.</P>

Has the Minister any answer to the allegation made by Deputy Bourke that the Minister afforded secret information to a body which floated a company in this city with Articles of Association clearly designed to conform to a Bill <Col N="1363" /> which had not yet been completed, and has he any answer to the allegation that that body is still waiting for some further favours from the Minister? Surely the Minister has some reply to that?  Are those allegations well-founded or are they not well-founded? If they are well-founded, surely this House is entitled to some explanation of why it is that certain individuals are entitled to preferential information from the Minister's Department and that others are refused it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept or reject nothing, but I say that, when statements are made in a considered manner and with the moderation that Deputy Bourke has displayed, it is the duty of the Minister to inform this House whether these allegations are well-founded or not.  I say that the Minister, in view of such allegations, is bound to tell us whether he admits the impeachment brought against him or, if he does not admit it, that he is bound to disprove it.  Deputy Bourke has taken the correct steps to state what he has stated.  There are no other steps for him to take except in the presence of the Minister and on an occasion when the Minister has ample opportunity of dealing with the matter.  Does the Minister accept that?</P>

The only allegation that I can relate to any <Col N="1364" /> known fact is the allegation that an insurance company got a loan of £56,000 under the Trade Loans Acts. That is entirely incorrect.</P>

I had brought the Minister's attention to a certain matter, and the Minister's reply was to the effect that there was no truth in any of the allegations made by Deputy Dillon, and that he had no time to investigate stupid allegations of that kind.

      <P>In page 8, line 14, to add after the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; the words &ldquo;provided the Minister may on application of any trade union unregistered in Saorstát Eireann but which operated in Saorstát Eireann for a period of not less than ten years prior to October, 1935, extend to that trade union the exemption conferred on a registered trade union by this Act and the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is to safeguard the interests of some thousands of organised workers who belong to trade unions not at present registered here. These unions are amongst the oldest established in the country, covering various types of workers, such as railwaymen of all grades, woodworkers, printers, vehicle builders, engineers, plumbers, painters, furnishing-trade workers and others.  Added to the ordinary trade union benefits, such as strike pay, each of these unions gives friendly benefits such as death benefit, retirement benefit in certain cases, accident benefit in some instances, and in other cases small payments during illness.  In one union that I have in mind there is refunded to the member, by way of retirement allowance or bonus when he finally retires from his employment through old age or on pension, a certain proportion of his total contributions to the union.  If he dies whilst a member his widow or nearest relative receives a certain payment in proportion to his years of membership of the union.  If his wife predeceases him, half the same amount is paid to him.  If he should lose his life through accident during his employment or on his way to work, his dependents are entitled to a lump sum payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to preserve to members of this type this kind of benefit. If it is not adopted, then the vested interest which they have created, in some cases by very long membership ranging up to 35 or 40 years will be cancelled forthwith and a very grave and unjustifiable hardship inflicted upon a very deserving body of men. I am informed that the estimated value of the existing benefit to members of such unions would not be less than £1,000,000.  It should be stated that this is really not insurance in the ordinary sense of the word.  For instance, there is no such procedure as medical examination, or any actuarial processes which apply in the case of the insurance company.  The arrangement <Col N="1367" /> merely means that the union in its general desire to help its members as far as possible in circumstances in which they are not otherwise protected, pays out these benefits in addition to extending the protection which a trade union normally gives to its members.  In no case could the individual concerned get anything like the same benefits for the same contribution from any insurance company.  In fact, in the vast majority of cases there is no particular allocation whatever of either the contributions or the funds in respect of these benefits.  They are merely in the nature of a bonus, which the member is entitled to receive as a result of the general trade union contribution he pays.  They are, however, benefits which are very highly appreciated, and any attempt to interfere with the arrangement would be very keenly resented by those concerned and would result in very serious hardships to many thousands of deserving people and their dependents.</P>
    <P>Those who belong to trade unions whose headquarters happen to be in the Free State are left their present rights and privileges.  It is presumed that there is no desire to extend less favourable treatment to the other workers concerned who are covered by this amendment.  Moreover, the manner in which foreign insurance companies and their shareholders have been protected is surely the strongest possible argument for the acceptance of this amendment, because here no shareholders at all are involved but merely the insured.  The type of benefit they get is such as they would not normally get from any insurance company, because they would not subscribe for it.  It is in fact a bonus which some unions are able to pay after discharging their normal trade union liabilities to their members. They are in no way in competition with the insurance companies; therefore there is no question of the financial rights or interests of any other existing organisation.  I understand that the Executive of the Trade Union Congress has explained the meaning and the effect of this amendment very fully to the Minister and his officials, and I <Col N="1368" /> hope he will see his way to accept it, and thereby preserve the very valuable rights of existing members of trade unions not registered in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure as it stands exempts from its scope any business lawfully carried on by trade unions registered in the Saorstát under Acts relating to trade unions. The purpose of the Deputy's amendment, and of certain representations made by the Trade Union Congress, is to ensure that the Minister shall have discretion to grant exemption also to certain bodies which are acting as trade unions but are not registered as such under the Trade Union Acts.  I have given the matter consideration, and I think there is a good case to be made, on the lines advanced by the Deputy, for taking such power.  If the Deputy will hold his amendment over until the next stage, I will undertake to have tabled for consideration then an amendment which, I think, will have the same effect as his, that is an amendment designed to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to grant this exemption to unregistered trade unions in certain conditions and in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the purpose of the amendment is not clear.  The effect would be merely to put a couple of insurance companies which are registered here, but not owned here as the term is defined in the amendment, into the position of foreign companies. I am not quite sure what difference it would make.  The companies concerned, as far as I can see, would be entitled to get licences in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, and the only effect of the amendment would be to ensure that they would go about getting those licences in one manner rather than in another.  I think the amendment is unnecessary. The companies are registered here, and, as such, are treated in the Bill as Saorstát companies, but in so far as they carried on business in October, 1935, would be entitled under the provisions of the Bill to apply for a licence in any event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before line 18, to insert the words&mdash;the expression &ldquo;national company&rdquo; means an assurance company registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, and incorporated in Ireland not before the 24th day of April, 1916, and not later than the 7th day of January, 1921, and which for the purposes of this Act save as is otherwise provided shall be a &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann Company&rdquo; save that the provisions of paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) of section 12 and the words in paragraph (a) of sub-section (9) of section 12 beginning with the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; line 59 and ending with the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; line 61 do not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, and unless it is very seriously amended at this stage, or at a subsequent stage, it will really sound the death-knell of Irish insurance companies.  The Irish insurance companies have had a very difficult struggle, and are competing under a very heavy handicap with companies with much greater resources.  Though they went through their formative years at a time when restrictions on <Col N="1370" /> insurance were much less than they are at present, and when the premiums charged were much higher than they are to-day, the Irish insurance companies had one advantage, and only one advantage, in competing with foreign companies: that they could appeal to the patriotic sense of the Irish people and use the slogan, &ldquo;support Irish industry.&rdquo;  The fact that these companies were giving preference to Irish employees and had invested their money in Irish industries, and so far as possible assisted a native Government and the national outlook generally, made an appeal to the Irish people, and enabled the Irish companies to get business against the very keen competition of the stronger companies. By a system of licensing insurance companies, this Bill will to a great extent, if not completely, do away with that advantage.  Once a company is licensed to do business in this country, to all intents and purposes it becomes an Irish company, as no one is going to inquire very far back into his antecedents one way or another.  A person henceforward will insure with the company that can offer him the greatest advantages.  It is on that basis that insurance will probably be done in future.  To that extent Irish companies will suffer by this system of licensing.</P>
    <P>Then the partition proposals in this Bill by dividing up the Irish companies will destroy their identity.  Once the company has had to submit to this Solomon's judgment, it will be very hard to identify the original company or to know into which particular section these companies have been divided up and stirred about by the Minister's Irish stew of amalgamation.  It will be very hard to recognise the parts that will emerge without their original label.  Again, everybody who knows anything about business, will recognise that goodwill is a most important item in any business, perhaps even a more important item than capital itself.  It is quite a usual thing&mdash;and nobody should be more familiar with it than the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;to see a particular business house changing hands several times in one generation while the same name <Col N="1371" /> remains over the door all the time, for the simple reason that a certain goodwill attaches to that particular name. There is probably no business in the world that is more affected by the factor of goodwill than the insurance business, because it is a very widespread business and touches the interests of a great number of the public.  If a company carries out its business in a satisfactory manner and gives satisfaction to the people who are doing business with it, everyone who comes in contact with that company becomes an advertising agent for it.  In like manner, if a company does not give satisfaction to its clients, the people who are dissatisfied can do immense injury to that company; and the company that is endeavouring to give satisfaction, once it loses this factor of goodwill, is losing something that is extremely important for its successful working.  Under the partition proposals in this Bill that element of goodwill will be completely lost, and the Irish companies to that extent will be the losers, because the great English companies and the foreign companies will still retain their name.  Their goodwill will not be affected, whereas the Irish companies will lose whatever prestige they have built up during the last few years.</P>
    <P>There is another important point in these partition proposals, namely, that they are going proportionately to increase very greatly the overhead charges of the Irish companies.  Anyone who has any knowledge of the business of insurance companies realises that the great difficulty with which they are confronted is to reduce their expense rates.  You may start at one end of the problem and by increasing your business, which is a fairly easy thing to do, you do not mind the factor of expense, but by increasing your business in such a way that at the same time you increase your expenses proportionately, you are worse off in the end than at the beginning.  If you approach the problem from the other end by reducing expenses you may possibly find that you are reducing your income still more, so that you are still faced with the same dilemma.  In the case of companies that are doing both <Col N="1372" /> classes of business, their overhead charges are generally distributed between the two branches of the business and if you cut off one branch you will be faced with the position in which the other branch will find it very difficult to maintain its overhead charges.  A number of the officials in those companies are supported by salaries paid from both sides of the business.  In the same way a great number of offices can only be maintained by reason of the fact that a share of the business is fire and general, and another share of it is life.  If you cut off one or other of these classes of business it will mean that various local offices will have to be closed down and the business of that extent will be reduced.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect, which makes it also necessary for the Irish companies to escape from these partition proposals.  That is, the fact that every penal clause in this Bill, everything that makes insurance in this country more difficult than in foreign countries, militates to a greater extent against the native Irish insurance companies than against the foreign companies and, to that extent, is a fillip to the foreign companies. Most of the foreign companies do only a small portion of their business in this country, some of them only about 10 per cent.  They can afford to lose on their business in this country for a number of years if, by doing so, they know that the Irish company which is being subjected to the same conditions will be driven out of business.  The Irish companies, unlike the foreign companies, have no subsidiaries in other countries on which they can depend. If conditions are such that they cannot carry on a profitable business here, the Irish companies will be forced out of business while the foreign companies in competition with them would be prepared to lose a considerable sum of money in order to see that result brought about.</P>
    <P>There is another part of the Bill to which I have an amendment down alongside one by Deputy Dillon, which will enable all Saorstát companies that were composite companies before the Bill was introduced to continue as composite companies.  I do think <Col N="1373" /> that special consideration should be given to those companies that were established here in the period between the 1916 Proclamation and the acceptance of the Treaty in 1922, that is, during the period of the struggle for independence.  Most of these companies and societies&mdash;I have not included societies in my amendment&mdash; were started more from patriotic motives than from any other point of view.  They were not started solely as commercial concerns.  The money was subscribed in the same spirit by a number of people as that in which they subscribed to the National Loan and it was part of the Articles of Association of these companies that they should invest in Irish industries. At a time when there was very little encouragement or inducement to invest in Irish industries, when there was if anything a certain animus against these industries, it was a very good thing to have institutions that had fairly substantial funds and were prepared to support those industries. Very often from a financial point of view these concerns were not of a type to attract investors.  Some of them did carry on to success but a great many of them did not.  At all events, these industries, with a more or less Irish-Ireland outlook, got substantial support from these Irish companies. In the same way men who had participated in the national struggle and who were victimised, for one reason or another, found a refuge in these companies as officials, although frequently they might not have been as competent as men who would have been selected solely on grounds of ability or because of their knowledge of the insurance business.</P>
    <P>Again, these companies carried on under very considerable handicaps at times.  Their directors and high officials were frequently on the run or in jail for political offences.  Their head offices were frequently raided and their position was made exceptionally difficult.  However, the companies survived that difficult period but then they had to undergo a period equally as difficult, the period of the civil war.  Subsequent to that they were plunged into the world-wide depression which meant a big loss on <Col N="1374" /> investments.  Having survived all these difficulties, it is certainly a hardship that our own Government, a Government which has come into office pledged to carry out a programme of fostering and protecting native industries, should introduce a measure such as this.  It is certainly very strange that the death blow for Irish insurance companies should come from a Government organised on these particular lines.  The irony of the situation, as I see it, is that it is probably those companies which have done their best to avoid the irregularities which the Minister will probably adduce as a reason for insisting on this partition proposal, which have not utilised their life fund to bolster up their fire accident fund or vice versa, which have kept their accounts separate and tried to carry on in that way&mdash;these are the companies which, in my opinion, are going to suffer most.  Those companies which have kept their business in such a way that one side has been supported at the expense of another, to the extent of the other portion becoming completely atrophied, will lose nothing by having the diseased limb cut off.  That limb was no good to the company, at any rate, as regards the support of overhead charges.  Those companies which have tried to keep both limbs solid and sound, which have tried to carry on in a regular way, will find this major operation, as it was described by Deputy Cosgrave, a very serious matter.  Those companies have been in the habit of standing on both feet.  Both were sound and healthy feet and, if one is cut off, it will be very difficult for them to maintain the top-heavy body which will be left.</P>
    <P>No consideration is shown in any portion of this Bill for the shareholders of these companies.  Those who subscribed to the capital of those companies did so partly from patriotic motives but that is no reason why their capital should be confiscated in this way.  The people who subscribed to the National Loan did not expect to make anything out of it but, when a national Government was established, it immediately repaid that loan.  Some consideration should be shown to the <Col N="1375" /> people who invested in these companies. Their capital will, to all intents and purposes, be confiscated under this measure if it goes through as designed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment, as I read it, is merely to provide that Saorstát composite offices will be entitled to continue both life and non-life business.  The larger part of the Deputy's remarks seemed to me to be entirely irrelevant to the amendment.  It is quite true that a number of insurance companies were established here by people whose main motives were patriotic, that business was secured for them by the use of the slogan &ldquo;Support Irish industries&rdquo; and that that business was given to them for patriotic reasons irrespective of the merits of the policies which these companies were offering.  But I cannot quite see what that has to do with this amendment.  The slogan &ldquo;Support Irish industries&rdquo; is a good one.  The great majority of the people who use it are entitled to use it.  But if that slogan is used to secure business for a company which is insolvent, if it is used to induce people who are not in a position to get accurate information as to the financial position of a particular enterprise to put their savings into that enterprise, when it is certain they will lose them, it is a dishonest slogan and one that can be used to trap and defraud people. When we come to consider the provisions of this Bill&mdash;the first measure dealing with insurance introduced in this Dáil since its establishment&mdash;we have got to leave these considerations aside and consider the purely business matters, that must be our first concern. The job of this Dáil is not to make things particularly easy for the insurance companies.  Our primary task is to protect the people who have dealings with these companies and see that the average person, desiring for any reason to insure himself, gets a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the fundamental provisions of this Bill is the section which provides that a company which is carrying on life assurance business must not carry non-life classes of business as well.  That is a fundamental provision <Col N="1376" /> of the Bill.  It is, in our opinion, an essential safeguard for the people who are effecting life assurance.  It is a provision which should obviously appear in the first Bill dealing with insurance introduced here.  It is, in fact, the law in a number of European countries and, in our opinion, it should be the law here. During the course of the Second Reading debate, I stated the primary reasons which induced us to introduce this provision.  Force of circumstances would, I think, compel this Dáil to introduce that provision at some stage and, in our opinion, it is preferable to make the change now than later, when it might be much more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seeks to secure exemption from that general principle for companies which are &ldquo;national companies,&rdquo; as he defines them.  We do not think that that should be done. We think that the considerations which justified the introduction of the principle regarding the division between life and non-life classes of business apply with equal force to those national companies and the principle should also be made applicable to them.  The general principle as to effecting that division hardly needs any defence at this stage. As I said, it was discussed here on Second Reading and the Dáil approved of the Bill containing that provision. Since that is so, I think it would be entirely wrong, at this stage, to introduce an amendment which would exempt one class of insurance companies from its application, leaving it to apply to all the others: The amendment on that account cannot be accepted.  We think the Dáil should maintain the principle embodied in the Bill&mdash;that these two classes of business, which are distinct and separate and which are carried on on separate principles, should be carried on also by separate companies.  That is one of the main purposes of the Bill and it would be a fundamental mistake to exclude any class of company from its scope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that our duty is to see that the Irish insured person gets a square deal from any insurance company with whom he does his business, whether it is a German company, <Col N="1377" /> a British company, or an Irish company. However, I do not want this House to be left under the impression that the only people who have to be watched in this manner are Irish companies. I do not know the details of the affairs of all the Irish companies, but any Irish insurance companies of which I have knowledge are solvent companies and have no apology whatever to make to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for engaging in the business in which they are at present engaged.  They have carried on their general business, their ordinary branch business, and their industrial business in accordance with the strictest standards of rectitude that have ever been enforced in Great Britain or elsewhere.  There may be companies in this country of which the Minister has a more intimate knowledge than I have to which that would not apply.  The companies which I know of have set for themselves a higher standard than many foreign companies which are at present operating in this country.  We ought to get clear on that, because it is not right at this stage, or at any other stage of this debate, that a note should creep in that Irish companies are insolvent wrecks and that the only companies operating here deserving of the name of insurance companies are British or Continental companies because that is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with a pound of butter.  There are ways of suggesting it.  We are told that our concern is to watch over the interests of insured persons.  It certainly is, but let nobody draw from that the conclusion that anybody who transacts his business with Irish companies requires the vigilance of the State to protect him.  I want to make it perfectly clear that, with regard to British, German, and Irish companies, there are two classes, the solvent and the insolvent companies.  It is a gross injustice to the solvent companies that they should be lumped with the insolvent companies, whether they are in Ireland, in England or in Germany.  The Minister says he cannot entertain this <Col N="1378" /> amendment because the principle was discussed on the Second Stage, and the House having adopted the Bill on the Second Stage, he cannot see his way to remove this part of the Bill now. The Minister never, at any stage, gave any adequate reason whatever for divorcing the fire and general business from the ordinary life and industrial business.  What Deputy Bourke has said about increasing the overhead charges, and thus causing great embarrassment to Irish companies, is perfectly true.  It is the company which has submitted itself to the rules with the strictest propriety, by maintaining two separate funds, and maintaining both branches of its business in a strictly healthy condition, is to suffer most because of this change. The ones that have not been complying with the regulations laid down are going to suffer nothing from this new departure, because they abandoned that part of their business.  So that instead of hurting them this new departure will only relieve them from embarrassment.  I think I have heard at no stage of this Bill any adequate reason advanced for the course suggested by the Minister.  The Minister says that this division is of universal practice on the Continent of Europe. I am not in a position to confirm or to controvert that statement.  All I know is that it is not a universal practice in Great Britain, and I do not believe it is a universal practice in the United States of America.  These are the two countries in the world at present which have the most solvent insurance institutions. They are the two great countries whose insurance companies are receiving risks from the four corners of the earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance companies of most other countries of the world are exclusively national, except in so far as the German companies specialise in the business of reinsurance, so that that argument does not carry much weight.  If we go by the experience of the world we will find that the experience of the world is against the proposals in this Bill.  No adequate reason has ever been advanced for imposing this divorcement upon Irish <Col N="1379" /> companies or upon British companies in so far as they operate in the Saorstát. If this is persisted in I feel that we are going to do insurance business in this country a very great injury. Remember, if we do the insurance business as a whole serious injury, it is only the very strongest and biggest of the companies that are going to survive. The big companies are provided for in this Bill.  They will be the British companies and foreign companies that can afford to get hard knocks and survive them.  The solvent Irish companies, which have kept the claims of their policy-holders foremost before their minds, are the ones that are going to feel the hard knocks most. It is quite likely that some of them may go to the wall, and we will be told, when they do go to the wall, as we were told before on other matters, that you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs, and that these are a couple of eggs that have been broken in the course of carrying order and rectitude into the insurance business in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has defended the general principle.  Would he now explain its special application?  The section which provides for the granting of temporary licences for two kinds of insurance in the Saorstát says, in (b) (4) of Section 12, that the Minister may grant such licence if, but only if, he is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such licence is required by such company only pending the amalgamation of such company with one or more other Saorstát Eireann companies and the transfer of the said other assurance business of such company to some other Saorstát Eireann company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as I can understand that section, it provides that the Saorstát insurance company which is in the process of shedding its fire and general business under the provisions of this Bill must dispose of it to a Saorstát company.</P>
    <P>Now I come to sub-section (7) of this Section 12, dealing with British or other foreign companies operating in this country for a licence under this Bill to carry on both classes of business, and I find the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" />&ldquo;may grant such application if he is satisfied that such company complies with the conditions set forth in whichever of the said two next preceding sub-sections applies to such application, and that such licence is required by such company only pending the completion of arrangements for the transfer of the assurance business or businesses to which the application relates to some other assurance company or companies licensed under this Act to carry on such business or businesses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that it would appear that an Irish company finding itself under the obligation to dispose of its general business is confined to disposing of it to another Saorstát company.  Whereas the British company requiring to dispose of its business can dispose of it either to a Saorstát company or to a foreign company licensed under this Bill.  We can all foresee what is to happen. The British companies can transfer all their business to one company operating in that way, and they will probably do it by negotiations amongst themselves and do it on an agreed basis. The Saorstát companies cannot do that.  There are only five such companies in this country, and any one of them which gets the wink from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to stand out can effectively collar the general business of all four others, and that company can do that at its own price.  In many cases it may mean that solvent Irish companies will have to part with their fire and general business for virtually nothing at all.  I want to ask the Minister why it is that this differentiation is made between the methods whereby a Saorstát Eireann company and a foreign company may dispose of that part of their business of which this Bill requires them to divest themselves.</P>

      <P>The general question of dividing the insurance business has arisen on the definition section, and there are certain points that it is necessary to have cleared up.  The first Committee Stage was taken for the purpose of allowing the Minister to reprint the Bill and include certain Government amendments, and there are still certain points that are rather obscure.  I suggest that it will help the discussion materially if the points now raised by the Opposition are answered by the Minister, and if, having explained any blatant or patent obscurities, he adds that he wishes to postpone the remainder of the discussion on the point as clarified by his statement, then the Opposition will be very glad to accommodate him.  Perhaps he will explain now the difference between the method prescribed for the foreign company of disposing of one half of its business and the method prescribed for the Irish company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the definition of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; that appears in the Bill at the foot of page 7.  The definition as it stands is extremely comprehensive and would almost, if not quite, go to the point of saying that you can have a policy of assurance effected by word of mouth or even by conduct; in fact, the definition goes so far as to say that you can have such a policy provided the evidence is in some document.  It was my intention to put down an amendment to this definition, but, owing to the rush, it was not in time. I am drawing the Minister's attention to this matter now in order that he may have it examined.  In the Act of 1909 there is no comprehensive definition of the expression &ldquo;policy of assurance.&rdquo;  There are a number of <Col N="1382" /> definitions of various kinds of policies, such as policy on human life, and that as defined in Section 30, paragraph (a) of the 1909 Act, and in paragraph (b) there is also something else which is deemed to be included in the expression &ldquo;policy.&rdquo;  How do these two definitions fit in with the definition in this Bill?  That is one point.</P>
      <P>The second point is this, and it is the real fundamental point.  I submit to the Minister that the complete terms of the contract of assurance, whatever that may be, should be within the four walls of the document itself; that the document which constitutes a policy of assurance, whether on life or in connection with any other class of insurance should speak for itself, and both the policy-holder and the company issuing the policy should be in a position to determine their respective rights and liabilities by reference only to the document itself. The definition clause here would enable people to bring in acts or conduct or words spoken prior to the making of the alleged contract of assurance, or even subsequent to the contract, because the definition of &ldquo;policy&rdquo; provides that it will include a document which is evidence of a contract of assurance made verbally or arising from conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it a little difficult to understand the necessity for such a wide definition of &ldquo;policy&rdquo; there, and I submit that the Minister ought to adopt the definition of &ldquo;policy&rdquo; that is in the Stamp Act.  It is the definition used for revenue purposes.  It is a very simple definition and would include everything that ought to be included.  I cannot see any reason why acts of the parties not put into writing at the time of the making of a contract of assurance should in any way affect the interpretation of the contract or the rights and liabilities of the parties to the contract.  Neither do I see any reason why the conduct of the parties should be considered relevant in any way to a contract which ought to be entirely in writing.  Contracts of assurance for small or great sums are of importance to the parties concerned and it is of paramount importance that the policy-holder should know what his rights and liabilities <Col N="1383" /> are.  He can only know that by looking at what is in writing.  If the law ultimately is determined by this House to be that the conduct of the parties or something said or done prior to or subsequent to the making of the contract is taken into consideration then an element of grave uncertainty will be introduced.  Will the Minister give us the reason why these words were brought into the definition of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello's point, I take it, is mainly directed against the words &ldquo;or acts or words&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;policy&rdquo; includes a document which is evidence of a contract of assurance made verbally or arising from conduct. The point at which evidence other than a document comes in is in the second line, in the words &ldquo;or acts or words&rdquo;. I am not disposed to quarrel with the Deputy when he states that the definition is fairly wide.  It is wide.  There may be considerations which justify having a wide definition such as is here.  I am, however, in possession of an entirely open mind on the point. It is, perhaps, not unusual, if very rare, to have insurance effected by means of a conversation, verbally, even on occasion by a telephone communication. Whether we should have that verbal contract brought within the definition of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; here is a very doubtful point and I am disposed to think that on the balance it is better not to have it and to keep the evidence of the existence of the policy confined to a document, as the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps if the Deputy would leave the matter over until the next stage, and if he cares to introduce another amendment then, I will undertake to give consideration to whatever definition he suggests.  In the meantime I will myself be examining the possibility of contracting the definition.  I am anxious to have as little ambiguity as possible, and particularly in this section of the Bill where definitions are set out.  On that account my sympathies are entirely with his point of view to have the words &ldquo;or acts or <Col N="1384" /> words&rdquo; taken out.  I will be disposed, therefore, to consider sympathetically whatever amendment is suggested in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for his consideration of the points I have put forward.  I would like him, in regard to the matters I have mentioned, to consider, having regard to any advice that he may get from his legal advisers, whether it would be advisable to make an expressed prohibition against any contract of insurance unless it is in writing.  There is an old saying that it is better for the law to be certain than to be just.  Therefore, I think that the liabilities and rights of parties to any alleged contract of assurance should be evidenced by a document. It is much better for the parties to it that that should be so.  I will adopt the Minister's suggestion.</P>

      <P>At the end of the section to add the words &ldquo;but no regulation made by the Minister shall become operative unless and until it is laid before, and approved by, Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Section 8 is to reestablish, in regard to this Bill, the practice which is in process of being slowly whittled away.  Originally Parliament did not delegate its functions to make law to anybody, but with the growing complexity of legislation Parliament has delegated certain of its duties to administrative Departments of Government for the purpose of clearing up ambiguities which may have been left in an Act as it left the Oireachtas, or of providing for any unforeseen contingencies in accordance with the general principle underlying the Act of Parliament.  But Parliament <Col N="1385" /> has never gone so far as to divest itself of all authority in regard to such regulations.  Originally it required that such regulations would lie on the Table and be recommended by Ministers to the House within a given time, and that the House would then approve of them or reject them.  If the House approved of them, nothing done under them to the date that the House rejected them would be held subsequently to be invalid.  The next stage was that the bureaucratic machine imposed upon Parliament a scheme whereby when any such regulations were laid upon the Table they, within a given time, became law unless a resolution was moved by somebody in the Parliament to reject the regulations. We are at that stage now.  This Bill proposes to go a step further. Section 5 says that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed, and for the prescription of which no other provision is made by this Act.</P>
    <P>I want to reintroduce the principle that such regulations must lie upon the Table and get the approval of Parliament. As my amendment stands, I require the Minister to lay every regulation on the Table of the House, and to provide that the regulation will not become operative unless the House has adopted it.  That is to go back to the pure doctrine of parliamentary government. But if the Minister indicates his readiness to follow the existing practice, that is, to leave the regulations made under this Bill on the Table for 21 days and to allow them to become law in the event of no resolution being passed rejecting them, I would be prepared to accept that compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever case the Deputy may have had for moving similar amendments to other Bills, I think he has no case here.  The only matters to be prescribed under this Bill are matters of form and procedure. If the Deputy examines the Bill carefully he will find that there is nothing in the Bill to be prescribed which can in any sense be deemed to be a delegation of legislative powers from <Col N="1386" /> the Dáil to the Minister.  In Section 3 the actuary's qualifications are to be prescribed; in Section 11, the form and manner of applications for assurance licences and the fees payable; in Section 16, the form of assurance licence; in Section 19 the form and manner of the application for the alteration or revocation of assurance licences; in Section 63 the form of consent for a transfer from one company to another; in Section 67 the fee to be paid in reference to disputes.  These are all matters of administration only, and it is not necessary, I think, to adopt this procedure of having regulations laid before the Dáil, and, therefore, capable of being anulled here. There is nothing in this Bill which confers on the Minister any wide powers to act by regulation.  I am glad the Deputy has been making up the history of the tendency to delegate powers.  I presume that he has been reading the recently published report of the British Committee on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been reading the recently published letter of Messrs. Morgan on the question of bureaucracy, but I shall pass away from that. I will certainly challenge a division on this in order to avoid establishing a precedent.  If the Minister's remarks were well founded, and that it were true that nothing but purely administrative matters arise in connection with this section, I would still oppose it, because it is introduced here by the bureaucratic mind in order to establish a precedent on which it will be able to build a further edifice of bureaucracy, designed to take away from this House, still more and more, its authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can hear the Minister, or his successor, inspired by the bureaucracy behind them saying, in connection with some Bill, &ldquo;but there is a provision in the Insurance Bill giving the right to make regulations without any obligation of laying them on the Table; there is nothing new in this procedure.&rdquo;  I can imagine the then occupant of the Minister's office expressing amazement at some protests against a Bill giving general power to the bureaucrats to make law by regulation, because he will say &ldquo;we got that power in the Insurance <Col N="1387" /> Bill and no harmful results ensued.&rdquo; The Minister says that these are purely administrative matters.  There is the regulation prescribing the form of licence.  Does that include the conditions?</P>

      <P>The Minister now says that it cannot.  I can very well imagine that if the Minister wanted to include conditions, over and above the conditions envisaged by the Bill, they might be worked in within this power of prescribing the form.  But the Minister is entitled to prescribe the fees.  Let us suppose that the Minister wants to stop any additional licence being issued hereafter, is there anything to prevent him from prescribing a fee of £1,000,000?  That is not impossible.  I am sorry that there is no representative on the Labour Benches at the moment.  I know a trade union which prescribes a fee of £30 before you can be registered a member of it, not, I agree, in order to get the £30, but in order to prevent persons registering that it does not want admitted to that particular craft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose an insurance company wants to admit no one else into the business, why not prescribe a fee of £1,000,000 on any application for a licence?  That would make the insurance business a closed borough.  The Minister might prescribe by regulation anything he desires.  I do not know whether the process of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> is a good method of making the House understand the position.  There is no reason why the Minister should not prescribe that the actuary should be a man of red beard and white eyebrows. The Minister could prescribe certain professional qualifications which would point out the individual he wanted, and this House would have no particular right in the matter at all, because the Minister would have the right to make these orders without submitting them to the House.  The Minister might reply that the matter could be raised on his Estimate.  Yes, <Col N="1388" /> but that would be a year or nine months after the regulations came into force, and after the man with the red beard and the white eyebrows had got the job and had been doing what the Minister wanted him to do from the date of his appointment.</P>
    <P>I would indicate to the Minister another objection to this provision in this way.  The devil we know is bad enough but the devil we do not know might be much worse.  After all, other people who may be the Minister's successors will have to administer this Bill.  The Minister gives me no confidence whatever, but his successors might command less of my confidence. I strongly object to any such powers being put in the Minister's hands.  I urge upon the Minister that he should not make himself responsible for advising this House to abandon its right to pass judgment upon any regulation he makes affecting legislative rights of the citizens of this country. That is what he is asking us to do here.  He is not entitled to get powers of this kind.  I do not see why he should be entitled to supersede the powers of the Oireachtas.  I do not see why he should claim powers to make regulations in regard to anything and everything he likes.  The Minister is trying to get complete and irrevocable control over Irish insurance for all time.  That means State socialism, and the Minister is certainly moving in that direction.  He has tried to get these powers over flour, over factories, and over several industries.  In my opinion he is trying to get power by regulations over Irish insurance business and to control that business for all time.  I object to this most barefaced effort which the Minister is making to secure that power.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the amendment, and I do so on the general principle that Deputy Dillon has enunciated.  I do not intend at this stage to enter into the Government's tendency towards bureaucracy as evidenced in the last few years.  I hope at an early stage to give the House an opportunity of discussing these matters with appropriate procedure.  But my point of view is that the Bill is bad, as well on general principles as in its tendency towards bureaucracy.  I do not see why the ordinary procedure of laying regulations before the House cannot be adopted here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Section 11. The Minister apparently overlooked that section when he told the House that matters prescribed under Section 11 are merely matters of form.  These matters of form may involve people in criminal proceedings, and that certainly is not a matter of form.  Subsection (2) of Section 11 provides not merely that the Minister may prescribe the form and manner in which application for an insurance licence should be made, but should state the class or classes of assurance business which the assurance company making such application proposes to carry on, together with such other particulars as may be prescribed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, by these very regulations which, unless the Minister changes his position, will enable him to put a complete catechism <Col N="1390" /> to any person or company applying for such insurance licence.  He may ask any questions, relevant or irrelevant to the subject matter of the licence, and any replies that may possibly be misleading may be the subject matter of criminal proceedings. Anything which may lead to criminal proceedings is, in my submission, no formality.  These are very wide powers that the Minister proposes to take. He does not propose the form in which the application for a State licence must be made or the class of information that may be given on application. He proposes to give himself power to ask any questions, whether about the colour of the eyes of the employees or any other notion that the Minister may take into his head.  If any person refuses to give information as to the colour of the eyes, or gives any information that may be misleading, that person shall be guilty of a criminal offence.  As I say, anything that leads to criminal proceedings is no formality.  Deputy Dillon already drew attention to the fact that by subsection (7) the Minister may prescribe the fee to be charged, and that the due payment of such fee shall be a condition precedent to the entertainment of the application by the Minister.  The very fact that the Minister has power to prescribe the fee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Minister likes that kind of flattery or not, the fact remains that he has taken power to prescribe the fee without so far having given any indication whatever as to what the amount of the fee will be.  I propose to raise that matter when we come to Section 11.  I only <Col N="1391" /> touch on it now because it is relevant to this discussion.  We do not know what the amount of the fee is that may be prescribed.  It may be prohibitive and of such a nature that only very wealthy companies could afford to pay it, but it is a condition precedent to the granting of the licence.  I think the people of this country are entitled, through their representatives in this Dáil, to protest against such a position as that.  Once this section is passed there is no machinery in the Dáil for the introduction of a Private Bill by which the amount of the licence duty charged by the Minister could be reduced or effectively reduced.</P>
      <P>I submit that these are very cogent reasons why the normal and proper procedure, in our view, should be followed under this section and the regulations to be made by the Minister be placed on the Table of this House, where, if they require it, they may be criticised or, if necessary, set aside, but where, at least, they should be made public.  There is no obligation, as things stand at present, to make these regulations public.  They may be made and, like some regulations which have been made by Departments, nobody may know anything about them until they find themselves prosecuted under their provisions.</P>

I am quite certain that, despite the Deputy's lack of confidence in the integrity of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, he will have at least sufficient wisdom to see that he does not use these powers for the purpose of imposing upon any citizen an obligation which that citizen is unable to carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to press the matter.  As is well known, the Minister is a past master at the art of making vague, general statements. He has made one of them now&mdash;that Parliaments in all parts of the world from the time of Henry VIII did this sort of thing.  I put it to the Minister that he had not directed his attention to this fact when he told us <Col N="1393" /> that he did not wish the House to waste time in discussing matters of form.  Surely, if he does not accept Deputy Dillon's amendment, he ought at least to accept the suggestions contained in amendment No. 12&mdash;that these regulations come into force automatically unless they are set aside subsequently by a motion in the House.  Surely, that is a matter that ought to commend itself to the Minister, if his only reason for not wishing to concede what Deputy Dillon or the mover of the other amendment seeks is to ask the House not to waste time on matters of form. The House will not waste any time on matters of form.  If any of these regulations which are made seriously affect companies carrying on business, it ought to be within the right of a Deputy to direct public attention to these matters by discussion in the Dáil.  If this power is taken by the Minister, there will be no opportunity of directing public attention other than the method I have indicated.</P>

I submit that that is what is at the back of this whole proposal.  The Minister does not want to be bothered by Parliaments. He thinks it is waste of time to discuss matters of this kind in a democratic Parliament; that it ought to be done by regulation by intelligent bureaucrats such as he represents.  We take a different view.  We believe that you, Sir, have some useful function, that the Chair is valuable.  We believe that the institutions for which we stand are worth something.  The Minister does not share our view.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 propose the setting up of a Fund for the Compensation or Pension of assurance employees. Amendments Nos. 24 (d), 36 (f), 77, 78 and 80 also deal with the question of compensation.  As duplication does not make for orderly debate, I suggest that the wide principle of compensation might be decided on amendment No. 9.  The decision on amendment No. 9 should govern amendments Nos. 10, 11, 24 (d) and 36 (f).  Decisions might be taken on amendments Nos. 77, 78 and 80 without debate later on.

      <P>10.  Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Any sums standing to the credit of the Fund which are not required to meet current expenditure shall be transferred to the Minister for Finance and by him credited to an account (in this Act referred to as the Account) to be called and known as the Assurance Employees' Compensation and Pensions Investment Account.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any sums standing to the credit of the Account shall be invested and kept invested at the discretion of the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Fund in all or any of the following ways, that is to say, in the purchase of any stock, fund or security in which trustees are authorised by Section 18 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922) to invest trust funds, or in the purchase of any stocks, shares or securities the principal and interest of which are guaranteed under statutory authority by the Government of Saorstát Eireann, and any interest received from such investment shall be credited to the Account.</P>
      <P>(3)  If at any time the moneys in the Fund are insufficient to meet current liabilities the Minister for Finance shall out of the Account issue to the Fund such sums as may be required for the purpose of discharging such liabilities.</P>
      <P>11.  Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9.  Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 really form one amendment, and they would, if accepted, be Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Act.  The object of these amendments is to provide a fund which will be available for the payment of compensation to employees of Irish insurance companies who may become or who almost certainly will become redundant as a result of the Bill becoming law.  I hold that the setting up of a fund as provided for here is the only practical way of providing for the compensation of those employees. Amendment No. 9 provides for the moneys which will come into the fund, those moneys to come from licence fees to be paid by agents, and a contribution to the fund from the life income of ordinary industrial or foreign insurance companies.  The Minister has said, and it has been reiterated from all sides of the House, that the object of the Bill itself is to secure policy holders&mdash;to secure better benefits for them if possible, and at any rate to see that the investments they make when they take out policies will be safeguarded.  The only way by which you can increase the benefits that Irish companies will give is by a reduction of their overhead expenses &mdash;their ratio of expenses, as it is called.  The ratio of expenses of the Irish companies is naturally much higher at present than that of the English or foreign companies which are far longer in existence.  In the early stages of those foreign companies their ratio of expenses was probably at least as high as the present ratio of the Irish companies.  The decreasing of the ratio of expenses of the Irish companies will obviously necessitate a reduction in staffs.  There is no other way that I can see by which the ratio of expenses will be reduced, and it is desirable that it <Col N="1398" /> should be reduced by about 15 per cent. to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>At the present moment, I understand there are about 1,500 whole-time employees of the Irish companies. If the amalgamation proposed in this Bill is carried through, in about five or six years' time that number should be reduced to something between 500 and 600.  That will mean that something in the neighbourhood of 1,000 persons, who are now engaged in the insurance business in the employment of the Irish offices, will become redundant. The Bill makes no provision whatever for these employees.  There is no provision made for them by way of compensation or anything of that kind.  Now, the fund, as I have said, is made up from two sources.  I have no doubt that the agents of the companies will gladly pay a licence fee towards that fund, because of the benefits that will accrue to them from it.  Apart from making provision for compensation, Section 9 provides that this fund should also form a permanent superannuation fund for insurance employees.  I take it also that the contribution from the foreign companies&mdash;that is, 2½ per cent. of the gross premium income from life and industrial assurance&mdash;will be strongly opposed.  I think, however, when we are dealing with insurance here, that it would be just to give the Irish companies that measure of a handicap from their foreign competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that these foreign companies have been in existence for a long time and that their ratio of expenses, with huge permanent incomes, is considerably lower than that of the Irish companies, and I think that they could very well afford this 2½ per cent. contribution to these agents and insurance employees without in any way passing it on to the policy-holders.  As it is, with these companies there is a very great variation in the ratio of expenses.  For instance, for the year 1934, the ratio of expenses of the Prudential was 23.34; of the Pearl, 31.04; and of the Refuge, 34.68.  These are three of the biggest companies operating here, and that shows that there was a difference of 11 per cent. between two of these-companies <Col N="1399" /> in their ratio of expenses, and yet the benefits to the policy-holders were identical in all the cases.  I might say, that they are all identical in this, too, that, whereas these companies, operating in this country, pay no bonus to their policy-holders here, they do pay a bonus to their policy-holders in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The policy-holders in this country pay exactly in accordance with the same tables as the policy-holders across the Channel and in Northern Ireland, but these companies do not treat their Saorstát policy-holders as equitably as they treat their policy-holders elsewhere. I think that, in those circumstances, and especially in view of that differentiation in the manner in which they treat their Saorstát policy-holders, it would be quite legitimate to tax them to the extent of the 2½ per cent. proposed in this amendment of mine, or in a later amendment, so that they may make that contribution to this fund which will provide for compensation for those persons who will lose their employment if and when this measure becomes law.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch, evidently, is trying to do more than kill two birds with one stone with this series of amendments of his.  Evidently he is trying to kill a whole flock of birds, but I am not quite sure which particular bird he is most anxious to get.  He is proposing that we should set up a fund, the primary purpose of which is to provide pensions or compensation for employees of insurance companies, and he is proposing to constitute that fund by taxing the premium income of foreign companies and instituting a scheme for the registration of insurance agents.  If I may suggest a doubt concerning his main purpose, I do so because I think he is less interested in setting up the fund than in the manner of constituting it, and that the tax on the income of the foreign companies, or the institution of a register of agents, is probably the principal objective at which he is aiming. I do not think we should provide, in this Bill, a fund under State control for the payment of pensions to persons employed in the insurance industry, <Col N="1400" /> any more than we have any such fund for the payment of pensions to persons employed in the transport industry or any other industry in respect of which as good a case, if not a better case, could be made out for the inauguration of a pension scheme.  Neither do I think that we should provide in this Bill provisions for the compensation of any persons, employed by an insurance company, who may become disemployed in consequence of an amalgamation scheme approved by the Minister under Part V of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There may, or there may not, be an amalgamation scheme&mdash;I think there will be&mdash;but if so I think the question of the disposal of the staffs of the amalgamating companies should be considered then, and not now.  It may be considered preferable to deal with the problem of redundant staffs otherwise than by the payment of compensation in cash.  In any event, I do not think we should impose, as the Deputy suggests in another amendment, upon the amalgamating companies a statutory obligation to provide that compensation in cash, because of the nature of employment in the insurance industry and the difficulties that might arise in consequence. We have had this question of the institution of a register of agents considered here before, and representations have been made to me by parties interested in the institution of such a scheme.  These parties, however, in my opinion, have consistently refused to face up to the main difficulties that arise in that connection, and the principal objection to it is the difficulty which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, under any circumstances, would have in determining who should or should not be entitled to practise as an insurance agent.  Neither do I think should we have imposed by this Bill a tax on the premiums of foreign companies.  If there is any reason, other than an insurance reason, for that tax, then it should be imposed by a different kind of measure altogether.  There is no insurance reason for it in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were considered good policy to prevent the operation here of foreign <Col N="1401" /> insurance companies, the Bill would have so provided, but, having decided that it is not possible in present circumstances to prohibit foreign insurance companies from carrying on business here, I do not think we should create that position by roundabout methods; by the introduction in the Bill of provisions applying to foreign companies which would make it extremely improbable that they would, if not impossible for them to, carry on.  We have decided that it is desirable in present circumstances to allow foreign companies to continue to do insurance business here.  If that point of view is accepted by the Dáil, then I think the Dáil must logically accept the consequential view, that they should not be subject to any differential tax or restrictions which would impose obligations on them that did not apply to other persons engaged in insurance business, in consequence of which they might decide not to carry on, or which might so operate as to make it impossible for them to do so. I am, therefore, opposed to the Deputy's proposal on all three points. I do not think we should constitute such a fund, and even if we had a different attitude in this respect, and decided that such a fund should be created, I do not think it should be constituted by the methods which the Deputy suggests.  The setting up of an insurance agent register would be so difficult as to make it foolish to attempt it and probably in the circumstances arising if it were established we would have all sorts of allegations as to the manner in which the Minister exercised these powers which the Deputy proposes should be conferred upon him.  Certainly it would be impossible for the Minister to carry out the Deputy's proposal completely without very great difficulty indeed. Neither should we adopt the Deputy's suggestion of a tax of 2½ per cent. on the premiums of foreign companies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am in the position that I must resist the amendment.  May I say that in doing so I have given considerable attention to the redundancy in insurance employment which exists at the present time.  As I pointed out <Col N="1402" /> during the course of the Second Reading discussion, there are too many people trying to get employment in the insurance industry, and any improvement in the organisation of the industry is bound to result in certain redundancy of staff.  I do not think that that surplus staff need constitute an insoluble problem.  It would be a problem for a time, but would then disappear. There are various ways of dealing with that problem, but I do not think we should commit ourselves concerning it on this Bill in the manner the Deputy suggests by the payment of compensation in cash.  I think there are preferable ways of dealing with it, and that we can consider the matter more satisfactorily when proposals for amalgamation actually arise, and when the details are under consideration.  At that period, as I indicated in the past, it would be my intention that employees of the amalgamating company would be fairly dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to hear the Minister when he reiterates the fact that he and his Government are committed to the principle that foreign companies can carry on their business here without differentiation between them and Irish companies.  It is also interesting to know that he failed to appreciate the case put up on behalf of a register of agents.  I submit that has nothing to do with the series of amendments we are discussing, because while the Ceann Comhairle asked the House to consider the principle of compensation, the Minister carefully refrained, in any portion of his speech, from touching in any way on the principle of whether or not employees in an insurance company, whether British or foreign, should be compensated if they were deprived of their livelihood as a result of the operation of this Bill.  Personally, I am against the principle of a register of agents.  But I submit that has nothing to do with the principle of compensation, of which I am in favour.  May I remind the Minister that on the Second Reading of this Bill he made this statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;And it is my intention that persons who are dependent for their <Col N="1403" /> livelihood on insurance employment and are affected by this measure will be fairly dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He prefaced that statement by the remark that much of the criticism of the Insurance Bill then being discussed had centred around the question of staff and he gave the assurance I have just quoted.  The whole object of this series of amendments which we are discussing is to ensure that by some means or other these employees will be, as the Minister said, fairly dealt with.  I take it that the scheme put forward by Deputy Fionan Lynch is not one to which he is particularly wedded, but that he is wedded to the principle that the employees should be compensated in some way.  The Deputy merely suggested that as a way in which it could be achieved.  It would appear that all Parties take the view stated in the House on the Second Reading, and are wedded to the principle of compensation.  The Minister said that the employees would be fairly dealt with.  To-day, when discussing this and the other amendments with which we are dealing, he dealt with details, referring to the register of agents, a tax on foreign companies, and every other point he could think of, but he never once mentioned the principle of compensation.  He did say that there might or might not be an amalgamation scheme between the Irish companies, and that if there was he would see that the redundant employees were fairly dealt with, or words to that effect.  That was the only contribution I have been able to extract from the statement he made, and he prefaced it by saying that there might or might not be amalgamation.</P>

Supposing amalgamation is not possible, will there not be far more employees put out, I suggest, than by the provisions of the Bill?  If amalgamation does not arise what is going to happen to the companies?  Are they to be refused a licence and the whole lot put out?  The Minister knows far better than I do what the views of the Irish companies are on amalgamation, and surely he cannot avoid the principle being discussed by a mere passing reference to amalgamation.  Is he or is he not going to carry out the promise made on the Second Reading, that persons dependent for their livelihood on insurance employment who are affected by this measure will be fairly dealt with?  If he is, how is he going to carry that out?  We have had a Second Reading, and a Committee Stage, and we are now at a further Committee Stage, and so far there is no indication from the Government of their intentions with regard to the employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more surprised if I read in the daily newspapers a statement by the Minister that there was not a necessity for making provision for the payment of compensation. I should like the Minister to carry his mind back to the period when the railway amalgamation policy was before the House during the life of the last Government, and during the life of this Government when the policy of amalgamation of national health societies was brought forward by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Then, as a result of a general expression of opinion from all Parties represented in this House, it was agreed that reasonable compensation should be provided for those who lost their employment as a result of the passage of these measures.  I have been given information which I believe to be correct that in one town in County Tipperary there are at the present time 12 <Col N="1405" /> insurance agents collecting £60, weekly premiums.  Does the Minister think, that after the passage of this measure, employment will still be found for these 12 people in Tipperary who are in receipt of a weekly wage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>This Bill pre-supposes the absorption or the amalgamation of existing companies.  Otherwise, we are wasting our time here.  If that is not the object, what is the reason for bringing in this Bill?  Anybody who has made any study of the matter knows perfectly well that redundancy will arise, and if redundancy arises as a result of the absorption of some companies, then I think in fairness to the people who will be deprived of their employment, compensation should be provided for them.  I do not agree with the detailed proposals put forward by Deputy Lynch as to the way in which the money is to be raised, but I think that is a minor matter as compared with the principle that compensation should be provided for those who are rendered redundant and that a section should be inserted in this Bill for that purpose.  I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude and to remember how eloquent he and other Deputies were when they were in Opposition in favour of this very same proposal in other Acts.  I would also ask him to remember that since the Government came into office the Ministry, as a result of pressure from all parts of the House, agreed to provide compensation under the National Health Insurance Act for agents and others who lost their employment as a result of the coming into operation of that measure.</P>

      <P>Consistency makes debate in this House a good deal simpler than it otherwise would be, but I find it very hard to follow the line of reasoning which the Minister has pursued to lead him to the axiom that once you have agreed that foreign companies may continue to function here, you must stipulate that they must function on exactly equal terms with <Col N="1406" /> companies carried on by Irish nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood him to say any burdens which were not imposed on Irish companies.  If he said that, it would be rather difficult to reconcile it with the attitude of the Government in regard to the tobacco industry where he deliberately imposed burdens on a foreign company which firms of Irish origin were not called upon to bear.  If the Minister hesitates to accept that doctrine, we shall pass from it.  I want at this juncture to register an emphatic protest against a principle that was first enunciated in this House by the President of the Executive Council, namely that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  I do not consider that this Legislature is entitled to smash the whole livelihood and family establishment of a citizen of this State without compensating that individual for his loss.  If the community makes up its mind that it wants to establish a new order in any branch of the nation's life, the community has the right to do it within certain limitations, but it should be remembered by this House that while we are omnipotent in the legislative sphere, there is a law higher than any law we pass, a law which binds and restricts us in our legislation, and that is the law of natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that this House has no right to smash a man's means of livelihood, to break up his family and put him on the street in order to accommodate the remainder of the community.  I do not believe that any act of this House which confiscates a man's property <Col N="1407" /> has any validity.  We have the power and we have the right, where the community good demands it, compulsorily to acquire the property of any citizen provided we give him fair compensation for what the community takes from him.  We have no right to take his property and to console him with the reflection that he is one of the eggs that had to be smashed in order to make our omelette.  If compulsory amalgamations take place under this Bill, these amalgamations will take place because we compel them.  They may result in men being deprived of their means of livelihood, men who have built up in their own small way a very valuable goodwill and a very valuable business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He may have a rival in the particular area in which he is operating. They engage in the friendly rivalry of trade, each man acquiring his own clear debit.  The debit which that individual has built up for his company is that individual's little business and his livelihood depends upon it.  Now if we are to compel amalgamation amongst the two companies who employ these two men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has power to compel any company, which has not complied with the standards of solvency set up by this Bill, to amalgamate.  I propose to make my case and the Minister will have abundant parliamentary time to rebut it, but it is disorderly, and it is not helpful, continually to interrupt.  These two men who have built up their respective debits find that, by the operation of a statute of this House, their companies are amalgamated. One of the primary purposes of the amalgamation is to make it possible for the work these two men were doing in the past to be done by one in the future so that solvency, according to the Ministerial standard, would be established for the amalgamated company.  From the community point of view that may be a mighty good thing, something for which everybody in this House would stand, something into which this House would conscientiously go and carry through, but what I am asking is this, that if that community good is to be achieved, an individual engaged in a perfectly legitimate enterprise, such as an insurance agent, will get such compensation as an independent tribunal would adjudge to be fair and honest for what he has lost.  We are in this House prone to get detached from the ordinary everyday life of the people who live around us.  It is all very well for us to take a lofty view of each problem, but we ought to think of the situation that will arise if one of the victims of this legislation happens to be our next-door neighbour.  If a man who has two or three children, who is buying a house and who has made certain commitments on the basis of his earning capacity, is informed some morning that that earning capacity has ceased, his only recourse is to unemployment assistance.  I ask the House to bear in mind that we are dealing with insurance agents and <Col N="1409" /> that these are men who have no craft, men who are not skilled, in a wide sense, and who cannot readily pass from one employment to another. They have, probably, no professional qualifications.  They have, almost certainly, no trade qualifications and they are left high and dry.  It is very hard for the simplest manual labourer to reconcile himself to going on unemployment assistance or outdoor relief, but it is ten times harder for a man who has lived in moderately comfortable circumstances and has accustomed his family to considerable amenities, to tell them that they can have none of these in future and that he has to go out and seek work as a day labourer.  In rural Ireland, the circumstances of which I am particularly familiar with in this regard, that is going to happen in respect of a number of agents in the event of the provisions of this Bill becoming effectively operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that the case we make here is absolutely unanswerable and, for that reason, he desires to confuse it by irrelevant interruption.  I put it to the Minister that under the Bill an individual may be obliged to deprive his family of what they had been accustomed to and what he had hoped to make permanently available for them.  Speaking on behalf of the agents of rural Ireland, whose circumstances I know and understand, I say that some of them with whom I am personally acquainted will have no alternative but to go out and look for work as day labourers.  Owing to their mode of life, bad day labourers they will make.  They are not accustomed to heavy physical work and they will find themselves at a discount in the market for unskilled labour.  I say that this House has no right to interfere in the lives of citizens in that way.  I say that this House has no right to smash the lives of individual families in that way, and I say that there is an absolute obligation on us to provide reasonable compensation for those people if, for the common good, we have to deprive them of their existing means of livelihood.  The Minister himself has accepted that principle because, speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, he used these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is my intention that persons who are dependent for their livelihoods on insurance employment and who are affected by this measure will be fairly dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All I ask is: what did the Minister mean by saying that?  Surely, if he is going to repel a series of amendments designed to provide compensation for those persons to whom he himself referred&mdash;those persons who are &ldquo;affected by this measure&rdquo; and whose livelihood depends on insurance employment&mdash;the obligation is on him now to tell us what his plan is, because the only indication he has given us of what is in his mind gives rise to the gravest alarm in my mind.  On the Second Stage of this Bill, I dealt with this question and used these words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no fund available to <Col N="1411" /> the Irish insurance offices out of which displaced employees can be fairly compensated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the fact that we accepted the principle of compensation in national health insurance legislation.  We did, but let us be careful now lest we be carried too far by that analogy.  There is no fund at the disposal of the Irish insurance companies to finance compensation. They have had an extremely difficult job to build up their businesses and a lot of people forget, in that connection, one of the most vital matters in respect of this whole problem.  A lot of people are inclined to say, &ldquo;Why is it, if British and Continental companies were able to build up huge reserves to meet emergencies of this kind, the Irish companies never did so?&rdquo; The answer is one which ought to be present to the minds of Deputies&mdash; that the foreign companies built up their businesses during a period when there was virtually no State regulation. A great part of their reserves accrued from practices which were then legitimate in the narrow sense of the word.</P>

      <P>The Minister is beginning to ramble.  I do not mind the Minister interrupting me when he shows any degree of intelligence, but he has now started to ramble.  Practices in operation in the early stages of the great insurance companies of the world, practices which are not now within the law and have not been within the law for the past 20 years, made it possible for them to build up very large reserves.  The Irish companies were never able to build up these reserves, because they were all founded <Col N="1412" /> after very considerable reform in insurance law had been enacted. They built up their business under a comparatively stringent insurance code, with the result that they have no vast reserves out of which compensation of the kind we have in mind can be financed.  I want to make the case that if the State butts in and breaks up a man's means of livelihood, then it is the obligation of the State to compensate him for it.</P>

The Deputy ought to know that that body is organised on a mutual basis and passes on any profits it makes in the form of statutory benefits to the insured parties.  It was not designed to make a profit.  There is no capital invested in it and it has nothing to do but administer the funds which come into its hands by way of premiums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the case made by any other Deputy.  I am pointing out that there is a danger in establishing too close an analogy between the National Health Insurance Society and the companies with whom we are dealing, because the plain fact is this, that if you apply the same compensation proposals to the Irish insurance companies that you applied to the national health insurance societies, you are going to burst all the Irish insurance companies.  These are the facts: There are rights in the employees and there are obligations which it is our duty to place on the proper shoulders. My object in placing those obligations on the shoulders of the State is threefold. First, I believe the State is responsible and, therefore, the State should pay; secondly, I do not want to make any proposal to this House which will result not only in the legitimate compensation for the employees being jettisoned, but would also result in destroying the business at which the employees have to make their livelihood&mdash; that is to say, to wipe out the Irish insurance companies altogether. It would be a desperately irresponsible thing to adopt a scheme which would saddle the Irish companies with such proposals as would be almost impossible for them to meet.  In the third place the reason why this proposal should commend itself to this House is this: We have had bitter experience of the general vague proposals which saddle the Exchequer with a liability the full extent of which it is very difficult to envisage, because it may go on and it may grow.  But we know the full possible extent of the liability <Col N="1414" /> which this proposal will put upon the Exchequer.  Its limit is the total number of persons employed at the present time by the Irish insurance industry.  If the full staffs employed on Irish insurance were wiped out that would be the full limit of the responsibility on the Exchequer.  In practice we know that it is to be very small indeed, and it is going to be very small for this reason&mdash;that while certain persons are going to lose their jobs many of the companies to be amalgamated will say that it is the common experience of insurance companies that the normal wastage in the staff is high.  People pass out of employment, they get married, they get other jobs.  There is a good deal of transitory employment and there may be other wastage.  That consideration would have to be carefully examined. When the assessment of compensation comes to be made the insurance companies will say to themselves: &ldquo;If we had to anticipate maintaining the staffs for ever we might have to be more trenchant in our returns, but we are anticipating that we are going to lose a certain part of our staff through normal wastage; it is better to retain a slight surplus of skilled operatives than to cut the staff down to the minimum that would be efficient at the moment of amalgamation and then in four or five years to find ourselves recruiting unskilled operatives to fill the vacancies that will arise through normal wastage and other causes.&rdquo; So that we may hope that everybody who from the strictly efficient point of view may be dispensed with, will not be dispensed with, and we may be certain that perhaps 50 per cent. of the employees who on the strict letter of efficiency would be cut out, will be retained and that all we have to deal with is the 50 per cent. that are going. When we come to examine their cases, some of these may be very young, just starting, and have very little claim at all upon the bounty of the State, because they will be equally adapted for employment elsewhere.  We will find others to whom the change will be a hardship and they will require compensation to tide them over the period while they are equipping themselves for some other employment.  A very <Col N="1415" /> small minority will become a charge upon the State, as we will have interfered with their earning their living at a period late in life for them.  On the whole, taking everything into consideration, the liability from the State point of view is going to be extremely small, but the liability on the insurance company that is striving to keep itself on the strictest level of actuarial solvency might be intolerable.  To refuse them any compensation would be a glaring and intolerable injustice, and so I very strongly urge on the House that it should insist that the Minister should, on the Report Stage, give a definite undertaking that some compensation scheme will be brought before this House to be financed by the Exchequer.  I do not know on what amendment that is to be decided upon, but if it is decided upon this amendment I want to make it clear that I cannot agree with Deputy Lynch on the details of the scheme he suggests for dealing with the compensation fund.  If some scheme of compensation is not brought forward I am prepared to vote against the section.</P>

      <P>I am not, of course, entirely wedded to the scheme embodied in amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 to Section 6, but I am willing to let the scheme be settled on the proposals set out in amendment No. 9. Personally, I believe that this is the best method of going about it.  I think it is absolutely impracticable that the Saorstát companies should have to be carrying compensation burdens that would be particularly unfair to them, burdens too which they would be quite incapable of carrying.  It would also be unfair to ask the promoting company in the event of amalgamation to carry the burden of compensation to meet the matter of the redundant employees.  I say that because they will have as a liability, first of all, the large sum that will be borrowed&mdash;£500,000&mdash;and I presume they will have to make arrangements for the repayment of that sum by principal and interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  If the Minister is satisfied that the promoting company can carry the burden I am prepared to leave it at that, but I consider it is entirely wrong for him to suggest that this 2½ per cent. on the foreign companies operating here is going to drive any of them out of the country.  The figures as to the variation in the rate of expenses of these companies will give the House an idea of how this matter will operate.  The expenses vary from 23.34 per cent. in the case of the Prudential to 38.26 per cent. in the case of the Royal Liver Friendly Society.  Where there is such a variation in the routine of expenses of these companies paying exactly the same benefits to the policy-holders, I do not see how 2½ per cent. additional added to the routine expenses is going to make the slightest difference to them.  I do not think that one of them would dream of leaving the profitable ground they have here if their operation costs had this 2½ per cent. added to them.  When these companies differentiate between the treatment of policy-holders here and the treatment of policy-holders in Great Britain and Northern Ireland I do not think they would have anything to complain of if we gave that much advantage to the Saorstát companies as against them.  The Minister can be very vague when he likes. He has stated that there are too many people in the insurance business.  At the same time, he questions whether there will be any redundancy.  He said that it depends only on whether or not there will be amalgamation and there may or may not be amalgamation; he hopes there will be.  I think that inevitably there is going to be redundancy, if it is only because of the provision in the Bill for the partitioning of the life business from the general business.  That in itself, to my mind, will create redundancy, and in that way you will have persons unemployed.  If you enforce the provisions contained in Section 12 (4) (b)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Col N="1417" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in my opinion it will lead obviously to redundancy; there will be persons unemployed as a result of its operation.  At the moment there are 1,500 whole-time employees in the Saorstát companies.  It is estimated that if all the provisions of the Bill become law, if amalgamation becomes a fact, the number employed whole-time by the companies will be reduced to 600.  No provision is made in the Bill for the 900 who will become redundant and who will lose their employment.  The Minister tells us that it will not be an insoluble problem, that it will be only for a time and will ultimately disappear.  But during the period when these people will be out of work what is going to happen to them?  What provision is being made for the people who will be rendered unemployed?  Some may be fortunate enough to get employment in other spheres and some of them may die, but for the vast majority what is the prospect?  It must be remembered that as regards men engaged in insurance work over a number of years, when they reach the age of 40 years they are usually unfit for any other type of employment, and their position will be rendered very difficult when their means of livelihood is taken from them, as I foresee it will be under this Bill.  Inevitably large numbers of them will become unemployed.  If the principle of compensation in regard to these persons is enshrined in the Bill, I will be quite satisfied.  I am not wedded to the actual words set down, although I still believe that they constitute the most practical way out.  If there is any other way found of dealing with this matter along the lines I have suggested, it will meet with approval on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on the extent of the problem we are facing.  The Minister pretends to believe that there will be no redundancy, or that there will be very slight redundancy.  He seems to be agitated to-day at the thought that there is anywhere in this Bill a clause which <Col N="1418" /> may bring about redundancy.  He told us on one occasion that there are far too many people in this business.  I think his words were that there are too many people employed in the industry at the present time to permit of its being conducted on sound lines. He turns his back now on his Second Reading speech and he tries to avoid that aspect of it.  There are three possible ways in which redundancy may be caused.  He may present a petition for the winding-up of an insolvent company, in the first place.  Secondly, amalgamation may take place with or without such modifications as the Minister may care to impose.  Thirdly, as Deputy Lynch pointed out, the whole tendency of the Bill, with the partitioning of the life and industrial assurance business from every other type of assurance business drives towards amalgamation and ultimately towards redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not certain, there are his own phrases when closing on the Second Reading, and I think he then accepted in the tenor of that speech the particular analogies put before him by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton took the phrase used by Deputy Kennedy, that the management expense ratio was going to be forced down, as in England.  A question was asked how it was done in England, and the answer in the main was by reduction of staff.  In the main it will be that way here, too.  The Minister may talk about not having so many companies running up expenditure here running after the same little bit of business.  How did they get after that little bit of business?  With their separate staffs, and the biggest economy that will be made through this measure will be on the staffs.  I would personally hesitate to impose on the State any big burden by way of compensation, and I would hesitate if I thought the number of staff likely to be rendered redundant was going to be large.  I do not know whether immediately it is going to be large.  I believe that, as the years pass by, what would be the throwing of people in employment out of that employment will be met in another way, namely, that as the wastage occurs other people <Col N="1419" /> need not be recruited.  It closes an avenue to employment, but it does not throw out of employment people already in.  I do not think the problem is a very serious one in the sense that there is not going to be a very big number.  The burden is not going to be a very heavy one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a wise provision from the point of view of the people who became redundant.

I think at a high level it would work out about £70.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest there is a standard of compensation already set, and the Parliament of the Free State from time to time has accepted as a principle that when the State intervenes to cut down a field of employment for people who are already in a particular branch of employment, there should be compensation payable.  That was done in the case of the Railways Act of 1924, the electricity undertaking arising out of the Shannon Development and the Road Transport Act of 1933.  The principle was also observed when the bus companies were amalgamating and at the time of the National Health Insurance amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked who is to pay the compensation.  I thought the Minister would have welcomed the proposal with regard to the 2½ per cent. on the foreign companies.  I remember the Minister, when he was dining with the New Ireland Assurance Company, talking of these people as little alien outposts, hostile to the country's development, concerned only with the profits they could draw from the Saorstát business.  Those were wild and woolly words; there was no semblance of truth in them at all, but yet they were words that the Minister <Col N="1420" /> thought fit to use on that occasion. I thought he would have welcomed Deputy Lynch's idea of putting a 2½ per cent. tax on them.  Deputy Lynch was arguing in order to show that there might be something in the way of equalising the handicap under which the Irish companies suffer.  It was a suggestion the Minister would have jumped at on another occasion.</P>
    <P>I agree that it should not be put on any of the other companies; I do not think it should be shared by the companies; it should go on the State. There is no analogy with the other examples that have been suggested. Take the case of the electricity concern. A huge board was established, which was pretty nearly a State concern. It had very many of the attributes of a State concern.  The only thing that prevented it being entirely a State concern was that it was thrown out at arm's length in order to permit people to run it in a commercial way.  At the time of the railway amalgamation the argument was used that the railways could gain enormous sums by economies which were then being put before them, and it was a small thing to ask them in return to meet the compensation bill caused by the redundancy of certain men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The same argument is good here, too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it can be said that any company here is getting a monopoly it is a good argument, but without that there is no analogy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will wait until that point is reached.  If it is, then I think there will be a great case for shifting the burden from the State to the monopolistic group.  But let us wait until that time comes.  I do not see that in the Bill or anywhere else. As regards the transport undertakings, there was the open statement in the House that what was aimed at was to hand over the carrying of passengers and goods on the roads to three companies so that there would be a monopoly within their own respective <Col N="1421" /> zones.  If there was anything of that sort here, then I think the monopoly should bear its burden on its back, but there is no such thing here. The State is interfering here; it is shutting those people out of employment, and should meet the burden. The Minister told us there is nothing here enabling compulsory amalgamation. The tendency of the Bill is towards amalgamation.  The whole intention of the Bill is towards that. Even if there was only in the Bill amalgamation of the type brought about by the goodwill of certain companies, then I think we should meet that and make proposals to that end. Deputies should remember that this House loses its grip on this measure once it passes from it.  The Minister is not even going to prescribe the things that these amalgamated companies may do.  He is allowed to make a movement in that direction to them, but this House will not hear of that or know what he is going to do with regard to redundancy, if redundancy is brought about by amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole object of this is to drive towards a separation of business, to a better consolidation and to fewer hands in the insurance business.  The Minister has told us that there are too many people employed in the industry at the present time to permit of its being conducted on sound lines.  That is not in reference to amalgamation, but in regard to the generality of the Bill.  The Minister envisages redundancy. So do we all.  The difficulty I see about this measure is that one unfortunate tendency.  I do not know what the country is exactly developing towards: whether it is making towards a certain goal with deliberation. We started in this country with a legal decision rather than by an Act of Parliament, so that we have the whole licensed trade made a sort of closed corporation as far as this House is concerned.  In a variety of measures we have made transport closed.  As far as the Minister is concerned in regard to certain industries, we are making these closed also.  There are going to be certain closed boroughs in the future in which it will be as hard for anyone to get into as it was in the old days of the rigid guilds. <Col N="1422" /> I suppose the rest are going to be left to the unemployment insurance fund and the unemployment assistance fund.  Here in this Bill we find the same tendency: the closing up of avenues of work and the shutting out of competition and of enterprise.</P>

      <P>I learned to avoid this sort of thing.  As regards one of the amalgamation proposals for which I had responsibility, I regret it because, in the main, it worked out against the humans who were employed in the industry.  I say that very tendency is here.  With the bit of experience I derived when a Minister, I am in favour of compensation for people who are thrown out of their occupation by State intervention.  If the burden is small, that is all the more reason for facing up to it.  If there is going to be a vast number of people thrown out, and if the burden is going to be a heavy one, either upon the foreign insurance companies or insurance generally, or on the State, there is at any rate a weighty argument against any proposal for compensation; but if we are told by the Minister that, although there are too many in the industry, it is not an important consideration: if the burden of paying this compensation is going to be light, then we should shoulder it.  If, however, it is going to be an enormously heavy thing, then the argument is against it</P>

The essential difference between the Transport Acts, the Electricity Supply Act and the National Health Insurance Acts, to which reference has <Col N="1423" /> been made, and the Bill now before the Dáil, has not been mentioned. Each of these Acts provided for compensation for certain persons losing their employment in consequence of their enactment.  The essential difference, however, between the provision in any of these Acts and this Bill is that they give power to effect, because of considerations of public policy, the acquisition, amalgamation or the elimination of solvent concerns, of concerns which were making profits, and which could look forward to enjoying those profits with reasonable continuity, the employees of which had also reasonable security in their employment which entitled them to compensation.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get side-tracked off my main argument which is that these Acts gave power to deal with solvent concerns, or at any rate solvent concerns were brought within their scope.  Power was taken to effect this amalgamation, acquisition or elimination irrespective of whether these concerns were solvent or insolvent, and that was done for reasons of public policy.  This Bill does nothing of the kind.  A company which is solvent and which carries on its business in strict accordance with the law&mdash;that is in accordance with the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law&mdash;cannot be interfered with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If Deputy Dillon says that is not so, will he refer me to the section which gives power to interfere?</P>

      <P>We will deal with that consideration.  The suggestion, I take it, is that because there may be amalgamations of companies under Part III of the Bill, the Bill should provide for the establishment by the State of a fund from which compensation can be paid to any employees of the amalgamating companies who may not be employed in the amalgamated company.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Lynch first.  I am not quite clear as to what he intends because his amendments, so far as I have been able to follow them, provide for the creation of a fund and for the revenue of that fund, but they do not seem to provide for payments out of that fund. I have not been able to find an amendment which defines the classes of persons to whom payments are to be made or the circumstances under which they are to be made.  Is that right?  There is no such provision?</P>

      <P>I take it then that Deputy Lynch intends that any employee of an insurance company who can show that he loses his employment consequent on the enactment of this measure, through any cause, is to get compensation and other employees in certain circumstances are to get pensions.  The only amendment the Deputy has in relation to amalgamations seems to me to provide that the costs of compensation are to be paid by the amalgamating companies.  That is amendment 78.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Chair asked for an accommodation with the House and suggested that a series of amendments could be taken in one discussion for the purpose of deciding the general principle of compensation. In deference to an agreement of the House, all parties have been proceeding to discuss the principle of compensation without advertance to the various proposals of Deputy Lynch's implementing the principle.  One or two of us have completely dissociated ourselves from Deputy Lynch's proposals.  As I understand, we are having a Second Reading discussion on the principle of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the principle of compensation.  Deputy Lynch's principle of compensation is that every person now employed by an insurance company, who loses his employment in consequence of any of the provisions of this Bill, is to be compensated.  I am anxious to find out if Deputy Dillon and his associates on the front bench accept that principle <i>in toto.</i>  If there is an insolvent company, so insolvent that it cannot meet its liabilities, and if that company is wound up under this Bill and prohibited from carrying on further business, Deputies opposite are concerned to see that the employees of that company get compensation for the loss of their employment.  If we read in the paper to-morrow that Company A, an Irish insurance company, had smashed, that it had ceased to carry on business, that it was going to be wound up and that it was unable to meet its liabilities, do Deputies opposite think that I should come immediately before the Dáil with a Supplementary Estimate to provide compensation for its employees? Do they think that my concern should be for those employees or for the 100,000 or 200,000 people who had given their money on trust to that <Col N="1427" /> company, and whose policies have become less valuable than the paper on which they were printed?  Is that the Deputy's point&mdash;that our concern should be for the employees of these insolvent companies, because it is only insolvent companies that can be affected by the provisions of this measure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with my proposal in a minute, but I am anxious to get clear the principle on which Deputies opposite are standing. That principle is that where an insolvent company ceases to do business, the State is to provide, out of State <Col N="1428" /> funds, compensation for the employees of that company and not compensation for the policy holders, not compensation for the shareholders.  The people who gave their 1/- a week or 2/6 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in premiums to that company are not to be compensated. There is no proposal in this list of amendments tabled by the Deputies to provide them with compensation, but compensation is to be provided under any circumstances under which unemployment arises to persons now employed by insurance companies. That is what Deputies opposite require.  I do not think we should do it.  I do not think there should be any obligation on the State to provide compensation for those people out of State funds.  It has never been done.  It was not done in the case of the railways or the omnibus services; it was not done in the case of the electricity undertakings; and it was not done in the case of the national health societies. In each of these cases, there was, however, this provision, that, where compensation was payable, it was to be provided by the amalgamated company, the company that got the benefit of the legislation.  There is a certain amount of sense in the proposal submitted in Deputy Norton's name relating to this matter contained in another amendment later on.  I do not say that I am accepting it.  I think there is an argument against his proposal in principle, as there is against the proposal put forward by Deputy Lynch, but it is a more sensible contention than Deputy Lynch's contention, because at least Deputy Norton says that the circumstances that may lead to the amalgamation, or may result from the amalgamation, must be taken into account and there is no point in providing now for the creation of a fund and the imposition of taxes for the purpose of that fund to provide for compensation to be paid in cash. The necessity for it might never arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary again to emphasise that the only power which this Bill proposes to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce which could be <Col N="1429" /> used to effect amalgamation is power to apply to the High Court for an order to wind up an insolvent company.  It is not the Minister who decides that the company is insolvent; it is the High Court decides it.  The Minister is given power to apply for that order. That is his power, and it is the only power he can use to effect amalgamations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable, in my opinion, that that power should be exercised in that way, and, in relation to these Saorstát companies, created in the main upon national enthusiasm, as Deputy Burke pointed out, into which people were induced to put their savings upon the plea of &ldquo;Support Irish Industries&rdquo; that we should provide, not for their compulsory winding-up, but for their amalgamation under a scheme which is going to preserve, not the interests of the employees in these companies, not the interests of the shareholders in these companies, but the value of the policies held by the policy-holders. That is our intention.  Amalgamations may take place, and, because of amalgamations, there may be a problem created by the fact that there are more people trying to get a livelihood out of insurance business at present than that business can support.  That business, particularly industrial assurance business, is developing in that way.  Companies are continually advertising for new agents, and trying to attract people to them as agents in the insurance business, with the result that there is a much larger number of people engaged in insurance business than would be engaged if better and sounder methods of carrying on the business were in operation. The problem of redundancy exists at the moment, and may create special difficulty in connection with the amalgamation scheme under Part III of the Bill.  That difficulty however, can be resolved by other methods than by the payment of cash compensation.  I am not leaving out as a solution of the problem payment of cash compensation, but I think it should be paid by the amalgamating <Col N="1430" /> company coming under the scheme, or by the amalgamated companies, but, in my opinion, it is better to deal with that problem, if it arises by other methods.</P>
      <P>These methods suggest themselves immediately to Deputies.  It is possible, under the policy of amalgamation, to secure the carrying of redundant staffs until the growth in business, the increase in premiums resulting from amalgamation or normal wastage will rectify the position. My opinion, therefore, is that any question of unemployment, resulting from an amalgamation scheme, should be dealt with by the amalgamation scheme as put forward, and that there should be an obligation on the part of a company putting forward a scheme to offer proposals as to how it will deal with the problem of their staffs.  I think the problem can be dealt with better than by the provision of cash compensation, because under the manner in which insurance is carried on the assessment of the compensation to be paid in individual cases would be very difficult.</P>
      <P>An attempt was made to justify the amendment `because of the proposals in the Bill for the division of business. Preventing a company doing a life business from doing other classes of insurance business as well may result in unemployment.  It is extremely improbable that it will.  Any Deputy familiar with the circumstances will see at once that in certain respects this proposal may actually necessitate the recruitment of additional staffs. It has been argued by the insurance companies that it may make the carrying on of certain classes of insurance very difficult, and that in certain classes of insurance business there will be duplication.  But I do not think it will mean that the persons concerned will not be employed in the insurance business in future. Other provisions of the Bill will operate to create for them wider opportunities for employment in the Saorstát than previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, therefore, resisting this amendment, or any proposal to put upon the State the obligation of paying compensation, or providing the means for paying compensation, to persons <Col N="1431" /> employed in the insurance business who may lose their employment because of the operation of this measure.  If they lose their employment because of the wiping out of insolvent companies we have no obligation to them.  Insolvent companies disappear in every business, and will again, and no one ever suggested that the State should compensate their employees.  Insolvent insurance companies have disappeared.  If this Bill should result in insolvent insurance companies ceasing to operate we have no obligations to their staffs. So far as the proposal may result in bringing out the redundancy of staffs and disemployment, these staffs should be dealt with under the amalgamation scheme, either by making provision for the payment of compensation or for the employment of these redundant staffs during whatever period may be necessary or in some other way.  There are no grounds in this Bill which, in my opinion, would justify the inauguration of the elaborate scheme which Deputy Lynch suggests or any similar provision.</P>

      <P>The most amazing statement made by the Minister in his speech was that in which he wants the House to believe that the power given in the Railways and Transport Act was power given for the purpose of eliminating solvent companies.  But the Minister took jolly good care that he did not explain, even from his own point of view, what a solvent concern meant.  Does he mean a concern that pays a rate of interest to its shareholders? If so, neither were the railways that were taken over under Deputy McGilligan's scheme, or that were compulsorily amalgamated under the Minister's own Act of 1933, or the present concern in a solvent position either then or now.  The Minister ought to know, and if he does not, Deputy McGilligan can tell him that the principal amalgamated company of the Free State does not now pay dividends to its shareholders on certain of its shares.  I am concerned to know from the Minister whether he holds the view that the railway concerns were in any different circumstances and could be regarded as solvent concerns.  If the <Col N="1432" /> Minister does not know I would like Deputy McGilligan to answer that.</P>

      <P>The Minister admitted that there are insolvent companies, whether British or Irish, to be wiped out, and, therefore, he admitted that a number of their staffs will be deprived of their employment because of the coming into operation of this Bill. I am not seriously concerned where such people are getting compensation from, or whether that compensation is to be provided by the State or the benefiting concern.  Personally I believe that compensation paid in such circumstances should be provided by the company that gets the benefit of the increased business, namely, the amalgamated insurance company.  We were told by Deputy Lynch, and I am not prepared to accept his opinion, that the Saorstát insurance companies would not be able to bear the burden of the small compensation we are asking for under the terms of this amendment.  Anybody who knows anything about Irish insurance companies will be able to recollect the name of an Irish insurance company which some time ago sold its shares to another concern.  Everyone with any knowledge of the activities of that body, and every shareholder, knows the amazing amount of compensation paid to the people who lost their seats on the board of directors and the increased amount paid to Irish shareholders who sold their shares in that company to another body of people. I do not know whether Deputy Lynch remembers the name of the company which carried out that operation.  If so, would he say how many other Irish companies are in the same happy position? Would he say how many companies that will get increased business by a Bill of this kind would not be able to pay an amount of compensation to their Irish staffs?</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan knows much more about the meaning of this measure than Deputy Dillon will ever learn.  He was in the Department of Industry and Commerce for a number of years and had to listen to representations from solvent and insolvent insurance companies.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as the members of this Party are concerned, we do not want to prop up any longer, at the expense of the insurable population of this country, insolvent companies, whether Irish or British.  We voted for the amalgamation of businesses through measures passed in this House, with the full knowledge when doing so that these Bills, whether the Railway Bill, the Transport Bill or the National Health Insurance Bill, were bound in the end to lead to redundancy and to loss of employment by a number of people concerned in these industries.  We supported these Bills on the condition that, in all such cases, where the State deprives persons of employment, provision should be made in these Bills for the payment of reasonable compensation to the persons losing their employment.  I say again that I am not seriously concerned as to whether the compensation comes from the State or from the benefiting concerns, but my personal view is that it should come from the benefiting bodies&mdash;the insurance companies that are going to get the benefit of the increased business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the National Health Insurance Act, the Minister for Local Government, after a good deal of pressure both from this House and the Upper House, which has now disappeared, ultimately agreed that compensation should be paid to the part-time agents who lost their employment.  In that case the Minister made provision for the payment of compensation to people whom he knew were not making their livelihood in the main out of the small incomes that they <Col N="1436" /> received for acting as agents for national health insurance societies. I strongly press the Minister to make provision for the payment of reasonable compensation to persons who will lose their full-time employment as a result of the operation of this measure. I appeal strongly to the Minister and to his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, who is now sitting on the Front Bench, and who knows more about the implications of this measure than even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to give this matter more careful and more sympathetic consideration than it appears to have received up to the present.  I ask the Minister to take it back on the case made by Deputy Lynch and not on the case made by Deputy Dillon. Deputy Dillon made it quite clear to the House that he was not in favour of the payment of compensation to redundant officials, although he agreed with the principle, simply because it would interfere with the income of the shareholders of the companies here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The final word of the Minister, in reply to the very effective case made by Deputy Lynch, was that he was prepared to ask the amalgamating companies when they are submitting a scheme for amalgamation or absorption to indicate what compensation they are prepared to provide for those who would become redundant, or whether they would make provision for the employment of the people who would lose their employment in these insolvent companies that are going to disappear.  I am not prepared to leave <Col N="1437" /> it to the goodwill or the generosity of the directors of the amalgamating companies.  I think we should have clearly shown in a section of a Bill of this kind the nature of the compensation provisions and the extent to which compensation is going to be provided for those who will lose their employment as a result of the measure brought in by the Minister.  It should be contained in a Bill of this kind, just as in any of the other measures which provided for the amalgamation or absorption of other business companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the effect of the Transport Act.  The Minister and his predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, had the owners of these small so-called transport concerns coming on deputations, both before Deputy McGilligan left office and as soon as the present Minister came into office, telling them that if they did not give them protection in some shape or form they would be bound to disappear and that they were insolvent.  Whenever I raised in this House the question of the wages paid by those large or small bus concerns I was told that I was slandering those people who were owners of those concerns.  I was told, in other places, that they could not afford to pay more than 15/- per week to the conductors who were operating in and around the City of Dublin. What has happened under the operation of that measure?  The unfortunate employees who had less than five years' service did not receive any compensation. But there are Deputies in this House who know&mdash;and the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself knows better than anybody in this House&mdash; the amazing amounts that were paid in compensation to the owners of those broken-down buses which cannot now be used in or around the City of Dublin.  I have been given, and given on good authority, the amounts that were paid in compensation under the terms of the Transport Act.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is this: why take such an interest in the owners of concerns that are supposed to be insolvent and <Col N="1438" /> not take any interest in or make any provision whatsoever for the redundancy that will arise under the terms of this Bill, even though it may affect so-called insolvent insurance companies? I am making a case here that the Minister should reconsider the whole position from the point of view of the redundancy that is likely to arise.  I would ask him to give an undertaking&mdash;or I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to give an undertaking on his behalf&mdash;that this whole matter will be reconsidered in the light of the discussion which has now taken place, and that a section will be inserted in this Bill at a later stage making it quite clear to the employees who may become redundant what they may expect from the persons responsible for carrying the burden of the payment of compensation. There was a clear issue here on the principle, and on that I hope the Minister will make his position much more clear than he made it in the speech which he has just delivered.  I would invite the Minister for Agriculture to give this House the benefit of the experience he has had in the insurance business, and the benefit of the conversations which he must have had with his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter.  I would ask him to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the question as to whether they are prepared to make provision in this Bill for the payment of compensation to persons who will become redundant and lose their employment as a result of the coming into operation of this measure.  I want &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; as an answer to that question.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of this amendment by Deputy Lynch, having for its object the payment of compensation to those men who may lose their employment as a result of an Act passed by this House.  I think it is only a matter of common justice that men who are deprived of their living should be compensated by the State.  I was surprised to hear the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Of course, one has got accustomed to the fact that, if it <Col N="1439" /> suited his purpose, he would argue a hole through a pot, but in this particular instance he argued the whole bottom out of the pot when he stated that there is nothing in this Bill which gave any Deputy the right to get up and say that amalgamation will take place.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if all those employees of the various companies concerned, notably the Irish companies, have been going round the country on a wild goose chase, organising meetings and interviewing Deputies of the various Parties during the last four or five months?  Were they so devoid of common sense, and did they know so little about the sections of this Bill and what this Bill purports to put into effect, that they took all those precautions if they did not see in this Bill a danger of their livelihood being taken away from them?  Yet, we have the Minister, in answer to Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan, getting up in this House and saying: &ldquo;Point out to me any section in the Bill which will do away with any of those companies or prevent any of those companies from functioning.&rdquo;  Surely the Minister knew the position deep down in his heart when he stated: &ldquo;If I have to choose between safeguarding the interests of the policy-holders of this country and the putting out of operation of insolvent insurance companies there can be only one opinion,&rdquo; which means that insolvent companies must go.  That is the Irish Minister who, at the cross-roads of the Twenty-Six Counties of this country, has been telling the Irish people to insure in Irish companies, and we have it from the same Minister this evening that there are insolvent Irish companies in the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>We want no more camouflage about this question.  &ldquo;Why should we pay compensation?&rdquo; says this Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Everybody knows that <Col N="1440" /> certain Irish companies, which exist at the moment, have been created as a result of the propaganda that has been carried on throughout this country for the past eight or nine years by the Government and its supporters.  The child on the street knows that; it is no secret.  Yet the Minister stated here this evening: &ldquo;If a company should become insolvent to-morrow morning, or next week, why should this Dáil be asked to put into this Bill a section which will be the means of paying compensation to the employees of that insolvent insurance company?&rdquo; If I read anything into the speech of the Minister it is that he knows deep down in his heart that at the moment there are Irish companies&mdash;let him not say &ldquo;companies,&rdquo; or let not Deputy Davin say &ldquo;companies&rdquo;; Irish companies are the only companies referred to&mdash;which are insolvent.  Of course the Minister and his Government are getting afraid of the day that something terrible will happen in this country, and we want to go on now and prevent the compensation of those men who have given years of hard work in the building up of those companies, and the employees who have left the service of other companies to go into those Irish companies, mainly on the propaganda carried on by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government during the last eight or nine years, in order to build up what they say are purely Irish companies in conformity with the general policy pursued by the present Government.  Nobody can get away from that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those who ever claimed to be as Irish as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any member of that Government opposite. I am not supposed to be an Irishman at all, of course.  We always had very Imperialistic interests and we were always full of Imperialist ideas, but still as an Irishman I should be slow to give voice to the sentiments expressed in the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce here this evening, when he went very far to cast any suspicion he could upon the existing Irish companies of the Free State. Everybody knows and must agree that where, as a result of legislation, a man's livelihood is taken away from <Col N="1441" /> him, it is the duty of the Government to make provision for that man. Those companies have not asked for this legislation.  They are prepared to carry on in the future as they have been carrying on in the past.  They are prepared to pay their employees in the future as they have been paid in the past, and if by any Act of this House those companies are not in a position to do in the future what they have been doing in the past, then I say it is only a matter of justice on the part of this Parliament to pass a law which would enable those people to be compensated for the loss which they will sustain as a result of their means of livelihood being taken away from them.</P>
    <P>I never was more amazed than I was this evening when listening to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He himself will be surprised when he reads it.  I do not think the greatest supporter of a British company could make the speech that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made here this evening. It was a speech in defence of what I might call the foreign companies.  As he himself says, in effect: &ldquo;I do not care about the shareholders, I do not care about anything&mdash;I am going to defend the policy-holders.&rdquo; It is fine compensation and fine thanks that those men, who have spent so many years in building up Irish insurance companies, are getting now from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I think it is very little thanks that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is giving to all the agents of those companies who assisted him during the last general election and during the previous general election and who helped to put into power a Government that, to-day, is going to take away their means of livelihood from those men.  It is a fact&mdash;and no man knows it better than the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that the agents of the New Ireland Assurance Company, of the Munster and Leinster Assurance Company and the other assurance companies were the best canvassers for him and his Party throughout the length and breadth of this land in the last general election and the previous <Col N="1442" /> general election; and these men are now going to be thrown overboard and their means of livelihood taken away by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not care three straws, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in effect this evening, about the shareholders.  I am concerned with the interests of the policy holders, many of whom, as a result of the propaganda carried on by the Government and by members of the Government Party, were induced to transfer their policies from good solvent English insurance companies to certain Irish insurance companies.  Now, after all those years, those people are going to be deprived of their livelihood. I say, without fear of contradiction, that it is up to the Government, and especially the Government now in power, to see to it that, before this Bill leaves this House, a section or clause will be incorporated in the Bill safeguarding the means of livelihood of those men who will lose their employment as a result of this Bill if it remains as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not get the hang of what Deputy Davin was saying at all, because, apparently, Deputy Davin has completely lost track of this discussion.  Our position is perfectly clear, and that is that we are in favour of the principle of compensation, but that we are not in favour of saddling the amalgamated companies with the cost of it&mdash;for two reasons: first, that it may smash the amalgamated company, thereby disemploying all the people who are working in that company; and secondly, because, if it were by way of annuity, it would result in the annuitants losing their annuity because the company would be forced into liquidation through its inability to pay.  I do not mention the policy-holders in that connection, because I think the companies would go into liquidation before an insolvency was upon them that would force them to give the policy-holders less than the actuarial value of their several policies. Deputy Davin, however, is following a very dangerous line if he is going to lead the Labour Party down the alley of saying that compensation for the disemployed <Col N="1443" /> employees must be levied on the companies.  I warn him now that, if he follows that line, not only will he do the employees out of their compensation, but he will shake the whole foundation of the existing Irish insurance companies.  Now, I ask Deputy Davin to inquire into that situation before he pursues the line that he has been advocating in this House any longer.  If there is going to be compensation for redundant employees levied on the Irish insurance companies there will not be a single Irish insurance company left in this country in the next ten years, with the exception, perhaps, of the Hibernian Fire and Accident Insurance Company, which does not do life or industrial assurance.</P>

This Bill will not eliminate any competition or will not make the competition lighter than it was before.  Deputy Davin, however, does not seem to be able to get that into his head.</P>

In my opinion, at any rate&mdash;and I know it is the opinion of others&mdash;the amalgamated company would not be free to pay one penny of interest on its ordinary shares until such time as it had accumulated a reserve sufficient to meet the amount of money subscribed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if there is no money in the Irish insurance company to provide for a fund of the kind Deputy Davin has in mind, it cannot be provided by the company.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked for a clear statement from the Opposition as to where we stand on the principle of compensation.  The Minister loves to call for these clear statements from his opponents, but he is very reluctant to give them himself.  I want to be quite clear with the Minister on this matter.  We stand for compensation for any person who loses his employment as a result of the operations of this Bill.  The Minister whacked the desk and asked if an insolvent company was wound up were they to be concerned?  The whole object of the Bill is to avoid wiping them out.  If an insolvent company is wound up I ask the Deputies to remember that the policy-holders are going to suffer.  Suppose we wind up an insolvent company to-morrow and there is an actuarial deficit of 10/- in the £, the <Col N="1446" /> policy-holders are only going to get 8/- in the £ out of what they are actuarially entitled to.  The whole object of this legislation is to avoid winding up. and if the only effect is to wipe out a company and to leave the policy-holders to carry the baby, this legislation is going to be of no effect at all. We all know perfectly well that there are insurance companies in this country which are insolvent.  We all know that the object of this legislation is to prevent these insurance companies crashing.</P>
      <P>It is right that at this stage the public should be informed that the reason for this legislation is because there are insurance companies of such kind and that if they did crash the State would have to come to their assistance.  The whole position of these insurance companies is such that we could not possibly allow them to go crash.  Let us be clear on that.  There are numbers of persons in very responsible positions in this State intimately associated with these companies. There are numbers of persons in very responsible positions who urged the people in the name of patriotism to put their money into these companies, and rightly I think the State has consistently taken the view since it was founded in 1922&mdash;not since Fianna Fáil came into office&mdash; that if all went to all it would have to come in to save a crash, if a crash threatened.  With that in mind, companies that were insolvent years ago have been allowed to carry on, and I think rightly allowed to carry on, because it was felt that there was a chance they would pull themselves together, and come out of the wood as all the big insurance companies in Great Britain have done in their day. Not a single one of the big insurance companies in Great Britain was solvent within a decade of its foundation; they were all insolvent, and they all came back to solvency and to the prosperity that they now enjoy, through a period of great difficulty and great doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they all solvent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the great insurance companies, and I say that not a single one of them but was <Col N="1447" /> insolvent in the early years of its existence.  They have all attained mighty wealth after having gone through a period of difficulty.  Irish insurance companies were admittedly insolvent, and I believe some of them are still insolvent.  I believe some have been insolvent for the last eight or nine years.  I think the Government then and the Government now rightly took the view that they ought to be allowed to carry on, always knowing that it would be left to someone else to carry the baby if a catastrophe occurred, hoping all the time that everything would come all right, and that the Government or the State would see that the policy-holders were all right.  In pursuing that line they left open the doors of employment with insurance companies to young persons starting out on their careers.  It was not for these young fellows who were looking for jobs to assess the solvency or the insolvency of any company with which they could get a job.  They took the jobs, built up their books, and many of them are now married and settled in life. It was the policy of the State to allow these companies to continue to function long after they might legitimately have been wound up for insolvency.  Are the young persons who were invited by the State's complacency to go into these jobs to be sacrificed now because the companies have become insolvent?  They were insolvent eight years ago, and if wound up then boys who went into that business would never have gone into it, but would have prepared themselves for other walks of life or made jobs for themselves.  They did not do so, because they believed that if the companies were allowed to carry on they were solvent companies. They are now faced with the situation that they have accepted responsibilities of one kind or another on the strength of the jobs they got.  Consequently these men are entitled to compensation.  That is my position as regards insolvent companies.  In regard to Irish companies, a most peculiar situation arises.  We deliberately, and in my opinion properly, <Col N="1448" /> tolerated their insolvency in the hope that in time they would come all right.  We must now accept responsibility for that, and recognise that this legislation is designed to put Irish insurance on a solid foundation, to make a clean sweep of insecurity and doubt, and the foreseeable possibility of collapse, and that we are going to make sure that any casualties that arise will be adequately and properly looked after.</P>

      <P>My belief is that we should clear the ground as far as is foreseeable to secure ourselves against future catastrophe, and in the process of doing that, in my opinion, the casualties should be compensated.  If the Minister wants to make an imbecile or idiotic point, as to whether we should make provision for people for whom it may be necessary in two or three years, I do not think that point relevant.  Naturally, a line is drawn beyond which the impact of the Bill is not to operate.  These are details for which to devise a scheme to carry that out.  This has been clearly explained by those defending the principle and it is silly to drag in fortuitous difficulties which cannot arise and artificial cases which have no real existence in the problem which confronts us at present. That disposes of compulsory winding up.  The Minister went on to imply that the only real redundancy that could arise would be as a result of insolvent companies being wound up, and their business terminated.  He deliberately sought to veil the provisions of Section 12 (4), where a perfectly solvent company is operating life, industrial life, fire or accident. The Minister says to that company, &ldquo;Divide your business into two. Either sell the life business or dispose of the fire and accident business.&rdquo;  A company which is perfectly solvent, and able to carry on a reasonably comfortable business with one head office, might find the situation entirely different if it was obliged to dispose of half of its business to someone else. It might then find that the only hope of maintaining itself in the solvent condition it was in when the Minister sought to interfere, was by amalgamation with some other company.  It is forced by the operation of this Bill into amalgamation.  When it amalgamates the principle of economy in the expense ratio is going to result in a reduction of the staff.  I say these <Col N="1450" /> people are entitled to compensation.  I suggest that their unemployment has been precipitated by the action of the Minister.  What is going to happen in regard to this Bill, as far as amalgamation proposals are going to operate, and indeed in all human probability in so far as the compulsory winding-up will operate, is that they are going to use those parts of the Bill for the purpose of clearing the ground immediately after its passage, but having been once used ordinarily they should never be used again, because there will be close surveillance and immediate warnings, and precautions can be taken long before an insurance company approaches the position of insolvency.  That is the whole object of this Bill.  There might happen to be drastic work undertaken immediately the Bill becomes law, and it is on that occasion I want the casualties to be properly looked after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise what Deputy Dillon has said in one respect.  The Minister has made an amazing statement here, contrary to what he said on Second Reading, that there is not likely to be much unemployment or disemployment caused by this measure.  When he was closing on Second Reading, after the particular matter had been discussed here, he said: &ldquo;There are too many people employed in the industry at the present time to permit of its being conducted on sound lines.&rdquo;  Later he talked about the burden that would be cast upon an amalgamated company by reason of excessive staffs.  He tells us now that amalgamation will not take place under his authority or through his compulsion, and that whatever redundancy takes place under these amalgamations should be left to these amalgamations to clean up for themselves. I think the answer to that is that this House should deal with that matter, that this House should lay down conditions regarding compensation which should be part of the terms of amalgamation when these matters do arise.  The Minister has made the amazing statement with regard to Section 12 that it is likely to increase work.  That is on the lines of the Spanish-oranges-and-eggs type of story. We can leave that to his telling.  There <Col N="1451" /> is nobody going to believe it, and it is not worth arguing about it.</P>
      <P>The special point, which the Minister has made, which requires consideration is this matter of insolvent companies. It may seem to be an equitable suggestion that if a business fails because it is not able to keep up with the strain of competition, then there should be no provision made for those cast out of work, that you do not in the ordinary way of business deal with it but take it as a necessary happening. There were companies, as has been pointed out, started here under a particular impulse.  They were kept going here because of the strength and the enthusiasm of these impulses.  When these companies were looked into by the first Government that came to investigate them here, the situation was seen to be a pretty bad one, and although there was a danger facing the continuance of these companies, that danger or risk was accepted and accepted exactly on the terms to which Deputy Dillon has referred. These companies were so definitely bound up with a particular movement, with a particular surge in Irish affairs, that whatever we might say of their weakness, if any of them came near the point of collapse it would be a matter of State intervention.</P>
      <P>Whatever good points there might be behind the continuance of these weak companies in the hope of nursing them into a proper financial condition, it was no answer, say to some dozen or 100 assured people who came within the grip of these weak insurance companies 10 or 15 years ago, that they should have been wound up and the only answer that could be given was that the resources of the State were behind them.  Transfer that argument to the case of the employees and they are in exactly the same position.  The companies were allowed to carry on and these men entered their employment. If the axe had been allowed to fall when the neck was ripe for the block, these people would not have been diverted to that type of employment. They are entitled to the same consideration as the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to this as though it were a matter of a business <Col N="1452" /> concern falling by the wayside.  That same phrase entering into another Minister's head about 1923 or 1924 would have produced from the present Minister then the fiercest indignation and tirades.  Anybody armed with the powers of the English insurance commissioner about the year 1925 and who proposed to cut out four or five Irish companies, for that reason would have been regarded as a traitor to the best interests of the country and would have been maligned by nobody more than the present Minister&mdash;speaking in ignorance, of course.  He would have condemned it resoundingly and vehemently.  The employees are exactly in the same position as the shareholders.  Are they not deserving of the same consideration? They are not to be cast aside as a separate company that could not stand the stress of the times.  Again, these are people who could not have had any knowledge themselves of the danger they were in, because a lot of the difficulties surrounding these companies have not been something that the employees might have seen.  There has been some overcrowding in the ranks of those employed in the insurance companies, but a certain amount of their difficulties arose from a bad investment policy.  If, however, anybody had classed it as a bad investment policy five years ago, he himself would have been classed as definitely unpatriotic for giving expression to such a statement.  The impact of this Bill on insurance is one that is going to lead to redundancy because the situation undoubtedly is that there are too many people employed in the insurance business.  If the licence is to be withdrawn and if no term of years is to be put upon it, but that it is to be withdrawn simply because of insolvency, what is going to happen? Is it because it is found insolvent hereafter or now?  In the case of the Railways Bill, a period of seven years was fixed within which there would have to be compensation for any redundancy arising out of the amalgamation. Deputy Davin then criticised the limitation that was put upon the period during which compensation would be paid on redundancy but it was thought, at any rate, that any <Col N="1453" /> redundancy as a result of the amalgamation would have shown itself within that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>The Deputy did prophesy that it would happen, but I do not know whether it did.  The Minister speaks of the licence being withdrawn from a foreign company because it is insolvent.  If he means one that is now insolvent, I put it in the same position as an Irish company. It was allowed to carry on.  There was no reason for allowing a foreign company to carry on if it could have been shown to be insolvent.  If it was a company that at one time had been a native company, and had been bought out, then peculiar considerations would apply, or if there was some interlocking between it and a native company somewhat the same considerations would apply.  If it refers to an outside or English company, after the Bill has its first impact on the company, then I think there is no case for compensation.  The State has had its interactions on the whole matter, and we will have seen what the results may be.  I do not think that there is any analogy at all between the company whose certificate is withdrawn because of something in the Bill, and one which should have been declared insolvent a few years ago.</P>

      <P>By no means, and, therefore, there should be no compensation. But it is redundancy about which I am speaking.  The redundancy is brought about by the action of the Government in the interest, in the main, of the insured people.  There is undoubtedly a case for compensation in those circumstances, and we have always accepted that principle.  I do not know of any measure by which people were put out of employment, whether directly under the Bill or by the Minister saying: &ldquo;There are to be amalgamations, and I foresee that that will mean redundancy,&rdquo; or by the Minister giving power to a group, established by him, to take over the business of other people, in which that principle was not accepted.  The Electricity Supply Board were not forced to take over any concerns.  They were given the power to do so.  They were practically a Government concern and they were huge monopolists.  They were told that one of the conditions in taking over the businesses of others was that they should compensate employees of a certain type.  No point was ever made in this House, and it cannot be made now retrospectively, that the principle which operated in the minds of people who voted for compensation in previous years was whether or not the businesses to be acquired were solvent or insolvent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin referred to the railway companies.  One might have a certain delicacy in referring to the railway companies a few years ago, but, speaking now, there can be no delicacy in alluding to their position. In 1924 they represented themselves &mdash;it was not what was said about them, but what they said&mdash;as insolvent. The situation with regard to the railway companies was that the whole country was clamouring to get the rates, which were 150 per cent. over the pre-war rates, reduced.  The attitude of the companies was that, although they knew the retention of the high rates was driving business from them, any attempt to lower them was going to make them completely insolvent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not here when Deputy Davin raised this question.  I say, in reply to his question, that a solvent railway company is one which can pay dividends on its stock.  So far was that from being the case that, when the Minister came to the aid of the railway company in 1933, he reduced their stock to one-tenth of what it previously was and made the case that that meant no difference because they had not been paying even on one-tenth. Having brought the railway company to the position in which the debenture-holders could have come in and closed down on the property, the company being so completely insolvent, the Minister interfered with the debenture-holders' rights and prevented them from exercising them in the legal way, as well as reducing the value of that property.  Then, he tells us that, by analogy, that was a solvent concern.  I do not agree with the Deputy about the bus concerns. The Deputy may disagree with the results, as found, but the terms of reference were clear.  People were to be compensated for pecuniary loss. You could not find that there was pecuniary loss if a man had been making a loss when he was in the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who were not over five years in that employment were ruled out by the Act. That was accepted by the majority in this House.  If a man was not in the job for five years he was not thought to be in the industry long enough to qualify for compensation.  This measure is on all fours with most of the measures about which different members of the Dáil and different Parliaments took exactly the same view. If, by State action, people are driven out of employment, whether directly by the Bill or because of powers given to certain people by the Bill, compensation should be provided for.  If there is going to be no unemployment, the Minister is right in saying that the clause will never be put into operation. But the House has always guarded itself against the plea of injustice by associating with all these confiscation or amalgamation measures clauses with regard to compensation.  There may have been hurdles to be got over and <Col N="1457" /> the compensation may have been small but we have always salved our consciences, when we brought in measures here providing for State intervention and feared that the field of employment might be encroached upon, by providing for compensation.</P>
      <P>I should have liked to discuss further the question as to who should bear the burden of compensation.  Deputy Davin has the clear view that this tends towards a monopoly.  I do not see any monopoly in regard to this matter.  It may come later but it will not come in the period during which compensation should be paid.  This will not be a question of pensions; it will be a question of gratuities or lump-sum payments.  I do not think you can put it on all the companies left in existence.  There will be a considerable amount of competition to be faced&mdash;and a good thing, too.  There is nothing in the way of a monopoly. That being the situation, if the State is responsible for disemployment, even if the State is under suspicion of being responsible, or under the suspicion of bringing about a remotely possible situation in which people will be put out of employment, then the State ought to include in the Bill a clause which will become operative only if and when redundancy occurs through its activities or the activities of people given power by this measure to produce redundancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech of about half-an-hour ago, the Minister said he was anxious to know the principle on which this Party was standing in reference to this question of compensation to employees.  I shall give it to him in one sentence&mdash;a sentence out of his own speech on Second Reading:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is my intention that persons who are dependent for their livelihoods on insurance employment, and who are affected by this measure will be fairly dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the principle on which we stand and that quotation is from the Minister's own speech.  The Minister endeavoured to avoid giving the principle on which he stood.  Having tried to side-track the issue by reference to the details of Deputy Lynch's <Col N="1458" /> amendment, he ultimately came down to three points&mdash;(1) that he would pay no compensation to any employee of an insolvent company; (2) if amalgamation took place he would put the burden of compensation on the amalgamated companies, and (3) that there would be no necessity to give compensation to any employees because, if partition took place in the businesses of insurance companies, there would be no unemployment by reason of the partition. I understood that the Minister's arguments boiled down into these three points.  That means that, unless and until there is a scheme of amalgamation, there is to be no provision for dealing fairly with employees.  It is only in that state of affairs that the Minister will intervene.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I have entirely misread this Bill.  I agree with what the Minister has iterated and reiterated, that there are no provisions in this Bill for compulsory amalgamation. The Minister thinks that there may be compulsory amalgamation of Irish insurance companies.  I am not sufficiently in touch with the concerns of Irish insurance companies to say whether or not that is so.  The Minister thinks there will be amalgamation.  So far as my knowledge goes, I think there will not.  Then, Irish companies will be thrown back on Section 12. What is the position under Section 12? If this Bill is passed in its present form, no insurance company, British or Irish, can carry on a composite business. Some offices carried on a life business, including industrial assurance and general insurance&mdash;accident, fire, burglary and all the rest.  Once this Bill comes into force, a company must, as I read the provisions of the measure, decide whether it will carry on for the future its life business or its general business.  It cannot do both.</P>
    <P>As most companies will elect to carry on their life business, they are then left with something which they have built up for some period of years.  It may or may not be an asset.  Whether it is an asset or not it is there.  There are some employees who have been concerned in the working of that branch of their business.  What is to become of them?  That company is <Col N="1459" /> going to carry on the life business; it is going to drop the other.  It is going either to unload it on some other company which is to carry it on, or leave it drop&mdash;leaving it to some other companies to collect that business without giving any purchase price to the company that built it up.  Whether any company is going to purchase this, or whether any company can be got to purchase it, or whether the business is going to be left there at large for other companies to take it up, without paying any purchase price, there is, in either event, bound to be unemployment, because if a company takes it up having purchased it from the company which dropped it, then that new company will probably be in a position to carry it on without taking on to their staff one additional person.  If any company does not take it up, there is in either event bound to be considerable unemployment as a result.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister can say that the situation created by Section 12 causes no trouble under this Bill.  The Minister says that it is extremely unlikely that unemployment will result.  On the contrary, I think it is extremeuy likely that unemployment must result.  I cannot at all follow the Minister in coming to the conclusion he comes to, that no unemployment will be caused through this measure.  Unemployment is bound to be caused in the way I have pointed out.  As I understood him, Deputy Davin is in favour personally of compensation. The Deputy rather inclines to the view that something along the lines of Deputy Finian Lynch's amendment should meet the case, or that the amalgamating companies should bear the burden.  The principle that is operating in the Deputy's mind is that whoever gets benefit from this Bill should pay the cost of the compensation. If there is no amalgamation, as is very likely under this Bill, then who is to bear the cost of the unemployment that will ensue from the operation of the partition of the business? Nobody.  Deputy Lynch suggests the details of a scheme.  His suggestions and his details for carrying them out do not commend themselves to me. <Col N="1460" /> We take up the position that because the State has interfered with the business of insurance in this country the cost of that should be borne by the State, because we feel that nothing but disadvantage is coming to the Irish companies or the British companies through the operations of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one advantage from the Bill. There is a problem to be met and to be dealt with by this Bill&mdash;a problem we do not want to dwell upon&mdash;the problem of the insolvent companies.  So far as an effort is being made by this Bill to deal with that problem then that is something that is to be done in the public interest.  Nobody wants that business.  Who wants to bear the burden of some insolvent company? What is the business worth?  Who is going to buy an insolvent business as a business proposition?  If these insolvent companies are to be transferred to other Irish companies that business is going to be forced on them directly or indirectly.  Nobody is going to take that business gratuitously.  What does the Bill do?  It interferes with all of that business.  The Bill interferes with the British insurance companies and foreign companies doing business here. The British and foreign companies who are carrying on business here do not want the Bill; they want to be let alone.  As regards the Irish insurance companies, I am aware that, before this Bill was brought in, they wanted and had some reason to expect certain benefits from this Government.  That was their outlook.  They thought that the present Government by reason of their promises and because of their policy in industrial concerns were going to give them something equivalent to tariffs or bounties for their business as Irish industrial concerns. They were under the impression&mdash;quite wrongly as it now appears&mdash;that they were going to get some benefit under the Bill.  But they are getting no benefit.  I think I am correctly stating their attitude if I say this: that as they have not been getting what they thought they were getting from the present Government, they would prefer to be let alone rather than be interfered with by the Bill.  We have then the position that the British companies <Col N="1461" /> want to be let alone, and the Irish companies, in default of getting what they expected, want to be let alone.  Both groups are seriously interfered with by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In whose interests then is it being introduced?  As I gathered from the Minister's statement it is being introduced in the interests of the policy-holders&mdash;in other words a section of the public.  Deputy Davin himself to-day used the phrase&mdash;I think I have taken him down correctly&mdash;&ldquo;This Bill is saving the insurance population from themselves.&rdquo;  That is what this Bill is doing.  It is preventing certain Irish concerns going insolvent and thereby bringing discredit on this country and discredit on business in general.  It is protecting the policy-holders, according to Deputy Davin, from the dangers of these insolvent companies.  According to the Minister the primary purpose of this Bill is to protect the policy-holders.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the persons who will be getting benefit from this measure are the public, or a big section of the public, and not the companies whose business is being interfered with, whether they are British or Irish. There is, therefore, no case to put the burden of paying compensation on either the companies, whether they are British or Irish concerns, or on the policy-holders for that matter.  If there is to be compensation, and we and apparently everybody except the Government think that there should be compensation for any persons who may be disemployed as a result of the operation of this measure, then the logical conclusion should be that the persons who benefit by it should pay for its operation.  The persons who will benefit are the public as a whole, and, consequently, I suggest that Deputy Davin, having hit on the right principle, that the persons who are getting benefits from the operation of the measure should pay compensation to the people who are disemployed as a result of its operation, should revise his opinions, disagree with himself and come to the conclusions that we have put forward.  It is rather amusing, in one sense, that Deputy Davin, whose Party, perhaps surreptitiously, stands for the socialistic doctrine, should now <Col N="1462" /> be arguing very heatedly in this House against the idea of the State paying compensation in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to listen to the Deputy arguing in that manner, while others, who may not be in agreement with the policy of State control in every direction, should be asking the Minister to pay compensation out of State funds to the persons who will be disemployed when this measure is put into operation.  Apparently, Deputy Davin and ourselves are now in full agreement on the principle of compensation.  On the details we have, perhaps, disagreed, but now that his attention has been directed along proper channels, perhaps he will see his way to agree with the main arguments which we put forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister asks us to state clearly what is our principle in relation to this question of compensation.  We want that persons who are dependent for their livelihood on insurance employment and are affected by this measure will be fairly dealt with. Those are the Minister's own words, and we use them to state our principle on this question of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely intervene now because statements made by me on the Second Reading have been quoted twice out of their context. The statement that Deputy Costello has quoted clearly relates only to the amalgamation provisions of the Bill. I was then dealing with the amalgamation provisions of the Bill and, in relation to them, I made that statement, that persons who are dependent for their livelihood on insurance employment and are affected by this measure will be fairly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about amalgamation in that sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the whole paragraph.  The Deputy is not quoting from the Official Debates, but from a pamphlet issued by insurance agents&mdash;I happen to have a copy of it.  In column 1721 of the Parliamentary Debates I am reported:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" />&ldquo;It has been suggested that amalgamation may result in the wholesale dismissal of staffs of the amalgamating companies, but this suggestion is entirely without foundation.  I do not think that the provisions of this Bill will result in any number of persons losing employment, and it is my intention that persons who are dependent for their livelihoods on insurance employment and who are affected by the measure will be fairly dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is some more in the paragraph, but it is clear that the reference relates to the amalgamation proposals. Deputy McGilligan quoted me from the same pamphlet as saying that the question of the redundancy of staff is not an important consideration. The full sentence reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The industry as at present conducted is peculiar in this respect, that it is under no necessity to restrict the number of persons who can at any time be taken on as agents, since they may be paid wholly or mainly by commission, and the question of redundancy of staff is not an important consideration for the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point of that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the Minister was misquoted and to the extent he says the sentence that I quoted from him, and which I again say embodies the principle for which we stand, is entirely divorced from its context.  Assuming again that it only relates to amalgamation, will he deal with the point that I have put, that, irrespective of amalgamation, the partitioning of staffs in itself is bound inevitably to lead to a considerable number of persons being put out of employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggests that when this State, for the protection of its own citizens, enacts legislation to provide that companies doing insurance business here should do it on a certain basis, that foreign companies doing business on a different basis, who are made to conform to our law, should be put in this position, that if the change results in any disemployment amongst their staff, the taxpayers of this country are to be made responsible for whatever amount is involved in compensation.  That is an amazing proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, but the Minister's statement is still more amazing.  There are large numbers of Saorstát citizens employed by British insurance companies in this country. Large numbers of people gain their livelihoods from that business.  Large numbers of Saorstát citizens are keenly and vitally interested in the business carried on by the British insurance companies.  The Minister must remember that we are only a State for the last 12 years, and a lot of Irish people put money into British insurance companies when there were no Irish companies.  Apart altogether from that, I think, as a matter of pure justice, that when the Legislature interferes in the operations of an insurance company, whether British, Irish, Czecho-Slovakian or anything else, that has been lawfully carrying on its business here, deliberately and with the consent of the Legislature of this country, for a considerable number of years, and in strict accordance with the ordinary principles of private international law, there ought to be compensation.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall as soon as possible after the expiration of each year prepare and present to each House of the Oireachtas a report of his proceedings under this Act during such year.</P>
      <P>The administration of this Bill when it becomes law will be a matter which will concern the whole of the insurable population of the country and, therefore, warrants, in my opinion, the preparation and circulation in the manner indicated of a yearly report to the Oireachtas and, through the Oireachtas, to the country.

The Minister does not get over that by saying that the Act of 1909 gives an abstract of all this in the paper laid before the House.  The Minister may make a report.  The Deputy wants in his amendment to use the words &ldquo;shall make a report.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment is refused for the reason that it is not thought desirable by the Minister.  The Minister has power to lay this report. He has that power from the old Act; and he may add to it, but the Deputy <Col N="1474" /> wants the report laid before the House. The Deputy has this good point in this amendment, that whatever the report may be, as long as it proceeds from the Minister, it is ground for debate.  If the Minister merely brings in a formal report there is no possibility of debate. If the report discloses things that are of some moment to the public, then, there can be a debate upon it in this House.  The virtue of this House is publicity and debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that in the case of private citizens only <Col N="1475" /> there should be any amount of statutory obligations, particularly in regard to income-tax, but that there should be no obligation upon the Minister, because he is a Minister, and because the collection of information would give some trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the waste and trouble?  Records will have to be kept in relation to the returns, and not even the time of the new civil servants would be wasted.  The Minister has advanced two concrete arguments against this amendment.  One is that this is done, and the other is that it should not be made statutory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not accept the amendment because it would impose upon him the obligation to do what he is now doing, and then there is his argument that it will be far too troublesome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>More than that.  The Deputy's amendment says &ldquo;the Minister shall as soon as possible after the expiration of each financial year&rdquo; publish a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  A good deal of elasticity could be given to the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  The Minister would be up against criticism of the report.  But the collation of reports from information supplied takes time.  Everybody is patient with regard to such reports.  There is no question of taking civil servants away from other urgent duties to prepare this report.  The report generally is published, and I do not see why we should not impose the obligation now that there is so much Government departmental direction in these matters.  I ask the Minister to qualify what he has said.  He said there always is published, not only an abstract of the accounts but also comments by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said the report from the Board of Trade is published. It often might have been.  The fact <Col N="1476" /> that there was any report might have awakened people to the importance of insurance.  But it is not accurate to say that there has been a report by the Minister on matters referred to in the 1909 Act.  Deputy Davin is right in asking that there should be published a report of the proceedings during the year.  If that could be joined up with the 1909 Act it would be still more desirable as an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister took an exaggerated view of the amendment.  The amendment asks that &ldquo;the Minister shall as soon as possible after the expiration of each year prepare and present...a report of his proceedings under this Act during such year&rdquo;.  That leaves it to the discretion of the Minister, and his advisers, to furnish a report &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;  There is no fixed date by which the report should be placed before members of the House after the expiration of the particular year.  I take the view that the Bill is one of the Bills introduced during the last year that causes a good deal of annoyance to people.  It affects agents, and it affects people all over the country.  I think the circulation of an annual report would be very likely to have a very good effect from the propaganda point of view upon the people of the country.  If the Minister does not furnish this report Deputies will be forced to put down a large number of questions from time to time, with a view to getting information.  That could all be avoided if the Minister furnishes this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of what portion does the Deputy want that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the major operations of the Bill.  The report would also reduce the amount of correspondence coming to his Department or to his officials, as well as probably from the insurable public and Deputies, who have no other means of getting information except by correspondence or, finally, by questions to be answered in the House by the Minister.  I think the Minister is taking too serious a view of the <Col N="1477" /> demand contained in the amendment. I do not think that it would have any greater effect than, probably, engaging the time of one of his officials for a week or two in every year to compile and prepare for printing a report on the lines indicated.  The nature of the report is very largely left in the hands of the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree that, in respect of the sections concerning the determination of disputes, it might be desirable to publish information, much the same as information that is at present published concerning appeals under the Unemployment Insurance Act to the Umpire.  As Deputies who read the <i>Trade Journal</i> are aware, we periodically publish, without giving such information as will identify the parties, particulars of appeals taken to the Umpire, so that the nature of his decisions will be known and act as a guide to courts of referees, unemployment insurance officers, and the general public in connection with these matters.  In relation to these sections dealing with the determination of disputes, the publication of similar information in a similar way might be considered. But even there I do not think there should be a statutory obligation to publish, which is a very onerous matter in relation to a Bill of this kind, because it means not merely an official spending a week preparing a report, but that all the records of the Department dealing with all matters relating to insurance must be so kept that a report of the proceedings taken under the Bill is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desirable. Read the section dealing with the amalgamation of companies.  What report do you think could be published under that section?  That a particular scheme was received, that certain objections were voiced, that the scheme was amended in a particular way, and again objected to. Does the Deputy think that all that information should be published? These may be part of the Minister's proceedings under the Bill&mdash;the most important proceedings under the Bill <Col N="1478" />&mdash;but that information could not, I think, very well be made public, except in very rare cases, without very definite damage to particular interests</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the pieces of information that might be usefully included in this report, if it were published, would be the regulations which the Minister refused just now, through his voting power, to lay before the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>These would be one of the useful pieces of information some of us might want to have and which could be included in this report.  The information that is supplied in accordance with Section 27 of the Insurance Companies Act, 1909, so far as I can see, not having any great practical knowledge of the working of that section, is designed for the purpose of preventing any possible information from being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That section says that the Board of Trade shall lay annually before Parliament the accounts, balance sheets, abstracts, statements and any other documents under the Act.  I could not conceive any collection of documents more calculated to conceal rather than to give information than abstracts, accounts and other documents.  The real purpose of Section 27 is not to supply information to Parliament or to the public.  The sting is in the last part of Section 27.  It is to enable the Board of Trade to extract information from the companies that they do not want to give under the threat that it will be laid as a foot-note to the abstracts and documents that the Board of Trade is reporting to Parliament every year. That is the purpose of the section, in my view&mdash;not for the purpose of giving the public any information but for the purpose of extracting information from the insurance companies themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that that is the purpose, because the whole purpose of the Act was to implement the principle in relation to insurance <Col N="1479" /> business of freedom or non-interference, but full publicity.  That was the principle of the Act of 1909 and, to a large extent, is the principle of this Bill&mdash;to give the companies freedom to operate within certain limits and to ensure that there will be the fullest possible publicity as to their proceedings. These reports, which will be considerably amplified under the provisions of this Bill, will be put in that form every year.</P>

The Minister for Finance has taken the precaution of doing that in connection with certain financial resolutions we have had before us.  But, in view of the fact that we are now the solitary representative of the deliberative Oireachtas, I think it is right that we should understand what we are passing in Section 7, which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following portions of the Act of 1909 are hereby repealed as on and <Col N="1480" /> from the commencement of Part II of this Act, that is to say, sub-section (2) of Section 28, paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Section 31, paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 32, paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 33, and paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 34, and the Eighth Schedule.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister or the Attorney-General or any Deputy knows what any of those references are. Then the section goes on:</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Act of 1909 is hereby repealed as on and from the commencement of Part V of this Act.</P>
    <P>The following portion of the Act of 1909 is hereby repealed as on and from the commencement of Part VII of this Act, that is to say, in sub-section (1) of Section 3 all words from the words &ldquo;Provided that&rdquo; to the end of that sub-section.</P>
    <P>The Collecting Societies and Industrial Assurance Companies Act, 1896, is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>Not a single Deputy knows what any of these references mean.  I think it is highly desirable, when schedules of that kind are mentioned in a Bill of this character, that a memorandum should accompany the Bill setting out what these references are.  Is the Minister in a position to give us in résumé what these appeals represent, what effect they have on the existing law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The general question about memoranda can be discussed on another occasion.  In the main, these repeals are effected because fuller and better provision is being made in this Bill to deal with the particular matters to which these various sections and subsections relate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that. We all know that the Minister purports to put something in the place of most of what is repealed in the section. But the Minister has carefully refrained from stating that everything here repealed is replaced by something else.  For all we know, some of those repeals are alterations in the law without any substituted legislation. The Minister says that better <Col N="1481" /> and fuller provision is made.  That is a matter of opinion.  The purpose of discussion in this House is to make up our minds whether that is true or not. The Minister is impatient of that; he says it is obstruction.</P>

I submit that the House is entitled to expect from the Minister, where he finds it convenient to legislate by reference in that way, a memorandum explaining the section which he has deemed it expedient not to set out.</P>

      <P>Now that the Minister is no longer in Opposition, presumably he knows the Bill even better than he would have known it when he was in Opposition.  He himself says in answer to Deputy Dillon, that the reason why those various parts of the <Col N="1482" /> Act of 1909 are being repealed is because fuller and better provision is being made in the Bill.  I want to test him on that.  I want to test him by asking him the question: What fuller and better provision is being made in the Bill by reason of the repeal of sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act of 1909?  I will tell him what it is about; it is about Lloyds' insurance.  The Minister need not pretend that he has read it; we will assume that he has read it.  Will he tell us what better and fuller provisions are made in this present Bill for Lloyds' underwriters than were made by Section 28 (2) of the Act of 1909?</P>

I want to ask the Minister now, on the section which makes it unlawful for any person to carry on an assurance business in this country without an assurance licence, is he in a position to tell the House now what it will cost to get an assurance licence?  Unless we hear what an assurance company will be required to pay to get one of those licences, we cannot make up our minds whether we will make it illegal to carry on a business without one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) It shall not be lawful for any person to negotiate a contract of assurance in Saorstát Eireann save under licence (in this Act referred to as an agent's licence) granted by <Col N="1484" /> the Minister under this part of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2) Every person, who negotiates a contract of assurance in contravention of the foregoing sub-section of this section, shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    <P>I think it would be convenient to discuss amendments Nos. 14 and 24 together. Amendment No. 24 is really complementary to No. 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 prescribes that it shall not be lawful for a person to carry on assurance business without having a licence, and amendment No. 24 provides for the granting of those licences and the conditions under which they will be granted.  I realise that those amendments are to some extent revolutionary, and I know that they do not recommend themselves to a number of Deputies even on my own side of the House; at the same time I think a case can be made for them. The object of amendment No. 14 would be to exclude from the insurance business the bird of passage who has no intention of making insurance his career, and at the same time preserve the insurance business for those who are making insurance their career&mdash;to preserve it for the whole-time insurance man.  It may be said, as it has been said to me by different persons, that they would prefer to trust their premiums to people they know, like their bank manager or their local auctioneer or somebody of that kind who is in insurance business just as a side-line, than to entrust those premiums to the particular type of agent with whom they might be familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take a statement of that kind as being an argument in favour of this provision, because I believe that this provision, if given effect to, would wipe out the very type of agent whom those people had in mind.  If you make the insurance business something in the nature of a profession, at any rate something that is carried on under licence, and if you exclude the part-time agent whose main income <Col N="1485" /> comes from other sources, the undesirable type of agent will very soon disappear. Furthermore, when there are the provisions that follow later on, and an agent has hanging over him the threat that for any misconduct he may lose his licence and be put out of business, it would have, I should say, a very salutary effect.  The Minister himself, speaking at an earlier Stage of the Bill, said there was too much intensive canvassing, and that many of these agents were inclined to make fraudulent statements with regard to the policy they were trying to sell, in order to secure business.  I believe that, if a provision of this kind were made, by which agents were licensed, that type of agent would soon be wiped out.  I believe, first of all, that he might be the type of person who would be slow to pay the licence fee which is prescribed by amendment No. 24, and that if, in addition to any other penalties, there was the danger to him, if he desired to carry on the business, of losing his licence, it would prevent him indulging in the practice of trying to persuade policy-holders that he was giving them something better than he really was giving them.</P>
    <P>Now, in a sense, this is not so very revolutionary, inasmuch as we have certainly had precedents in this House for making certain trades or professions exclusive to certain individuals. I understand that there is on the stocks at the moment a Bill making the auctioneering business to some extent exclusive.  I was hoping that Deputy Haslett would be here, because I understand that he is very much opposed to the provisions of these amendments which would wipe out the part-time agents, because auctioneers do a good deal in the way of part-time insurance business.  If Deputy Haslett had been here, I was going to put it to him that what was sauce for the auctioneer goose ought to be sauce for the insurance agent gander, and I was hoping that I could persuade him that, if he hopes to get a Bill through the House making the auctioneering business exclusive, he ought to support the insurance agents in making their business a whole-time business and exclusive to that extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> There is an argument that can be used also with regard to many of these part-time agents who do work in the ordinary branch business.  I think it is fairly generally known that very many of these agents are rather inclined to discourage the persons whom they wish to entice into taking out policies from doing business with the Irish companies.  For the most part they are the agents of foreign companies, and, naturally, they are going to try to sell to the prospective policy-holder the insurance policy of the company for which they are agents.  It is also to some extent objectionable that many of these agents are in a privileged position where they can practically force people to take out policies, and that they use those positions to gain an advantage that they might not otherwise gain, and to gain an additional income to their ordinary income. They are in a position, at least, that the ordinary agent is not in, in canvassing insurance.  The ordinary agent has to sell the insurance policy for what it is worth.  He has to make his arguments and to show the value of the policy, whereas many of the others in privileged positions have a big stick to hold over a person in order to make him take out a policy.  It would not be quite so bad if they were agents for Irish companies, but I should say that 95 per cent. of them at least are the agents of foreign companies.</P>
    <P>I think there is a case for having the agents of companies licensed, and I think that the effect of having them licensed would be to secure better service for policy-holders.  You would provide, in time at any rate, a better type of man entering into the insurance business&mdash;a better type of agent, who would give more direct information to the prospective policy-holder, and the policy-holder would benefit to that extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch is correct when he says that a number of statutes were enacted providing for the setting up of registers for persons engaging in different professions and for confining these registers to persons with particular qualifications, or recruited in a particular way.  He will remember, however, that when the doctors and <Col N="1487" /> dentists and veterinary surgeons had been covered by such legislation, and demands for similar measures came pouring in from architects, engineers, hairdressers, auctioneers and valuers, opinions in all parts of this House rather reacted against such legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, in fact, none of these measures ever appeared here except the Auctioneers and Valuers Bill, which appeared here in 1931 and has not got beyond the Second Stage since then, because, I think, of the feeling which existed and evidently still exists among members of all Parties that the restriction of entry into these occupations should not be effected, however desirable it might be to control the activities of persons engaged in these occupations or to improve the conditions under which they work.  If, therefore, Deputy Lynch has in mind the idea of putting insurance agents into the same position as veterinary surgeons or dentists or doctors, and elevating insurance work to the status of a profession and confining it to certain classes of people, then I think I would have to oppose him on principle.  In so far, however, as his main desire is to improve the conditions under which the majority of insurance agents work, and to give them an opportunity of getting a better livelihood out of the insurance business by providing that the business should be carried on, in so far as it is possible, by persons who are working wholetime in it&mdash;even though the number of such persons might be restricted&mdash;rather than that it should be carried on by a much larger number of persons to whom it was only a sideline, I have sympathy with that idea.  My objection to the Deputy's amendments, and my objection to any proposal for the implementation of that idea which has been conveyed to me, is a purely practical one.  I think that this proposal of the Deputy's is completely impracticable and that it could not possibly work.  After all, he suggests that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his discretion, should issue a licence to a person to act as an <Col N="1488" /> insurance agent, subject to his being satisfied on certain points, into which I shall go later.  Now, take the very first suggestion: that the Minister should have discretion in the granting or withholding of a licence.  The Deputy sees at once that it would be a very difficult position for any Minister to be in, because no matter how he arranges to have every application determined, it is bound to be alleged against the Minister, as Deputies who sit in this House regularly know, that he is allowing political considerations, or personal considerations, or some other extraneous considerations, to influence his judgment.</P>
      <P>Every person who is refused a licence will have a grievance, and is going to say that the refusal was due to some other cause except his unworthiness to have it.  He is going to allege political victimisation or something of that kind, and in the eyes of the Opposition everyone who gets a licence is bound to be a Government supporter.  It can be seen that that procedure is ruled out.  It is doubly ruled out when the Deputy sets out the ground upon which the Minister would have to consider each application, first, that &ldquo;the Minister is satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold such licence.&rdquo; How is the Minister to satisfy himself that the applicant was a fit and proper person?  He could not do that.  Yet this is what follows: every person to whom he issues the licence is deemed in consequence of that to be a fit and proper person to hold a licence.  The Minister is not merely giving permission to carry on the business, but the fact is, he is giving a certificate that he is &ldquo;a fit and proper person&rdquo; to do so, when he may be nothing of the kind. The Minister would not be in a position to check up the fact that he was a fit and proper person, and some person who was defrauded by a dishonest agent would feel that he had a grievance because he trusted that agent on the strength of the fact that he held a Minister's licence that he was &ldquo;a fit and proper person,&rdquo; and so on with the other consideration:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the applicant is not engaged in <Col N="1489" /> any other business and is devoting or is about to devote his whole time to the assurance business.</P>
    <P>Again, the question of the machinery comes in, because it would require very elaborate investigation before the Minister could honestly give the certificate that that was a fact in relation to any applicant.  The actual provision of the fee is a minor matter. Therefore, the objection to the Deputy's proposal is that practically it could not be done in that way.  I am saying that, although I am in sympathy with the idea, in so far as it can be ensured, that insurance business should be carried on by persons who are engaged whole-time in it, rather than by bank managers and auctioneers&mdash;not forgetting the lawyers, who supplement their incomes from that source by occasionally acting as insurance agents.</P>
    <P>I say that on consideration of the whole matter, even if there were not the other factor to which the Deputy alluded, and which in present circumstances has some force, that these spare-time agents are, in the main, agents of external companies, and exercise considerable influence in turning insurance business from native companies.  In accordance with the Government's general policy of regulating conditions of employment in particular occupations in the interests of persons following these occupations, action on the lines suggested by, the Deputy would be in accordance with our views, and while such action would be logical, my difficulty is that no practical method has been suggested to which obvious objections could not be advanced, and consequently I feel that it is undesirable to put any such provision in this Bill. In any event a provision of this kind should be embodied in a conditions of employment Bill of some kind relating to clerical work or to work of that class rather than in an insurance Bill, just as statutory provisions governing conditions of employment in say, a railway workshop are not in the Transport Act but in the Conditions of Employment Act.  When the general code, to which reference has been made, designed to cover conditions of employment in all occupations is extended, it <Col N="1490" /> may be possible to make some provisions covering persons in the insurance business, but I do not quite see how these provisions can meet all points that the various agents' associations are anxious to have met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely opposed both to the suggestion put forward by Deputy Lynch and to the principle embodied in it.  It is the sort of amendment, of course, on which it is possible that an amount of nonsense could be talked.  I am not saying that it is put forward by Deputy Lynch for that reason, but the amendment is one, not in favour of the employees but of the big companies.  That may come as a surprise to the Minister.  I think the Minister would be most delighted if such an amendment were carried, and so would the companies, because it would save them a great deal of trouble, a considerable amount of money by way of commission, but would do the employees no good whatever. That is not the principle I object to.  I object to it on two grounds, that it is an endeavour to create a new privileged class, and as a consumer, using the word in its broadest sense, I object to being further fleeced.  We are being fleeced by the Minister, right, left and centre, on every possible commodity. The fact that there are numbers of gentlemen, including those much-condemned gentlemen, the lawyers, acting as agents is the greatest possible protection for policy-holders, and would be policy-holders. They can get better terms than they would get if there was only a privileged small class of fixed canvassers available, with whom they had to place their orders whether they liked them or not.  There is nothing to be said for the amendment.  I should say that a number of people who have had the misfortune, of trying to earn their living as agents for certain classes of insurance have very great difficulty in doing so, and consequently if their field of operations was confined to themselves, they feel that a great benefit would be conferred upon them. The Minister fell into the trap.  He talked glibly about sympathy with Deputy Lynch while all the time turning down the amendment by suggestions of an irrelevant ground.  There <Col N="1491" /> is no Conditions of Employment Bill in which a provision of that kind could be properly inserted.  This proposal would be in favour of the employers, and not in favour of the employees, and it is into that trap that the Minister walked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this amendment, I suggest that one fact has been lost sight of.  Those who have been mentioned as agents for insurance companies, bank managers, solicitors, and auctioneers, are able to perform certain service to persons effecting insurance which I think Deputy Lynch did not appreciate when he proposed the amendment. A person who has a place insured has perhaps a very hazy opinion of the insurable value of the premises.  A bank manager is continually dealing with advances and has got a very sure idea of the market value, and is probably able to suggest that the place is either over insured, under insured, or is not insured at all.  Solicitors and auctioneers are probably in a similar position.  It has been claimed that this business should be reserved for a whole-time insurance agent.  I suggest that such a person does not exist at the present time.  The whole-time insurance man is in the direct employment, and is the servant, of one of the insurance companies.  I do not see how a sort of direct whole-time insurance agent is going to be created. If he is a person of real insurance ability, who spends his whole time following up insurance business, it will not be very long until he is absorbed into the service of an insurance company. The three classes that have been mentioned have to deal with property from time to time, and are more or less experts valuing it, in transferring it, or in some other transaction in connection with property. People who have property to insure may not be able very readily to lay their hands on the class of whole-time insurance agent that Deputy Lynch has in view.  If they went and asked for expert advice and did not take it, the insurance agent might feel aggrieved at such action; whereas if <Col N="1492" /> some passing reference is made to the value of a property during the period that it is under review by a bank manager or solicitor, it is quite another matter.  For that reason I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Dockrell seems to have completely misunderstood what I endeavoured to point out.  He looks on the agent in this amendment as some person who is a vacuum and who is not attached to any insurance company.  By an agent I mean a person who is employed by an insurance company and who canvasses for an insurance company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, either a salary or commission.  It depends on the particular insurance company.  Some have canvassers who are paid salaries; others have canvassers who are paid a small salary and a commission, while some agents are paid entirely on commission. The agents to whom I am referring and the agents for whom I am trying to provide are persons employed by existing insurance companies. I do not accept Deputy Costello's view that this provision would be of no benefit to the agents. He said it would be of benefit merely to the insurance companies.  I agree it would be of benefit to the insurance companies, but I think it would be of far more direct benefit to the agents. It would be of benefit to the companies to the extent that the persons who would be employed by them would be of a better type than the persons they are getting now.</P>

      <P>The agents would be well able to look after themselves in that respect.  The companies would benefit to the extent I have indicated, and they would also benefit by the fact that they would not be let in for the misrepresentation of the agent to policy-holders.  The amendment is intended primarily for the benefit of the agents.  I have made my case for <Col N="1493" /> it, and I do not think that anything Deputy Costello has said can change my views.</P>

      <P>It amused me to observe the flash of friendly recognition that passed over the countenance of the Minister when he heard a proposal being made that would permit him to dragoon another section of the community. That element in Deputy Lynch's amendment appealed strongly to his soul, and it was with grief that he could think of no practical way of operating it.  It would be such a joy to him to get another body of persons whose every action he could control. In my humble judgment, this amendment has nothing to recommend it in theory or practice.  I think it is fundamentally rotten from both points of view.  Deputy Lynch, who is familiar with my emphatic style, will excuse the strength of the language which I use. This amendment is designed to facilitate the Minister into dragooning people in their everyday work in a manner which I think is highly undesirable. It is an amendment which will react almost exclusively to the advantage of insurance companies, who will have their agents in a strait-jacket. The companies will inevitably say: &ldquo;Whereas we have given you 20 or 30 per cent.  heretofore, you have such a large area to cover now, and so much more a fertile field, that we propose to reduce your commission.  If you do not like it you can lump it, as we can get another man.&rdquo;  It has this additional difficulty.  Instead of reducing the number of agents, it might eventually operate to increase the number of agents and make things far worse than they now are, because what is to prevent one of these legal agents, who would be created by Deputy Lynch's amendment, employing agents of his own?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But he would not carry out the contract.  The making of a contract of insurance is defined by the Bill and if I were a sub-agent to an agent I would take good care not to carry out the contract.  I would go in to Deputy Lynch, if he were a shopkeeper, and I would say: &ldquo;I know a man who will insure your property very advantageously.  Will you give your business to him?&rdquo; Deputy Lynch would ask me who he was and I would describe him.  I would say: &ldquo;If you take out the contract of insurance with him, this is what he will sign but this is not the contract.  I will read you the notes I made when I was looking at the contract.&rdquo;  Deputy Lynch would then say: &ldquo;I shall be glad to deal with him on these terms.&rdquo;  I would then trot over to the legal agent, supply him with the particulars I had received from Deputy Lynch, and he would then draw up the contract and I would carry it back to Deputy Lynch. I would be merely acting as a messenger between the legal agent and Deputy Lynch.  Can the Deputy prevent that?  Where are we going to draw the line?  Are we going to provide that if a policeman sees a person crossing the street he must ask that person the purpose for which he is crossing the street?  If we do not, how are we to prevent people obliging their neighbours and accepting a honorarium for obliging them?  That cock will not fight and it is a good job it will not fight because, if it did, it would provide the Minister with another opportunity to dragoon yet another section of the community.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister cannot see his way to accept this amendment.  I think it has a great <Col N="1495" /> deal more to recommend it than the reverse.  I do not at all accept the view that it would create a specialised class of insurance men, or that it would increase the price of insurance. On the contrary, I think it would effect a reduction, and in proof of that, I might point to the instance of the Public Bodies Mutual.  They have no agents in the accepted sense of the word.  Consequently their rates are much lower.  In my opinion this would be a move in the same direction.  There would, of course, be agents still operating, but we would not have the same plethora of agents that we have at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they should be made a special class or a privileged class.  Why should we not put insurance on as high a plane as the law or any other profession?  I see nothing at all against it.  With regard to the special advantages to which Deputy Dockrell has referred, in the case of men insuring through bank managers. I cannot see the point of that argument at all, because it seemed to refer to fire and general insurance.  I think if a man is insuring his premises, he, as the person who bought the premises, knows its value better than the bank manager.  On the question of the character of the people with whom you do your insurance, I do not think that there is a whole lot in the argument that the types of people referred to here have been the desirable types.  I do not think my experience would support that, and I have had some experience in this regard.  I have seen things happening that were very little short of blackmail on the part of these people&mdash;things which could not be attempted by the agent.  Nobody could get after these people because, usually, the victim had his head in the lion's mouth and, if he squeaked, the jaws closed upon him.  There is a good deal to be said for this proposal, and I regret that the Minister cannot see his way to accept it.</P>

      <P>So that this has application to persons who are only ordinarily resident here.  If it has that limitation then they are prevented from doing any sort of insurance business, not in regard to property in the Saorstát or risks that may arise in the Saorstát, but from doing insurance business of any type once they leave the country as long as they can be caught up hereafter.  If a Saorstát national goes abroad for a period and wants to effect some short-term insurance for the period during which he is abroad, and comes back with that particular term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, likely to arise outside.  That phrase, by the way, is not in the section either.  Let us take it that &ldquo;person&rdquo; means only a person within the jurisdiction of the Saorstát. Does the Minister mean that if a person within the jurisdiction of the Saorstát goes abroad and effects any type of short-term insurance and comes back before the whole period is expired, he is supposed to be caught by Section 9?  I take it that he is not, that there is no intention of affecting that man injuriously with regard to that class of insurance. But is it clear that it does not affect him?</P>

      <P>Good, sound reasons. On the section, supposing a person here, an Irish national, wants to insure his life and for some reason there is a combination of the insurance companies operating here in the Irish Free State against him and they will not insure his life, a good, sound life. He is able to effect an insurance through Lloyd's or some other agency not licensed to carry on business here. Is it intended, in those circumstances, apart from what Section 9 does, to prevent an Irish national from laying off an insurance on his life which he cannot effect here with any existing company?</P>

      <P>What will happen suppose you desire to cover a risk that no Irish company will take?  I refer now to any licensed company operating in Ireland.  I have had experience of trying to get a risk covered by companies who will be licensed under this Bill and none of them would cover it.  Eventually, I got it covered by Lloyd's and it was necessary to get it covered at the time.  If this Bill were in operation I would have suffered a loss which would completely wipe me out of existence because I could not cover it by insurance. It amazes me if it is not the Minister's intention to make some exception in respect of that.  He says it is only fooling around to try to clear the ambiguities of Section 9. There is no doubt that Section 9 is so drafted as to avoid doing most of what the Minister desires to have done and to effect at least two results which nobody intends and nobody wants.  However, the Minister is irritated and I assume that between now and the Report Stage the proper amendments will be brought in to set the matter to rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No Government Department, Government owned or controlled company or public authority shall place any fire and accident business with any foreign company until either such body has entered into an agreement with a Saorstát Eireann company or companies to insure with it or with them such business or such portion of the business as the company or companies may agree to accept or such company or companies have refused to accept such business or any portion of such business.</P>
      <P>In proposing this amendment I wish to say that I am sorry Deputy Norton is not here because his amendment, No. 17, has much the same object in view.  The object of my amendment is to see that Government Departments, and companies and bodies generally under the control of the Government, will give preference to Irish insurance companies where they have insurance business to dispose of. The general provisions of this Bill are anything but favourable to the Irish insurance companies, and in order to make up for what those companies are going to lose as a result of its passing, it is only right that the Government should be prepared to give them some <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to the Government, in a matter of this kind, to set a headline to the public generally.  If the Government are not prepared to stand by the Irish companies and assist them, then they cannot expect that the public are going to give a preference to the Irish companies.  In the past, local <Col N="1509" /> authorities have certainly been very sympathetic to the Irish companies. The Irish National Government has not shown the same disposition.  As a matter of fact, it has been the other way about.  The Irish companies have always shown a disposition to support our Government, whatever Government was in office, particularly in such matters as the floating of National Loans.  No institutions in the country came more readily to the support of whatever Government happened to be in power at the time of the floating of National Loans than the Irish insurance companies.  They were the first to come forward with very heavy subscriptions, subscriptions out of all proportion to their capital funds.  I think that shows clearly the importance of having Irish companies that are sympathetic to the Government.  I think it is only right that there should be some reciprocity, and that the Government, so far as it can, should assist the Irish companies with business within its disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy puts forward this amendment as a means of compensating the Irish fire and accident offices for what he states they are going to lose under the Bill.  The Irish fire and accident offices are not going to lose anything under the Bill; on the contrary, I think that they are going to gain considerably and that the provisions of this measure will result in their getting a much larger proportion of the fire and accident business arising in the Saorstát in future than they have got in the past.  The principles of the Bill have been discussed, and the Deputy is no doubt aware of them. We are proposing to allow this business to be carried on by any licensed company that conforms to the provisions of the measure, and the reinsurance provisions in the Bill will mean that a much larger proportion of all such business arising here will be retained within the country and a very considerable part of it will find its way to the Saorstát offices.  Under these circumstances, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the other provisions of the Bill to which I have referred are <Col N="1510" /> ample to ensure that the Irish fire and accident offices will get as large a proportion of the business as they are able to handle, and I think it would be objectionable to restrict the activities of foreign companies in the particular manner proposed.  The matter of restricting foreign companies in fire and accident business was very carefully considered, and, for the reasons I stated in the course of the Second Reading discussion, it was decided not to restrict them otherwise than as proposed in the Bill, and certainly not to prohibit them from doing that business here.  The circumstances under which that decision was taken may change at some time, and if, at any period, the Government in office consider it desirable to impose fresh restrictions upon these companies, it should, I think, be done directly, and not in the indirect manner the Deputy suggests in this amendment.  The limitation of the classes of persons who might do particular kinds of business with certain licensed companies would be a difficult thing to control and is, I think, objectionable in principle. We believe that the Bill as framed will confer considerable benefit upon the Saorstát fire and accident offices, and that it is not necessary to insert any additional provisions of this kind in order to effect the same purpose.</P>

      <P>I indicated that the Government's intention was to ensure that, through the reinsurance provision, a proportion of all fire and accident business arising in the Saorstát would be available for Saorstát companies, and that in that way these companies would be enabled to get whatever proportion of the total business their resources permit them to handle.  That proportion will increase continuously as the Bill comes into operation, and in consequence of these provisions, the growth of strong Irish <Col N="1511" /> companies doing this class of business will be promoted.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I am entirely in favour of Deputy Bourke's amendment in all its details, but there is this clarity about it, that it says that Government Departments, Government owned or controlled companies, and public authorities must place fire and accident business with a foreign company, only after there has been agreement with a Saorstát Eireann company or companies to insure with it or with them such business or such portion of the business as the company or companies may agree to accept.  Deputy Bourke's amendment aims at this, and says that, so far as Government Departments, Government owned or controlled companies, or public authorities are concerned, they must, first of all, approach, not the Reinsurance Company of Ireland, which may be some peculiar abnormality of which we have no conception of the moment, but some of the ordinary fire and accident companies of Saorstát Eireann origin, or companies described as being of Saorstát Eireann origin, and offer the business to them, and they can take whatever proportion of it they like.  That is a concrete proposal.  The Minister says <Col N="1512" /> his intentions are to achieve a similar result.  How?  Is it through the reinsurance company?</P>

The sections from Section 72 on allow for the formation of this reinsurance company, but where is the section which even hints that the reinsurance is going to be put out on commission amongst the existing Irish companies, or does it do that?</P>

      <P>The Reinsurance Company will carry on as an ordinary reinsurance company.  It will effect these reinsurance treaties on a reciprocal basis.  Perhaps I had better read for the Deputy what I said in introducing the measure, at column 1723 of the Official Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proposed that every licensed company, Saorstát or foreign, shall enter into reinsurance treaties with the Reinsurance Company ceding a proportion of its Irish reinsurance business.  The terms of the Treaty and the proportion of the business to be ceded will be agreed by the board of the company.  The company will at its own option cede risks reinsured with it giving preference to the Saorstát companies wherever practicable.  As all treaties at present granted are reciprocal, it will be seen that the external companies will be giving up a portion of their business by ceding to the Reinsurance Company unless the company enters into reciprocal treaties.  In this way a certain amount of the Irish business and the profit attaching thereto will pass into Irish hands.  This method will provide proper insurance facilities in general and for compulsory insurance in particular, and the business ceded to the Saorstát companies will help them to establish themselves.  When this stage is reached the advantage of a Saorstát company over an external company in securing Saorstát business will, it is believed, enable them to obtain <Col N="1513" /> a proper share of that business, and expedite the arrival of the day on which the limitation of the business to Saorstát companies will be practicable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>So far as the section was originally drafted it purported to exclude foreign companies from issuing policies of insurance here, but it did not exclude persons who are acting, in fact, as agents for foreign companies inside Saorstát Eireann; so it is suggested that the words &ldquo;or a person wherever resident or doing business&rdquo; should be inserted in addition to foreign companies in sub-section (2).

    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that a company which is unlicensed for the transaction of insurance business in this country will not be allowed to display, or otherwise solicit, business from persons intending to take out an insurance policy of any kind.  In the moneylenders' legislation, at present in force, certain restrictions are imposed.  On reflection, now, I do not think that moneylenders from abroad are forbidden to advertise here, but the form of their advertisement is very restricted.

      <P>Sub-section (2) of this section relates to something which is in existence now or may exist in the future.  In my recollection of the various measures in which I was responsible for that phrase, such as the Control of Manufactures Act, the necessity for it arose out of the fact that the qualifying condition, such as the condition which required a person to be born in the Saorstát, was something which commenced to operate before the Saorstát was established, and before the area of the Saorstát became defined.  A particular section of the Control of Manufactures Act says that a facility or concession is available to any person born in Saorstát Eireann, or the area which is now comprised in Saorstát Eireann, and the necessity for that qualification is quite clear in that case, because, of course, a person might be born in the area long before Saorstát Eireann was constituted.</P>

That sub-section is put in, as similar sub-sections were put in a multitude of Bills, because it has become an established practice, on an application for a licence, or some application of that kind, to require by fee recoupment of the cost of consideration <Col N="1521" /> of the application; that is, the cost of the stationery or clerical work involved.

      <P>As far as I can see from sub-section (7), which says, &ldquo;On every application under this section for an assurance licence there shall be paid such fee as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall prescribe...&rdquo;, it does not clearly state that the Minister shall first prescribe a fee for all companies, and then that all companies will be called upon to pay that fee. It leaves it open to him to prescribe a different fee for each company.  I want to have it made clear that the Minister will prescribe the same fee for every company, so that there will be no possibility of this power of fixing fees being used hereafter for the purpose of excluding somebody from entering business by making it very high for one entrant and comparatively low for another.</P>

There is the right of appeal again given from the Minister's decision.  It is not intended to have different fees for different companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the herring industry in this country, and asked him what he was going to do to get a market for the herring which were being caught in Donegal.  I desire to remind those Deputies who are interested in fisheries that at this time of year we are referring to the matje herring which is a peculiar commodity having as one of its outstanding characteristics the fact that even when cured it will not keep as well as the summer or autumn herring will keep.  Our trade for this herring in the old days was with Russia, Germany and the United States of America.  One of our principal markets was Germany, and by the quality of this particular type of fish we built up in Germany a goodwill so effective that German merchants specifically sought out Donegal herrings. With the development of economic nationalism, which has spread all over Europe, the Government of the German Reich attempted to develop their own fishing fleets, and one of the methods to which they resorted was to restrict entry to their market very severely, with the result that they determined to exclude any exporter whom they thought they were in a position to exclude&mdash;who could not get back on them in any effective way.  They, therefore, attacked the British exporters and the Irish exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of years ago we reached the stage at which the German Government refused to take any Irish herring at all, but owing to the proximity of <Col N="1523" /> Derry to the Donegal coast a number of boats put out&mdash;they were British trawlers&mdash;and fished the Donegal coast, brought the herring into Burtonport, Downings, Kincasslagh and Buncrana and cured it there; sent it to Derry or got from the Derry shippers quota certificates, and with those quota certificates shipped the herring to Germany, representing that because the fish had been caught by British trawlers in neutral waters, and had only been processed in Irish Free State territory, it was reasonable to say that they came within the British quota for the German market, and were therefore exportable on that representation. Up to last year that expedient succeeded, with the result that our matje herrings were got away, and profitably so.  This year the German Government has fixed exporters with notice that they will not accept herring which has been cured in the Saorstát, no matter how or where it is caught, and that any herring to be exported on the British quota must be cured in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Now, a lot of people might say: &ldquo;Well, the German market which is available for imports of herring is so small that it is unreasonable to press our Government to insist on a share of it.&rdquo;  Let me tell the House that the British share of the German quota for herring is 700,000 barrels for this year, and I think it is true to say that if we could get a quota of 60,000 barrels&mdash;I want to understate my case, if anything, because I believe it is a good one&mdash;we would clear all the herring we could catch.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting to the House that we could fairly ask the Minister to get all of that this year, but I am suggesting this: Last year we gave the Germans a trade agreement of 3 to 1. and before trade agreements were the order of the day at all we put a lot of business in the way of the German people in connection with the Shannon scheme.  This year the German Government knew that it was of special importance to us to get a market for herring, and we were negotiating a trade treaty with them. I say that the Minister for Agriculture was gravely remiss in his duty when <Col N="1524" /> he did not insist that this ultimatum would be handed to the Government of the German Reich: &ldquo;Either you take part of our herring exports or we will make no agreement with you.&rdquo;  A map has been displayed downstairs in the Lobby during the last week or so showing Deputies from all over the country where there is the deepest depression in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty and Deputy Brian Brady will tell us that that map in no way exaggerates the situation in West Donegal.  It is the area in Ireland where unemployment is worst.  The Government, Sir, has boasted that under their dispensation the poor are better off than they ever were before. I make bold to say that there is a section of the poor who are better off than they ever were before, and that is the poor who do not want to work; they are better off because they are getting unemployment assistance.  But the great majority of the poor in this country are the poor who want to work, who want to earn their living, and who would much prefer to earn their living than get doles or outdoor assistance of any kind, and it is on behalf of those poor that I am concerned to solicit the support of Deputies in this House now.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of men in County Donegal who could keep the wheel turning and make a modest living if they could only get the fish, and remember that not only will the men get work but there is a large number of girls who are engaged in this curing business, and who have brought in invaluable revenue to that very area which is coloured black on the map displayed by the Department of Finance in connection with the unemployment problem.  As things are at present, the herring is being caught by trawlers and brought into Burtonport. That herring has to be loaded on lorries there, carted into Derry, and the curing carried out there.  The result of that is that the majority of our girls are not getting work to-day. Those who are getting work have to spend half their income in paying for lodgings and subsistence in the City of Derry.  They have to abandon a mode of livelihood which leaves them in their homes, move into the City of <Col N="1525" /> Derry and work there as curing girls under conditions which are not perhaps at all as acceptable as those which would obtain in their native surroundings.</P>
    <P>Remember that Germany is one of the alternative markets of which Fianna Fáil used to boast so much. Germany was one of the countries in which we were going to dispose of a great part of the agricultural surplus for which there was no longer any market in Great Britain.  I am not asking that we should trespass widely or extravagantly on the German market.  All I am asking is that the Germans will give us 5 per cent. of what they are giving the British in their herring market&mdash;35,000 barrels for the first year.  On that basis I am prepared to give them a two-to-one agreement, but I say that it is an outrage to ask us to take £2 worth of merchandise for every £1 the Germans take from us, unless the Germans are prepared to take something which we find some difficulty in disposing of. The only things which the German Reich seems to be prepared to take from us at the present time are things that we ought to have no difficulty in disposing of, and at a much better price than the Germans would give us for them, if we would dispose of them in the ordinary market which is there for the taking.  All we actually give the Germans now are cattle, shillings below the British price, and we have to pay them for taking them away.</P>

      <P>The general merits of the trade agreement with Germany do not arise, but the Deputy is perfectly in order in suggesting that the Minister should have secured in that market a quota for Irish herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, all I say is that the herring should certainly make a part of any agreement which leaves us in a disadvantageous position vis-a-vis Germany, and if we can get even 5 per cent. of what Great Britain is getting I hold that it will be a step in the right direction and, of course, if we can get the 60,000 barrels it will be all the better.  Even if it should mean a three-to-one agreement with Germany <Col N="1526" /> I shall do all I can to support it, because I want work for the people of Donegal instead of doles or outdoor relief because I know that the people there are ready to work.  Deputies Brian Brady and Doherty on that side of the House know that just as much as Deputy McMenamin and I know it on this side of the House.  I do find fault, however, with these Deputies for not having made a stiffer fight in the ranks of their own Party, together with Deputies from Connemara and Kerry, to get what they are entitled to get from the Government which boasted so much of what they were going to do for the poor of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am given to understand that the Minister is developing some kind of a scheme for curing and storing the matje herring and having it sent across Channel.  I want to point out to the Minister that that is risky, because the matje herring, being a fat herring, is peculiarly likely to go bad if not properly cured, and if that should happen, frightful damage would be done to the market which has always existed for the Donegal herring.  There has always been a market for the Donegal matje herring, because the matje herring has always been recognised as, <i>par excellence</i>, the best of the herring trade.  Therefore, I hold that it would be infinitely preferable to take that herring and dump it into the sea rather than allow it into the market in an imperfect condition.  However, apart from that, I say that it is deplorable that herring should be brought in and have to be dumped in the sea owing to the circumstances I have mentioned.  That is a shocking state of affairs, and I say that it is very unfair to the people of Buncrana to see the herring being brought in and carted off in lorries to Derry, where dozens of people are getting good pay for handling the herring, while nobody in Buncrana can get a day's work.  I feel that if Deputies here from other parts of the country understood the situation as well as we do, they would join with us in pressing the Government to say to the German Reich: &ldquo;No herring, no agreement.&rdquo;  If that had been done, some concession could have been got for the fishermen of our <Col N="1527" /> western coasts.  Perhaps the Minister was deterred by the fear that, if they did so, and if he failed to get an agreement with Germany as a result of that, he would have been jeered at here because one of his alternative markets had disappeared.  If the Minister had that fear, then he is a bad judge of political psychology.  If he came in here and said that he had failed to agree with the German Reich because they would not accept our herrings, I believe that he would have the unanimous support of all sides of the House. What I urge on him now is, if possible, to reopen the trade agreement with Germany and to offer, even at this eleventh hour, to extend that agreement to a three to one agreement if they will take 60,000 barrels of herring from us.  If the Minister will do that, so far as I am concerned I shall heartily support him, and I think I can answer for most of my colleagues when I say that he will receive scant criticism for adopting that course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, Sir, with some of what Deputy Dillon said.  I agree that the conditions are such that they deserve that every consideration should be given to those parts of Donegal where herring fishing is taking place.  As a matter of fact, I stated publicly in Donegal, when I met the fishermen there, that I had personally told the delegates going to Germany that the herring was the most important item in this year's trade agreement, and the delegates went to Germany with the herring as the item that should be put first of all in these discussions. That was true and, during those negotiations, I received at least two or three communications telling me that it was absolutely impossible to get the Germans to agree to take our herrings.  As a matter of fact, I received one of those communications, as it happened, in Downings, during the time that I was meeting the fishermen there.  That communication was forwarded from my office in Dublin be cause it was known that I was going to meet the fishermen on that occasion. That was our position, but the Germans also pressed us very hard to take certain things from them and we <Col N="1528" /> also refused to take them.  We had to put up with the situation as regards ourselves, and the Germans had to put up with the situation as regards themselves.  Possibly, the things the Germans wanted us to take were not as important for them as the herring was for some of our people.  However, that is the position at present. I would be quite agreeable to say, even now, to Germany: &ldquo;We will give you three to one against anything you may give us for herrings.&rdquo;  I am very doubtful, however, if they would be tempted even by that offer, because they refused to discuss the taking of herrings from us at all.  As far as I understand it, their plea was that they had already agreed to take from Great Britain more than they could afford, and were, therefore, importing more than they would require.  However, as I say, they would not take our herrings.  It is possible, of course, at all times, to return to that question, especially on what might be called a special bargain.  In other words, if we were giving some special order to Germany, such as for machinery for a new State factory&mdash;if there were such a thing as a beet factory going up or something of that nature&mdash;the matter would certainly be raised again, and it may be possible to succeed in that way during the year.  Negotiations are also being carried on with two or three other Continental countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of herring that we shall possibly have for export this year will not be very large.  I think that Deputy Dillon's figure would be about the outside figure.  In fact, I do not think it will be anything like 60,000 barrels.  If we look at our exports for some years past, it will be noticed that it was a kind of cycle&mdash;very small in 1924 and increasing somewhat up to 1927, when between 60,000 and 70,000 barrels were exported to Germany, and then decreasing from that on to 1934, when it went as low as about 1,000 barrels.  It has been going up since that, and it is expected that this year it will be something over what it was last year, but nothing very big. However, although I admit that it is a misfortune that we cannot do more for the marketing of our herring, on the <Col N="1529" /> other hand I must say that I do not think things have got too bad up to the moment.  I have just got a cutting here from the <i>Derry Journal</i> of the 27th May, which reported some of the prices for herring.  According to that report, they were sold at Buncrana at 30/- a cran, and at Downings also for 30/-, which is, on the whole, as good as the average price for the last ten years, taking one year with another. It is not as good as we would like to see the fishermen getting, yet it is as good as they have been getting, taking the average for the last ten years. The catch so far has not been very big, but it is expected that it will be bigger than that of last year.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that the particular instance quoted by Deputy Dillon, of herring being thrown back into the sea, was an isolated one, as far as my Department is aware, and was not due to the fact that there was no market.  It was due to the fact that these herring were taken from Kincasslagh to Downings and were injured on the way.  They were unfit for sale by the time they reached Downings and had to be dumped into the sea. There would be sale for the herring if they were in fit condition.  To give the impression that herring are being thrown back into the sea because there is no sale for them does not fit in with the facts.  I am pleased that this matter has been raised, because I think it is due to Deputies, and to the country at large, that it should be known that, so far as the Government is concerned, they made every possible effort to find a market for herring in Germany, and are making every effort possible in that direction in Germany and in other Continental countries.</P>
    <P>I think we must all agree that when two countries are negotiating a trade treaty, and if one country absolutely refuses to take a particular commodity, <Col N="1530" /> it is a matter, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, either of breaking or of saying that we must only make the best bargain we can.  I do not think we would have gained anything by breaking, when everything is taken into consideration.  I do not think Deputy Dillon need be in any way afraid that it was through not wanting to find a possible way out.  We were prepared to break with Germany if we thought that by breaking we were going to succeed in getting anything better.  We came to the conclusion, taking everything into consideration, that whether we broke or not it was impossible at that time, at any rate, to get this quota for herring from Germany.</P>

      <P>Might I make a suggestion to the Minister in the most helpful spirit in my power?  Would he be prepared to open negotiations with the British Ministry for the exchange of, say, 25,000 barrels of their quota for some trade concession on our part?  Germany would take the British quota certificate for Donegal herring, and has indicated, in correspondence that I have, not only a readiness but an eagerness to get matje herring, which are only available to the end of this month, when accompanied by a British certificate? It may be that we could make that trade a matter of exchange.  Will the Minister examine that question?</P>

      <P>Mr. Michael Gibbons, of Gurthenacullan, Shrah, Tourmakeady, County Mayo, made a renewed application for unemployment assistance at the Ballinrobe Branch Employment Office on the 2nd of October, 1935.  As a consequence of certain inquiries which followed upon the lodgment of this application it was discovered that Mr. Gibbons had received payment of unemployment assistance for a period of 23 days during which he was in wage-earning employment. Payment of unemployment assistance was therefore withheld, and no payment can be made until certain further action which is contemplated has been taken.  In regard to the application made by Mr. Michael O'Malley, payment of unemployment assistance was withheld pending the completion of inquiries into the validity of his application. These inquiries have been completed, and payment of unemployment assistance for the period up to and including the 26th May, 1936, was made to him on Friday last.</P>
