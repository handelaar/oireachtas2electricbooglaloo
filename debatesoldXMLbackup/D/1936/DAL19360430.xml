      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether John Martin, of Labasheeda, County Clare, applied for a blind pension in January, 1935, and is still waiting to be examined by a medical officer, and, if so, what is the explanation for this delay.</P>

      <P>The application in this case was received by the pension officer in January, 1935, as stated by the Deputy.  The appeal against the award by the sub-committee of a blind pension at the rate of 10/- a week was received on the 26th June, 1935, and it is regretted that owing to the occurrence of a vacancy in the medical inspection staff there was some unavoidable delay in dealing with this and some other appeals on claims for blind pensions.</P>
      <P>The case of John Martin, Labasheeda, has now been decided and it has been determined that he is entitled to a pension at the maximum rate of 10/- a week as from the 31st January, 1935.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether further investigations have caused him to make any change in the statement of the net balance of the external trade for the year ended 31st December, 1933, made by him on 27th February, 1935; and, if so, if he will re-state the net balance of the external trade for that year amended in accordance with any adjustments necessary; and if he will indicate the various items of invisible trade taken into account in arriving at the balance.</P>

      <P>I propose taking these two questions together.  In the following table the values are given for the items of visible and invisible trade in 1933 and 1934, as far as these are known or have been estimated.  The detailed investigations which are being made in my Department have proved more protracted than originally anticipated but good progress has been made and it is hoped to have available shortly a much improved statement on this matter.  I should add that these <Col N="1944" /> inquiries have mostly been in relation to the two major &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; items &ldquo;Income from investments abroad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outgo from extern investments in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  Accordingly, in the figures for 1933 and 1934 which are appended these two items have been omitted.  The figures for the &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; items for 1934 are still to be regarded as subject to revision.</P>

    <P>I am not in a position to supply the Deputy with the information as to the cost of manufacturing sugar other than such information as is contained in the company's accounts published in accordance with Section 15 of the Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>The sugar pulp, under the terms of the company's contracts with growers, becomes the property of the growers, and is returned to the growers, or otherwise disposed of at their order. Molasses, which forms the only other by-product of a commercial value, is mixed with sugar pulp, and only in exceptional cases, and for the convenience of other Saorstát manufacturers, has the company disposed of molasses by sale&mdash;the quantities so disposed of being comparatively small.</P>
    <P>It is pointed out that the company's production season does not coincide with the calendar year, and the foregoing replies have, therefore, been given by reference to the production season.  The figures given at (f) above for 1934-35, relating to the quantity of sugar sold, refer to the whole of the saleable sugar produced in the season 1934-35.  The figures given for 1935-36 <Col N="1953" /> represent the quantity of sugar, being part of the produce of the manufacturing season 1935-36, which was sold during the period from the opening of the manufacturing season (October, 1935) to the 31st March, 1936.  The remainder of the sugar produced in this season is in stock, and on sale.</P>
    <P>The prices quoted for sugar include free delivery to some 45 distributing centres in the Saorstát, and the average price for sugar produced in the season 1935-36 is influenced by the sale of cube and castor sugars produced for the first time in that season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the intention of the Minister, on this Estimate, to give us any indication of what his proposals are in connection with the general transport problem of the County Donegal?  My recollection is that this sum of £1,500 is by way of subsidy to one of the railway companies operating in Donegal.  We have been told from time to time that it was the intention of the Government to withdraw all subsidies on these lines at <Col N="1958" /> some future date and substitute some other form of transport in County Donegal in those areas where railways cannot be economically carried on.  I think the Minister ought now to give us an outline of what his attitude is in regard to that general problem, because it has been complicated by a variety of matters which the Government themselves have raised, notably a commission set up to deal generally with the question of transport facilities in the county.  The history of that was that in the 1933 general election Fianna Fáil Deputies, led by Senator Connolly, created the impression generally in Donegal that what they pleased to call a deep sea port was going to be created there.  Deputy Brady was very eloquent, Deputy Blaney was very eloquent and Deputy Hugh Doherty was very eloquent on the subject, and the general impression in the Rosses was that we were going to excavate a port on the west coast of Donegal large enough to accommodate even the Queen Mary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>From that great port, railways or other modes of distribution were to be provided by the Government. Transport facilities were to be provided from this great port and Donegal was going to be cut off from Derry; we were going to wipe out the port of Derry and substitute this deep sea port on the west coast of Donegal for the accommodation of all Donegal business and also for adjoining parts of the Irish Free State.  There are only two items in the Estimate, one of which is a subsidy for a railway, the prime and only purpose of which is to connect the port of Derry with Donegal.  What is the policy of the Government with regard to transport services in Donegal?  Is it to continue subsidies for the purpose of linking up Donegal with the port of Derry, or do they want <Col N="1959" /> to vote this money only until they have excavated Deputy Brady's deep sea port?  Perhaps the Donegal Deputies whom I have mentioned are in a position to tell us when they hope to start work on this great port?  Can they advise us when they anticipate the Queen Mary will be able to dock there and what precautions are going to be taken to provide for the traffic that will result therefrom?  That is one question.  The second question is a very practical one.  If the Minister is going to allow existing railways in Donegal to collapse, is he going to take any administrative action, in the transport division of his Department, to secure that some alternative method of communication will be provided? because there is no use in thinking that he can allow the narrow gauge railways in Donegal to collapse unless he or some Minister of State undertakes to provide from the national Exchequer alternative accommodation for the people.</P>
      <P>The ratepayers of County Donegal cannot afford to build, in the western parts of Donegal, the type of roads that will become necessary if the existing railways are allowed to collapse. The roads at present existing are almost primitive.  That part of the county is extremely poor and the burden of providing modern roads, sufficient to carry heavy traffic, would be quite out of reach of the local authorities' resources.  I suggested to the Minister on several occasions that, if he intends to allow the railway companies to collapse, he ought to prevail on the Executive Council to make money available for the building of suitable roads.  I have suggested on more than one occasion that this would not be altogether a gift from the national Exchequer to the people of Donegal, because these roads could be designed primarily for the purpose of filling the gap created by the Minister allowing the railways to collapse; but they could also provide scenic attractions for potential tourists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question does arise as to what is the purpose of giving a subsidy to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. Does the Minister intend to keep these railways permanently in existence by means of subsidies, or does he intend to allow them to perish? There used to be subsidies given to other railways, but these have been stopped.  The Minister continues to give this subsidy to the railway which connects Donegal with the City of Derry.  I refer to this matter in order to expose the hollow sham about the deep sea port on which Deputy Brady was largely elected.  At the time of the election the impression was created that the whole population of Donegal would be shouldering their picks and shovels in order to start excavating for the deep sea port.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he does not accept responsibility now, but he was preening his feathers when this great project was mentioned years ago. However, let me pass from that in order to deal with the alternative accommodation that the Minister should provide for the people of West Donegal if he is going to allow the railways of West Donegal to collapse. I quite agree that he has no concern for supplying roads for the purpose of attracting tourists, or indeed for any purpose except for the purpose of facilitating transport.  But he has an obligation, if he is going to allow the railways to crumple up and disappear, to supply suitable roads.  He might protest that to supply the roads would be an unreasonable demand <Col N="1961" /> to make upon the Exchequer and that it was a matter which would be more properly dealt with by the local authority in the usual way.  I make the case that these roads, while having a very great value from the point of view of the Donegal people for transport purposes, would also operate to attract tourists to this country and provide tourist facilities which do not at present operate, and they would become a material source of national revenue by drawing tourists.</P>
      <P>I think it is a mistake to segregate Departments like the Department of Local Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce into such water-tight compartments that they cannot exchange views as to the repercussions of one Department upon the activities of the other.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to consult with the Department of Local Government in order to ascertain their views as to the desirability of building for Donegal an elaborate road system in the western part of the county.  If he will do that, not only may he hope to confer very material benefits on the people of West Donegal and compensate them for the loss of their railways, but also he would be justified in applying to the national Exchequer for assistance in carrying that work out, because the roads would not be a loss; rather would they have a considerable value as a tourist attraction, which would react to the advantage of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this Estimate we are entitled to expect from the Minister a very full statement of his policy in regard to transport in County Donegal.  He has had before him for some considerable time the report of the commission he set up to inquire into this matter.  Deputy Brady, Deputy Blaney and Deputy Hugh Doherty are straining at the leash in order to get back to Donegal to tell the people there what the mountain is going to produce.  It has been in labour for four years and considerable anxiety exists in Donegal as to what is going to emerge.  Now the Minister can <Col N="1962" /> tell us.  I would like him to describe to us whether it is to be a mouse or a white elephant or whatever else it may be.  I have no doubt that Deputy Brady will join with me in urging on the Minister to give us a graphic description of what we may expect in Donegal as a result of all the trials and tribulations that have been proceeding since we first heard about the deep sea port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the Minister to the present inadequate transport service in my constituency.  I think that on fair days especially it is very inadequate and that it ought be possible to arrange for the running of the Dun Angus on the eve of fairs and for a return journey on the evening of the fairs.  I think the scale of charges also would require some attention.  The sum of 10/- is charged for each beast, and 1/- for each parcel, in addition to the people's train fare.  I hope the Minister will be able to include this service in some of the subsidies in aid of transport, so that it could be improved and made adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the consent of the Chair, I shall do so.  On the question of the Arran service raised by Deputy Bartley, I will look into that matter. The payment to the Londonderry and <Col N="1964" /> Lough Swilly Railway Service was discussed last year.  It was proposed to make a payment of £1,500 for the three years, 1935, 1936 and 1937 to enable the railway company to raise the necessary capital to effect the reorganisation of their entire undertaking which was made possible under the recent railway and road transport legislation, and because it was found necessary to provide incidentally for the railway fixed charges, and consequent compensation payments to railway workers who might become disemployed. This contribution provided was to be made for three years by the Government of the Saorstát and together with a similar contribution made by the Government of Northern Ireland towards the railway fixed charges will enable these liabilities to which I have referred to be discharged without endangering the financial stability of the undertaking during the period of reorganisation.  A similar sum, according to that arrangement, will require to be provided next year, but after that there will be no further financial assistance given to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the report of the Donegal Transport Committee I refer Deputy Dillon to a reply I gave yesterday to a Parliamentary Question asked by Deputy Brady.  I shall now, with the permission of the Chair, deal with the request put to me by Deputy Morrissey.  It is correct to say that one or two points dealing with transport services were raised yesterday, which I had not time to deal with. One was the acquisition by the Great Southern Railways Company of the Galway Omnibus Company. The other was certain increases in charges which the Great Southern Railways Company have given notice of their intention to effect.  So far as the acquisition of the Galway omnibus service is concerned, by the Great Southern Railways Company, no decision upon that matter has yet been made.  The Act provides for such amalgamation of road transport services and indicates that the Minister has discretion in deciding whether or not he will agree <Col N="1965" /> to any such proposal.  He is entitled to give due consideration to any representations that may be made to him by interested parties on the ground that the proposed acquisition or amalgamation is not in the public interest.  I may say that the whole idea of the Road Transport Act was to secure such amalgamation and was based on the idea that competition in transport was not desirable; that it promoted inefficiency, led to bad conditions of employment and, furthermore, jeopardised the stability of the main services of the country.</P>
    <P>In a country like this, with its scattered population, it is difficult to provide for efficient transport service except on such basis as that for which the Road Transport Act of 1933 provided. Therefore, it must be assumed that the Minister in considering any proposal to amalgamate existing services, with the service of the Great Southern Railway Company, is bound to be sympathetic with the idea of amalgamation although in individual cases the public interest may be clearly against it, and his decision contrary to the request of the railway company.  That has arisen in a few areas.  But we have set out to establish one national transport undertaking, subject to public control as to its rates for the transportation of passengers and merchandise and under obligation to provide in every part of the country the most efficient forms of transport which the requirements of each area demand.  Therefore, while I do not want to be taken as prejudging any report that may be made to me with regard to the Galway service and the acquisition of that company by the Great Southern Railway, nevertheless it may be assumed that unless a very definite case is made to the contrary my decision is likely to be in favour of amalgamation.  I have no functions concerned with the charges made by the Great Southern Railway.  Any proposal to increase or vary rates has to be submitted to the Railway Tribunal, before which interested parties can appear and make their case, and it is the Railway Tribunal decides on the proposals of the company.  I may, however, point out that the situation which existed <Col N="1966" /> here in 1933 was one in which transport services were being sold generally at less than the cost of production, with the result that not merely were conditions of employment in transport services very bad but the financial stability and, in fact, the continued existence of the main transport undertakings was in jeopardy.  When the Road Transport Act of 1933 was before the Dáil it was approved of by all Parties.  In that year, everybody was keenly alive to the precarious position that existed in respect of public transport and as to the need for some such scheme of reorganisation as was provided for.  Nowadays, when conditions are very definitely improved, some Deputies are, perhaps, inclined to forget the circumstances that these Acts were designed to remedy and are, perhaps, more concerned with the individual steps of reorganisation and the effect of these individual steps upon the fortunes of individuals.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, was that any improvement in our transport services or any reorganisation scheme was bound to involve an increase of transport charges to an economic level.  It is the concern of the Railway Tribunal to ensure that they do not rise beyond an economic level. The obligation of the Railway Tribunal is such that they must ensure that the scale of charges approved of by them, having regard to the anticipated volume of traffic likely to arise in any one year, will be such as to secure for the Great Southern Railway Company the standard net revenue which the tribunal has determined. Therefore, when any proposal arises from the railway company to vary its rates of charge for merchandise generally, or in particular areas, it is entirely a matter for the Railway Tribunal, and the parties who think their interests are likely to be affected adversely by these changes should take steps to ensure that they are represented before the tribunal and that their case is heard.  It is true that the Department of Industry and Commerce is, as a rule, represented at sittings of the tribunal, but the functions of the Department are not to ensure merely that increases of <Col N="1967" /> charges do not take place.  Its function is primarily to ensure that the general economy of the railway company and the main transport organisations are not undermined, and in particular, that the standard net revenue is secured.  In fact, for a long time, it was the primary purpose of the Department's representative at the Railway Tribunal to object to proposals to reduce charges.  That situation is changing now, perhaps, and the purpose of the Department in relation to this matter is merely to ensure that all considerations are taken into account&mdash;to secure, on the one hand, that consideration is given to the interests of the users of the transport system and, on the other hand, to secure that the economy of the system is not adversely affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to deal with the point I raised yesterday regarding the number of owner-drivers of lorries who applied for merchandise licences and were unable to get them.  These people will be driven off the road and deprived, in some cases, of their only means of livelihood.  Is the Minister in a position to do anything for them? I think his position is that his hands are tied but these men have a fairly good case and they should be met in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware, there is nobody who, it was decided, was entitled to a road merchandise licence who has not got it.  The Deputy will remember that the Act provided that everybody engaged in the business of carrying merchandise by road during the period immediately preceding the coming into operation of the Act became entitled, as of right, to a licence to carry on that business to the same degree that he had been engaged in it previously.  The only difficulty that arose was that certain persons did not apply in time to get these licences and, that being so, we extended by an amending Act the period during which applications could be received.  We engaged in fairly widespread publicity to ensure that everybody would realise the necessity for making application. Even then, there were people who did <Col N="1968" /> not apply and we brought the matter more directly to their attention by arranging for their prosecution for carrying on business without a licence. Then, again, we introduced an amending Act validating all the applications received from persons who had had the matter brought to their attention in that very direct way.  Twice since the main Act was introduced the period for making application has been extended and, on that account, I do not think it is practicable to contemplate a further extension.</P>
      <P>Most of the grievances that have come to my attention have been on the part of persons who commenced to engage in the business of carrying merchandise by road after the Act of 1933 had come into operation either in ignorance of the terms of the Act or in the belief that they could in some way qualify for licences under it.  In respect of those cases, I have no discretion whatsoever.  The only discretion I have under the Act is where the authorised merchandise carrying company for the area&mdash;the railway company&mdash;declines to provide transport.  It is only in such a case that I could give a licence to an independent operator. That has happened in a few cases in respect of particular classes of merchandise in particular districts.  There have not, however, been many such cases.  Any licence issued in such a way is a permanent licence and cannot be revoked.  Apart from these cases, I have no power to issue licences to anybody to carry on a road transport business.  The Deputy will see at once that it would be most inequitable to issue these licences in any number.  It is the obligation of the authorised carrying companies to buy up the licences of those engaged in the road transport business and if, having spent considerable sums in acquiring the licences issued and the businesses of the persons holding the licences, they were now to be faced with a batch of licences issued to new operators it would be very inequitable. Consequently, I should not propose to amend the Act so as to take power to issue licences to those persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister regarding those who may <Col N="1969" /> have acquired licences or entered into the carrying business subsequent to the passing of the Act.  There were, however, a number of people genuinely engaged in the carrying business prior to the passing of the Act and, for some reason, technical or otherwise, they were not able to qualify for merchandise licences.  In those cases there is genuine hardship, and I ask the Minister to see if he can possibly meet them in some way.  I refer to those people who can prove to the satisfaction of the Minister's Department that they were actually engaged in the carrying business prior to the Act, and prior even to the introduction of the Act.</P>

I think the Minister will be advised of that by the Department.</P>

    <P>For an explanation of the various sub-heads I refer Deputies to the notes which are attached to the Estimate. Provision is made for an increase in staff which is found necessary in consequence of the extended operations of the Department.  It is considered desirable that the facilities available in connection with the exchanges and branch employment offices should be extended as widely as possible and certain provision is being made to that end in the Estimate for this year. There are two sub-heads under which there are substantial changes.  Subhead G, which provides for the State contribution to the Unemployment Fund, records an increase of £12,000.  The contribution from the Exchequer to the Unemployment Fund is determined by statute. It is a sum which has a fixed relationship to the revenue of the fund from the sale of insurance stamps, and in anticipation of the increase in employment that occurred during the past few years being continued during the course of the present year, provision has to be made for an increase in Exchequer contribution.  On the other hand, we have estimated that the amount required for unemployment assistance in the course of the current year will be £110,000 less than last year.  The Appropriations-in-Aid show <Col N="1972" /> little change.  They are explained in the notes attached to the Estimate. There is, consequently, a net decrease in the Estimate of £89,042.  The services provided for out of this Vote are three in number.  There is the service of the labour exchanges, the service of unemployment insurance, and the service of unemployment assistance. These three services have become fused in one another and are at present virtually administered as one service. The labour exchanges were originally established for the purpose of bringing into touch with one another persons seeking employment and employers who were in search of workpeople. That service has been always the main function of the local offices of the Department, but through the stress of other work, particularly during the past couple of years, it has tended to become overshadowed. It is the intention in the near future to revive this important function of the Department, and to require local officers to engage in a vigorous canvassing campaign for the purpose of ascertaining employers' local requirements, and inducing them to satisfy their requirements through the medium of the local offices.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past year, from 2nd April, 1935, to 9th March, 1936, there were 64,897 vacancies notified to the Department, and of these 51,136 were filled through the Department.  It is worthy of comment, I think, that the activities of the Department in the matter of filling vacancies has been considerably extended during the course of the past three or four years. The number of vacancies filled in the year ending April, 1930, was 16,020; in the year ending April, 1931, 22,931; in the year ending April, 1933, 96,069, and in the following year, 71,916.  The number fell off in the year ending April, 1935, to 26,036.  I mention that fact because reference has been made to it here, and apparently a misunderstanding exists as to the reason for the decline in the number of vacancies filled for that year.  It was represented that that was due to a diminution in the volume of employment available.  That is not correct.  It was due entirely to the fact that the Unemployment Assistance <Col N="1973" /> Act was brought into operation during that year, and required all the attention of the officers of the Department situated in exchanges or branch employment offices, with the result that the function of the Department, in the matter of filling vacancies notified to it, could not be performed, and various administrative changes were made in order to relieve them of obligation in that respect during that period.  The Department is now assuming its ordinary functions in that regard, and, for that reason, for the period of 12 months I mentioned, the number of vacancies filled rose again to 51,130.  In connection with unemployment insurance there was no change during the course of the year, either legislatively or administratively. The number of persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act has, however, risen considerably, and is now the highest recorded.  The total number of persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act during the period 1934-35 was 399,710, a figure which has to be compared with 314,368 for the financial year 1931-32, an increase of 86,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is the number of persons insured.  The number of persons claiming insurance benefit expressed as a total percentage of the insured population has shown a steady decline during the course of the past year.  The number of claims for unemployment insurance benefit expressed as a percentage of the total number of persons insured under the Act on the 2nd April was 4.9 per cent., compared with 6.9 per cent. for 2nd April, 1931. In August, 1935, the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act became law and in consequence of that Act certain changes in the administration of the unemployment assistance scheme came into effect.  In particular, new machinery was devised and established for the consideration and determination of appeals by persons who were dissatisfied, either as to the assessment of their means for the purposes of the Act or who had been refused qualification <Col N="1974" /> certificates.  As Deputies will remember, there was outstanding a very large number of these appeals and the matter was the subject of complaint here.  I am glad to say that the new machinery has been completely effective in wiping off these arrears of appeals and at the present time there are no appeals other than current appeals outstanding.</P>
      <P>The section of the Department provided for in this Estimate deals with the matter of the granting of permits to aliens to undertake employment in the Saorstát.  Certain people have been addressing themselves in public to the question of the granting of permits to aliens to get employment here and any Deputy who wishes to refer to the matter can do so in the discussion on this Vote.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind, however, that the persons who are described as aliens for the purposes of the Aliens Act do not include British citizens, and it is only in respect to persons who are defined as aliens under these Acts that the Department has any function, in respect to the granting or refusing of permits to undertake employment here. A person who is an alien within the meaning of the Aliens Act, cannot undertake employment in the Saorstát without a permit from the Department. A number of these permits have been issued.  It has been the policy of the Department to issue them where the alien had technical qualifications of the kind necessary to permit of some industrial activity being inaugurated in the Saorstát or of the work of some particular company being continued. In fact, the general test which has been applied, in considering applications from these firms, is whether the grant of the permit will or will not increase the prospect of Saorstát nationals getting employment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, I know, a number of people who consider that in certain of the new industries that have been established an undue proportion of aliens have been employed.  I cannot accept that point of view.  Particular reference has been made in that connection to the sugar industry.  The sugar industry, as Deputies are aware, is a very large industry involving some £2,000,000 capital, and we could not <Col N="1975" /> take the risk that the efficiency of that industry would be impaired by any defect in the technical qualifications of those responsible for its direction and management.  On that account we have had to sanction the employment of aliens in a number of the technical posts in the service of the sugar company.  I can say, however, that the total number of aliens employed in connection with the four factories now established in the Saorstát is less than the number originally employed in the Carlow factory when it first got going.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the intention of the Government that Saorstát citizens should be trained in all classes of technical work associated with the sugar industry, and we are getting the co-operation of the sugar company to that end.  In fact, considerable progress has been made in the education of Saorstát citizens employed by the company in the technical operations of the industry, and they are replacing alien workers to an increasing extent every year.  But there are certain posts in each of the sugar factories which involve such an amount of experience and technical knowledge that it is likely to be some considerable time before any of our citizens will have been sufficiently trained and qualified to occupy these posts without risk to the fortunes of the company.  In all cases, or in practically all cases where a permit is issued for the employment of an alien, a condition is attached that the service of the alien will be utilised for the purpose of training a Saorstát national in the work concerned and, in fact, a number of our citizens have got a technical training in various classes of industry on that account which might not have been easily procured otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary to refer to any other matters in connection with the administration of this service.  We have had certain questions in connection with it raised in the course of the past 12 months on Supplementary Estimates or otherwise.  I notice, however, that recently local authorities&mdash;and I might mention in particular the Dublin Board of Assistance&mdash;have been making adverse comments on the administration of the <Col N="1976" /> Unemployment Assistance Act, particularly in the City of Dublin.  It is, perhaps, not fully appreciated by the great body of the citizens that the Dublin Board of Assistance is a Party caucus. It is a body composed entirely of members of the Opposition Party, and it has allowed itself to be influenced by political considerations to an undue extent in the discharge of its functions, particularly in the course of the past year.  Persons who may have been influenced by statements made by members of the board should be fully informed as to the motives from which they originated.</P>
    <P>Recently some comment has been made on the fact that certain persons have been debarred from receiving unemployment assistance on the ground that they are not genuinely seeking work.  I do not know that anybody will seriously contend that the State should provide unemployment assistance for persons of whom it can be correctly said that they are not genuinely seeking work.  The whole purpose of the Unemployment Assistance Act is to provide State aid for persons who are in a <i>bona fide</i> manner endeavouring to obtain employment, and who, through no fault of their own, are unable to secure it.  If, therefore, in accordance with the machinery of the Act, a person is held to be not genuinely seeking work, he is, obviously, not a person to receive assistance.  Any complaint which may arise on the action of the officers concerned in debarring certain persons from receiving unemployment assistance, on the ground that they are not genuinely seeking work, must be due to the belief that these persons have been so held in the wrong.  In that connection, I can merely state that the general policy of the Department is, if possible, to give the benefit of the doubt in favour of the applicant.  The consideration of each case is undertaken by an unemployment assistance officer, in the first instance, and on his determination there is an appeal.  In all cases there is an appeal taken to the local court of referees which, as Deputies are aware, is a body free from Departmental influence.  It consists of a neutral person as chairman appointed by the Minister&mdash;a solicitor or a barrister, <Col N="1977" /> or somebody with legal training&mdash;a representative of the organised workers in the area of the court, and also a representative of the employers.  The representative of the workers and the representative of the employers are taken in rotation from a panel of representatives which is prepared regularly. It is that court which determines an appeal from an unemployment assistance officer's decision as to whether a person is or is not qualified to receive unemployment assistance.  In certain cases there is a further appeal to the umpire, who is a legal personage.  He acts, in relation to the Unemployment Assistance Act, in a manner similar to that in which he acts in relation to the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the umpire a neutral person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a barrister who is appointed for that purpose and paid fees in relation to the number of appeals taken to him.  The same man has acted in that capacity for a long time.  His functions under the Unemployment Insurance Act are similar to those which he discharges under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The appeals that come to him are mainly on questions of law.  The actual determination of the facts relating to the question as to whether a person is qualified to receive unemployment assistance is usually done finally by the court of referees.  The determinations of the umpire upon a test case, in which an interpretation of the law arises, are communicated to the courts of referees, and naturally influence their decisions in subsequent similar cases as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as much the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce to see that no person who is not entitled to unemployment assistance gets it as it is to see that those who are entitled do get it. As I was personally in some way responsible for the initiation of the unemployment assistance scheme, and as I am very anxious to see it made a permanent feature of our social legislation, I am particularly concerned to ensure that all abuses in the administration of it should be eliminated, and I rely upon the <Col N="1978" /> co-operation of those who are equally concerned with me to make this unemployment assistance idea a permanency in the elimination of these abuses.  There is nothing which will act more effectively to secure the development of an opinion in favour of the abolition of the Unemployment Assistance Act than the sight, in any part of the country, of a person getting unemployment assistance who, the general public know, is not entitled to it on the ground that he is not unemployed, or on the ground that he is not genuinely seeking work, or on the ground that he is not fit to perform work if it were available for him.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there are so many abuses as is sometimes alleged, but it is reasonable to assume, having regard to the wide scope of the Act and the difficulties inherent in bringing it into operation over a short period, that abuses did arise, and that in parts of the country individuals got unemployment assistance who were not entitled to it in accordance with the provisions of the Act, just as, I presume, it is equally reasonable to assume that some individuals who should have got unemployment assistance did not get it.  But, with the increased experience of the operations of the Act which the officers of the Department are getting, and the inauguration of the investigation staff of the Revenue Commissioners, these abuses, to whatever extent they did exist, are being eliminated, and we are getting rapidly to the point at which we can be certain that the persons who are, in fact, receiving unemployment assistance are entitled to it in accordance with the strict letter of the law.</P>
    <P>It is, however, utterly unfair for such a body as the Dublin Board of Assistance to represent the action of the Department in debarring certain persons from receiving unemployment assistance on the ground that they are not genuinely seeking work, as harsh or unreasonable, or designed to embarrass the Dublin Board of Assistance in the payment of home assistance.  The officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce have no desire whatever to be <Col N="1979" /> harsh towards applicants for unemployment assistance.  As I have said, it is their general policy to give the benefit of whatever doubt may exist to the applicant for assistance, and it is only when they are satisfied that the conditions of the Act are not being observed by some applicants that assistance is refused.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware, as his attention has already been drawn to the fact, that there was a considerable want of co-operation between the branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with this Act and the machinery in the Dublin Union in its early days.  The Minister is also aware that you have working under the Dublin Board of Assistance a very experienced staff of home assistance officers and superintendent home assistant officers who have a thorough knowledge of the conditions, one might almost say of the personnel, of that part of the city population which requires relief.  Will the Minister say what steps have since been taken, or will be taken now, to provide co-operation between the officers of his Department and the staff of the Dublin Union so that there shall be efficient administration of the moneys provided and of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and so that there shall be a more thorough understanding as to what is being done?  If that is insisted on differences can be avoided.</P>

      <P>I do not mind complaints made by members of the Committee. So far as I am aware there is no reason why that co-operation should not be whole-hearted, and so far as the actual legal structure of the unemployment assistance scheme is concerned, the amendment made in the 1935 Act provides for the only difficulty that I know had arisen and that difficulty was this; that a person <Col N="1980" /> might apply for unemployment assistance and some time might elapse before the claim could be determined. During the interval, home assistance would be paid to him, and at the end of the period, when his application for unemployment assistance has been determined favourably, he would be entitled to get that assistance as from the date of his original application, so that a lump sum, representing several weeks' assistance, would become payable to him.  The board of assistance rightly complained that during that period they had paid home assistance to him and should get a refund of the amount so paid from the arrears of unemployment assistance which became payable to him on the determination of his claim.  Section 16 of the Act of 1935 provides for that refund of any home assistance paid by the board of assistance during the period that the applicant's claim is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has shifted now, because, judging by the payments that were made by the board of public assistance in the City of Dublin, the sympathy is now on their part towards the people who are being turned down by the Minister's Department from getting unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the position is, as I have said, that they are either properly turned down and denied assistance on the grounds that they have not qualified for it&mdash;some such ground as <Col N="1981" /> not genuinely seeking work&mdash;or else they are not properly turned down, in which case their applications for assistance will be reconsidered.  In the first case they are not entitled to assistance, and in the second case, if home assistance is paid to them, then the amount of such home assistance paid will be refunded when the appeal is determined in favour of the applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose that the Minister's Department turned down A, B, C or D for the reasons he has told us.  Those people then apply to the home assistance officer for assistance. Are they not to get that?  I do not know what the board of assistance point of view is, but I assume it is this: Here is a sum for which they are made liable annually, as a contribution towards this fund.  Even though they pay it, there are cases which are excluded from the benefits of the Act for one or other of the causes stated.  Those people cannot be allowed to starve, and the board has got to pay, so it really pays twice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. The Unemployment Assistance Act did not supersede the boards of assistance. Those boards were left in existence with exactly the same obligations and exactly the same powers as they always had, but we took out of the class of persons who were being helped by those boards one definite class, that is persons who are fit for work, who are genuinely seeking it, and not able to find it through no fault of their own, and we gave those people a statutory right to unemployment assistance.  The board of assistance distributes home help at its discretion.  It does so after the investigation of individual cases, and having regard to the circumstances of individual cases. Persons who conform to certain conditions are of right entitled to unemployment assistance payments and must get them.  The board of assistance can give or withhold assistance at its discretion, having regard to the nature of the case, and the Dublin Board of Assistance is in a <Col N="1982" /> position which any body of politicians would love to be in.  They can give out assistance, and if they increase the rates the blame is going to go to their opponents.  I do not think that there was ever a body of politicians in Parliamentary history so ideally situated as the Fine Gael members of the Dublin Board of Assistance.</P>

When it comes to a question of deciding whether a particular person is genuinely seeking work, what is the close-down machinery in the city that the Minister has for deciding that, and when a decision is being taken or when a decision has been taken on that matter, is there any consultation or co-operation between the machinery that he has working for him close down in the city and the machinery that is working for the board of public assistance close <Col N="1983" /> down in the city?  I ask the question for this reason, that the home assistance officers who are working in the city have had a lot of close and personal experience, and I want to say that they are a highly experienced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are perfectly capable of discriminating between the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Act and the purposes of the Relief Act.  I would ask the Minister what co-operation or consultation there is between the two sets of officials on the question as to whether a man is genuinely seeking work or not?  Is there any?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of assistance have nothing to do with that.  They have the obligation of relieving destitution from no matter what cause it may arise.  They are not concerned with whether a person is destitute because he is not seeking work.  The Department of Industry and Commerce only relieves destitution arising from involuntary unemployment, but the board of assistance has to relieve destitution arising from any cause.  Therefore, the experience of the officers of the board of assistance is of little importance in relation to the consideration of that one question.  The unemployment assistance officer may for various reasons come to the conclusion that a particular applicant for unemployment assistance is not genuinely seeking work.  The obligation of proving the fulfilment of that condition is on the applicant.  If he does not satisfy the unemployment assistance officer that he is genuinely seeking work, then he is debarred from receiving assistance and his case goes on appeal to the court of referees.  It <Col N="1984" /> is the court of referees that finally decides whether he is to go back on unemployment assistance or be debarred.  In any event he is debarred only for a period of six weeks.  At the end of that period he can again make his claim.  If the circumstances have changed in the interval, and if he can then show that he fulfils the conditions, he becomes entitled to unemployment assistance again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;the speeches reported from the Dublin Board of Assistance.  I stated that mistakes arose in the past in connection with the administration of unemployment assistance; at least I assumed that.  I was referring to the period during which the Act was being brought into operation, when untrained and inexperienced staffs were recruited in great number and put on the administration of this Act all over the country.  That period is over.  The staffs at the various exchanges and branch offices are now fully competent to perform their duties efficiently, and they are in fact doing so, with the result that we can claim that the administration of the unemployment assistance code is as efficient as admittedly the unemployment insurance code is and has been. So far as I am concerned, I am quite satisfied with the manner in which the scheme is working out.  There is also perhaps one other matter to which I should refer at this stage for the purpose of giving Deputies an opportunity of referring to it, in case they might forget it.  We have made one Employment Period Order, affecting persons holding land with a valuation of £4 or <Col N="1985" /> over.  That Order was discussed here on a motion moved by Deputy Norton, and approved of by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In another place I gave at great length my views on the motion. I merely want to mention that it is our intention to make another Order for a period commencing in June, affecting single men without dependents.  These men were debarred from receiving unemployment assistance through a similar Order in last year.  They will also be debarred for a longer period this year, and we think we are justified in doing so, having regard to the reports which have been received from many parts of the country as to the amount of agricultural employment available and as to the difficulties which may have been experienced in some districts in getting workers for agricultural work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised, however, that that Order, or any such Order of general application, will not work with equal fairness in each case.  There will be some parts of the country where persons struck off unemployment assistance in consequence of it will not be able to get employment, and there will be other parts where we might have reason to extend the Order to cover other classes because of the amount of employment that will be available, and particularly there will be certain workers in the smaller towns, which, for the purpose of the Act, are regarded as rural areas, who may be adversely affected by the Order.  These things are unavoidable in operating a wide spread scheme of the nature of the unemployment assistance scheme.  One has got to make general decisions and apply them to broad classes, without too close regard to the possible variations in conditions that may occur within these classes, but, on the whole, the operation of these Orders last year was quite satisfactory.  There were very few complaints after the Orders came into operation, and no evidence that they caused hardship, and I think that will be our experience in this year also.  I refer, however, to the Order which has been made, and to the Order <Col N="1986" /> which it is intended to make, at this stage, so that Deputies, if they wish, can give expression to their opinions in regard to them.</P>

      <P>The figure gives an indication of the number of persons in this country who are seeking their livelihood from insurable employment, and the increase in the figure indicates that a much larger number of persons are to-day seeking their livelihood from insurable employment than in the past. That may be due to an increase in population or to a change-over on the part of a number of persons from agriculture to industry, or to both such reasons, but I give the figure as indicating that that increase has taken place, a fairly substantial increase, during the past three or four years.</P>

      <P>Yes.  In addition to the amount of benefit paid there was, of course, the cost of administration which comes out of the fund, and, furthermore, there is a surplus.  That surplus at present is going to the reduction of the debt which arose in the fund during the period from 1921 to 1926 or 1927.  There was a fairly heavy debt <Col N="1988" /> accumulated in the fund during that period.</P>

      <P>By 1931 that debt had been reduced, and in that year the contribution was reduced, much to the disgust of Deputy Morrissey, who opposed it very strongly.  With the coming into operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, the contribution was increased again, the additional amount coming in making up the £250,000 which is contributed from the Unemployment Insurance Fund for the purpose of unemployment assistance, but, still, the amount secured is in excess of the outgoings, and the debt has been further reduced in the interval. In fact, the debt will be wiped out in a year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering during the greater part of the Minister's speech when he was going to introduce the red herring, and then we got the attack on the Dublin Board of Public Assistance.  It is an old trick, tried fairly frequently by that particular Minister, and sometimes it succeeds. The Minister spent a considerable <Col N="1989" /> time in giving very little information to the House as to the real activities of this Department during the last 12 months.  I had hoped that we would have had from the Minister some information as to the steps taken by the Department to save the £300,000 which the Minister for Finance told us in his Budget last year was to be taken from this particular service.  The Minister never said a word about it. He never told us what steps had been taken by himself or his Department to make this very substantial saving for the Minister for Finance, or whether he believed he would save £300,000 or more than that.  He told us about the politicians on the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The Minister did not deal with the facts contained in the reports of the home assistance officers of the City of Dublin.  Was it purely because there is a political board, as he calls it, that the expenditure is £114 per week greater than the normal expenditure in the City of Dublin for relief? The Minister did not deal with the statement that was made at a meeting of the Dublin Board of Assistance that because of the number of people who were being cut off unemployment assistance on the grounds that they were not genuinely seeking work, the amount to be made available by the Dublin Board of Home Assistance would have to be increased.  Let us face up to this.  We were told last year that it was the Government's intention to save £300,000 upon unemployment assistance.  The Minister has not told us what steps were taken by his Department to save that amount. The Minister has not told this House in the course of his opening speech what has been the increase in the number of unemployed in the last 12 months.  That, one would think, should have been the first matter he would deal with, but he never mentioned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the statement of a Minister conscious of his responsibility or is it the statement of the most active politician in a political Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I thought the <Col N="1990" /> Minister would try to get a little nearer to the truth as a Minister than he does as a politician.  If the Minister is not aware of the fact that we have a far greater number of unemployed in this country than ever before, most other people are aware of it.  The unemployed are aware of it and possibly, too, the people who have to support them and maintain them in some way are aware of it.  The Minister did not indicate to this House in any way what steps his Department are taking to get the only real solution for reducing this very large amount which must be provided for maintenance.  The real solution is the provision of work, but he did not say a word about that.  The Minister told us that the main function of what he called the labour exchange &mdash;the proper official title is the employment exchange&mdash;was to place people in employment.  But the Minister did not tell us to what extent, if any, they had placed those people in what might be called ordinary employment.  He gave us figures of 64,000 odd as the number placed in employment through the employment exchanges.  To what extent are relief schemes responsible for absorbing these numbers?  To what extent is road work responsible, and to what extent are housing schemes responsible?  I would like to get from the Minister some idea of the number placed in ordinary normal employment through the employment exchanges, but the Minister did not tell us.  He kept away from it.  Then he told us it was his intention to embark upon a canvassing campaign to place people in employment in this country.  It is not by a canvassing campaign that people can be put into employment, but it is by the opening up of works to enable people to give employment so as to absorb the unemployed workers.  If work is there the unemployed will find it without the assistance of the Minister or his Department.</P>

      <Col N="1991" /> Is it not so that the Minister will be able to say next year, &ldquo;We placed so many thousands in employment, and these men would never have got that employment only for the activities of our Department?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could tell that, too. The Minister raised another point that he is in the habit of raising here.  He did not develop it as fully to-day as on other occasions.  He said that the number of people who were claiming insurance benefit is steadily declining. The last time the Minister said there was this steady decline&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there was a steady decline in the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, what I said was that there was a decline in comparison with the total number of people insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I took down the Minister's words.  It is not the first time the Minister said that, and it is not the first time he argued from figures similar to those he gave us.  The Minister argued that it was because these people found employment that the number was declining.  I want to suggest to the Minister that it is because they have exhausted their <Col N="1992" /> benefit and there are no stamps to their credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more stamps to their credit than ever there were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen.  The Minister makes an Order in order to safeguard the Minister for Finance at the expense of those claiming insurance benefit.  He makes an Order that priority was to be given to those in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The Order is that they must get priority in relief work. What is the effect?  It prevents those in receipt of insurance benefit from obtaining the employment which they would otherwise obtain, and it forces them to exhaust the stamps they have to their credit.  Surely the Minister does not think he is dealing with people completely ignorant of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently so, because no such Order has been made except in the case of work financed partly out of central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of the work is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A small percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>One ought to realise long before now that there is nothing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not say when driven to it.  There is no limit to which he will not go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say this, that of the total number employed, it is less than 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am not concerned with the Minister's interruption, because long since I gave up any hope of ever getting the Minister to admit facts.  Let us get down to the real facts&mdash;to the means by which this £300,000 was attempted to be saved during the year.  Will the Minister tell us why he did not advert to that in his opening speech?  I do not want now to go into the Amending Bill which brought in the question of means, and which further reduces the miserable sum which in the Minister's opinion and in the opinion of his colleagues provides maintenance for those who are unable to find work.  Is this not a fact, that notoriously during the last 12 months claims were suspended for <Col N="1993" /> inspection on the flimsiest excuses, and that when a claim was suspended, the minimum period of suspension was really two months?  Without the slightest excuse, claims for unemployment assistance are suspended.  Many claims have been suspended on receipt of anonymous letters&mdash;and the practice is that the unfortunate person is deprived of unemployment assistance until the matter is investigated and decided.  That occupies some time. The Minister tells us that the reason relief is denied to some people is that they are not genuinely seeking work. Unfortunately, the onus of proving that a man is genuinely seeking work is left on himself.  Who is to decide, definitely and fairly, whether a man is genuinely seeking work or not?  I feel satisfied that there is an attempt to cut people off on this ground.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that there are some hundreds if not, perhaps, a couple of thousand or more than a couple of thousand other workers in this country who are unemployed, and who are not reflected at all, or to any extent in the unemployment return.  I refer to the British ex-servicemen, who may be in receipt of pensions, even small pensions. They do not register now. There is no point in their registering because they cannot get employment. There are too many other classes before them for these men to hope to get employment through the labour exchanges.  In many cases the pensions that these men receive are very small indeed, especially for men who married subsequent to their army service, and who, in many cases, have large families.  As I say, these people are not reflected in the unemployment returns at all.</P>
      <P>We had a figure given to us last night by the Minister.  He contested Deputy McGilligan's figures.  Deputy McGilligan gave a figure of 30,000 put into employment.  The most that the Minister claimed afterwards was 36,000 persons put into employment for the last three years.  I was glad at least that we got a figure from the Minister which I hope he will not try to explain away.</P>

      <P>I was taking the Minister's figures.  He told us that there were 36,000.  What I want to get at is this.  Is the Minister with all his efforts through industry and otherwise, even marking time with the unemployment problem, not to speak of getting to grips with it?  According to the Party opposite, our employable population is increasing at the rate of 20,000 per year.  The Minister, I think, is putting the figure very high, because he is not taking into account at all the people who may have been displaced, who may have been disemployed.</P>

I want to come back to this point that the Minister is anxious to evade, that we have a register which is provided for people who are unemployed, and who are able and willing to work, because <Col N="1996" /> otherwise they are not entitled to sign the register, which reached a figure this year of 147,000, the highest ever reached in the history of the country.</P>

      <P>Let me deal with the effect of the period orders last year. The Minister last year, before his period orders came into full operation, had an unemployed total of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 140,000.  When the period orders were fully enforced that number had been reduced, by the application of the period orders to something like 82,000.  These figures are approximately correct.  I am speaking from recollection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister compelled them.  During the last four years he has changed the regulations governing the placing of men in employment through the labour exchanges three or four times.  He gave figures and tried to compare the figures for one year with those for another year.  There could not be any comparison, because the regulations were different in those years.  The Minister did not tell the House that.  The Minister, as I said, by a stroke of the pen deprives between 50,000 and 60,000 persons of unemployment assistance&mdash; he deems them to be employed.  He concludes that they are going to get employment, but he has no figures, facts or evidence to show that these persons are going to be absorbed into employment, or even a substantial number of them.  At the end of the period order, when they come back again on unemployment assistance, he does not know to what extent, if any, they have been employed.  The <Col N="1998" /> Minister has no evidence to produce. It is merely an order made for the purpose of saving so much money to the Exchequer and enabling the Minister for Finance to get the £300,000 we were told about last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows these things as well as I do, or at least he ought to. He ought to give the House the facts.  The point in all this is, as I say, that we had, before the first period order was made, something like 145,000 people unemployed and signing on as available for work.  That is a very big problem.  It is a much bigger problem now than it was when the Minister told us that he would be able to solve it comparatively easily, and in a comparatively short time, and solve it so successfully that not only would they absorb the whole number of unemployed, but there would be jobs going a-begging.</P>
      <P>Now, the Minister has not solved the unemployment problem.  No sensible person expected the Minister to solve it, in the sense of completely wiping out unemployment in this country within four years, not to mind doing it in the 12 months that the Minister mentioned on another famous occasion. Nobody expected him to do it. My contention is that not only has he failed to make any impression on the unemployment problem as it existed when he came into office, but that that problem has grown tremendously under his administration, and that the numbers of unemployed have increased to an unprecedented figure, despite all the Minister's activities by way of tariffs, industries and so forth and despite the very extensive housing schemes that have been and are being undertaken by the Department of Local Government.  I submit that what we ought to be told by a Minister, conscious of his responsibility to the House and to the unemployed, is whether he hopes at the end of 12 months, if he is still in a ministerial position, to be able to come here asking for a very much reduced sum for unemployment assistance, not because of administrative action taken to deprive people, for one reason or another, of unemployment assistance, but because large numbers have been absorbed into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> Can the Minister tell us what schemes, if any, he has in contemplation, or what schemes the Government have in contemplation that are likely to absorb the unemployed into genuine employment? Can he tell us whether he hopes, from the information contained in the three reports placed before him, that it will be possible to absorb a considerable number of the unemployed? Are we to take it that, as the number this year reached a higher point than the number last year, for the coming year we may look forward, at the end of the period orders, to weekly increases of 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000, or are we simply to come here year after year listening to the Minister introducing his Estimate and telling us fairy stories of how the Department is administered and how steps are taken to give every applicant the benefit of the doubt?  We have the Minister's statement that he looks on the unemployment assistance scheme as a permanent scheme.  That is an extraordinary admission from the man who was to abolish unemployment completely in this country.  The Minister is now going back to the point that not only will he not be able to absorb the unemployed in industry so that if they become unemployed in the normal way they will be claiming unemployment insurance rather than unemployment assistance, but he is looking on the unemployment assistance scheme as a permanent scheme.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a tremendous gap between the Minister's promises and his performances, so far as the unemployed are concerned.  It is not very pleasant to be continually talking about this subject.  I am not one of those who believes for a moment that it is possible for the Minister or whoever may succeed him, with the best will in the world, completely to wipe out unemployment in this country. I do not suppose it can be done, but I believe that, tackled in the proper way, it can be reduced to very small proportions.  We have to be fair to the Minister to this extent, that so far as his efforts to deal with unemployment are concerned, he was faced <Col N="2000" /> from the beginning, from the time he and his colleagues decided to embark on the economic war&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether the Deputy was going to refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is merely a passing reference.  The Minister must surely realise that it cannot be ignored in dealing with the question of unemployment. It has a very big bearing on unemployment, and the Minister knows quite well that he is not going to get men absorbed in industry unless, side by side with it, he can build up prosperous agricultural conditions. The Minister knows as well as I do, although he may have stated differently at the dinner of the Federation of Irish Industries, that instead of looking to industry in the main to absorb our unemployment, he will have to look to the development of agriculture in the main to absorb them.  That is my whole point, that so long as this particular affair continues, I do not believe it would be possible for the Minister or any other Minister, with the best intentions in the world, to deal in a satisfactory way with the unemployment question. Unquestionably, to those of us who are in daily contact with unemployed persons, it is apparent there has been a very rigorous tightening up of the administration of the Department during the last 12 months.  Cases have been brought to our notice day in and day out, and I am afraid that that tightening up process is not so much to eliminate whatever abuses there may be.  That was not the primary purpose.  The primary purpose was to save money for the Exchequer.  We have always to keep in mind when dealing with these regulations and their enforcement that the Minister for Finance, in his last Budget statement, said he was aiming to save £300,000, a very substantial sum, on this service.  If he has saved it, he has done so by denying people the unemployment assistance to which they were legally entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding all that the Minister has said and all the <Col N="2001" /> rosy promises that he, and the various members of his Party, made at the last general election, when they produced that wonderful plan about which we have heard so much, and which, in a most indirect way, Deputy Morrissey has just touched on, the problem of unemployment to-day remains as bad, if not infinitely worse, than it did when the Minister and his Party produced that wonderful plan. The Minister is usually very adept at solving most of our industrial problems, quite apart altogether from unemployment, the gravest of the whole lot&mdash;solving them to his own satisfaction, on paper.  But it is very poor satisfaction indeed, and very poor solace and comfort to the unemployed men in Cork and Dublin, or any other portion of the Saorstát, who, notwithstanding a heartbreaking search for work day after day, cannot find the employment about which the Minister speaks here whenever he rises to address the House on industrial matters.</P>
      <P>I know what the position in Cork City was and what its position is to-day on the industrial side.  I know that so far as Cork City is concerned there was never so much unemployment. Personally I do not stand for the work shy; I do not stand for the person who signs at the employment exchange for the purpose of receiving money for nothing.  I am quite on the Minister's side in that respect.  But the Minister has at his disposal, and his Department at its disposal, a very easy remedy, a very easy method, of finding out whether the person who registers for work is or is not genuinely seeking employment.  The remedy is this. Offer to that person work of any kind for which that person is suited, and then, if that person refuses the work, it is very easy to ascertain whether he or she is genuinely seeking employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I commend that to the Minister; he might try it as an experiment. I have no doubt whatever that here, as elsewhere, there may be people who are work-shy, but I speak for a large number of persons who come to me day after day, and week after week, and who are genuinely seeking employment <Col N="2002" /> and who, because of this section of the Act which deals with that particular class of persons, are refused unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with a great flourish of trumpets and his back-bencher followers, with an equally great flourish of trumpets, proclaimed the great relief that the ratepayers were to get under this Act and what they could reasonably anticipate when the Act became operative.  What is the experience? It is this: that while the expenditure on poor relief&mdash;outdoor relief, as it used to be called&mdash;is not going down, expenditure on home assistance is going up.  These are facts that cannot be controverted.  Now, if, as the Minister predicted, home assistance figures would go down and expenditure under it would be lessened&mdash;if that has happened and if it is true&mdash;it is easy for the Minister to contradict the statement I make now or else admit that it is true.  It is natural, of course, that those persons who are refused unemployment assistance or State benefit should turn to the home assistance authorities for relief.  That kind of relief has been readily given, but then the Minister should recollect that we were told that this question would be made a national one, instead of a local one, and that the ignominy of applying for home assistance or outdoor relief would no longer be tolerated in this country and that everyone could apply for work, and could go to the unemployment exchanges with their chests out and their heads up and demand from the nation all the beneficence allowed them.  But promise and fulfilment are two different things.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it from the Minister that a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out, according to the Act, that a person who is for a long period unemployed is to be deemed to be one not genuinely seeking work?  I do see the force of the objection on the part of the Department, and an objection which I would stand over, to the use of the nation's money for subsidising work-shy persons if they are found to be present.  But I suggest a way to the Minister which I commend to him and to his officials and others who have the administration of these funds. <Col N="2003" /> Unemployed persons deprived of assistance by the officials frequently blame the officials and the Court of Referees.  In most cases such persons are wrong.  My experience of the Court of Referees is that in all cases they give due attention to the claim of the unemployed person, but neither the officials nor the Court of Referees can be blamed if they interpret the Act in the way the Minister says it should be interpreted. It is a question of policy not so much as administration.  I have the greatest sympathy with many of the officials of the labour exchanges who are endeavouring to translate the policy of the Government.  It is the unemployment officials and the Court of Referees who are in the front-line trenches, bearing the brunt of the battle arising out of the Minister's policy.</P>
    <P>The House should understand, and the Minister should understand, that no matter how sympathetic, or well disposed or kindly disposed the officials at the exchanges may be or the Court of Referees may be, it is a question of policy that decides these things.  It is the interpretation of the section of the Act in the way the Minister wants it interpreted that matters.  I would make this suggestion to the Minister.  He might ask both officials and the Court of Referees through the head officer, the manager of the local labour exchange and the President of the Court of Referees respectively, to make a more liberal interpretation of those three or four words &ldquo;not genuinely seeking work.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly, grave hardship has been inflicted upon a very large number of deserving people, and it is adding insult to injury to tell an unfortunate creature unemployed for two or three years that he or she is deprived of benefit because not genuinely seeking work.  I feel sure, however I may differ from the Minister in many respects, that he is a man of initiative and of some human feeling.  I think that he has a full grasp of the effect of the Act and that in the reports from the managers of the labour exchanges, and the Court of Referees, he will see there has been grave hardship inflicted upon <Col N="2004" /> the persons to whom I have referred. I ask the Minister as one who has some respect, and regard, and, also, a little sympathy with the particular job he has to do, to consider the suggestion of issuing instructions for wider and more humane interpretation of four words I have quoted.  If that were done it would cost the State, perhaps, something extra but it would be money well spent and would be spent in fulfilment of the Minister's own undertaking, when he told the country that when the Act became operative it would mean, in practice, that the amount paid out in home assistance would be lessened very considerably. I am now talking of the effect that this would have on the man who, in my interpretation, is genuinely seeking work if his claim is met from the Unemployment Assistance Fund instead of home assistance. I am talking of the moral effect that will have on a man, and to me, at any rate it is of great importance to see the morale of our people kept up even at the expenditure of a little more of money.  I ask the Minister to act as far as possible on the suggestion I have just made to him.  It would have, perhaps, a better and more far-reaching effect than even an increase of the money assistance given to the majority of those who are entitled to draw that benefit.  I again impress on the Minister, at the risk of repetition, that the points I have raised are worthy of his consideration, if he has any respect or regard for the morale of our people who are genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that he had not received any reports or complaints of difficulties in connection with the operation of the period order procedure but that, on the contrary, he had received reports of difficulty in securing agricultural workers in many parts of the country.  I should like to refer to an area which has suffered considerably in connection with many matters for which this Government is not responsible.  An industrial area has closed down and it happens that, in that area, very few farmers employ men.  In the constituency I represent the farmers are not able to avail of the <Col N="2005" /> agricultural policy of the Government. That is not due to any fault on their part.  They live a long way from the Carlow beet factory in mountainous territory, and the land is not suitable for the growing of wheat.  I want to ask the Minister to make a special exemption in respect of the period order for single men in that area.  They are unable to find employment in Avoca and other rural areas.  The farmers do not require them, and the position in which we will find ourselves will be that the majority of single men, being unable to obtain unemployment assistance, will have to receive grants from the board of health.  I see the Minister's difficulty in making exceptions but, where a special case can be put up, as it can be put up on behalf of our county, and where the men are willing but are unable to obtain work, due to the causes I have indicated, I do not think the period order should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the Minister has referred to the sympathetic view which the Court of Referees takes.  Unfortunately, in our county, the Minister has not sanctioned any Court of Referees. While there are a few complaints regarding excessive charges in respect of the means test, I can well understand the mentality of a Court of Referees sitting in Dublin to decide the value to the man in the country of a few drills of potatoes.  A man in West Wicklow, in order to avail of the Court of Referees, must travel to Carlow.  He may get a voucher on the bus, but there is no voucher to bring him the ten or 15 miles to the main road where he will get the bus.  The journey to Carlow might involve two days if the man lived at Rathangan, Hollywood or any such area.  A man in East Wicklow may have to go to Dublin, and he may forfeit his rights rather than do that.  I ask the Minister to meet the difficulty in Wicklow.  I do not suggest that people in Bray should have the services of a special Court of Referees, but I suggest that there should be one at least in Arklow, to take in East Wicklow, and one in Blessington.  An order is sent to the Guards who advise men as to work in certain areas.  I should be only too <Col N="2006" /> anxious, through our organisation, to assist men in procuring work.  I am sure the Minister appreciates our position, and I ask that a special exemption be made in the areas I have just mentioned.  I ask the Minister, too, to take special note of the hardship to a man in West Wicklow of having to attend a Court of Referees in Dublin or Carlow.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to take into consideration the case of the man who will be deprived of unemployment assistance under this Order and the difficulty which the boards of health have, owing to the financial position, in providing assistance for these men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett has mentioned a very important point with reference to the Court of Referees and the distances which unemployed men have to travel in order to have their cases heard.  He referred to West Wicklow men having to travel to Carlow to put their case before the referees.  These men have no means for travelling long distances.  They have to borrow a bicycle, or try to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; lorries.  On numerous occasions I have interviewed these men, and I should like to emphasise Deputy Everett's point.  Is there any way by which the referees could be brought on different days to different centres? For instance, if the Carlow referee were asked to attend at Athy on a certain day, it would save considerable hardship.  Deputy Everett's point is one to which the Minister and his officials should give serious consideration. My suggestion might help only in a few cases, but it would help in those cases where help is most needed. Putting aside unemployment statistics and the pros and cons of industrial activity in solving unemployment, I often wonder if we have come to the point where we should consider the obligations of citizenship.  I think the time has been reached when representative citizens throughout the country who have a desire to help their fellow-men should take up the question of forming clubs for unemployed men and try and bring about, particularly in the rural areas, a relief of the terrible drudgery suffered by the unemployed, and prevent that loss of morale <Col N="2007" /> on the part of our young men which has been referred to.  In this matter, citizens and industrialists, as well as the Government, have a duty to perform. The time has arrived when we might copy the methods of other countries, not necessarily Great Britain, where this question has been tackled and where a lead has been given.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Pattison does not want to be flippant, as this is a serious question.  I am sincere in suggesting that if possible we should try to bring about a spirit, other methods having failed, by which the unemployed could be helped both vocationally and socially.  A great deal of trouble and some of the happenings that we hear about might be avoided if there was a movement to help the unemployed.  I am not suggesting that the unemployed should be marshalled into crops and ordered here and there. On the contrary, it would be well if some of the younger people in this country who are leaving colleges got into touch with young people who are unemployed and helped them in their difficulties.  In that way a better public spirit would be developed. Something like that should be done. As far as making any political appeal on this question, I refuse to make it. It is the duty of everyone in this State to bring about a better state of affairs. Although my remarks may cause smiles amongst the Labour Party, who may look upon them as so much talk, or imagine I have a personal or a selfish interest in this matter, I assure them that is not so.  I only wish I had the power and was capable of making a speech which would impress those listening to me to deal with the unemployment problem.  I have no time to prepare long speeches, and I can only deal with the position as I see it.  If public men and public bodies like county councils and urban councils, business men and young people with leisure would only take an interest in the unemployment problem in a really Christian way, a great deal could be done to help the unemployed to improve <Col N="2008" /> their morale and perhaps help to bring about a change in other matters that we do not care to refer to in this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that he had dealt with the total number unemployed in every week for a certain time.  One would imagine that the Minister had no other figures before him.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, the Minister apparently throws up his hands in despair, and, instead of the rosy talk we were accustomed to from him, he has nothing better than the hope to keep the Unemployment Assistance Act as a permanent piece of legislation enshrining the principle in it already.  On previous occasions the Minister endeavoured to say that the Opposition Party had voted against the introduction of that measure.  He had to correct that statement.  In the circumstances the Act was necessary because of the position created by the Minister's Party.  Something had to be done to provide State assistance for people who were unable to get employment and who were becoming such a burden on the rates that they could not bear it.  Even if the Minister feels hopeless about the situation we should have a more critical examination of what is happening to-day.  The Minister suggested to Deputy Morrissey that there are more people in employment in agricultural occupations in Tipperary now than in the past.  The Minister provided figures to show that in County Tipperary last year there were 375 persons less employed on June 1 in agricultural occupations than at the same date in 1934.</P>

If the Minister will refer to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and to the propaganda issued through that side of the House&mdash;I know he issues his own&mdash;he will understand that there is an inducement to register members of farmers' families as being actively engaged in agricultural work that did not exist before, owing to the allowance for employment given in a <Col N="2011" /> section of the Act dealing with rates on agricultural land.

      <P>At any rate when we come to discuss the difference between one year and another, the Minister provides out of one set of <Col N="2012" /> figures an absolute figure.  There may be something to be said for taking an absolute figure when you discuss the differences that operate in a particular period between one year and another.  If there is a substantial difference in June there is a substantial difference in July.  What I really want to ask the Minister is this.  The Minister at the beginning of last year indicated either through himself or the Minister for Finance, that he was going to spend £300,000 less during the year which we have just completed than in the year before.  The Minister did not succeed in effecting that economy, I think.  My impression is that he had to spend more in unemployment assistance last year than in the year before.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when it was most difficult to get work, a time when the unemployment peak has shown itself year after year.  That was the time he chose, not the time when, under a normal state of affairs, unemployment might be expected to be at a low ebb.  It was at the peak period of seasonal unemployment that the Minister contrived machinery to put unfortunate men off the unemployment assistance payment sheets because they were not genuinely looking for work.  The Minister has introduced employment periods now.  He has extended what was the employment period for land-holders of a particular kind from 19 weeks to 35. That is, he has increased the period during which they will not be eligible <Col N="2013" /> for unemployment assistance by 16 weeks.  In the case of unmarried agricultural labourers he has increased the period from 8 weeks to 21&mdash;an increase of 13 weeks.  Will the Minister tell us whether his reason for doing that is that there is now more employment to be got in the country, or that the financial position of the country is not able to bear the same expenditure on unemployment assistance as last year?  If the Minister issued these Employment Orders because there is more employment available in the country, then the Minister could tell us that explicitly.  If the Minister is reducing relief payments to a class of people to assist whom particularly he brought in this legislation because the finances of the country cannot bear them, we ought to know that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the financial position of the country is such that we need not pay any attention to it, does the Minister tell us that the reason that he is cutting down these payments and extending the employment periods is because there is more employment in the country?  If there is more employment in the country, will the Minister tell us why the permanent agricultural labourers employed in 1935 were 617 less in number than in 1931, and why there were 1,055 less employed in 1935 than in 1934?  It is very hard to understand why the Minister will not address himself to an explicit examination of the matter.  It is very hard to understand why he holds, in the casual way in which he does, that there is more employment in the country in view of the figures which he has given us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary question, told us that in the following counties agricultural employees, <Col N="2014" /> including fathers of families and heads of houses, were less in 1935 than in 1934 by the numbers indicated &mdash;Carlow, 697; Kilkenny, 40; Leix, 171; Longford, 455; Westmeath, 404; Wexford, 31; and Wicklow, 30.  There might be some explanation for the decrease in employment in Leinster counties, where there was a reduction in the beet acreage in order to transfer part of that acreage to Munster and Connaught, but let us take the other counties.  In Clare there were 784 less employed in 1934 than in 1935; in Cork, 309; Kerry, 99; Limerick, 604; Tipperary, 375; Galway, 993; Leitrim, 2; Mayo, 1,172; Roscommon, 694; Sligo, 459; and Cavan, 437 less.  Although the Minister, in comparatively recent weeks, gave the House the information that the number of persons employed in agriculture last year in these counties was less by the figures I have quoted, he has told us that there is more agricultural employment available, and that that is why he issued his employment period Orders.  The Minister for Finance, as Deputy Morrissey and, I think, Deputy Anthony have said, indicated to the local authorities that he was going to relieve them considerably of the burden of home assistance by the introduction of unemployment assistance payments. The figures given to-day by the Minister indicate that the total amount of unemployment assistance paid in the month of March last over the country as a whole, excluding Dublin and the area around it&mdash;Balrothery and Rathdown&mdash;was £102,500.  Nevertheless, the amount of home assistance paid by local authorities in the month of March this year was greater than it was in the month of March before Fianna Fáil took over.  Therefore, the situation that presents itself to the bodies in the country responsible for relieving the poor, in spite of an expenditure of over £100,000, not including Dublin City or the area surrounding it, is of such a nature that, in spite of the difficulty of getting in rates in the present economic condition of the farmers, they are called upon to collect and pay out more money in home assistance than <Col N="2015" /> they were doing before the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced. In view of these considerations, the Minister has a duty to consider whether his action in introducing the employment period Orders is dictated by any knowledge of his that the country cannot bear the expenditure that is going on at the present time, and would require a more careful explanation from him of the figures which he has disclosed with regard to employment in agriculture; that is, if we are going to believe that he is treating this matter in a serious-minded way at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear that the Minister was of opinion that the Unemployment Assistance Act was working smoothly.  I think, if he makes inquiries, he will find that the position is quite different.  In the part of the country that I know best there is widespread dissatisfaction with the present position in regard to unemployment assistance.  I want to refer to some of the sources that cause a good deal of delay and consequent dissatisfaction in connection with the Act.  The Minister must be aware that a good deal of the time of the officials charged with the administration of the Act is taken up with the investigation of anonymous complaints.  I venture to suggest that it should be easy to establish that a great many of these complaints are entirely groundless. Quite a number of them have been so proved to be.  The Minister and his department must be aware that a great many complaints arise purely from motives of malice.  I know that within the last 12 months, in West Cork, one person was responsible for the suspension of the payment of unemployment assistance to 15 persons. That was because of bogus offers of employment.  In the case of those who were made the victims of such complaints, long delays occurred before the payment of assistance was renewed.  I suggest to the Minister that the period of these delays might be considerably shortened.  Somebody with a kink in him, or because of a local prejudice, sends an unsigned complaint <Col N="2016" /> to the labour exchange, and benefit is promptly suspended in the case of some deserving person.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable, I suppose, that there should be an investigation when a complaint is made, and a suspension of benefit, because of the fact that a very small percentage of the complaints made may prove to be genuine.  What I have to complain about is the long delay that takes place, arising out of such complaints, before payment of assistance is resumed.  These complaints are investigated by the Guards promptly enough, but in too many cases several weeks elapse before a final decision is come to and payment resumed.  That is an extremely serious matter for the persons concerned as well as for their dependents.  It involves, too, the transfer of such people to home assistance funds pending a decision in their cases.  Several Deputies have referred to that in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it ought to be possible, without doing away with the necessity for making inquiries and of establishing the <i>bona fides</i> of claimants, to shorten considerably the period during which investigations are carried out. The only complaints, I suggest to the Minister, that should be acted upon are those which bear satisfactory proof of being genuine.  We all know that you have in every country evilly disposed persons, people with a petty grudge of some kind against a neighbour. Such people think that the easiest way to inflict immediate hardship is to send in an anonymous complaint. Only too often, unfortunately, that happens to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to certain remarks that have been made about offers of work of any kind, I would like to join issue with Deputy Anthony on that.  I am aware that offers of work have been made to people at a wage of 3/- or 4/- a week.  I consider that it is a perfectly proper thing for an unemployed person to refuse offers of that kind. They are not reasonable offers of work and ought not to be regarded as such either by the unemployed person or by the officials of the Department.  I think there ought to be some definite standard of wages&mdash;low and miserable <Col N="2017" /> enough as they are in agriculture or in whatever work is usually performed by the person&mdash;to determine what is a reasonable offer of work.  I want to add my voice to what has been said in regard to the large numbers of people who have had their unemployment assistance suspended or who have been finally refused assistance on the grounds that they were not genuinely seeking work.  I think it is a great hardship on people, some of whom have unfortunately been idle for a year or two, or have only done a little work in between, that although they are willing to work and are available for work, the fact that they are on assistance for a fairly long period seems to weight the scales heavily against them in any investigation of their case afterwards.  It is not intended, perhaps, that that should be so, but, judging by the results, one is forced to the conclusion that that is the case in many instances.  A very large number of widows with children have from time to time been deprived of unemployment assistance on that plea. I have known a number of cases which were so decided.  I should very much like if the Minister would make more inquiries as to how this provision is operating, because it seems to me that in a fairly large number of cases it operates very unfairly indeed.</P>
    <P>The most general complaint that one hears about the administration of the Act is in regard to delays.  One hears about the determination of a claim against an applicant, and then the machinery of the Act is available for the applicant; he is entitled to seek to have that decision reversed by the Court of Referees.  But there is sometimes a fairly long delay before the case comes before the Court of Referees.  Perhaps delays of that kind are unavoidable, but they make the position of the unemployment person, who is without any provision in the meantime, very difficult.  That, however, is not the kind of delay that I want to complain about.  What I want to complain about is the delay that very often occurs after the decision of the Court of Referees has been given.  I have been present at sittings of Courts of Referees and have <Col N="2018" /> personal knowledge and recollection of certain decisions.  Several weeks sometimes elapsed before the applicant is informed of what the position is.  The delay in that case seems to me to be with the headquarters of the Department, where a further examination of such decisions is necessitated, but it should not necessitate the very considerable delay which takes place before the decision is given in a great number of cases.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the employment periods.  I want to suggest to the Minister that there is no justification for employment periods at all in the case of persons who have holdings with a valuation of about £4, because such people hold land which is equivalent to the plot attached to a labourer's cottage.  99.9 per cent. of the people concerned are workers, pure and simple, for the whole 12 months of the year.  One, two, or three weeks in the year would provide ample time for them to do the work necessary on their own holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The average valuation of land is 10/- an acre and, therefore, on the average a holding with a valuation of £4 must be eight acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that a £4 valuation represents a very small holding.  There might be seven or eight acres, but only one or two acres might be suitable for tillage purposes.  The bulk of it, in the cases I have referred to, is rough grazing land which is not the subject of any labour by the holder at any time during the year.  I do suggest to the Minister that the employment period Orders operate very harshly against such people.  If they are unable to get portion of the work that is available on the roads, in the way of carting if they have a horse, or in the way of manual labour, they are available to work for their neighbours, and the bulk of them get their living in that way.  To suggest that they would require 18 or 19 weeks, or even a small portion of that time, to do work on their own holdings, is to suggest what is an utter impossibility in a very large number of cases that I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> Like Deputy Everett, I want to draw the Minister's attention to what I think might be remedied by a further examination of the position.  In West Cork the sittings of the Court of Referees are held in Bantry, and they cover a stretch of country from Allihies Mines to Clonakilty&mdash;certainly in the neighbourhood of 70 miles.  They cover also, as far as West Cork is concerned, up to 100 islands off the coast.  A large number of the islands are not of very great significance in this respect, because the number of applications that would arise there are very small.  But in places like Cape Clear and Sherkin, where there is a very large number of persons, who, by reason of their position in life, would seem to be normally persons eligible for unemployment assistance, I suggest that involves very considerable hardship.  In regard to Cape Clear, which is the largest of the islands, with a population of something like 500, the cost of travelling to the mainland is in the neighbourhood of £1 if one is to make a special journey, or a proportionate part of that sum if one is fortunate enough to be able to travel with other people who are making the same journey.  In addition, there is the very long journey from Baltimore to Bantry.  It may not be possible, but if it is possible to establish sittings of the court in rotation in certain towns in West Cork, or in some sub-division of the area, it would certainly very considerably facilitate the persons concerned.  I make that suggestion to the Minister in the belief that if it is possible to do anything along those lines he will consider the matter.</P>
    <P>There certainly is very serious dissatisfaction with the present working of the Act.  Delays account for the greatest number of the complaints that one does hear, and I wish to emphasise what has been said from other quarters in that connection.  I was sorry to hear in the course of this debate arguments which seem to me to have no other result than to put the position of the unemployed people of this country in a very unfavourable light. Deputy Anthony for instance said, with a fervour associated with his laying <Col N="2020" /> down of certain principles of one kind or another, that we have very many work-shy people in the country. I think that is a slander on the working people of this country.  Coming from the same county as Deputy Anthony I want to refute that most emphatically here.  I have come in contact with working people in very many parts of Cork county&mdash;and I think what is true of that county is true of the country as a whole&mdash;and one could meet 200 or 300 people without being able to point to one person to whom that allegation would apply. I very much resent the making of statements of that kind here.  Why does one have to apologise, in this or any other assembly, when making a plea for unemployed persons?  Why does one always have to adopt the sanctimonious attitude of segregating, as is attempted to be done, the genuine unemployed from the impostors one always hears associated with discussions of this kind?  They do not exist, and it is an unfair reflection on the workers of the country that the statement should be made.</P>
    <P>The working people of the country who have to endure the horrors of unemployment have to put up with other things which are sometimes very little less humiliating.  One hears in certain organisations constant reference to what is described as the dole. I think that people in this country, many of whom are getting assistance and subsidies of one kind or another at the hands of the State, are no less in receipt of the dole than the people who have to be helped in the way in which they ought to be helped in any civilised country because they are unable to get work.  There are a great many living people in this country at present in the enjoyment of means which they never earned and which were originally obtained by methods that were very questionable and doubtful, and I resent the atmosphere in which discussions of this kind, both in this House and in other parts of the country, amongst certain very comfortable and well-fed people, take place.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Minch, who <Col N="2021" /> spoke a moment ago, that there is no desire in this, or, I think, in any other quarter of the House, to treat suggestions for easing the difficulties of unemployment with any flippancy, but it does seem a puny contribution to a debate of this kind to suggest certain tiny social efforts for unemployed persons while the core of the whole problem seems to remain untouched. I put up the suggestions I have made to the Minister in the certain knowledge that I can talk with some degree of accuracy about this position.  They are not put up for the purpose of making the Minister's task in this matter more difficult than it is, but in the belief that they will enable him to ease a great many of the difficulties that obtain at present, and permit the benefits of the Act, limited and poor and inadequate as they are, to flow uninterruptedly into the homes of people, so long as there are victims of unemployment in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in my constituency, there are a number of people, principally British ex-servicemen, who, by reason of the fact that they have a small pension, are not entitled to draw unemployment assistance.  For that reason they cannot become registered as unemployed and are, therefore, not entitled to go on the roll as unemployed men, and are not entitled to work, notwithstanding the fact that the small pension they get is not sufficient to maintain them.  I think it is an extraordinary state of affairs that there are men anxious for work who, through no fault of their own, are debarred simply because they have a small pension, and who cannot become registered unemployed because they are in receipt of this pension.  I ask the Minister in all sincerity to have their cases investigated with a view to ascertaining whether he could not give them some sort of genuine claim, and put them on the same basis as their fellow-men who are on the unemployed list and who get preference in the matter of employment.  These men want work and they are most anxious to do everything that would put them <Col N="2022" /> on this list and make them entitled to work.  At present, they are simply told, when they go to the exchange, that they are not entitled to work by reason of the fact that they have a paltry pension of 15/- and, in some cases, less.  They have actually less than men who are getting unemployment assistance, and I appeal to the Minister to have their cases investigated.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters I should like to refer to.  One is the question of the remuneration paid to branch managers of employment exchanges throughout the country.  There are two types of persons concerned.  One is the manager, who is a regular civil servant and remunerated on the Civil Service scale of pay.  The other is the branch manager, who is paid a rate of pay in accordance with the volume of work in his office.  I think the normal maximum pay in respect of the latter category of people is approximately £5 per week, and many of those who are so employed find it necessary to employ staffs to deal with the volume of work in the office.  If the Minister makes inquiries, I think he will find that by the time these staffs are paid, the amount of money left to the branch manager, on whom the ultimate responsibility for administration devolves, is probably less than the rate of pay to, let us say, building labourers in any town where building labourers are properly organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only do I believe it, but I will prove it to the Minister.  I should like the Minister to be able to quote cases showing the remuneration of branch managers, the amount paid to their individual staffs, the amount paid to the individual members of the staffs, and the balance left to the branch manager.  For instance, I should like the Minister to tell me what remuneration is left to those persons employed in exchanges who have about £3 per week as managers.  What residue is held by them after they have met their commitments in the ordinary <Col N="2023" /> way to the staff they employ and the other necessary commitments which are involved?  Then we shall have some idea as to what the Minister considers to be a fair standard of remuneration.  I should like the Minister also to make some inquiries as to the rates paid to the staff employed by branch managers of that kind.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, and I have some experience of these matters, the rates of wages paid to the staff in these cases are utterly inadequate.  The branch manager is being treated unfairly by the Minister, who fixes a low rate of remuneration for him, and he, in turn, because he is being squeezed by the Minister on top, finds it necessary to squeeze his own employees underneath.  The scale paid to the branch manager is inadequate, and out of that inadequate salary he finds it difficult to pay an adequate salary to the persons whom he employs. If the Minister would make inquiries into that matter&mdash;personal inquiries into individual cases&mdash;and were to undertake an examination of all the cases, I think he will have no difficulty in realising that the employees of these branch managers are very badly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bad payment in the main is due to the fact that branch managers themselves are also badly paid.  Where, therefore, one employee is badly paid, he is compelled to employ others, and the reflex of his low wages is bound to be felt by those whom he employs. The Minister is responsible, because he pays these branch managers a low rate for the responsible work which they do for the State.  Deputies who have had experience of that work know that a considerable volume of work is dealt with in these offices. These people are doing work comparable to the work done by civil servants employed in other offices.  They are administering the same Act, and doing the same sort of work; perhaps the volume done in these offices is not the same, but the individual output of the branch manager is as good as the output of the civil servant, who is branch manager in another type of office.  I do not see any reason for differentiation <Col N="2024" /> between the scale paid to those branch managers in one office and the scale paid to civil servants who are branch managers in other offices.</P>
    <P>Employment clerks are referred to in this Estimate.  While their remuneration is low, the branch manager's remuneration is even lower.  The employment clerk's scale of pay is bad enough, but the manager, whose title one would imagine conferred perhaps a better claim to higher remuneration, has actually less than the employment clerk.  That is obviously an anomalous state of affairs which the Minister ought to lose no time in clearing up. I think the association representing these managers has tried to get a personal interview with the Minister, but I understand that so far they have not succeeded.  The Minister is their employer, and he is morally responsible for the conditions under which they are employed.  I suggest that a careful examination of the position would disclose to the Minister that these men are badly treated, and would convince him that he, as an employer, should take steps to investigate their grievances with a view to having these grievances remedied at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate reference has been made to what is called a new practice on the part of the Department of cutting off claims for unemployment assistance benefit on the slightest pretext.  I have had cases reported to me from Dublin, and a number also from my own constituency, where claimants for unemployment assistance benefit have been told that their claims have been suspended pending investigation.  Other Deputies and I have been compelled to write to the Department asking the reason as to why the claim is suspended, the applicant himself not having been informed by the local employment exchange.  In many cases it has taken months before these investigations are completed.  In the meantime the person whose claim is suspended is compelled to apply to the local authority for some form of assistance from that authority pending the decision on his claim.  The Minister may say that if the investigation shows <Col N="2025" /> that there was no reason for stopping the assistance benefit the accumulated arrears are paid to the claimant.  That is true.  It would not be just if it were otherwise, but the Minister is not entitled to plume himself on that score. My experience is that a man may have his claim stopped by any complaint made against him by some maliciously disposed person.  All that is necessary is for some maliciously disposed person to write to the Minister's headquarters and say that &ldquo;so and so was not entitled to unemployment benefit because he has benefits from other sources.&rdquo; or that &ldquo;he worked for such and such a man for half a day or for a day, and drew unemployment benefits at the same time.&rdquo;  The receipt of an unsigned letter of that kind, without a scintilla of truth, is sufficient for the Department to suspend a man's claim to benefit.  In this way benefit is denied to this man under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Then in the most leisurely way the Department proceeds to investigate the complaint. I wonder if the people responsible for that procedure would like to have that method applied in the case of their own remuneration.  If that procedure affected them personally, I am sure there would be much less delay in investigating the claims.</P>
    <P>I have had cases brought to me where I made representations to the Department asking them to expedite cases where unemployment benefits were suspended.  Months elapsed before there was any definite decision in the matter.  If the Minister wants particulars of these cases I can get them for him.  I have got cases at the moment where benefit was suspended, and where it has taken an inordinately long time to have the investigation completed.  A delay of that kind, especially in the case of unemployed men who are dependent on this unemployment assistance, is needlessly hard, and it is grossly unfair to these people.  The Minister ought to make some representations to his officials to expedite the investigation in cases of that kind, so that it will be completed in the shortest possible time, and if it is found that there is no justification for the suspension <Col N="2026" /> of benefits the payments will be resumed to the applicants with the minimum of delay.  I am glad Deputy Anthony has returned to the House, because I wanted to make some references to the Deputy's action in stigmatising some of the work-people as being rather shy of work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing to the effort that is being made in certain interested quarters to endeavour to show that certain unemployed persons prefer to receive unemployment benefit rather than to accept work.  As one who has some knowledge of the sufferings of the unemployed and who knows the anxiety that exists in the ranks of the unemployed for work which will enable them to obtain a decent income, I say that if work is available to unemployed persons they are only too eager to grasp at the opportunity of getting that work.  I am sure that every Deputy who takes an interest in the problem of unemployed persons is aware from personal experience that, if there is any employment available, unemployed persons make every possible effort to secure whatever employment is available.  I suppose many Deputies, like myself, have had the regular experience of being interviewed by unemployed persons and of receiving communications from such persons, all denoting that so far as the unemployed are concerned they, <Col N="2028" /> at all events, have a much higher conception of their responsibilities to their wives and those dependent upon them than to depend, and force their dependents to depend, upon the small pittance which they receive under the Unemployment Assistance Act rather than seek work at better wages if that work were available.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Murphy said, part of the same mentality is to describe what the workers receive under the Unemployment Assistance Act as a dole, apparently in the belief that money received by unemployed persons under that title will have the effect of demeaning their status in the community.  If the farmer gets money from the State it can, of course, be called a bounty.  He may do nothing whatever for it, but when the farmer gets it in respect of exports of particular commodities it is called a bounty.  When the unemployed man with a wife and children dependent on him receives money from the State it is called a dole.  What the unemployed receive is described by the demeaning title of a dole; what the farmer, or any other class of the community, receives on the export of produce is described by the much more respectable title of a bounty.</P>
      <P>If there is any test as to who has the best claim to receive money of that kind from the State, I think the unemployed man has an infinitely better claim, both legally and morally, to receive a decent measure of subsistence from the State.  He is a human being, and his claim as a human being, with the dignity of a human being, ought to take priority over every other demand which might be made on the resources of the State for financial sustenance of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who circulate the story that unemployed people are reluctant to work, are shy of work, and do not want work, know little about the sufferings of unemployed persons and have little concern for the relief of the sufferings which unemployed persons endure. When a workingman is idle hunger and destitution are his reward.  Many other sections of the community do no work whatever, and seem to be able to live in luxury.  The same people who rate and rant about the unemployed <Col N="2029" /> drawing the dole and the heavy burden which the payment of unemployment assistance imposes on the State, cannot be got to see anything wrong in the curious spectacle of other persons who are doing no work, and have not any intention of working, while being able to live in palatial homes and, apparently, to enjoy all the luxury that wealth can purchase for them.  It is only when the workingman is idle that all the ramp is created.  When the wealthy classes are idle, nobody suggests that they ought to be induced to work, and that their title to food ought to be based on their willingness and capacity to work.  I thought that the Minister would have told us on this Estimate what proposals the Government have to provide such employment as would obviate the necessity for paying the present sum under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is marshalling these Estimates of his in a peculiar way.  Here is an Estimate for the provision of a sum of £1,433,000 for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.  On that Estimate the Minister might well have taken advantage of the opportunity to tell the House what reasons he has for believing that it will not in future be necessary to spend that sum of money in the form of unemployment benefit because of the fact that he proposes to put into operation such plans for the provision of work as will obviate the necessity for spending that large sum of <Col N="2030" /> money.  This seems to me to be a particularly appropriate Estimate on which to make a statement of that kind, because this Estimate only reaches the figure of £1,433,000 because of the Minister's failure to provide work.  If the Minister were providing work it would be unnecessary to spend this money.  We ought to have from the Minister some statement which will indicate that he does not contemplate a situation whereby it will be necessary to spend this money in the form of unemployment assistance benefit not merely this year, but every other year.</P>

In that year we were told by the President that there was no reason why unemployment should exist in this country.  In the same period the present Minister for Defence said that we ought surely be glad that we had so many unemployed, because they would be available to do the enormous amount of constructional work that would immediately follow the advent of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

The shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce said &ldquo;I can see a hefty problem in front of me, finding workers to undertake the gigantic schemes which I and the Party have in mind.&rdquo;  He contemplated that it would not be possible to get all the workers here and some would have to be brought back.</P>

      <P>That was the situation in 1932.  There was going to be such constructional work undertaken that the President said there was no reason why there should be unemployment and the Minister for Defence said it was a good job the unemployed men were there so that they could be turned into this work when the Fianna Fáil Government would make it available.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce doubted if he could get sufficient workers in the country to undertake all the work that would be provided. If that plan could only be put into operation there would be no need to spend £1,400,000.  My complaint against the Minister is that with a plan of that kind up his sleeve, a unique plan of that kind which would absorb every unemployed person into productive employment and probably help to relieve unemployment amongst Irish-born people in other countries, the Minister is so reluctant and so legislatively lazy that he will not put it into operation.</P>

If we are to believe that and swallow it in the way the Minister wants us to swallow it, then the country, and particularly the rural areas, should be places in which there is an abundance of work, and the only danger facing the workers would be that they might be drowned in this deluge of released milk and honey.

      <P>There should be a rule against impertinence also, and if there was the Deputy would offend against it every minute of the day.  If you rule, a Chinn Comhairle, that this discussion is not in order, I will pass from that.</P>
      <P>We now come to the item for unemployment assistance, which shows that the benefits this year amount to £1,500,000, as compared with £161,000 in 1935-36.  I think the House will recollect that on the Budget last year the Minister for Finance submitted, and he was supported in subsequent discussions by the Minister for Indusary and Commerce, that one of the reasons for reducing unemployment assistance benefit was that the Government expected the inter-departmental committee to report on the scheme of work to be put into operation, and that as the work, devised by that committee, would put such a large number of people into employment, that was one of the reasons why the sum for unemployment benefit was reduced.</P>
      <P>I think I am entitled to ascertain what has been done in that direction? Until the recent employment period Order was reached there were 143,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges.  Unless those 143,000 persons have satisfied the rigid test of being unemployed, or unless the overwhelming majority have satisfied that test, the reduction of the Estimate for unemployment assistance benefit has made no impression whatever upon the problem of providing work, because the number of persons registered at the employment exchanges this year is as great, if not greater, than the number registered last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> That brings me to the point that the reduction of the Unemployment Assistance Estimate last year and again this year has been made for economic reasons, and not because the Government is able or will be able to provide any scheme of work as a result of the activities of the inter-departmental Committee.  I am afraid the Government is cultivating the mentality, that it is cheaper to have unemployment assistance benefit than to provide schemes of work.  A mentality of that kind which I am afraid is all too evident, in respect of the Government's policy, is calculated to keep within the country the very serious unemployment problem which exists in our midst to-day.  If the Government is impregnated with the notion that it is cheaper to keep people under the Unemployment Assistance Act than to provide large scale schemes of work or to reduce working hours so as to absorb a greater number of people in employment, then I am afraid we are going to have Unemployment Assistance Estimates to provide for the unemployed instead of that scheme of regular work, with decent rates of wages, which every unemployed person would prefer to any form of unemployment assistance benefit.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to tell us what proposals he has in regard to this matter.  He ought to tell us what proposals are likely to be put into operation this year whereby the tens of thousands of persons unemployed may have an opportunity of getting employment.  If the Minister would put into operation a plan of providing work for everybody there would be no need to pass Estimates of the dimensions of the Estimates here.  It is because the Minister is unwilling, or reluctant, to put into operation large schemes of work that will absorb thousands of unemployed persons, that the House has to pass Estimates of this kind.  We thought at one stage that Estimates of this kind would be just passing affairs.  I think when the Unemployment Assistance Act was going through this House, the Minister stated that the number of persons regularly on relief would be in the vicinity of 40,000.  The present number is close on 140,000.  Obviously in that <Col N="2038" /> state of mind the Minister conceived that the Unemployment Assistance Act would be dealing with an unemployed problem of 40,000 people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the points made in connection with the number of people dealt with recently <Col N="2039" /> by the Minister in his Department as a type not seriously seeking employment. One could understand that position being taken up by the Minister if things were normal in the country. But in view of the fact that there is a huge unemployment problem here, it is very hard to understand that mentality. I think it will be understood that there is widespread dissatisfaction prevailing because of the chaotic state of affairs under the administration of the Act.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, numbers of men are kept waiting unduly long at the labour exchanges. I do not want to blame the local managers, who are doing their best under very exceptional circumstances. I think it will be admitted by everybody that the managers are sending on claims in due time.  What I complain of is the length of time the claims are kept in Dublin, and there is no chance of claimants having their claims paid retrospectively.  Time after time Deputies find it their duty to get into touch with the Department, but we usually receive the same stereotyped reply: &ldquo;The matter is engaging the attention of the Department and will be dealt with in due course.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That &ldquo;due course&rdquo; means, in practically every case, six to seven weeks.  In the meantime, the unfortunate man who has made his claim in the ordinary, statutory way is on the verge of starvation.  Deputy Morrissey, I think, asked how the Minister or his Department arrived at the decision that a man is not genuinely seeking employment.  How is that defined, and what evidence is required from a man who has been in receipt of unemployment assistance for some time in order to satisfy the local manager, the Court of Referees or the Department, as the case may be, that he is still entitled to it?  That requirement has created alarm in a great many parts of the country.  In my own constituency the majority, if not all, the men drawing unemployment assistance would rather be working than be humiliated in an endeavour to secure unemployment assistance.  They have almost to go down on their knees in order to obtain unemployment assistance. <Col N="2040" /> I have had men with me, in my capacity as Mayor of Wexford, asking for letters to show that they have been seeking work from the Corporation or from other bodies with which I am connected.  When the Unemployment Assistance Bill was before the House, it was pointed out by the Minister and by Deputies on his side of the House that assistance under the Bill would replace home assistance or home help. As Deputy Anthony pointed out, it was explained that men could go to the exchanges with chests out and heads erect and that there would be no humiliation or degradation such as was supposed to surround the receipt of home assistance.  They were to get this unemployment assistance so long as they were unemployed.  I think the Minister will admit that it is very hard for men to secure employment at present in view of the abnormality of the position.  Advantage has been taken of the tightening up which is proceeding at the moment to get men to accept positions at a very low wage. I know of cases in my own constituency where men in the agricultural areas have been offered work at from 6/- to 8/- a week, and have been told very definitely that unless they were prepared to take work at that wage they would be wiped off the unemployment assistance register.  I hope that that is not the policy of the Minister. If that is his policy, these people are going to be a menace to other workers. As a matter of fact, they will be a menace to the whole community if they are going to be used, through the medium of the Unemployment Assistance Act, to reduce wages all over the country.  I think it would be better, in these circumstances, if we had never heard of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Before I leave that point, I want to suggest to the Minister that the investigation being carried out at present is absolutely uncalled-for, and that 99 per cent. of the men in receipt of unemployment assistance would rather be working than going to the labour exchanges, day after day, to secure the miserable pittance allowed them under the Act.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates this year the Government are saving something like <Col N="2041" /> £110,000 in this connection.  I suggest that, before that saving was made, or at the same time as it was being made, some relief should have been given to the ratepayers.  The ratepayers' contribution is £2,000 more this year than it was last year, while the Ministry are saving £110,000.  I had an amendment down when the Bill was passing through the House to secure that the net result of the levy of a 9d. rate for the smaller boroughs would be all that would be required to be paid to the Government.  The Minister rejected that amendment.  What is happening at present in a great number of the urban areas, such as Clonmel, Wexford and Sligo, where the people are supposed to pay this 9d. rate?  What they are actually paying is 10d. in the £.  That is due to the fact that certain concessions are given through the medium of various Acts of Parliament recently passed, which allow rebates. To secure that the Minister is paid at the full 9d. rate, it is necessary for the boroughs concerned to levy 10d. in the £.  One would think that, when the Ministry were saving under the Unemployment Assistance Act, they would give some relief to the ratepayers, aspecially as a great many, if not all, of the people they are paying off as not genuinely seeking employment are thrown back on the rates. There is no doubt about that.  Everybody who has had anything to do in recent months with the administration of county boards of health knows that the people who are rejected in this way automatically come back on the local rates.  The Minister will, I think, agree that that is very unfair, especially in view of the fact that in urban areas of certain population the people are called upon to pay at the rate of 10d. in the £ in connection with this Act, while they were told very definitely, when the Bill was passing through the House, that even though they were to pay a 9d. rate under the Act, what they would pay out with one hand they would take in with the other by way of saving in board of health administration.  I suggest that the Minister should loosen his hold on the position so far as the present investigation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should <Col N="2042" /> like to refer was touched upon by Deputy Norton.  That is the question of anonymous letters.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, many evil-minded people, with a spite against their neighbours, would write a letter to the manager of the employment exchange saying that there was a certain amount of money going into the house of a particular person. Immediately that letter is received, that person's benefit is held up.  It may be held up for five, six, or seven weeks while investigations are proceeding. I made it my business on many occasions to call to the local exchange to find out why benefit had been stopped.  I have invariably found that the reason was the receipt by the manager of the exchange of anonymous letters.  What I really object to in this connection is the length of time it takes to have a matter of that kind investigated.  In the meantime, the unfortunate man, his wife and children are hungry.  If the Minister thinks it necessary, in the interest of administration, to take notice of these anonymous letters, I suggest that it should be possible to carry out any investigations necessary inside a week, so that the unemployed man would be able to get back his benefit at the end of the following week if it were found that there was no justification for the anonymous letter.  I hope the Minister will do something to withdraw the very rigorous regulations that are in operation in so far as drawing benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded at the Minister's praise for the officials of this particular Department.  It is painful, to say the least of it, to Deputies who have any experience of communicating with the Department to have to sit here and listen to the Minister actually praising them.  As the Minister is aware, I put certain cases before him recently, and in view of the facts set out in the communication, I do not know how he could praise them in the fashion he did to-day.  Two years ago, when Deputies began to put down questions concerning unemployment assistance claims, the Minister asked them to refrain <Col N="2043" /> from doing so in order to give the officials of the Department an opportunity to get on with the work. Deputies obliged the Minister and did not put down questions, but, as far as my experience goes, there is more chaos to-day than two years ago. There seems to be no regard whatever for people who are forced to seek unemployment assistance.  We had a reference to the Court of Referees and how fairly cases were considered and dealt with.  It was pointed out that the Court of Referees consisted of local people who understood local conditions. The Minister must not be aware of a certain list of questions which was sent to branch managers from Dublin Castle recently.  A child could give the decision which the Department required, provided he went by that list of questions.  That seems to be all the legal knowledge that is required now.  We were told to-day that the chairman should be only a lawyer or a person with legal knowledge.  Having attended a recent court on behalf of the union I represent, I could see a big difference in it in comparison with courts in years gone by.  There is nothing in the nature of fair play or a desire to see justice done to an applicant.  Fine, decent, able-bodied young men in the City of Kilkenny were struck off the unemployment list lately on the ground that they were not genuinely seeking work.  These were young men who are nearly gone frantic looking for work.  The Unemployment Assistance Bill was before the House for a number of months before it was passed into law, but apparently no effort was made by the Department to set up machinery to administer it.  It is well known that at a certain time certain necessary official forms were not provided in the offices of the employment exchanges.</P>

    <P>I was present on a couple of occasions when decisions on cases were given by Courts of Referees in Kilkenny in favour of the applicants, and they were notified later officially that the courts had recommended disallowance of their claims.  I put the facts in these cases before the Minister, but apparently no heed is paid to the views of public representatives.  As far as <Col N="2044" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, the responsibility of public representatives seems to have no value.  Since the new procedure of cutting off genuine applicants commenced the life of a member of this House living in an urban district&mdash;in fact, the life of any public representative&mdash;has become almost intolerable. Members of the Executive Council may have got out of touch with this section of the people, and may know nothing about them, but I should like to hear from the Minister, when replying, what he proposes to do to have this latest act of tyranny from Dublin Castle put an end to.  The people there are safely housed, and, as I said the other day to some people, they are allowed by the present Executive Council to carry out the old-time tyranny.  On one occasion in Cork the President stated&mdash;it was before he became President&mdash;that if the unemployed were not recognised as a State responsibility, and if unemployment was not destroyed, it would destroy the State.  I am sorry to say that the latest action against the unemployed does not indicate that the officials in Dublin Castle intend to obey the President.  On the discussion that will take place on the Estimates for Public Works I expect to have something more to say about unemployment.  I ask the Minister to take some action and to see that the latest tyranny is ended, so that those genuinely seeking work&mdash;many of them well known to Deputies in the constituency&mdash;and who, through no fault of their own, cannot get it, will not be treated in this way. I hope the Minister will investigate all these cases.  As far as I am concerned he will have my co-operation.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister if anything has been done with regard to a matter I raised on a previous occasion: the position of fishermen employed on the share system on boats.  When they take up positions in these boats they are immediately scheduled as working, and therefore break their claims.  They may be working, but they are earning no money.  Sometimes they may have a series of blank weeks, solely because they are scheduled as working, <Col N="2045" /> although earning no money.  That is a great hardship on them.  I believe the same question has arisen in other places around the coast.  The Minister promised to give the matter sympathetic consideration and to have a special definition made for men in that class of employment.  I should like to know if anything has been done as the present regulations in many cases constitute a hardship.</P>

      <P>A number of matters which were referred to by speakers to-day can be more adequately dealt with on some other occasion.  The references which have been made to the total amount of unemployment in the country require some examination now, however questionable their relevancy to the debate may be.  We have had continuously the number of persons on the live register quoted as the number of persons unemployed. That is not correct.  In fact, it has been repeatedly explained that it is entirely erroneous to assume that the number on the live register represents the number of persons unemployed.  If one examines the live register, and analyses it, one finds that the persons on it can be divided into a number of categories.  There are first, those who are entitled to unemployment insurance benefit.  That number at the present time is a very small proportion of the total number of persons following insurable employment.  The proportion is less than 5 per cent., and it is reasonable to assume that they represent the number of persons in seasonal occupations&mdash;who are in process of transfer from one job to another, house-builders, constructional trade workers, carpenters and people of that kind, are at times in process of moving from one job of work to another and who at the moment are temporarily employed.  That is the nature of their employment.  It is not unreasonable to assume a number which is less than 5 per cent. of the total insurable can be so classified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These persons do not constitute a problem.  In so far as we have a problem of unemployment, these people are not part of it.  There are others on the live register who are not <Col N="2046" /> entitled to unemployment insurance benefit or to unemployment assistance at the present time of the year.  They would be such persons as those in the category covered by the first employment period Order.  The landholder of over £4 valuation, who had been excluded from unemployment assistance by that Order, would in the ordinary course, if unemployed, maintain registration because he continues to be entitled to preference for works financed out of State funds, if such works are available in his area.  The number of persons on the register entitled to unemployment assistance can be divided into two classes&mdash;those with means and those without means. It is necessary for Deputies and others. who come to the consideration of the unemployment problem, to realise that out of that figure there is a very large proportion&mdash;much more than 50 per cent., in fact&mdash;of persons who in the past were never regarded as unemployed&mdash;that is, in the main, small landholders and the sons of farmers living with their fathers on the fathers' farms.  At no time in the past were these people regarded as unemployed, and the efforts which have been made by Deputies to compare our live register people with the census figure for &ldquo;out-of-works&rdquo; are completely futile, because the census figure for &ldquo;out-of-works&rdquo; does not include&mdash; expressly does not include&mdash;persons who were in occupation of uneconomic holdings of land, or the sons of landholders living with their fathers on the fathers' farms in the census year.  If one were to quote from the census figures, and add to the total of &ldquo;out-of-works&rdquo; the number of landowners and the sons of landowners who would have been qualified to draw unemployment assistance in 1926, if there had been unemployment assistance in that year, one would get a total figure far in excess of any figure we have reached under the present system of administration.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote the present figure for the number of persons drawing unemployment assistance because Deputies might contend that it is unduly low.  It is round about 80,000 I think at the present time. <Col N="2047" /> To a certain extent that figure has been brought down by the operation of the First Employment Period Order although that Order, it may be assumed, only affects 5,000 or 6,000 persons at the most.  Going back to the 1st March, before the First Employment Period Order came into operation, there were 114,000 persons claiming unemployment assistance and of these 78,000 were described as persons having means.  In the main, those persons who were described as having means were small landowners and the sons of small landowners. The number of persons who were described as being without means was 36,000.  I say here, with a full knowledge of all the facts, that if we could find employment for 40,000 people, and put off our register these 40,000 from amongst those who are receiving unemployment assistance and who are without means, we would have settled our unemployment problem. There would be a land problem still existing, the problem of eliminating the uneconomic holding, a problem that has existed for many years. There would still be the problem that there are too many people trying, to get a livelihood on the land.</P>
    <P>Deputies who study the agricultural census taken in 1926 and the enumeration taken in 1929 will find that the output per individual employed, the acreage per individual, and every other index in these years, point to the fact that there were more people on the land than the land was capable of giving an adequate livelihood to, judging by Danish standards, Dutch standards or any other European standards.  That problem of underemployment on the land has persisted since the State was established and it will persist for some time although the operation of the tillage policy, of which Deputies are aware, is helping to eliminate it. The significance of the increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture to which Deputy Mulcahy referred is not that the actual increase is small.  It is that that increase has taken place despite the fact that the great majority previously employed <Col N="2048" /> in agriculture were not fully employed and the extent to which their labours could be employed on increased production, before additional help had to be engaged, is an indication of the amount of increased production that was possible without increasing agricultural employment.  There has been an increase in production and agricultural employment has increased.</P>
    <P>The way in which Deputy Mulcahy quoted figures here to-day was a good example of the Deputy's usual tactics. He was supplied here with a list of the numbers of persons employed in agriculture in different counties.  It is easy with such a list to pick out a particular townland or county-side, and to say that in that particular part of Ireland, the number of persons employed in agriculture decreased.  I am quite sure that if the Deputy surveys the statistics for every townland or every electoral district, he will find some circumstance which indicates an unfavourable tendency, but the total number of persons employed in agriculture over the whole of the Saorstát has increased during this Government's term of office. That is the essential fact.</P>
    <P>There was an increase of 18,000 in the number of persons employed in agriculture between the 1st June, 1931, and the 1st June, 1935.  Deputies cannot ignore that fact.  They have been told that agricultural employment has been diminishing, that agricultural production is going down, and that the amount of employment given in agriculture is likely to be adversely affected by Government policy.  The fact is that the number of persons employed in agriculture, whether employed as members of the farmer's family on the farmer's land or employed for wages, has increased.  The increase in the number of persons, members of families engaged on home farms&mdash;that is, persons over 18 years of age&mdash;between 1931 and 1935 was 13,000.  The increase during the same period in the number of persons over 18 years of age employed for wages was 4,600.</P>

      <P>Between the 1st June, 1931, and the 1st June, 1935.  There is an unemployment problem here, but it is not going to help us to solve it to have its extent exaggerated.  Deputies will remember that I said here, when I became Minister for Industry and Commerce, and set about doing my part of the Government's plan to solve unemployment, that the first step to that end was to get an accurate picture of the position.  I contended and, in fact, it was agreed&mdash;I am sure Deputy Morrissey will not dispute it&mdash;that the picture of the unemployment position existing in the beginning of 1932 was totally inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we had to get a complete picture. We took various measures to induce those who could be described in any way as being unemployed to register at the exchanges.  Our measures did not prove effective.  The first measure we took in 1932 gave us, again, a false picture.  It exaggerated, or appeared to exaggerate, unemployment in some areas and to underestimate it in others.  It was not until the Unemployment Assistance Act came into operation that we began to get a more accurate census of our unemployed, but that census is not the total on the live register.  The total on the live register represents our unemployed, plus a large number of other persons: that is the number of persons who, while not unemployed, are nevertheless available for work, such as road work when it occurs, convenient to the places in which they live, for wages.  The great majority of those people are resident in the province of Connacht and the three Ulster counties. In fact, whatever increase has taken place in the live register has taken place entirely in these areas. During the course of the past year there was a substantial reduction in the number of persons registered as unemployed, or registered on the live register in the province of Leinster. There was a reduction in the province of Munster, and there was no change so far as the four county boroughs were concerned.  The increase, to whatever extent there was an increase, was entirely in Connacht and the three Ulster counties and was entirely composed <Col N="2050" /> of such persons&mdash;that is, persons who are the owners of land, or the sons of the owners of land.  They are in a special category constituting a special problem.</P>
    <P>They are not an unemployment problem of the ordinary kind.  In dealing with that problem we have two main lines of attack; one is the development of industry and the other the development of agriculture.  In the interval, while long term plans for increasing industrial production or agricultural employment are coming into operation, the Government have been carrying out a number of relief works of one kind or another, or stimulating local authorities to undertake the construction of public health works of one kind or another with a view to giving employment of that kind, temporary employment, at any rate, while permanent employment is being made available.  If Deputies take the point of view that the fullest possible development of our industries, plus the fullest possible development of our agriculture, is not capable of solving unemployment here, then we have got to face the situation from a new light.  If that is the attitude of Deputies opposite, and it appeared to be the attitude expressed in some of their speeches&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it should not be, and therefore we can take it as agreed that the fullest possible development of industry, plus the fullest possible development of agriculture will between them enable us to eliminate unemployment. That is what the Government are doing to-day.  It is not relevant now to discuss the measures which are being adopted to that end.  In my opinion these measures have been as successful as we could hope them to be in all the circumstances of our time. They certainly have been remarkably successful when one has regard to all the difficulties of the situation.  I know that reference can be made in this regard to the effects of the economic war, but so far as the economic war has its reactions on employment. these reactions should be found in the <Col N="2051" /> volume of agricultural production.  The penal duties which have been imposed on our agricultural products may have reduced the prices obtained for these products, but there has been no evidence of any diminution in the volume of agricultural production, and because there is no evidence of any diminution in the volume of the production of the classes of goods in respect of which an export market is required, it is reasonable to assume that there has been no diminution in the employment given in the production of these goods, whereas, of course, there is a net gain to be recorded by the increased production of the classes of goods which are not intended for export and which are replacing, in the home market, goods formerly imported.  However, these matters are perhaps not quite appropriate to the Vote before the House. The administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act has been criticised from two points of view.  We have had it stated that the administration is harsh and that genuine unemployed persons entitled to unemployment assistance are being deprived of it because of the harsh methods of administration adopted.  I do not believe that.  It is the function of the officers of the employment branch of my department as much to ensure that every genuine unemployed person entitled to unemployment assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act gets that assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is being done now is the normal work of the Department in relation to unemployment assistance. I agree that, because over the <Col N="2052" /> past year or more, when the Act was only being brought into operation, and the attention of the officers was mainly concentrated on dealing with new applications for qualification certificates and so forth, the normal investigation work in relation to persons receiving unemployment assistance may not have got attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deny that special instructions were sent out to branch managers of employment exchanges to canvass from house to house to make a special investigation for the purpose of finding out information about the recipients of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The officers of the Department were told that the preliminary period is now over, the period during which the Act was being brought into operation.  It is only now that the normal work begins, and the normal work requires continuous investigation of the case of every person receiving unemployment assistance so as to ensure that that person continues to fulfil the statutory conditions. There statutory conditions are not very harsh.  In fact, a much larger number of persons in the small land owning class and in the other rural classes qualified to receive unemployment assistance than we had anticipated, and that was because the Act was not framed as tightly as it might have been.  The conditions for receiving qualification certificates and for becoming entitled to receive unemployment assistance in certain circumstances are not hard to fulfil.  The essential condition is that the person must be capable of work, available for work, and must be genuinely seeking work.  If a person does not satisfy these conditions, he is not entitled to unemployment assistance.  I cannot see the circumstances in which an unemployment assistance officer would deliberately question the application of a person who was satisfying these conditions, and compel him to prove to the satisfaction of the Court of Referees that these conditions were being observed, for no other reason except to be harsh to the applicant.  It could not happen.  In <Col N="2053" /> fact the normal and natural tendency for the unemployment assistance officer is to give the applicant the benefit of whatever doubt there is, and that is certainly the tendency of the Court of Referees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;his case should be investigated, because there are some grounds for assuming that such a person has been continuing to draw unemployment assistance while employed, or else that he is not genuinely seeking work.  In fact, Deputies know that in quite a number of cases in rural areas persons continue to draw unemployment <Col N="2054" /> assistance even when employed. I have, unfortunately, had the obligation of prosecuting a very large number of persons for that offence during the past year, and I am quite certain that the number prosecuted was a small proportion of the number who tried it on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there has to be some <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person drawing assistance is not entitled to it before we take the responsibility of stopping that assistance.  It is only when there is that <i>prima facie</i> evidence of ineligibility that the action of stopping payment is resorted to.  It is in the interest of the applicant that payment is stopped while his case is being investigated.  Here is the position: you either stop payment, and, if you find he was entitled to it, pay him in arrear the amount he should have got, or else you continue the payment and, if you find he was not entitled to it, bring him to court.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, Deputies know well that the worst hardship you can <Col N="2055" /> inflict on an unemployed person who is getting unemployment assistance to which he is not entitled is to continue to allow him to draw that assistance until you establish his ineligibility, and then proceed to recover the amount which he has received.  Those investigations do not take the time that Deputies represent.</P>

      <P>Here and there in individual cases there will be delay, where investigations have to be undertaken. There are over 300,000 persons affected by this unemployment assistance scheme.  There are 80,000 or 85,000 persons every week receiving unemployment assistance payments, and it is extraordinary that the actual number of individual cases of genuine complaint which have been brought to my notice are less than .001 per cent. of the number of persons affected by the administration of the Act.  I do not deny that delays have occurred in a number of cases, or even that, perhaps, in a number of exchanges the rapidity with which cases are dealt with is less than in other exchanges, but to say that in all cases there is delay and harshness and unfairness to the applicants is to give a very exaggerated picture of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attack has been made on the officials responsible for the administration of the Act.  I think that those officials have accomplished something very extraordinary in bringing this Act into operation with the speed with which they did it, and with the efficiency with which they did it.  I do not want to say more in that regard than I think fair play calls for.  This Act came into operation in April, 1934&mdash; two years ago.  It is an Act under which over 300,000 persons have made application for qualification certificates, have had their applications considered and determined, and have had qualification certificates issued to them.  It is an Act under which, in each month, we have paid out from £100,000 to £150,000 in assistance to unemployed persons.  It is an Act under which, at the present time, there <Col N="2056" /> are and have been since the beginning 85,000 persons or 90,000 persons receiving assistance every week.  It was a colossal administrative task to set up machinery capable of doing that, and to make it function without any serious break-down in any part of it.  That has been done, and it is a tribute to the efficiency of the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, who were entrusted with the task, that they have succeeded in doing it so well.  I think it is also a tribute to them that they have done that while being constantly told that they were acting harshly and unreasonably, that they were actuated by all sorts of doubtful motives and so forth, by people who might have had a little consideration for the task that had been imposed upon them, for the difficulties they were encountering, and for the success with which they were overcoming those difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal now with the question of the remuneration of branch managers, which was raised by Deputy Norton.  The remuneration of branch managers was increased only a short while ago, and I am satisfied that it is not at all unreasonable.  The remuneration is, of course, based upon the volume of work passing through the various branches.  I should like to say that in my opinion the system of administration through those branch offices is not in itself a desirable one, and I think it will be found necessary in the future to reduce the number of branch offices and increase the number of exchanges.  Consequently the matter of the remuneration of branch managers will become less important as time goes on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the position of those people be specially considered in the event of that change?  Some of them have been employed for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot undertake that.  Reference was made by Deputy Mrs. Redmond to the position of British ex-servicemen.  I should like to deal with that matter, because it is one concerning which misunderstanding exists in other places than this House. In relation to the employment <Col N="2057" /> exchanges, in relation to the matter of registering for work, and in relation to the matter of receiving work, British ex-servicemen are in no different position to any other members of the community.  What has given rise to the misunderstanding is the fact that, in the calculation of means for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Act, pensions have necessarily to be taken into account.  The pensions to which those men are entitled are regarded as means, and in the case of many of them they are of such amount that they are disqualified under the Act from receiving a qualification certificate.  In so far, however, as they are disqualified from receiving qualification certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Act, they are in no different position to any other person having means of the same value.</P>
      <P>A person who had an income from a holding of land, a share in a fishing boat, from a small shop or any other source, of the same amount per week would also be disqualified, and would be in exactly the same position, in relation to the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, or in the matter of receiving employment on public works, as these ex-servicemen with pensions.  They are, of course, fully entitled to register at the exchange.  Deputy Mrs. Redmond said they were not entitled to register. That is not correct, and that registration may be quite useful for them in the matter of obtaining employment. There is only one class of employment in respect of which it is not likely in present circumstances to be of value to them, and that is employment financed, in whole or in part, out of public funds.  We have attached a condition to such employment which involves a preference being given to those who, according to a certain method of determination laid down, are most in need of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it comes to.  As a rough-and-ready method of determining as between one person and <Col N="2058" /> another who is in greater need of employment, we pick out, first, the persons getting unemployment assistance as against the persons who are not, and from these persons we pick those who are entitled to most unemployment assistance.  The idea behind that is not to save money voted for the purpose of unemployment assistance. It is to give effect to a general principle, which is that when the State provides money to finance relief works in any area, and the total amount of work available is not sufficient to absorb all the unemployed in that area, in picking those who are to be employed, preference is to be given to those who are in most urgent need of employment, having regard to their personal circumstances.  I agree that the operation of that rule has in many cases prevented persons who were not holders of qualification certificates, that is, persons having means in excess of the limits prescribed in the Unemployment Assistance Act, from getting work on such schemes; but, of course, they are not debarred from getting work of any other kind that may be available, including county council work, when such is not assisted out of State funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position at the moment that the British ex-serviceman in receipt of a pension which does not qualify him for a certificate, but whose pension may be hopelessly inadequate so far as supporting his wife and dependents is concerned, is under a double handicap? He is not entitled to unemployment assistance, and, so long as there is a single person who is drawing unemployment assistance available at the office, he cannot get work upon State-aided schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not entitled to unemployment assistance because he has means in excess of the limits laid down by the Act.  It is not because he is getting a pension.  The only reason I am dealing with this is because the manner in which it has been referred to suggests that in some way we have discriminated against British ex-servicemen. That is not correct.  In so far as they do not get unemployment <Col N="2059" /> assistance, it is because they have means, to wit, a pension, which is in excess of the limits laid down in the Act.  They would be similarly debarred if the amount of money they got was derived from any other source, including a pension under our own Military Service (Pensions) Acts, or revenue from a farm, shop, house or boat. Because they are not entitled to unemployment assistance, they do not get work upon State-relieved schemes when persons receiving unemployment assistance are available, but it does happen, although, I agree, not very often, that in particular areas the amount of labour required for some particular relief scheme is sufficient to absorb all the unemployed in the district. In the majority of cases, however, I agree that the institution of the rotational method of employment has generally resulted in only unemployment assistance applicants getting employment.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks of relief schemes, but previously he spoke about road work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment headquarters have nothing whatever to do with employment given by a private employer.  In any event, no such instruction was issued, nor has the Department of Industry and Commerce anything whatever to do with the employment given by a private employer.  A private employer can employ whom he likes, without reference to the Department, although we invite them to recruit their labour from employment exchanges.  Even in that case, they can ask for a specified person, or for a person with specified qualifications, and it is not at all unusual for an employer to specify members of a particular trade union, or something of that kind, which limits the selection the exchange might make for him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish talked about the large saving and the fact that the total of the amount estimated to be spent in this year is less than the total which appeared in the Book of Estimates for last year.  The Deputy, however, will remember the £300,000 Deputy Norton spoke about.  In fact, the Book of Estimates, if it had been prepared later, would have shown last year a figure of £1,300,000 which would have to be compared with a figure of £1,500,000 in this year's Estimate.  In any event, the cost of unemployment assistance, that is, the cost of assistance, plus the cost of administration, has worked out somewhat higher than we anticipated when the scheme was being prepared, mainly on account of the large number of land holders who qualified, and, on that account, I do not think there is much prospect of the amount demanded from local authorities being reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saving which was estimated last year was expected to come from two sources&mdash;firstly, the employment period Orders, and secondly, and mainly, from the operation of the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act; but the Act did not become law until late in the year, and did not come into operation until some time after that, <Col N="2061" /> so that the saving expected did not materialise.  In fact, the amount expended on unemployment assistance was only a little short of the £1,600,000 originally estimated, but that £300,000 was not anticipated in consequence of any tightening up of administration or any effort to deprive people of assistance who the Act stated were entitled to it.  The administration is no tighter at present than I hope to see it always.  I hope to see the offices of the Department in every branch fulfilling their duties so as to ensure, with reasonable certainty, that everybody who gets assistance is entitled to it, and that nobody gets assistance who is not entitled to it.  These are the principal matters that were raised. Reference was made by Deputy Everett to the Court of Referees at Wicklow, and to the possibility of the Court of Referees going on circuit.  I would not like to express an opinion on that without first investigating what is involved.  So far as I am concerned, I would be personally desirous of reducing the cost and the inconvenience to applicants whose cases are coming before these courts and who consider it necessary to attend on their own behalf.  When they are summoned by the court to attend their expenses are paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a couple of points to the Minister about the position of fishermen to which I have already referred.  Would the Minister define to the House how these fishermen stand in the matter of unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the sea fishermen into three classes: (1) those who own their own boats and gear; (2) those who are shareholders in boats and gear and (3) those who have no ownership in the boats and gear. These latter are employed on the boats as members of the crew.  In respect of class 1 and class 2 the position is that they are carrying on the business of fishing and the yearly advantage which accrues to them from that business must be taken into account as &ldquo;means&rdquo; in the same way as the yearly advantage which accrues to a small farmer from the working of his land must be taken into account or the yearly advantage that the occu pant of a shop derives from it. <Col N="2063" /> They are entitled to get unemployment assistance if within the means limits, less whatever &ldquo;means&rdquo; is attributable to their business as stated in the certificate, plus 1/-.  Now I come to the other class&mdash;those employed as members of the crew of the fishing boat.  That class can be sub-divided also into those who are employed at a fixed wage irrespective of the catch of fish on the particular voyage and (2) those who are employed as members of the crew and remunerated by a share of the catch.  There is here a third class &mdash;those who form the crew and are not employed at all but are there on a joint venture.</P>
      <P>The line of demarcation between classes 2 and 3, just mentioned, is extremely difficult to draw.  The arrangements are too variable; different individuals have made different arrangements. The result is that the information given by them is very often contradicted. Under the Act those who are in the first class&mdash;those employed at a fixed wage irrespective of the catch of fish&mdash;are not unemployed within the meaning of the Act when they are engaged in fishing.  Their position constitutes no difficulty.  The position of the others is different&mdash; that is those remunerated by a fixed share of the catch.  While engaged in fishing they are not unemployed, and because they are not unemployed they are not entitled to unemployment assistance.  It may sometimes happen that when they go out fishing there is no catch of fish and in consequence the crew have nothing to share by way of remuneration.  Here again it must be remembered that there may be another occasion where there may be a very large catch of fish when their share of the proceeds may be very profitable.  It is nearly always the case that there will be some catch of fish and something to share and the crew receives rather a reasonable sum as their share of the fish caught.  I think that explains the position fairly clearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not entitled to unemployment assistance when occupied in that way because they are not unemployed nor are they available for employment and it is reasonable to assume, if on one occasion they catch no fish, that on another occasion they will have a good catch.  On the whole, during the year their remuneration works out fairly satisfactorily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown a fairly good grasp of the position.  In the case of those who work on the share system I can give him specific examples where men employed in that way in salmon fishing have spent three weeks fishing and caught nothing. These men got no benefit from that fishing and they got no unemployment assistance nor did they get home assistance either.  But their families must be kept up all the time even while these men are earning nothing. It is all very well to say that over the whole year there is remuneration but the Minister will understand the hardship that comes to them in, say, the three weeks during which they earn nothing.  I would press the Minister again that he should have a definition of these men that would get them out of this difficulty of being described as employed men earning a weekly wage when in fact they earn nothing.</P>

You have the case, for instance, where if a person gets ill he would not be deemed to be available for work.  He may however be entitled to national health <Col N="2065" /> benefit or to some other form of assistance but unemployment assistance can only be paid if the man is unemployed and he is available for work.</P>

      <P>Might I draw attention to the fact that January has been taken as the period for unemployment fluctuation for the year and that it is to this extent a hardship by reason of the fact that the amount of employment available is lowest at that period of the year.  Therefore it is the most difficult period of the year for the unemployed person to get work.  This year has been a particularly severe year.  I would like to ask the Minister why it was that in these circumstances he selected that particular period of the year to begin his push on those genuinely seeking work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Export bounties and subsidies, as the House will no doubt remember, were first paid in respect of exports of agricultural produce in the year 1932-33, as a consequence of the enactment <Col N="2067" /> of certain special duties in Great Britain.  The rates of bounty payable in respect to the various agricultural products covered by this Estimate are varied from time to time in accordance with the prevailing market conditions, the rise and fall in prices, and the alterations which take place in certain tariff enactments elsewhere.  The House will no doubt have noticed from the Volume of Estimates that the aggregate amount of £2,180,000 is set out here for the first time under appropriate sub-heads.  I should also like to say in that regard that should an undue saving occur in one of the sub-heads it will, of course, be possible, in accordance with the usual procedure, for the Minister for Finance to exercise the power of virement and to authorise the payment of an increased amount for subsidies in regard to products appearing under other sub-heads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to be able to give us information why £525,000 has been taken off the Vote for export bounties and subsidies.  He refers us to the Minister for Agriculture.  Probably the Minister for Agriculture, if he were asked, <Col N="2072" /> would tell us to go to the Minister for Finance, the man who controls the purse-strings.  We are told the Minister for Finance cannot afford it.  There appears to be a good prospect of revenue this year.  According to all accounts, revenue is coming in well. There is no reason why relief should not be given to the farmers to help them to fight the economic war, and in a small way to make good the enormous losses they have suffered.  I asked the Minister a question yesterday and, although he had sufficient time to get the information, he was not very clear in his reply.  He said that unless unforeseen circumstances arose he would not restore the bounties.  It is evident the Minister had some information when he knew he was not going to restore them, and he could give us that information if he so wished.  He might at least explain why these bounties were withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Last year the British collected £5,400,000 from the farmers by way of tariffs.  They collected over £600,000 in excess of the amount in dispute between the two Governments.  They collected nearly all the money from tariffs on agricultural produce and the principal part of it came from live stock.  We must say this much for the British Government, that for the wrong they inflicted on the farmers of this country last year they made a little restitution&mdash;they reduced the tariffs this year.  The farmers are entitled to get the benefit of that reduction.  What does our own Government do now?  They step in and save this money for the Treasury, this restitution money that the English Government was giving to the farmers here.  Our Government seize it.  Is that the proper thing to do?  The Minister told us on another occasion that the farmers were dishonest but where is the dishonesty now?  Let the Minister get up and defend his dishonesty in this case if he can.  This money is restitution that the British Government are making in respect of the tariff paid in excess last year over and above the annuities, and the British Government are exacting less this year.  I am not going into the whole wrong that was done to the general agricultural community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was dealt with on the Agricultural Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is a Vote dealing with bounties and subsidies, and I think it is the proper opportunity to raise the whole question of bounties and subsidies. Because of the excess amount of money the British Government raised, last year, on the tax on our cattle, they reduced the tax this year because they find they will be able to get enough.  To that extent the reduction in the duties amounts to legal restitution to the Irish farmers. Has the Minister any right to seize on that money?  I think not, and therefore, I think the bounties on live stock should be continued.</P>
      <P>From the figures supplied by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer it is quite plain that Britain has been collecting more than twice the amount of the annuities.  The farmers here are at least entitled to the money they paid in excess; they are entitled to the full bounties.  There is no justification, on the part of whatever Minister is responsible, in withdrawing the bounties this year.  The Minister for Finance is responsible because the only case that can be made against the payment of the bounties is that the Minister for Finance will not allow it because the Exchequer cannot afford it.  That is the excuse.  Why does the Minister not stand up to his responsibilities and defend that action of his?  The revenue prospects are reported to be brighter this year than last year.  The Minister for Finance is finding so many sources of revenue that surely there is no reason why he should corner this bit of money coming to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the live-stock trade is such that they cannot afford to have all bounties struck off.  All the relief that can be given to the farmers is necessary to enable them to carry on and pay their rates and annuities.  It will be very difficult for them to pay their rates and annuities unless they get the little bit of relief to which they are accustomed.  There is a difference of opinion as to who loses most from the withdrawal of the bounties.  The <Col N="2074" /> Minister for Agriculture last year, when it was pointed out that people raising the cattle were losing most, denied that.  He contended that the people selling the cattle, whatever they lost on the first round, would have it made up on the next.  The Minister was right to a certain extent, but, to the extent that he was right, it only means that the loss was passed on from the grazier to the man who reared the young cattle, namely, the small farmer.  If the contention of the Minister for Agriculture was correct, as I admit it was to a certain extent, then the people who raised the calves had the whole burden put upon them. That is the meaning of the Minister's contention.  When the bounty is withdrawn the loss falls upon the small farmer.  I am sure the Fianna Fáil Government never set out with the object of imposing injustice on the small farmers, but they cannot have it both ways.  They pretend to serve them, but, according to the contention of the Minister for Agriculture, they are the people bearing the whole burden in the loss of the bounties and the whole burden of the tariffs imposed by Britain.  I think that is an extra reason why these bounties should be restored.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he would give us all the information we required. I hope he will tell us, either before or after the Budget, whether he proposes to continue the payment of these bounties.  Whatever little relief can be given is very necessary and very badly needed.  There is no use pretending, on the one hand, that revenue prospects are so bright that he can make a glowing speech about the country and its prosperity, and, on the other, helping the revenue by such disreputable methods.  Let him try to be just before being generous, and let him meet this little debt which is due in every way.  The bounties paid last year amounted to £2,705,000.  This year the Minister has reduced that figure to £2,180,000.  The Minister has not given any explanation to the House as to why that reduction has taken place.  It is strange that at a time when revenue prospects are supposed to be better than they were <Col N="2075" /> last year or the year before, the Minister should cut down this relief to the farmers.  I think it is time for the Minister to give a proper explanation and to tell us when he proposes to restore this little trifle that he is cutting off now.  He is taking this money, which is restitution by the British Government because of their excess tariffs last year.  I think the Minister should tell us when he intends to restore that money.</P>

      <P>I shall come back on that later.  Taxation is easy.  Money is pouring into the Treasury.  Everything is so prosperous that it is a shame and a scandal on the part of the Minister to do anything which would restrict any bounty now being paid.  That is one side of Deputy McGovern's face. The other side is nearly as beautiful. This country is hopelessly over-taxed. What about this great Fianna Fáil Party which said it was going to reduce taxation by £2,000,000?  What about the six, eight, ten or £20,000,000 extra taxation&mdash;I do not know which amount it is&mdash;we are supposed to have imposed.  What about every tax the Deputy and his Party went into the Lobby last year to vote against?</P>

      <P>I agree, but the Deputy says that taxation is coming in easily and that nothing should be done to reduce the input of taxation which is necessary to pay these bounties. Then, he does not want it both ways. As soon as the Budget is introduced, the story will be of all the taxation and, when it comes to considering any particular item of it, every bit of that taxation will be too low.  No taxation but increased product of taxation.  No burden on the community but more bounties and more distribution.  More everything but pay nothing for it.</P>

      <P>According to me, it is. The country is so prosperous it can provide more bounties.  But what about this wail we have been hearing for the last two and a half years?  I have heard Deputies opposite say the country was never poorer in the whole history of Ireland, that there was never more distress, never more torment and never more affliction in the country.  They have put that in absolute terms, without even excluding the times of the confiscations, the times of the settlements, or the times of the famine.  They have no hesitation at all about it.  This is the worst phase in the whole of Irish history, and then Deputy McGovern comes along and says the country is so dreadfully prosperous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why should not the bounty on live cattle be reduced?  Were we not told that England is increasing in prosperity at such an enormous rate that she will be able to absorb everything and anything.  If her prosperity is of that extraordinary character, if it is growing in certain districts, as it is growing, while in certain other districts it most certainly is not growing, and if it is the contention of Deputies opposite that that connotes increased prosperity and increased trade, why should not this bounty be reduced?  I am going to give Deputy McGovern an opportunity to make another speech. I hope he will make another speech from the text: &ldquo;You cannot have it both ways,&rdquo; because I intend to remind the Opposition Party from now on to the end of the Session that they cannot have it both ways, and that when they go to the country they will not have it either way, and that the country will see to it that they do not come back here to attempt to waste the time of the House in the way that Deputy Brennan invited his whole Party to waste it to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather fortunate for this House that the Parliamentary Secretary does not speak very often. He never sheds any lustre on it and, of course, he always makes fatal mistakes.  Because I had the hardihood <Col N="2080" /> to ask the Minister for Finance what was the meaning of certain provisions in the Estimate, the Parliamentary Secretary says I invited every member of my Party to speak on this Estimate.  As a matter of fact, as far as I know, no member intended to speak on it.  That is the fact.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary will draw on his limited imagination, and it is very limited, and will endeavour to put in Deputy McGovern's mouth and into other people's mouths things they did not say.  As far as possible the Parliamentary Secretary will endeavour to make them ask things about the Estimate that they never intended to ask.  What was the insinuation behind the remarks of the Minister for Finance when introducing the Estimate?  He said that Deputies should have the book of Estimates before them, and should read it.  What did he mean?  As a matter of fact it was because I had read the Estimates that I wanted the information that the Minister informed us was given under sub-head A.  The sub-head refers to bounties and subsidies on exports of industrial products.  We are providing £75,000 for that.  I am entitled to know what those industrial products are.  As this is an agricultural country and as agricultural products have suffered very severely during the régime of the present Government, if we are paying export bounties or subsidies on these products we are entitled to know what they are.  It was the business of the Minister to tell us that.  When I asked for the information I did not ask it in any Party or carping spirit. I had no intention of speaking.  I wanted the information and the Minister could not give it.  The Minister thinks it good enough to come to the House and ask for £2,180,000 without telling us what it was all about.  As far as I could, I endeavoured to induce the House to adjourn until the Minister would be in a position to tell what it was about. The Minister would not agree to that. I had real sympathy for the Minister. He was placed in a very humiliating position to-night.  He told us that there was an alteration in the bounties and that they would be altered <Col N="2081" /> from time to time according to the prevailing market conditions.  One would imagine from all this country has gone through, owing to Govern ment policy in connection with the economic war, that what would influence the nature of the bounties and subsidies would be not the prevailing market conditions but the prevailing imposition of penalties due to Government policy.  Because Britain's prosperity is growing, is that any reason why, owing to Government policy, our people are still penalised to the extent of £4 5s. 0d. per beast, or that there should be no obligation on the Government here to make good that amount to farmers?  Are they not entitled to it if it is the result of Government policy?  Let us examine this Estimate to see how far the Minister has endeavoured to explain to the House what it is all about.</P>
      <P>Sub-head (G) refers to bounties and subsidies on the export of potatoes and other agricultural products, as well as expenditure on trial consignments to external markets.  I asked the Minister, in no Party spirit, but as one who wanted information what that was about, and he could not tell me.  What were the trial consignments to external markets on which the Government apparently burned its fingers?  Are they prepared to continue them?  Are we not entitled to that information? On whose money and by what authority were these trial consignments carried out?  Was it on our money? If so we should know all about it.  The Minister actually told the House that he does not know anything about it, yet he wants the money for this purpose. The Parliamentary Secretary says that we wanted to have it both ways.  The Government wants it every way.  They want the money without telling us what it is for.</P>

So far from being displeased with a reduction in that Estimate, I want to know if it is to be continued.  Are we still to proceed with that suicidal policy of Fianna Fáil of slaughtering <Col N="2082" /> calves, when according to the Minister for Agriculture, we are not able to supply our cattle quota to the British market&mdash;this British market that the Parliamentary Secretary never thought anything about.</P>

      <P>If it is the fact that there has been a revival of prosperity in the live-stock trade, if it is admitted that it is due to a scarcity of cattle on the other side of the Channel, and that we could dispose of much more cattle if we had them, I want to know if we are still going to continue slaughtering calves.  I have an idea that if the Minister for Agriculture was here, he would at least offer some explanation as to the continuance of that bounty.  The Minister for Finance and his curate, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot do so.  They have not given any information.  The Minister for Finance honestly told us that he knew nothing about it, but the Parliamentary Secretary got up with his usual bluff and tried to tell Deputy McGovern and other people what fools they were.</P>

We are not opposing this Estimate; we are criticising it, as we are entitled, because we want to know what it is all about.  Far from the Parliamentary Secretary being right in his statement that we were trying to get a lot of speakers against this Estimate, I do not think anybody was inclined to speak except in so far as it was necessary to get the requisite information.  The Minister said that he hoped to be able to give us some information when he replies.  I hope he will, and if he is not, I would appeal to the Minister for his own sake not to establish the precedent in this House of bringing an Estimate before the House which cannot be explained by him or anybody on his behalf.  If we cannot get the details of these amounts to-night, they must be obtainable somewhere.  There must be somebody in the Government who can give us this information.  I suggest to the Minister that, if necessary, the debate should be adjourned until we get somebody to supply the House with the information to which it is justly entitled.</P>

The mere fact that there are two Ministers responsible for the detailed administration of this Vote&mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to sub-head A, and the Minister for Agriculture in relation to all the other sub-heads&mdash;shows that my responsibility to the House is to put before the House the Vote for the aggregate sum, and to be prepared, should the administration of that Vote be questioned, or should it be alleged that the moneys have been spent otherwise than was provided for by the Estimates, to justify that course. It does not rest with me to defend or justify the industrial policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to industrial products, or the Minister for Agriculture in relation to agricultural products.  Both of these matters have been discussed on the Estimates for the Department concerned. To-day we have just finished a discussion ranging over almost two days upon the Department of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If any question were to be raised as to the sufficiency of the amount or the advisability of paying the amount provided for bounties and subsidies under sub-head A, it should have been raised on the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

I do not think that Deputy Brennan, who is so full of inquisitiveness this evening, then ventured to address a question to him.  However, the Deputy did ask me in respect to what particular industrial products were these bounties to be paid, and I promised that before the debate concluded this evening I would give him the necessary information.  May I say that he should have asked the question of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and here is the information for the Deputy for what it is worth.

      <P>There is a line somewhere&mdash;I may not have got it correctly &mdash;to the effect that &ldquo;all seems yellow to the jaundiced eye.&rdquo;  There has been some confusion with regard to these two matters of bounties and subsidies, but I hope that when next the Vote for the Minister for Agriculture is being debated here Deputy Brennan, Deputy McGovern and others will raise on that Estimate any points they may wish to make in regard to export bounties and subsidies.</P>
      <P>I was asked a question as to why it was that the provision for bounties and exports on potatoes had been reduced.  I said it was due to the rise in prices.  The price of potatoes has risen, and is higher this year than it was last year.  I grant that that does not wholly explain why it is no longer thought necessary to provide the same amount as was provided last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> There are so many inconsistencies in the arguments advanced by the Opposition that it is really very difficult to deal with them.  In the short space of 20 minutes the fact that there has been a rise in the price of potatoes has been denied almost in the same breath as it has been admitted.  Everyone knows that there has been a rise in the price of potatoes.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows also that the import duty on main crop potatoes into Great Britain has been remitted until further notice.  Maybe Deputy McGovern does not know that, but the fact remains that it has been.  Surely, after all the wail which we have heard as to the necessity for providing export bounties and subsidies, partially to compensate for the tariffs on the other side, not even Deputy McGovern can want to have it both ways.  We know why the provision for bounties and subsidies on cattle and horses is no longer considered necessary.  The House is aware that only a short time ago it approved of a new trade agreement with Great Britain which obviates the necessity for providing bounties on the same scale as before.  I feel that even by going so far into these matters I am possibly going outside the strict rules of order.  Deputy McGovern and Deputy Brennan asked why we were providing only £60,000 this year for bounties and subsidies on the export of calf skins.</P>

      <P>One shadow Minister does not want bounties.  How am I to step in and reconcile the differences between them?  The explanation as to why the provision is being reduced this year is quite a simple one.  It is that the new arrangement which the Government have made for expanding foreign trade and increasing the consumption of beef here at home is dealing with the cattle surplus in the way in which the Opposition and we have always desired it should be dealt with: that is to say, that all our calves, or at least a much greater proportion of them than last year, are going to be converted profitably into beef.  I do not know that there is any further explanation required.  I think it is a <Col N="2090" /> matter upon which we can all congratulate ourselves, that this year the cattle surplus has been reduced to manageable proportions.  Possibly, it may even cease to be at all significant, and it may very well happen that we may not have to provide this £60,000 for bounties and subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is bound to be a difference of opinion as to the best way in which public money can be utilised.  I think, so far as the agricultural population of this country are concerned, that last year they were not dissatisfied, and that, taking all the circumstances into consideration, they were prepared to approve of the policy of paying export bounties on calf-skins.  I am not going to say that they might not have preferred to export the live animal if the market were available.  But when it was clear that the market was no longer available <Col N="2091" /> on the same scale as before, then they were quite prepared to approve of the slaughter of calves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy will throw his mind back to the speeches made here in this House on the question of the cattle industry, he will find that one of the things we said was that the surplus was only a temporary one; that there was bound to come about a revival in the demand for stores; and that we tried to impress upon the agricultural community that if they were only patient for a little while the situation would right itself.  I regret to say that we did not get a great deal of assistance in regard to this matter from those who were opposed to us on other grounds.  They tried to deny the truth of what we were saying.  They were telling us that we had lost our grip on the British market; that Canadian and colonial cattle were going to come in, and that our cattle were going to be shut out for good.  In a speech of mine I remember dealing with that matter.  I pointed out the advantages which our geographical position gave us in relation to the British market, and that inevitably a time would come, if we were only prepared to hold fast, when the British farmer would be looking to us for the supply of what is virtually his raw material&mdash;our stores and our young cattle.  I think that argument was scoffed at by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>No Minister ever stated the proposition in that bald and unqualified way.  It was said that it <Col N="2092" /> had disappeared in the form in which we had known it.  The Deputy must realise, as everybody does, that the form of any market is continually changing.  It is either expanding or it is contracting.  The very tastes of the people who make the market are changing.  If the Deputy will look across at England, I think it has already been stressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to finish the point I was making.  Not merely does a market change in regard to its size, but it also changes in regard to its character.  The great market in Great Britain used to be for beef.  The public taste in Great Britain has turned from beef to mutton, and the statistics over a period of years prove that.  I am merely making that point in order to show that there was a certain justification for saying that the British market, in the form in which it used to exist, has gone.  A new market, and I believe a more valuable market, has taken its place, because again it has been demonstrated by those who are engaged in the cattle industry in Great Britain that a supply of stores and young cattle from Ireland is essential to their well being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an Estimate here for which he has certain responsibility along with the Minister for Agriculture.  If we are to take the measure of information given to the House by the last speaker, it is quite obvious that as far as he is concerned he knows nothing whatever about this Estimate.  The Estimate differs from that of last year in a great many particulars. In last year's Estimate there were three sub-heads&mdash;A, B, and C, and the Estimate was for approximately £2,750,000.  This Estimate has got seven sub-heads, and it is for a little over £2,000,000.  The Minister who has just spoken referred to a change in trade in Great Britain. The change is against this country&mdash; definitely and disastrously against this country&mdash;for the simple reason that there was a market there, until Government policy interfered with it, for the sale of fat cattle, which has diminished to a remarkable extent.  That sale of fat cattle enabled us to consume something that we grew in this country, and the consequence of losing that will be that there will be a reduction in the consumption of those cereals which it paid the farmers to grow and consume on their own land.  The Estimate gives no information whatever as to what the purpose of the Vote amounts to.  A couple of years ago, when proceedings took place in court, even the judge had to agree that there was no statutory authority or regulation in connection with the distribution of this money. That is not before us to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing of importance in connection with this Estimate, and that is that the reductions which have taken place are reductions which strike at a fundamental part of agriculture. Perhaps that is not the correct term, but in view of the length of time which the Minister has taken, the short time that is left at our disposal, and the little information we got, we cannot be too precise about <Col N="2094" /> our exact terms.  The fat cattle trade in this country was very important to agricultural economy.  It has been very seriously injured, and the Ministry was well aware years ago of the injury which was being done to that cattle trade.  A British Bill was introduced&mdash;the Cattle Bill&mdash;which provided for the payment of a bounty on cattle in Great Britain of something like 5/- a cwt.  That Bill provided for the payment of that bounty on cattle from this country or any other country which were three months in Great Britain.  It is obvious that as far as Great Britain is concerned the British Government appreciated the value of the provision of fat cattle.  Our Ministry was wrong from the commencement in connection with this business, so they overlooked and discounted the value of the fat cattle trade.  Ministers were present at Ottawa.  The Minister was present there when New Zealand got a quota.  The quota that they got enabled them to send over 400,000 cwts.  They sent 700,000 cwts. the first year and 1,000,000 the following year, or the equivalent of about 50,000 head of cattle the first year and 100,000 in the next year.  That is a matter which the Minister would do well to consider.  If he is anxious to have tillage in this country, the best possible use for the tillage is to send it out from the farm on four legs.  It is the most economical.  It will give the best employment.  It will mean no loss of money to this country, and it will be a very much surer method of disposing of our tillage produce than anything else the Minister can think of.  It will be far more productive than even his cereals mixture, and there would be less need for his Cereals Act if that policy were to be pursued.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not unaware of the fact that by reason of those tariffs against our horses in Great Britain the horse trade has been very seriously interfered with.  A number of prosecutions have taken place in Great Britain which may militate against the purchase of our horses by those whom we were accustomed to deal with.  There is now in this Estimate no provision <Col N="2095" /> for a bounty on horses.  The Minister may say that so far as the horse trade is concerned it is in exactly the same position as last year.  That would be substantially correct if we were to ignore or remove from our minds all the prosecutions that have taken place. When Governments prosecute in respect of Customs evasions, they are not too exact as to their justice in connection with those prosecutions.  I have heard of one case of a man, who, in all good faith, bought a horse here for, let us say, £<i>x.</i>  He paid duty on the £<i>x</i>, and, over in England, they pursued the horse's pilgrimage through the country and found that he was sold for a multiple of £<i>x</i>, and the dealer was called upon to pay the duty on the sale price of the horse.  It may be justified from the point of view of the British Customs, and it may be that the Revenue Commissioners here would take the same view, but the situation is very unsatisfactory, so unsatisfactory that it is quite possible that the real loss will ultimately fall upon the producers of horses in this country.</P>
    <P>That particular disadvantage falls principally on the hunter and blood-stock horse.  It is not so likely in the case of blood-stock by reason of the fact that a certificate of the sales will be taken, but, in the case of hunters, men go around the country and, in all good faith, may buy five or six horses, paying a good price for them, and they may not sell all the horses they buy. In examining the ultimate results to those engaged in horse dealing, it has the flavour of being a very profitable occupation, but one seldom sees a very big estate left behind by those engaged in it.</P>
    <P>Although the position with regard to horses may be claimed by the Minister to be the same as it was last year, the position with regard to cattle is not exactly the same.  In the first place, by reason of the policy adopted by the Government, and, secondly, by reason of the fact that the British agriculturists are now anxious to buy stores, there is a better price for cattle than there was 12 months ago.  It is <Col N="2096" /> not due to the policy of the Government except in one respect.  That is item B in this Estimate, which was a fatal policy adopted by the Government&mdash;the bounty on the export of calf-skins.  It would have been well for this country if such a policy had never been indulged in.  It is against nature; it is against common-sense, and it is against the best interests of the country.  It would have been far better for the people if they had been able to produce another 200,000 or 300,000 head of cattle and get the advanced price, or something approaching it for them, than the miserable 10/- or 12/- allowed on calf-skins.  The Minister ought to go into the question I have raised in connection with the bounty on horses. There is plenty of room, even with this Estimate, to allow for a reconsideration of the decision to take off that bounty.  To my mind, it is quite possible that the Minister will not spend much more than a moiety of the money that is provided here, and it would be well in the circumstances if the best use could be made of the money available in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. R. Holohan Mr. R. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard for me to understand what justification there was for reducing the amount of this Vote.  The giving of these bounties and subsidies was supposed, to some extent, at any rate, to relieve us of the taxation imposed upon us by the British Government.  When I look back at the unfortunate position and see that bad as the position was last year, any little help we were getting in the way of bounties and subsidies is now to be reduced by a sum of £525,000, I cannot imagine what justification there is for such a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the horse trade in this country.  I have some little knowledge of that trade, particularly in connection with hunters, and I know that by reason of the unfortunate position brought about by the Government, that trade is practically destroyed.  It is almost impossible to sell a hunter at the present time, either at home or in the fairs.  Buyers are not prepared to give anything like <Col N="2097" /> their value, because, when they get across to the other side, the animal is valued there and they do not know what the demand is going to be. We are at a very serious loss on that account and the withdrawal of the bounty in respect of horses was, to my mind, very unjust and should not have happened at all.  What is worse than that is the action taken in regard to the bounty on cattle.  Small as it was and small as was the amount of it that came to us, there was, at any rate, some of it coming to us. I never at any time said here that we were getting the full benefit of the bounty.  We were not, but we were getting portion of it and, little as it was, it was satisfactory to get it.</P>
    <P>It was very hard to follow the statement of the Minister for Finance when he was speaking here.  He mentioned that prices for cattle and other things were a little better at the moment than they were last year.  That improvement cannot be attributed in any way to this Government.  If we are getting prices a little better than last year, it is due to the demand on the British market for store cattle.  It is a great loss to us here that we cannot have the same demand on the British market for fat cattle.  In the fattening and feeding of cattle, a good deal of roots and grain must be grown, and the fattening and the housing of cattle give a good deal of employment.  Last year, very few cattle were fattened, and, to my mind, there will be fewer next year.  The reduction of these bounties and subsidies was, in my view, a shame.  The Minister for Agriculture allowed the Minister for Finance to gobble the whole lot for himself to balance his Budget at the expense of the farmers.  I do not want to speak of the economic war, but the whole thing is only patched-up work and you will never have anything going on satisfactorily here until a settlement is arrived at.  I do not intend to go any further into that because I know it is outside the Vote before the House, but the manner in which we have been treated by the Minister, in allowing the Minister for Finance to gobble up this money to try to balance his <Col N="2098" /> Budget at the expense of the farmers, is a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the killing of calves and to the bounty on calf-skins. We always stated definitely here that we were against the killing of calves and that the money spent on bounties for calf-skins could be much better used in subsidising live animals, leaving the dead animals out of it.  The Minister for Finance this evening was asked a few questions but he did not answer them.  Whether he was able to do so or not or whether he knew anything that would enable him to answer, I do not know.  Personally I came to the conclusion that he knew nothing about the matter.  I say unhesitatingly that it is a shame and a disgrace to give those bounties on calf-skins.  After a year or two the shortage of cattle will be very evident. I have little more to say except to make a protest against the reduction of this bounty on cattle.  We were entitled to get these subsidies but now the benefits that we were looking forward to have been taken away from us leaving agriculture in the deplorable position in which it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Finance has gone away, because I cannot help thinking that Deputy McGovern was right in regarding him as the villain of the piece in regard to the withdrawal of these bounties on cattle.  It is incredible that the Minister for Agriculture would have withdrawn these bounties of his own free will.  I am sure if he had a free hand he would have left these bounties there so long as the Government policy resulted in tariffs on cattle and horses to Great Britain. The rearing of horses is an absolute gold mine for this country if that industry were only given a chance. It is obvious that under present conditions it cannot succeed as it ought to do or anywhere near to the extent to which it would had not the policy of the Government interfered with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance will bring in a Supplementary Estimate to restore the bounty on horses and also on <Col N="2099" /> cattle.  The general interests of the community as well as ordinary justice demand that these bounties should be restored.  That is the main grievance we have against the Minister.</P>
    <P>We also complain of his inability to supply us with that information.  The Minister referred to the bounty on calf-skins.  He wrongly interpreted a complaint of his failure to give information as a complaint of the Government's not persisting in their calfskin policy.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister for Agriculture to use his influence with the Minister for Finance to restore the bounties on horses and cattle even if it means his following the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in adding 3d. to the income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I did not hear all the discussions on this Estimate, though strictly speaking this is a Vote belonging to the Minister for Finance.  There have been a few points that I think might be dealt with in order to give the House some information as to what reasons there may be for making changes in the bounties under certain heads.  First of all, Deputy Cosgrave made the point about New Zealand getting a quota for beef to Great Britain.  He said that we failed to get as good a bargain as New Zealand.  In order to examine that we would have to get the figures of exports from New Zealand and from this country for the past nine or ten years and find out whether there is much in that point.  At any rate our quota for fat cattle at the moment appears to be as high as we can fill. There are less fat cattle going out this month than would fill the quota.  We can export this year between 250,000 and 350,000 fat cattle.  At any rate, we have got a quota that would be sufficient to take all the fat cattle that there are.  Deputy Cosgrave made the point that, if we could export another 100,000 fat cattle to Great Britain, it would make an enormous difference to our agricultural policy.  I do not think so.  As a matter of fact, any farmer here who has any experience of putting stores into stalls to fatten will agree <Col N="2100" /> that it would be possible to fatten these cattle on 4 or 5 cwt. of oats. That is so far as cereals are concerned. There must be cake or some concentrated food as well.  On that basis, 100,000 fat cattle would only mean 20,000 acres additional of oats consumed, which is a very small matter. The fact that Great Britain for the sake of her own internal policy gave a subsidy to fat cattle is a matter with which no Government in this country could interfere.  I do not think that any Government here, however friendly they might be with Great Britain, could induce them to change that policy, a policy which is altogether directed towards benefiting their agricultural community.  Undoubtedly that policy makes stores more valuable to the exporter than fat cattle.  I do not know whether that policy is going to continue or not, but if it is to continue it is difficult to see how we can counteract it, unless we give enormous bounties to fat cattle.  These prices would have to be very high to counteract that policy on the part of Great Britain.  I heard the argument used here over and over again by farmers on the Opposition Benches that the cattle trade in this country gave a great deal of employment and had absorbed a great deal of our crops.</P>

      <P>Tá an ceart agat.  Now I come to the matter of calf-skins.  I can understand Deputies disputing the wisdom of this bounty on calf-skins but I cannot understand Deputies on the other side talking of the thing being against nature.  I never could understand that small point where the slaughtering of a calf is against nature but if a calf goes on for three weeks when it becomes veal it is not against nature at all.  I pointed out here on many occasions that a good many of <Col N="2101" /> the skins exported are taken from calves that died in the ordinary way. I got the statistics of the number of calves exported on the average for the last six or seven years and it amounted to 60,000 skins annually, so that 60,000 skins would have been exported, got from calves that died naturally or died anyway before this policy came into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That 60,000 is out of about 1,000,000 calves.  That is 6 per cent., I think.  There are also very reliable people in the cattle industry, whose advice I value very much, who say that this policy of a small bounty on calf-skins should be a permanent one, whether there was an economic war or not&mdash;that there were calves reared here which were not worth rearing, no matter what the price of cattle was, and that it would be a good thing to give a chance to the remainder of our cattle to get a better name by doing away with the rubbish.  If I had time I could turn up some speeches made by Deputy Bennett and other Deputies three or four years ago quoting the price of calves at from 1/- to 2/6 per head. As, according to these Deputies, that was the position, surely it should be taken as a benevolent act on the part of the Government to give some sort of a price for these calves and get them slaughtered.</P>
      <P>I am also rather interested in the argument about the cattle bounty, because I do not think there was a Deputy on the opposite side of the House who ever admitted that the cattle bounty went to the farmer.  I would be very interested if any of these Deputies could turn up a quotation from any member of the Fine Gael Party or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party admitting that the farmer got the bounty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we had nothing to do with it.  For the last four years I have been trying to impress on Deputies that we had nothing to do with bringing down the prices.  At last, we have got them to agree that it is the other Government which is responsible for the regulation of the prices, up and down.  I was told by Deputy MacDermot that the Minister for Finance must be the villain of the piece, as surely I would not agree <Col N="2104" /> to taking the bounty off cattle and horses.  I have said that I was anxious to take the bounty off cattle on account of the general dissatisfaction amongst farmers with the administration of the bounty.  As a proof that I could have got the Minister for Finance to continue the bounty on cattle, I want to say that I induced the Minister to increase the amount allocated for bounties on poultry and eggs this year to £600,000, although only £472,000 was spent last year; and to £750,000 on dairy products, although only £660,000 was spent last year.  Taking these two items into account, if I had said to the Minister for Finance that I was satisfied to leave the bounty on eggs and butter as it was, and that I wanted to continue the bounty on cattle, I am sure he would agree, because it would not make any difference in his finances, as it is the total he is concerned with.</P>
      <P>I was, as I say, very doubtful that the farmers appreciated this bounty on cattle.  I thought that increasing the bounty on milk products and the bounty on eggs and poultry, and keeping the bounty as it was on pigs and pig products&mdash;even though we are to export 10 per cent, more, which will absorb another £40,000&mdash;that is, to keep these three bounties as high as possible and drop the cattle bounty, would be better for the farmer.  I think he would be more satisfied because the farmer believes that he is getting the benefit of the bounty on pigs, bacon, eggs, poultry, butter and other milk products.  It is a great thing to have the farmer satisfied if we can do it&mdash;it is the most important thing of all.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy MacDermot's suggestion, that the Minister for Finance might even go so far as to increase the income-tax in order to provide this bounty, I would be very reluctant to suggest that to the Minister for fear he might already have it in his mind for other purposes, and I might not get the benefit of it at all.  I am quite satisfied that we have done better for the farmer this year than last year, when we take the tariffs and the bounties together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made some point that the farmers were worse off in the <Col N="2105" /> case of cattle.  I could not follow that point, because the tariff on two-year olds was reduced by 35/- and the bounty only amounted to £1.  Therefore, taking the tariff and even admitting the farmer got the whole £1 last year, he is now 15/- better off&mdash;that is, when you take the tariff and bounty together.  In the case of horses, generally speaking, he is about the same; as a matter of fact, in the case of some horses he is better off, because there were certain horses excluded from the bounty.  In the case of sheep he is considerably better off, because there was no bounty given last year and the tariff has been reduced by 5/- per head, going into Great Britain.  In the case of pigs and pig products, we are maintaining the bounties at the rate at which they were last year, although we exported 10 per cent. more for the first three months of this year and we expect that the 10 per cent. increased export will be maintained for the whole year.  In the case of eggs, we have already increased bounties for this financial year by 9d. per great hundred and it is possible something better may be done for poultry when the poultry season comes along&mdash;that is, if it is necessary.  The last big items are butter and milk products. There is an increased provision for these items this year and we expect to be able to maintain a higher average price this year than was got for these commodities by the farmers last year.</P>
    <P>There are other small items here which are not of any importance, generally speaking, although perhaps they may be rather important to some farmers.  For instance, as regards the bounty on rabbits which was given, not so much as a benefit to the farmers through the receipt of the bounty as to get rid of the rabbits, that has been increased to double the amount.  It was £7,000 last year and £15,000 will be provided this year. For the last few months there has been a very big increase in the exports of rabbits and rabbit skins.  If that increase could be maintained we would go a good way this year towards the elimination of that pest in the districts where it is bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be right. We considered, at any rate, when putting on that bounty, that it would be a means of lessening the number of rabbits in the country and it would make it worth the while of trappers to go out again.  It was suggested that we ought to encourage county committees to import a certain apparatus for poisoning them.  We have not any experience of the working of those machines yet, and I do not know what the result may be, but I am quite willing to advocate the spending of a certain amount of money towards the elimination of rabbits, if any good proposition is put up for that purpose. Another rather small item, so far as cash is concerned, is the bounty on potatoes&mdash;£20,000.  It remains the same as last year.  Then there is the bounty in regard to fishery products&mdash;£5,000. Deputies mentioned that there was certain information they were looking for and did not get.</P>

In view of the statement just made by Deputy MacDermot, the Minister will realise the disadvantage we were at.  Fortunately, the Minister for Agriculture has been able to explain certain things.  With regard to sub-head <Col N="2107" /> A, the Minister for Finance did give us some information, although it was belated.  He read it out of some publication that the bounties and subsidies were being paid on certain industrial products and he mentioned linen.  I am informed that there has been a drop in the bounty on linen, which is considered by people in the industry as very injurious.  The Minister for Finance, in his usual fashion, could not give us any information about it. Can the Minister for Agriculture explain it?  It is probably a job for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am informed that the decrease of £25,000 is due to the dropping of the bounty on linen, and that is injurious to the business.</P>
