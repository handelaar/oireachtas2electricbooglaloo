      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  It is made clear to temporary clerks on engagement that the appointment is purely temporary and terminable on the expiration of one week's notice and that it carries no right to gratuity or allowance on its termination.  Every effort will be made by the employment exchanges, in the normal course of their duties, to place the discharged clerks in alternative employment, including any <Col N="316" /> employment that may arise in Government Departments.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any doubt exists as to the position of the defined mouth of the river in question. In compliance with local requests, a special examination of the place was made in 1933 by an inspector who reported that, while the old channel of the river had changed, the alteration had occurred at a point outside the defined mouth which was therefore not in any way affected by it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMichaelBurke" hpid="Mr. J.M. Burke Mr. J.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment which has been proposed by Deputies Davin and Keyes. I think that it is one which ought to commend itself to the majority of this House and one that will be endorsed by the whole electorate.  Let me say a few words on behalf of the pint of porter, which is the poor man's beverage. It is indeed, much more than a beverage or stimulant; it is, in fact, a food.  As they say in my backward part of the country, there is &ldquo;atin' and drinkin' in it.&rdquo;  I heard a very distinguished physician say that porter was a real Godsend to the farmers and workers and that it saved many of <Col N="318" /> them from an early grave because, even if they over-indulged in it occasionally, it made no great difference because they get a remedy in the morning air and they worked off not only the alcohol but a lot of other waste products which, otherwise, they would not have got rid of.</P>
      <P>In support of the amendment, I shall, with your permission, A Chinn Comhairle, appeal not only to Irish history but to the Irish song-writers. I shall appeal also to several modern authorities on literature.  It is a well-known fact, which cannot be controverted, that the ancient Celts and Gaels were the real discoverers of brewing.  As you know, in ancient Ireland the cuirm-thigh or ale-house, was a most important institution in the country and I need not say that the bean na leanna has become proverbial. As a matter of fact, in ancient Ireland the only people who were entitled to brew beer were the flaitha.  The flaith was, more or less, a prince or peer and a good prince or a good peer, as he may be called, if a decent sort of fellow, always distributed his brew on Sundavs and festivals to his friends or followers. Hence, as the Ceann Comhairle knows very well, the word &ldquo;flaitheamhail&rdquo; has come to mean &ldquo;generous.&rdquo;  In connection with that, I recall an epigram uttered here in Dublin many years ago by a very clever man.  He said, &ldquo;In ancient Ireland only peers were brewers and, in modern Ireland, only brewers are peers.&rdquo;  I do not wish to detain the House very long, but I want to appeal to some of our song-writers in support of the amendment.  One song-writer says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is little for glory I care;</P>
      <P>Ambition is only a fable.</P>
      <P>I'd as soon be meself as Lord May'r</P>
      <P>While there are lashings of stout on the table.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another writer sings in this fashion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Irish stout I have no doubt</P>
      <P>In either wood or bottle,</P>
      <P>And well brewed ale will never fail</P>
      <P>To cool a thirsty throttle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope these words will appeal to <Col N="319" /> the Minister for Finance.  I know he is a very temperate man, but he realises, I am sure, that the moderate use of alcohol is quite legitimate.  If necessary, I can quote authority from the Bible on that point.  I can also appeal to modern writers.  A famous English poet has said that &ldquo;Nothing can equal the welcome of an inn.&rdquo; Dr. Johnson says that &ldquo;a tavern chair is the throne of human felicity.&rdquo;  The late Gilbert Chesterton, who was such a great ornament to literature and whose death we all regret, says truly that &ldquo;the most democratic institution in the world is the common public house.&rdquo;  He goes on to say that every man who conducts himself there and can pay for his drink is as good as another.  It would be a very good thing, he says, if statesmen would occasionally drop in there and hear the comments of the man-in-the-street on their policy, their politics and their tricks.</P>
    <P>In view of these circumstances, I do hope that this amendment will be accepted by the Minister and the House.  The Minister knows, as we all know, that the price of stout or porter &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; is oppressive.  A large number of people have to consume it.  I appeal in this regard to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, who cannot deny that some of the hardest worked men in Cork &mdash; the coal heavers, who are engaged in a gruelling type of work &mdash;have to depend for maintenance of their vigour and health during the day on bread and porter.  That is well known to the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am sure he will endorse what I have said, at least, on that point.  I reiterate that I hope this amendment will be accepted by the Minister and embodied in the Finance Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be important in a discussion on this amendment that the House would hear from the Minister something of the policy of milk and light beer about which the President made an important pronouncement in 1932.  At that time he emphasised how valuable it <Col N="320" /> would be for the general well-being and health of the people of the country if light beer and milk could be substituted for tea as the more or less standard beverage of the people.  The Minister for Finance must be aware that since 1932 the average price for the cheapest tea has gone up by 10¼d per lb.  The Department of Industry and Commerce published the figures for three months and these figures show that between mid-February, 1932 and mid-February, 1936, the average price per lb. of the cheapest tea has gone up by 10¼d.  That is important from the point of view of the ordinary economy.  I would like to ask the Minister if in the Army or in any section of the Gárda an attempt has been made by the Government to carry out in any sort of a planned way the substitution of light beer or milk for tea and whether they have any particulars to put before the House as to whether the substitution of milk is more costly the substitution of beer, and what results if any, or what enquiries if any have been made by the Government with a view to developing and promoting the policy announced by the President of substituting tea by light beer and milk.  The Minister, I am sure, will appreciate that at the present time there is hardly any prospect of any great development of that substitution although tea has increased by what must be an enormous figure in the eyes of the ordinary housekeeper who has to run a house for the average family.  Therefore I think it would be well while on this question that we would hear from the Minister for Finance what he has to say of the policy of substituting light beer for tea as a beverage in the homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  Since 1932 this amendment or a similar amendment has been before the House in some form on the Finance Bill every year. The amendment has always been met with the excuse that the exigencies of the Exchequer could not bear the cost involved.  I do not think that is a good defence in itself.  It is only at the best a justification for the maintenance of that tax and that tax is too high.  I think that in the debate <Col N="321" /> last week the Minister told us that the cost-of-living figure, taking 1914 at 100, was now about 150 and that it had fallen from a higher level to that figure.  Let us take 1914 as related to this amendment.  I am sure the House would be interested in learning that the cost of porter to-day as compared with 1914 has gone up by 1,190 per cent., at least the duty has gone up by 1,190 per cent.  Assume that beer was essential for various classes of the community, particularly people working in the docks, people working in factories or people working in steel works and other such employment where the labour is very heavy and arduous and such as to demand that the people working would require some liquid refreshment during the day. Very often these men take with them to their work in the morning a piece of sandwich or a piece of bread, butter and jam.  With this they get one pint of porter for their lunch.  Is it fair that men in such circumstances are to be taxed at this high rate simply because of the exigencies of the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no other tax that was imposed during the Great War except this and the corporations profit tax that is in existence to-day.  We should be told why, under these circumstances, this tax is being maintained. I know, of course, that when I say something in favour of the remission of this tax, a lot of pious resolutions will be passed and my name will be involved in them.  But these resolutions have no terror for me.  I am just as big a teetotaler as the ladies and gentlemen who pass these resolutions. The acceptance of this amendment would be an act of justice, first, to the licensing trade and, secondly, to the people in the main who consume the least in the matter of food.  These people are crying out against this very high tax.  Surely an increase of 1,190 per cent. over 1914 is a heavy burden to bear.  I wonder if anybody in this House or outside this House will defend the justice of that tax with this increase of 1,190 per cent.  I would like to know how the increase in the wages of these working people compares with this increase of <Col N="322" /> 1,190 per cent. in an important article of their food?  Not only is there this enormous increase here but there is an increase in all other items above the 1914 figure.  Is it because we have an extreme right wing in this matter and an extreme left wing that we are to have this high increase in the price of the working man's drink?  I know of no greater curse than these two extremes, the left wing and the right wing, in the matter of teetotalism. Both are so blind that they are unable to see that the happy medium lies between.  On the one side you have got the rabid teetotalers, who are all fanatics.  They do not themselves drink.  If you sat at dinner with them you would find that their liquid refreshment would be either water or buttermilk.  They are so fanatical in their teetotalism that they forget that the happy medium lies between.  The main mass of the people do not belong to one wing or the other.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, people will drink.  The only thing to do is to endeavour to see that they will not drink too much, and it is for this House to see that the drink is sold at a price which will prevent them from drinking too much, while at the same time ensuring that those who need it will still be able to get it.  In other years in this debate I quoted examples from America.  I am not going to go over these now because the example of America on the question of drink is sticking out as a sign to anybody who wishes to read it.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to say that I read in the paper on Tuesday night the report of a case in the Dublin Police Court.  I would like to direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to that case.  A woman who attended a meeting down the country on Sunday week last was given, on her way home or before she arrived at her home, &ldquo;Biddy&rdquo; or red wine.  Having drank it she proceeded home and kicked up a row with her husband.  In the morning following she left her husband and children; it appears some other woman was alleged to have got their meals for them during the day.  When the wife came back in the evening, having partaken of this <Col N="323" /> bottle of &ldquo;Red Biddy&rdquo; or a portion of it she kicked up a row.  The affair finished in the police court on Tuesday. At all events this bottle of &ldquo;Red Biddy&rdquo; started this case.  What was behind that?  This is some sort of red wine.  It appears that it is stuff manufactured from some ingredients and then highly fortified.  What the ingredients are I do not know, but it appears that it can be sold at a cheap price.  It is fortified by something that is highly injurious to the people who drink any considerable quantity of it.  I would like to know if any attention has been paid by the Government to that side of the drink problem? Has there been an increase of 1,190 per cent. tax on these ingredients? I would support the Minister in increasing the tax on that stuff to 1,190 per cent.  Recently I have been making inquiries here in the city about this &ldquo;Red Biddy,&rdquo; and I am not quite sure that I have got any definite data as to the volume of business done in it.  I made some inquiries in Belfast. The thing is so glaring in Belfast that the facts are well known.  I understand that in parts of Belfast this stuff is consumed by the poorer classes, especially the women folk among the poorer classes, and the results there are dreadful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy relate that to the amendment which purports to reduce the duty on beer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to relate it.  The Minister should increase the tax on this material and reduce the tax on legitimate and sound material that would do the people no harm.  That is the case and it is quite simple.  The result of this taxation is that it is driving the people to take this other stuff.  What the constituents of this stuff are I do not know, but it is being permitted to be made and sold and drunk with great injury to our people.  I am not prepared to say what is the extent of the evil that it is doing in this city, but I am informed that in Belfast the results are very degrading. The only case of it I have seen in the courts here is the case I referred to which was in the courts on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> Apparently, somewhere between where the procession took place and this woman's house, when she was going home in the evening some person handed her a bottle of this stuff.  I take it it was somebody who took advantage of this occasion, when a large crowd of people had assembled on a Sunday, to distribute it, at what price I do not know.  I take it the price was not exorbitant and, apparently, a ready-made market was got for this cheap article.  I repeat that, while I do not in any way favour indulgence in strong drink, the people have a right to it and that they will get it in some form or another.  I want to see them getting it in a form which the State can control and under which the State can guarantee that the people who consume it are getting a sound article which will not be injurious, if taken in moderation.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that the proposed amendments &mdash;I presume that both amendments are being discussed together&mdash;would have considerable sympathy not merely from those quarters of the House from which they have been urged, but possibly from every quarter and every Party. Indeed, if it were merely a question of sympathy, the amendments would have a much better chance than they have to-day.  But these amendments do two things: they not merely, in effect, propose that the duty on a certain commodity should be reduced, but they would also, if carried, impose upon me the heavy obligation of increasing the tax upon some other commodity in order to make good the deficiency which would be inevitably created in the Exchequer revenues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though we have heard a great deal here about the beneficial effects of the beverages referred to, we have not been told about any of the detrimental effects which might follow if ordinary articles of food, like tea and sugar, were made dearer for the general mass of the people.  Of course, there have been pathetic stories told about the hefty dock labourer who must have his pint or two.  I am not without sympathy with the amendment, I am not a dyed-in-the-wool teetotaler by any <Col N="325" /> means; but I have to consider as to whether, in fact, even if the Exchequer position permitted it and we were to accept these amendments, there would be anything like the general increase in consumption of beer, stout, and porter which those who have advocated these proposals tell us would more than make up for any loss of revenue that might otherwise be expected to ensue.  If you reduce the price of the pint by 1d., and the ordinary workers' wages were to remain at their present standard, I question whether he would be able to buy at the very most more than one or two pints extra per week.</P>
    <P>We have been told here that, if we granted a remission, there is no fear that there would be any increase in drunkenness; that the tastes of the people have changed.  I listened last night to a speech by Deputy Morrissey in support of this proposal.  It seems to me that it is more calculated to secure its defeat than anything else, because he told us that at a time when we might have expected people to increase greatly their consumption of beer and stout, if it were cheaper, the workingman had no place to spend his leisure hours except in a publichouse; that he had not a decent home.  I am not going to say that every working-class family in this State is housed as we should like it to be housed, but at any rate the housing conditions have been very considerably improved.  The Deputy went on to say that at that time there were no cinemas and no cheap transport and nothing like the same provision for the entertainment and amusement of the people that exist to-day.</P>

      <P>I was saying that at that time there were not all the other inducements for the worker or for any other person, because I do not want to be taken as implying for a moment that the change for the better in the habits of the community that has taken place applies to any one class of society.  What I have said in regard to the worker applies also in regard to those who might be much better circumstanced.  There are many other ways of spending spare money now, if one is not inclined to save it, than there were in the days when the consumption of beer and stout was much higher than it is to-day. These other ways all make a demand upon the spare cash of the worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to believe for a moment that if we were to grant the reduction which is asked for here that there would be anything like a commensurate increase in the consumption of beer and spirits.  I have examined this problem very carefully and I am satisfied that if we were to accept the first amendment it would cost the State at least £250,000 this year, and £500,000 in the following year.  The problem that the House has to address itself to is this: whether is it better to find that £500,000 as we are finding it to-day out of the beer and spirits duty or that we should go and put another ½d. or ¾d. per lb. on sugar.  It is all very well to talk, as I have said, about the poor workingman and of every other person who consumes beer and spirits, and to say that he finds the price of his favourite beverage a bit high.  But it is much better, I think, that it should be kept high rather than that we should have to come along and increase the cost of food to his wife and family, because really that is the second part of this amendment though it is not put down in black and white on the Order Paper.  That is what the House would have to vote for: for a reduction, if you like, in the duty on beer and spirits, or for an increase in the duty on tea or sugar.  With that <Col N="327" /> proposition before me, I can only ask the House to reject both amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that amendments Nos. 22 and 23 could be discussed together.  I do not know that there is very much to hope for so far as these amendments are concerned, in view of the attitude of the Minister and the Government towards the amendment which has just been voted upon.  I think it is only right that these amendments should be put before the House and that we should point out that the duty upon spirits in this country has been increased by nearly 500 per cent.  There is, I think, a good case to be made for a reduction of that enormous increase.  This matter has been brought up before, not only in this House, but also in the British House of Commons.  It has been brought up there year after year, just as it has been brought before the Dáil. In 1934 the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Chamberlain, admitted that the duty on whiskey was too high. He said that that duty had been imposed at a time when the source of their indirect taxation was very much more limited.  Of course, that could be said with much greater truth so <Col N="330" /> far as this country is concerned.  Mr. Chamberlain also said that if they were imposing duty in 1934 they would not impose anything as great as the duty that spirits are called upon to bear at the present moment.</P>
      <P>A good case can be made in connection with Irish barley.  So far as I know, all the spirits distilled in this country are distilled from Irish barley; all the distillers here use Irish barley exclusively.  I think at one time the Irish distillers were able to use about one-third of our total barley production. What they use to-day is a very small percentage of the total crop.  I do not know whether it is much good delaying the time of the House on these amendments.  The Minister's attitude towards the last amendment was that he was not in a position to grant the reduction asked for and that he saw no hope of the present Government ever being in a position to grant any reduction in the case of beer or spirits.  The Minister, I take it, will give on these amendments reasons somewhat similar to those he gave for refusing to accept the last amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister asks the House where the money is to be got otherwise.  He asked the House to assume that there would be a loss to the Revenue in a full year of £500,000.  The Minister seems to consider there would not be any increased consumption as a result of the reduction and he said that he cannot see where else the money can be got.  The Minister and the Government have shown themselves to be very resourceful in the last three or four years for the purpose of getting revenue.  They have shown that they have been able to discover sources to tax that were never thought of by any previous Administration.  The Minister was resourceful enough, in any case, to put himself and his Government in the position that they were squeezing something in the neighbourhood of £10,000,000 a year over and above the amount extracted from the taxpayers by their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure if the Minister has the will to accept this amendment and grant this reduction it will not be beyond his powers to get alternative sources of revenue, alternative sources that will not affect the cost of living <Col N="331" /> of the poor.  Although the Government have succeeded in extracting about £10,000,000 over and above what was looked upon as normal taxation five or six years ago, they still maintain there has been no increase in the cost of living.  If the Minister can succeed in getting additional taxation to the amount of £10,000,000 without increasing the cost of living, then I think we can safely leave it to him to get £500,000 without further increasing the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have supported a similar amendment on a previous Finance Bill and I desire to support this amendment this year also.  Deputy Morrissey was quite modest when he said that if the Minister had the will he could find the money.  I am not concerned with whether the Minister has the will or not.  I do know that the duty devolves on him to remove this tax.  Those of us who remember the imposition of the tax will recall that it was imposed purely for the purpose of financing the European War; that is the only reason why it was imposed.  That reason has disappeared. It certainly has disappeared in our case.  We are not responsible for one penny of the cost of the European War, and <Col N="332" /> hence there is no justification for the maintenance of this tax as it at present stands.  To say that the money cannot be found is no answer.  No matter what tax is imposed, no matter to what height it is raised in a national emergency for the defence of the State and its citizens, each succeeding Minister who comes before this House ever afterwards can say: &ldquo;I cannot reduce the tax.  If I did, I would have to impose a tax on something else.&rdquo;  That technique is far too detailed for me; it is far too neat.  I would ask every Deputy in this House to vote against this tax, because it would be quite easy in the future to raise a national emergency in order to make an excuse to tax some body of citizens, and having got it imposed by way of an emergency then defend it by saying: &ldquo;I cannot reduce it.  If I did, I would have to increase the cost of living of the poor.&rdquo;  What is done is this: the Ministers get hold of those devices for imposing taxes, and then retain them, the money being wasted.  There is no such thing as retrenchment, or putting taxation back on an equitable basis. There is no defence for this particular tax, which was imposed as a war tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying at all that spirits and liquors should flow through the streets.  That would be as abnormal as the amount of this tax, but there are many very poor middle-class people who often require spirits for their children in case of sickness, and owing to the cost they cannot get it. What is the cost?  If you want a bottle of whiskey, gin or rum, to have in the house in case of sickness, you put down £1 and get a few shillings change, but for practical purposes the £1 is gone.  Take the middle-class family, living on the margin line, and having to bear heavy taxation&mdash;they are the people really hit&mdash;are they to have no consideration given to them? Having bought their houses, in discharge of their duties as good citizens, in order to have a permanent home on the soil of this country, thereby showing their thrift and their economy, their houses are now taxed at five-fourths.  Everything else is taxed in proportion, and on top of that there is this duty.  Remember that is the class of people in this community <Col N="333" /> to-day who are really ground down.  They have only small marginal incomes, which are being swept away in taxes and rates.  This tax was an emergency measure imposed for the purpose of fighting the European War, and there is no defence for maintaining it at this figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMichaelBurke" hpid="Mr. J.M. Burke Mr. J.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I just want to say a few words in support of this amendment.  On the last amendment I referred to Irish history and to Irish poetry, fruitlessly. I am going to do the same now with, I am sure, the same result. It is well known that at one time our ancestors had the monopoly of distilling, and I need not remind scholars of Irish history that the word &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; is a corruption of the Gaelic &ldquo;uisge beatha,&rdquo; which means water of life.  During all the centuries the people have been accustomed to &ldquo;a drop of the erathur,&rdquo; as it is called, and they have enjoyed it thoroughly.  Now the price has become so appalling that only the sick person can afford to buy it, and even then he can only get it in dribs and drabs.  Our great national poet, Tom Moore&mdash;I am glad to see that modern scholars and writers are beginning to realise that he was really a national poet&mdash;said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fill the bumper fair!</P>
      <P>Every drop we sprinkle</P>
      <P>O'er the brow of care</P>
      <P>Smoothes away a wrinkle!&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I commend this very seriously to the Minister for Finance.  Another Irish poet said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whiskey, drink divine!</P>
      <P>Why should drivellers bore us</P>
      <P>With the love of wine,</P>
      <P>When we've got thee before us!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister, who is conversant with Irish history, with Irish lays, lyrics and legends, will remember all about the &ldquo;Cruiskeen Lan&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Little Brown Jig&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Jug of Punch,&rdquo; and bear those things in mind.  Being, as I am sure he is, a patriot, I hope he will do something to relieve the burden which is at present being laid on the consumers of whiskey.  Everybody knows that in recent years the country has <Col N="334" /> become extremely temperate.  A famous Bishop said to me long ago &ldquo;Father Mathew was a great man and a wonderful man, and he did a great deal of good in the country, but Lloyd George did more than Father Mathew ever did by putting this tax on beer, wines and spirits.&rdquo;  However, as the people have become very abstemious, in my humble opinion there is no necessity at the present time for the continuation of the existing taxes, and I am sure that the Minister for Finance, with all the ways and means at his disposal and with his financial craftsmanship, will be able to relieve the public of at least a share of the burden in respect of distillation in this country.  I think, as Deputy Morrissey said, that he can do so without inflicting any terrible harm on the State and without in any way increasing intemperance in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister has refused to give Deputies a free choice as to their manner of voting, but even though they were compelled to vote with the Minister it would be interesting and perhaps useful to the House to have the views of various Deputies for and against those particular proposals.  There is no use in elaborating very much further the arguments made in regard to the beer duty.  They apply equally to Deputy Morrissey's proposal on the spirit duty. Perhaps we cannot make the same argument about whiskey and brandy being a necessity for the poor man as much as stout, but if whiskey or brandy is not the poor man's beverage it is very often the poor man's medicine. It is prescribed very largely by doctors, particularly in the winter months, in epidemics of influenza, and in other cases.  We all know that very many doctors prescribe whiskey or spirits as a medicine for poor people who find it extremely difficult to purchase it.  When you come to think that a glass of whiskey costs, I think, 1/8 retail, it must be realised that, when <Col N="335" /> a poor person is ordered that as a medicine, it is an extremely difficult matter to purchase it.</P>
      <P>Wine and spirits have been used, I suppose, in all times.  There is even a Biblical reference which says that we must drink wine for our infirmities, and not water.  I think that, in those days, it was considered good for people and good for certain infirmities.  I believe that some reduction in this particular duty is necessary if ever the poor man is going to taste the liquid again. However, there is a further fact to be considered, and that is that people who want spirits, and who cannot get legitimate spirits at a fair price, will resort to every subterfuge to get other kinds of spirits.  They will resort to poteen.  That, I understand, is what some people have been driven to drinking as a result of the high duties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;as Deputy Burke says, methylated spirits.  Now, I am sure that we all hope that a stop will be put to the manufacture of these illicit spirits, and I feel sure also that a great deal of the trouble that has existed in this country as a result of drunkenness is due to the manufacture of these illicit spirits.  I also believe, however, that we are never going to end that trouble so long as this high duty remains on the manufacture of legal spirits.  So long as that high duty remains, I believe there will be a great incentive to break the law.  So long as legitimately produced brandies and whiskies are at such a prohibitive price there will always be that inducement to break the law.  I think Deputy Burke referred to the old saying to the effect that, if you cannot have punch, you will have something else.  It is a fact, undoubtedly, that a lot of the old people used to drink punch.  Possibly, the Minister knows the joke of the old saying, but it is as true now as it was on the day the saying was first made, and I think that, perhaps, a reference by the Minister to the list of vices that were punished would bear me out on that.  It was not drinking people, in the old days, if they did drink too much, who committed most <Col N="336" /> of the other vices that nature makes us all fall into, occasionally, one way or the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in the same direction as the Minister.  However, I did not really intend to make very much of a further appeal to the Minister, but I do say that a tax imposed as a war measure at a very high figure ought now to be reduced.  As I have said already, war taxes have been reduced in most other countries, and even in England they have arrived at the point where they felt that they could safely reduce the duties on spirits and beer.  I dare say, therefore, that we also have come to that point, or at least that we ought to have come to the point where we could do something of the same kind.  When the Minister said that the proposed reduction would cost something like £500,000 in the next year, I do not know if he had made any allowance for an increased consumption.  I think that the Minister said that there would be no increased consumption.  If that is so, the argument of those people, who are opposed to this proposed reduction on the ground that it would lead to an increased consumption of drink and possible drunkenness, falls to the ground.  I think that the same argument would apply in the case of whiskey and spirits generally.  I do not believe that the small reduction in whiskey or spirit taxes, generally, that is proposed here, would lead to any great extra consumption of spirits, but I do believe that it would certainly help poor people, who needed spirits for medicinal purposes, to have whiskey or brandy, and there are innumerable cases, as any doctor in the House can testify, where whiskey or brandy is a necessity medicinally. The House, I think, has made up its mind on this particular matter of the reduction of the duties on whiskey and spirits generally, and I wish we could influence the Minister to take the broad view on this matter.  However, as that does not seem possible, I do not propose to say anything more on the matter.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputies who have spoken already on this amendment do not seem to be quite clear in their own minds on the difficulties that exist in connection with this matter.  I think I ought to make an exception, in this connection, in the case of Deputy McMenamin, who said that in the course of what he called this technique, a Minister for Finance could easily take the course of putting it up to the House that, if concessions of this sort were advocated, he could not reduce the tax because there would be no means of knowing what alternative tax would be imposed in order to make up for the deficiency in the Exchequer revenue.  He asked us to ignore that.  I am simply asking the House to imagine itself in the position of an ostrich whose political technique Deputy McMenamin seems to have adopted of burying its head in the sand.  We have no option.  We may as well make up our minds to that.  If we are to reduce the duties on wines and spirits, then we must increase the duties on other commodities.</P>

I do not know whether Deputy Mulcahy himself would be prepared to say that we ought to grant a concession which would cost us £385,000 and make up for that deficiency by cutting the old age pensions.  One way, perhaps, which might appeal to the Deputy, would be to wipe out the provision made for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

I think even the Deputy will have to admit that in the compilation every penny piece of the £7,000,000 was dealt with in the debate which took place on the other sections.  He is now concerned when he comes to the House to get facts to back up statements he made.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  The Minister stated that it was difficult to find money.  That may be true.  The Minister seemed to emphasise the fact that the granting of the concession would mean a loss of revenue approaching £385,000 in a full year, and he asked the Opposition what means were to be adopted to provide that money.  I wish to put this question to him: What amount of extra taxation has been placed upon the shoulders of the people to set up new industries of a very doubtful character, as against industries that <Col N="339" /> were already established here for years, and that wanted no props from this or any other Government, but simply wanted to get a fair chance to live?  I wish to put this aspect of the situation to the Minister, that he has imposed millions of extra taxation upon all sections of the people, including the very poor, to set up new industries.  The fact remains that many of them are being set up at the expense of the general public.  Here is an old industry and it gave a very large amount of employment, notwithstanding the views expressed by some people that it does not give much employment in comparison with the output. I wish to remind these people that this industry has been the means of increasing the National Exchequer by several millions yearly, and that the real advantage of it is not gauged by the amount of wages paid annually. It must be gauged by the amount paid into the National Exchequer, out of which comes money for old age pensions, provision for relief schemes, as well as other means of providing employment.  In addition, the raw material used in this industry is mainly Irish, which cannot be said of many of the other industries that have been set up.  I refer to barley.  Everyone knows that if the present tillage policy is to be made a success, barley is one of the most important crops that could be grown by farmers, as it is peculiarly adaptable to the soil of this country. For that reason alone, seeing that it <Col N="340" /> gives employment to the farming element, the Minister and the Government are entitled to give some remission of the amount of excise duty paid on whiskey.  It is well known that the use of whiskey is advocated by the medical profession.  While I am not in favour of increasing the sale of alcoholic drinks, nevertheless, my answer to certain people is that many of the crimes committed here are committed by people whose boast it is that they never took a glass of whiskey in their lives.  I am one of those who believe that it is very bad policy to kill an old industry that is in existence, unless we are prepared to set up another one in its place.  For that reason, I am prepared to support the amendment, as I think the time has arrived when there should be a reduction in the enormous burden that this industry has carried since the days of the Great War.  Whiskey now costs 10½d. a half-glass against 2d. in pre-war days, while the price now paid for barley is no greater than the price paid in pre-war days.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs.  It is the duty of the Government to do something for this old-established industry which, in the opinion of many people, is giving very much needed employment, and would give more in future if it only got half a chance or half the facilities that other industries are getting, for which, to use the Minister's own words, millions of extra taxation had to be imposed.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 23 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935), shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of Section 16.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section of the Finance Act of 1935 which this amendment proposes to delete is Section 16.  It operated to put a duty of 75 per cent.  On cutlery.  There is in fact a duty of 100 per cent. on cutlery and the only information we have had is that in spite of a duty of 75 per cent.&mdash;in effect a duty of 100 per cent.&mdash;the imports of cutlery, so far as value is concerned, have not been affected at all.  The total value of cutlery imported in 1932 was £27,000; in 1933, £38,000, and in 1934, £46,896.  We find that in 1935 the total value of cutlery imported was £46,350 or substantially the same as was imported in 1934 before this very substantial tariff was imposed.  I should like to find out from the Minister what the explanation of that is.  We should like to get some information as to what is happening in the cutlery industry here and to what extent the tariff is being used to raise money for purely revenue purposes.  This is just one sample of these very heavy tariffs. There is another duty, as well as this particular tariff, which raises the total duty well above 75 per cent.  As I say this is but one sample of the effect of very high tariffs.  Cutlery is coming in to the same value, at any rate, at which it came in before the tariff was imposed.  We should like to know what is happening in the industry and how much people are paying as a result of this very high tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>People are paying nothing as a result of the tariff.  It is producing practically no revenue whatever.  The manufacture of cutlery in the Saorstát was commenced towards the end of October last year, and consequently the importation of cutlery during 1935 was not affected. The fact is that a firm for its production has been established here. That firm is now in operation and is employing from 60 to 70 men.  They are, of course, not yet in full production. There are certain classes of cutlery that are not yet being produced here.  In respect of these classes, licences to import them free of this duty are still being issued.  It is anticipated that the full range of cutlery, in the quantities required, will be produced in the course of this year in which case, of course, the import figures to which the Deputy refers will be reduced very considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made any examination of the situation <Col N="343" /> with a view to seeing why it is necessary to have such a high tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that last year.  I explained that one of the reasons why such a high duty is necessary is because some of the countries engaged in the exportation of cutlery subsidise it.  Any lower duty than that in operation would be ineffective.  The maintenance of the duty at this rate is essential to the development of the industry.  The industry is an important one and is giving a good deal of employment.  Its products are of very good quality, and there is no complaint about the price at which they are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister this question.  I believe the Minister's tariff policy is ill-advised and irresponsible inasmuch as he does not consider all the relevant facts before he proposes his tariffs.  But assuming that this House is committed to a policy of putting on a tariff of 100 per cent. where, in the opinion of the Minister, a 100 per cent. is necessary, can he tell me why it is necessary to put 100 per cent. on cutlery when his colleague in the Executive Council thinks it inexpedient to give another Irish industry&mdash;ship-building&mdash;a tariff of 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit we are now discussing not tariffs in general but this particular tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's philosophy of putting 100 per cent. tariff on cutlery rests on the ground that tariffs are necessary to get something done in this country and that tariffs must go on.  I submit there is evidence that that is not the philosophy underlying these tariffs.  If it was it would be comprehensible and the matter might be debated on its merits, or at least we would know where we were. But we see a far bigger individual job being sent away to Great Britain with whom we are at present engaged in an economic war.  When we see that sent out of the country because a British firm can do the job 40 per cent. cheaper than an Irish firm, then I feel that we are on completely different ground.  Why is it desirable to put <Col N="344" /> 100 per cent. on knives and refuse to put 40 per cent. on ships?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put forward by the Minister is that 100 per cent. is put on in the case of cutlery in order to keep so many people employed in producing these knives and that that is worth a tariff of 100 per cent.  I think a case where a number of people would be necessarily kept employed in repairing the Muirchu is one well worth a tax of 40 per cent.  If the Minister tells us that the criterion by which to criticise each individual tariff is the effect it has on keeping people in employment, why should it not arise in the case of the Muirchu.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that the introduction of a criterion by which to criticise a tariff policy would involve the whole policy of tariffs.  That issue might have been debated on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill but is irrelevant to an amendment relating to a duty on cutlery.</P>

I am not prepared to endorse that kind of action, out of which the consumer gets nothing.  That is the situation at present, as it seems to me.

      <P>I am moving to take off the tariff because, as shown, it has no influence at all in reducing the amount of money that went out of the country for cutlery, and because, so far as we know, it is taking money out of the people's pockets and putting it into the Treasury.  The Minister denies that.  He implies that all the cutlery sought to be imported was imported free on licence.  I am moving to reduce the duty here, to 75 per cent. of the value of the article.

      <P>This is not the only tariff on cutlery.  There is another tariff of 25 per cent. on cutlery and, so far as the duties against British goods are concerned, there is now an additional 10 per cent., so that, in so far as cutlery from Great Britain is concerned, the deletion of this section would leave a duty remaining of 35 per cent. and, in respect of other countries, a duty of 25 per cent.  Inasmuch as as much money went out of the country last year for cutlery as <Col N="347" /> went out the year before, I think there is good reason for moving to take off the tariff.  The Minister has now told us that the factory has gone into production and that 60 or 70 men are employed.  He has also said that the price of cutlery is not going to be increased.  Personally, I should be prepared for the moment to take that statement and withdraw the amendment.

      <P>I looked up the debate on the Finance Bill of 1935, and I could not get satisfactory information as to why the duty of 75 per cent. was put on.  We have, according to the import list, a duty on cutlery and component parts, of 25 per cent. full, and 25 per cent. preferential, and an additional duty of 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential. Then we had the coal-cattle-cement pact, and now the coal-cattle minus the cement pact, and that appears to our minds to interfere with certain duties on articles that might include cutlery.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the rate of emergency duty on United Kingdom goods, on iron and steel goods not otherwise liable to duty, subject to duty under the <Col N="352" /> Emergency Duty Order No. 5 of 1932, was reduced from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, that is what I understood from the letter.  The Minister took, I think, about four weeks to find out what he could make out of the coal-cattle-cement agreement, and then he gave us this information.  Approaching the question humbly enough, I make a deduction from it.  I make the deduction that not only is this duty that is mentioned in this list imposed, but that there is also a retaliatory duty on cutlery coming in from Great Britain, and that, therefore, if this amendment of mine were passed, there would still be a 25 per cent. retaliatory duty on goods coming into the country from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act of 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of Section 17.</P>
      <P>This is one of the high power statutes. Section 17 of the Finance Act of 1935 imposed a duty of 75 per cent. on clocks coming into the country.  We have the position now that the value of imports of clocks has fallen from £24,000 to £16,000 between 1934 and 1935.  I would like to ask the Minister for some information as to how many persons are employed in the industry. Has he any information as to the total value of the annual production?  I understand that a duty is being collected on clocks coming into the country.  Is the Minister issuing licences for the import of clocks free of duty for clocks of the kind not manufactured by the companies manufacturing clocks here?  Are these licences issued on the application of the importers free of duty?</P>

The duty was imposed by the Finance Act last year. The figure as to the imports for last year would be no indication as to the extent to which these firms could supply the requirements of the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to annul the duty of 6d. per lb. on tea.  To my mind a very extraordinary situation seems to have arisen with regard to tea.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce publishes figures from time to time showing the average prices of those various commodities that particularly affect the cost of living of the people.  The position is remarkable in regard to tea in respect of which he publishes the average prices of the cheapest tea sold in the various towns throughout the country and the average price of the dearest tea.  The average price of the cheapest tea has risen by 10¼d. per lb. between mid-February 1932, and mid-February 1936, while the import price for tea in the same time during the two years 1932 and 1936 has fallen by 1d. per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the average price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The average price of the tea landed at the port has fallen by 1d. per lb.  The average price of the dearest tea has fallen by 1¾d., so that here we have a situation in respect of a commodity of general use and which to a very large extent is the staple beverage of the people and the price of that beverage has risen for the majority of the people by 10¼d. per lb.  And 6d. of that tax goes to the Government.  I do not want again to go over the various classes of people in this country on whom the burden of taxation is falling. The Minister for Finance indicated, when dealing with the question of relief of income-tax in respect of children who are undergoing certain types of education that the cost of giving that relief&mdash;that is to say, the tax which would have to be imposed to give that relief&mdash;would fall on the labouring classes, and I have repeatedly indicated what is the condition of <Col N="355" /> the labouring classes, particularly amongst the agricultural community, at the present time.  In that situation I submit that the tax of 6d. per lb. on tea is about the most inequitable tax that you could possibly have.  I have repeatedly pointed out that the previous Administration realised that.  It was a tax that fell very inequitably on various classes of the people, and was borne to the greatest possible extent by the poorer classes until they removed it.  It is now being restored to the extent of 6d. per lb.  One extraordinary circumstance that has accompanied that restoration is that the price of tea, when we take the 1d. reduction in the import price, has gone up by 5¼d. per lb. as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister the benefit of a comparison with the 1932 price.  The import price of tea between 1932 and 1935 fell from 1/5 to 1/4.  That 1d. fall is not reflected in the price the people pay.  If we take, as we might take, the 1935 price as compared with the 1931 price, the fall is 4d., because the import price of tea in 1931 was 1/8 and it was 1/4 last year. So that I am putting the mildest possible case, that over the price paid in February, 1932, the people buying the cheapest class of tea paid 10¼d.</P>

      <P>In 1936.  I should like the Minister to be clear on it.  In mid-February, 1932, the price paid for the cheapest tea was 2/1¼.  That had risen by 10¼d. in mid-February, 1936. Sixpence of that was tax.  Not only is there 4¼d. to be accounted for of an additional rise, but there is 1d. to be accounted for also by which the import <Col N="356" /> price of tea actually fell.  If the Minister wants to carry it further, there is an additional 3d. to be explained in the high price of tea to-day, if he takes the 1931 import price of tea as the foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another explanation and that is the true explanation. The incidence of the tax which the Minister put on tea fell either upon the palates of the people who drank the tea or upon their pockets.  So far as the rich people are concerned, or the people in a condition of moderate prosperity, the tax fell upon their palates, because the different blenders reduced the quality of the tea in the blend and left the prices at what they were before the Minister put on the tax at the special request of the Minister for Finance.  Deputies will remember that he begged the people not to pass on the 4d. tax because we were fighting a struggle to the death with Great Britain, that victory was to be won in a period of six weeks or two months, and, if the tax was passed on it might shake the foundations of the Irish nation.  It was not passed on.  The only persons to whom it was passed on were the poor of the Cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, who buy cheap fannings.  These fannings were the lowest grade of tea that money could buy and there could be <Col N="357" /> no depreciation of their quality, with the result that the whole tax had to go on to them and they suffered in their pockets.  I am not pretending that the people who bought a better quality did not suffer in any way. They did not get as good tea as they got heretofore.  They simply put cheaper tea in the blend.  It was the poor who were buying the cheapest tea that could be found in the market who had to find the extra 4d. or 6d., according to whether the tea came from the Dominions or the Dutch colonies.</P>
      <P>The result of the Government policy has been a very substantial fall in the consumption of tea in rural Ireland. I have tried to get a figure out of the Minister for Finance but he is very coy.  He keeps making the same answer and says it is an answer to the strict letter of the question put, but he feels bound to warn the Deputy that it leaves a considerable lacunae if information is really sought as to the total consumption of tea.  If the Minister knows that I want to ascertain what the total consumption is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wanted information as to how many lbs. of tea were consumed by the people.  The Minister wanted to cover up his tracks, to conceal <Col N="358" /> the fact that the consumption of tea has declined.  It declined because the people had not the money to pay for it.  The reason they had not the money was because the Minister was impoverishing them.  These are two facts.  The third fact is that the quality of tea consumed by the people of rural Ireland has fallen materially during the last three years.  A person who used to pay 4/4 for tea four or five years ago is now paying 3/4.  The person who used to pay 3/4 for tea is now paying 2/4.  The person who used to pay 2/4 for tea is now paying 1/8 or 2/-.  He would pay less if he could get cheaper tea, but he cannot.</P>
      <P>I beg Deputy Kelly, who represents a city constituency, and Deputy Mrs. Concannon, who holds herself out as a representative of the women of Ireland, to remember that the people who are actually paying the tax out of their pockets and not simply depreciating their standard of living are the poor.  The people who are buying the lowest grade of tea that they can get, because they cannot afford a better one, are the people who have to contribute to the tax-gatherer who stands at the door of every grocer's shop the 4d. or 6d. that the Minister levies on every poor person who buys a lb. of tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the Dublin tea trade, but I should say the poorest people in Dublin ought to be able to get tea at from 1/7 to 1/8.  I can conceive an exceptional fanning being available for 1/6, but I do not think any grocer will be profiteering who finds himself unable to offer tea at less than 1/8, even for the cheapest grade.  I am going to make a suggestion in connection with the tea tax.  The President spoke last night of being honest with the people, letting them know exactly what was being done and inviting judgment on it.  Will the Minister consider arranging in future that this tax should be collected by way of stamps: that each customer, having bought his tea and paid for it, would then be invited to pay for a stamp to be reminded that <Col N="359" /> when he was buying tea he was being privileged to contribute 6d. on each lb. of it to the development of the grand Fianna Fáil policy that we have in this country?  I feel sure that if the President is right&mdash;that the people are so anxious to know everything and that he is so anxious that they should know&mdash;the Minister would be glad to tell the working-class people of this country that he is extending to them the privilege of paying their share of the expense of the Fianna Fáil policy. The Minister for Education said some time ago in this House: &ldquo;Why should they not be made pay?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is it not right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they should be made pay their share.&rdquo;  If that is the policy of the Government, why not tell the people that honestly?  I was down in Deputy Tom Kelly's stronghold last night, addressing a meeting at the corner of York Street. I wonder would he go down there, amongst his own friends, and tell them that the Party that he is supporting is putting a levy of 6d. a lb. on tea, 2d. on sugar, 1½d. on the quartern loaf and 5d. per lb. on butter.  Would he tell them this: that, because he knew them to be enthusiastic citizens of <Col N="360" /> this State, they would regard it as a privilege to make their contribution of 2/- a week to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party?  I suggest that Deputy Kelly, who rejoices in his native borough in the cognomen of &ldquo;Honest Tom Kelly,&rdquo; should go down and dole out some of that honesty in York Street.  I have no doubt but that the Minister for Finance would be glad to escort him.  When the Deputy has done what I suggest he should do, and when both start running from York Street, we will be above at the corner at Stephen's Green with a barrage ready to receive them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Finance Act of 1935 puts a duty of 6d. a cwt. on wheat imported into the Saorstát.  This is one of the ways of keeping up the price of flour and the price of bread. I submit that this is the simplest, the easiest way by which the Government could indicate that they realise the enormous increases that have taken place in the price of bread and flour to the people and that they are going to see that these increases are not going to last.  There is a Bill before the House to give the Government power to fix the price of bread.  We should get an indication now that they are going to fix the price of bread at a rate lower than that applying to bread at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is, no doubt, aware that, when calculating the official cost-of-living index figure, something over 57 per cent of that figure is covered by the cost of food to the people and one-third of that is covered by items such as bread, flour, tea and sugar.  We have indicated that the price of the cheapest tea between February, 1932 and February, 1936, had risen by 10½d.; that the price of sugar has risen by 1/2d. a lb.; that flour has risen 4½d. a stone and that the 4 lb. loaf has risen by 1½d.  The Government have tolerated the continuance of that kind of thing for the reason, no doubt, that they set out to raise the price of bread and the price of flour; but there is very little excuse for the Minister for Finance tolerating the increase in the price of the 4 lb. loaf to 1½d. more than it was in the beginning of 1932, before Fianna Fáil came into office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been presented with the statement&mdash;and I have no doubt that he has brought it to the notice of the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole&mdash;that in the first quarter alone, the quarter to March, 1934, the millers made very considerable profits over what the Commission that was inquiring into the matter considered reasonable profits.  Dealing with the matter in page 35 of their Report, the Commission say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It represents a contribution of £34,640 to millers over and above the profits to which they were, in our opinion, entitled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here we had a group of flour millers, according to a report presented to the Minister very early last year, and the Government have been informed that these millers made, in the first quarter of the year 1934, £34,640 profit above the margin of profit that would be considered reasonable.  The Government have taken no steps to deal with that situation.  They sat idly by and they allowed the situation to develop to the extent that people are paying 1½d. more on the 4 lb. loaf than they were paying before Fianna Fáil took office.  It must amount to an enormous additional taxation, hidden taxation taken out of the pockets of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wheat policy was being financed by direct contribution from the Exchequer up to last year, but the extent of that contribution was becoming so great that the Government hid it, ceased the system by which it was made a direct contribution from the Revenue, and planned so that the people would have to pay the increased <Col N="363" /> charges for the wheat policy over the counter.  No doubt 6d. a cwt. on imported wheat is a very small thing in the matter of revenue, but it is an important factor in keeping up the level at which both flour and bread will be sold to the people.  There is a very grave situation indicated there in view of the unnecessarily high price that is being paid on two of the most important items in the whole cost-of-living index.</P>
    <P>I have said that food represents 57 per cent.  of the total cost-of-living index.  Bread and flour together represent nearly one-fifth of what the whole food component of the index represents. That gives some measure of the burden of increased prices on the people and I move that the 6d. should come off the wheat imports as a small indication to the people that when facing the question of fixing bread prices the Government will move in the direction of having them fixed at a lower level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on amendments discussed some time ago, expressed considerable concern that the House should take any action which would in any way compel the Government, by way of alternative taxation, to increase the cost of living. This is a matter to which I have had to draw the attention of the House on several occasions during the last year.  Deputy Mulcahy has quoted certain figures regarding the increase in the price of a 4 lb. loaf and regarding the increase in the price of flour. Of course the House is aware that in the rural parts of Ireland people make their own bread at home; it is mostly home-made bread that is used.  Flour is bought by farmers and others in half sacks in the towns and villages. It is bought in smaller quantities by the poorer people.  Deputy Mulcahy quoted an increase of 4½d. per stone. I do not know exactly where that figure was got, or what are the comparative periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mid-February 1932, and mid-February 1936, as quoted by the Minister for Industry <Col N="364" /> and Commerce.  The price was increased from 1/10 to 2/2½.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the rural parts of this country are concerned there was an increase of 8d. per stone.  The price of flour increased from 1/6 to 2/2.  It varied in certain parts from 2/1 to 2/2.  The poor people who have to buy flour in half-stones found they were saddled with an additional 8d. per stone.  In working-men's homes, where there are large families and where all the bread is made at home, 4 stones of flour are very often used in the week.  That gives the House an idea of what the additional cost means to an agricultural labourer with a comparatively small wage.  On flour alone there is an additional 2/8 per week; if you like, an additional 1/4 per week or an additional 2/- &mdash; the increase depending altogether on the size of the family. Of course there was an increase also in the price of bread.  I do not think there is any justification whatever for this particular tax.  Deputy Mulcahy has quoted from the report of the Commission regarding the profits made by millers in this country.  I do not think anybody in the country doubts for a moment that millers are making very large profits, particularly over the last two or three years. About a fortnight ago the newspaper which is controlled and directed by the President of the Executive Council, in an attempt to prove its contention that this country was prosperous and was growing more prosperous, quoted the price of shares in certain firms in this country, and referred to the way in which the price of those shares had advanced over the past four years.  One of the firms quoted to prove the contention that the country was growing more prosperous was one of the principal flour-milling bakery firms in this country. We were informed in that article that the shares had increased from 50/- to £5 14s. 0d. each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask members of the House to turn that over in their minds, remembering, as I say, that as a result of this tax and the other dealings of the Government the consumers are compelled to pay from 6d. to 8d. <Col N="365" /> per stone extra for flour.  That is a statement which cannot be contreverted. It is a statement that can be substantiated.  It is a statement which I have made on more than one occasion, both in this House and outside it.  I have gone to some trouble to make sure with regard to that particular figure.  I say that in my opinion this is perhaps the most unjust tax that was imposed in last year's Budget.  There were a great number of taxes imposed on the necessaries of life, and I think it will be agreed that there is no greater necessity than flour, particularly in the homes of the poor, where bread is used for every meal.  In the case of the better-off people in the larger homes there is a greater variety of food, and for that reason perhaps this tax does not hit them as badly as it hits the poor people, in whose homes bread is the staple part of every meal of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really very surprising that any Deputy who represents a rural constituency, at any rate, should manage to steel his heart and subdue his conscience sufficiently to follow the Minister for Finance into the Lobby upon the motion which we are now discussing.  This is a motion which comes to the relief of the very poorest members of the community, and since the interests of the Minister for Finance and the interests of the Executive Council are concentrated, not upon the welfare of the poor, but upon the welfare of the shareholders in milling and other companies, I take it for granted that this motion&mdash;a motion in relief of the poor&mdash;will be opposed by the Minister for Finance. He has not spoken but, from my general knowledge of the Minister for Finance and my general knowledge of the Fianna Fáil Party, I take it for granted that a motion which comes to the relief of the very poorest persons in the country will inevitably be opposed by the Party which is now in office.  Deputy Mulcahy quoted certain figures from the cost-of-living index, but we must always bear in mind that the cost-of-living index is not at all an indication of the cost of living of the very poor in this country.  The cost-of-living index is an index which <Col N="366" /> has been weighted to suit civil servants. There never has been an index to the cost-of-living figures in this country weighted to suit the working classes.  If a proper cost-of-living figure, weighted to suit the working classes, were introduced, the weight which would be given to the price of bread, to the price of flour and to the prices of the necessaries of life, would be very much heavier than the weight which is given to those items when an index to cost-of-living figures is produced weighted solely for the Civil Service.  We have it on the Government's own figures&mdash;admitted by the Government themselves&mdash;that the wages of agricultural labourers have fallen by at least an average of 3/- per week.  At a time when agricultural wages are being reduced, and must be reduced&mdash;it has been admitted even by the Chairman of the Labour Party that agricultural wages have been reduced of necessity because the farmers in this country cannot pay any higher wages&mdash;because the farmers are compelled, as a direct result of Government policy, to reduce the wages which they pay to their farm labourers, is it fair, is it just, is it moral even, that the Government, which on the one hand by their policy is indirectly foreing down the rate of agricultural wages, and on the other hand by their direct policy and the taxation which they have imposed upon the principal necessary which an agricultural labourer has got to buy, should further reduce the real purchasing value of those wages?  After all, what a wage means to the working man is solely what he can purchase with the amount of wages he receives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey has now given figures which cannot be controverted. As a matter of fact, I think that Deputy Morrissey has rather understated than over-stated his case.  We may take it that the cost of living of the ordinary agricultural labourer, rearing an ordinary family, has been put up by 2/- per week in the cost of flour.  Therefore, you may take it that if the Government policy means, indirectly, a reduction of wages by 3/- a week, and, directly, a reduction of the purchasing power of wages by another 2/-, it means a loss of 5/- a <Col N="367" /> week on an average to the agricultural labourer in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, surely, there ought to be some sense of fair play in the Executive Council, or at least in the Fianna Fáil Party; and surely, when they see, as they must see&mdash;they cannot be blind &mdash;that their policy has been the direct cause of a reduction of, on an average, 3/- a week in agricultural wages all over the country, instead of getting at that agricultural labourer, whose wages have been cut down, and instead of acting on the policy of saying &ldquo;There is a fellow down there, and let us jump on him,&rdquo; surely this is a time in which, if they had any sense of fair play or decency, the Executive Council would take a very different attitude and, instead of putting on taxes, would, owing to the poverty that exists among the agricultural community as a result of their policy, take this opportunity of removing every single tax off food, but, above all, off the prime necessity of life, because the staff of life, the staple food of the agricultural labourers and the small farmers of the country, is grain.  That is their standard food.  What has happened? That is being driven down.  Their wages are being driven down, and, at the same time, the cost of bread is going up.  What must happen as a result is an underfed population, and you are going to have little children wanting bread because you have made bread too dear.  You will have a population growing up underfed because, at a time like this, you have put up the cost of living for the poor.  You might raise the cost of living at a time of tremendous prosperity or at a time when agricultural wages were booming up, but, to increase the cost of living, at a time when the cost of agricultural wages are tumbling down, is unfair and unjust, and, I do not hesitate to stigmatise it, Sir, as immoral.</P>
    <P>I have certainly spoken, Sir, on the assumption that the Government will refuse this motion.  According to their past history, I know that they talk about themselves as a poor man's Government, but it seems to me that, when they get a chance to do something <Col N="368" /> for the poor man, their only idea seems to be to know what else they can extract from his pocket.  Their attitude seems to be that, although they have made these people poor already, they will make them poorer.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was dealing with the cost of living generally.  The cost of flour fluctuates from time to time and it fluctuated considerably during the time the previous Government was in office. Taking the cost of living generally, however, the general cost-of-living figure now is lower than it was in 1931. Deputy Morrissey's and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's arguments, again, fall before the facts.  I have often referred before to the innumerable tragedies in this House when beautiful theories advanced by certain Deputies come into contact with ugly facts. Deputies opposite do not like facing facts, but it is only necessary to face the facts in order to destroy their arguments because all their arguments are based upon conceptions of the facts that are wrong.  The cost-of-living figure now is lower than in 1931, and the remission of this duty would not affect the price of bread in the slightest&mdash;this duty of 6d. a cwt. on wheat.  That would not influence the price of bread in the slightest.</P>

      <P>Therefore, this tax, which brings in £150,000 a year, is of a character which does not influence the general cost of living to any degree whatever.  It has, however, a protective effect.  It is important that we should grow our own wheat and secure for the growers of wheat here a good price, and that, I think, is appreciated by most of the people in this country, if not by the Deputies opposite.  That protective duty is very small in relation to the world price of wheat which fell so much in 1929, and subsequently, that it was the prime cause of the world depression.  The addition of 6d. a cwt. does not bring the price anywhere near the minimum price we have guaranteed the wheat producers of this country.  In so far as we are succeeding in getting an increase of wheat production here, an increase that Deputies opposite and their Party always told us was a physical impossibility, this tax is becoming of less and less importance, because 35 per cent. of the flour being milled this year is being milled from Irish wheat. It is not so many years since the ex-Minister for Agriculture, and many of his agricultural experts, asserted, with all the authority which their positions gave them, that the land of this country would grow thistles, would grow weeds, would grow dandelion, would grow grass&mdash;anything except wheat.  They said the climatic conditions were such that wheat could not grow here.  It is growing, and in increasing quantities every year, and in due course this tax will be merely historic relic.</P>

      <P>The area under wheat is increasing, and the effect of the Government's plan for the development of wheat production has been very beneficial in all the wheat-growing parts.  It has given the farmers in these areas a new cash crop, one which they can grow with the certainty that in the harvest they will be able to dispose of it at a remunerative price. I think that is a good thing for the country, and a good thing for the farmers, who know that it is a good thing.  All the talk we have on occasions from the benches opposite, about the effect on consumers of agricultural produce of the Government's agricultural policy is intended for town consumption only.  They make the mistake of thinking that people in the agricultural community are illiterate; that they do not read the newspapers, but they are going to find out some day to their astonishment that the speeches they deliver for town consumption are being read by the rural population. Deputies opposite cannot have it both ways.  They cannot go around saying that the Government are ruining the farmers because the price of farm produce <Col N="371" /> is too low, and, at the same time, contend that we are ruining the towns because the price of farm produce is too high.  They have to stand by one thing or the other.  If they stand for an increase in agricultural prices, they may get increased support amongst the farmers, or if they stand for lower prices for agricultural produce in the towns, they may get support from the workers.  So long as they are trying to do both things they are not going to get any support, as the result of the recent County Dublin elections illustrates.</P>

Is it the Minister's contention that the millers are paying the £150,000 to the Government, and are not passing it on?  Does the Minister contend that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The Minister would like to proceed by way of speech because he will find some difficulty in answering.  The Minister wants to get away from the point.  A sum of £150,000 is involved for wheat which is to be imported, notwithstanding the Government's wheat policy.  If the consumers do not pay the £150,000 to the Government, who pays?  Does the Minister contend that millers whose shares have increased from 50/- to £5 14s. 0d. will pay?  Does the Minister contend that millers will pay this £150,000 and not recoup themselves from the consumers?  It is nonsense for the Minister to try to relate this to the guaranteed price.  What has that to do with it?  The Government is not contributing to the guaranteed price. <Col N="372" /> They are making the consumers pay it. This is a case of transferring it from the Exchequer and making it a direct charge on the people.  Whatever difficulty there is in making up the guaranteed price is solved by the direct charge on bread and flour used by consumers, and not by any contribution from the State.  This tax is for revenue purposes only, and is not passed on to the people who grow wheat.  The Minister spoke of this as a measure of protection for the wheat growing policy.  I should like the Minister to explain that.  Does any other Deputy understand it in that way?  I do not think there is, except Deputy Briscoe.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to discuss it, as a whole, because this is one of the items which go to make up the bread tax, and this is the only way in which we can bring the bread tax up for discussion in this House.  The Minister knows that the amendment was brought in, in order to discuss the bread tax, but, disingenuously and entirely ineffectively, he tried to dodge that issue. The Minister endeavoured to pass the major proposition.  He said that flour was as dear in 1932 as it is now, and that by taxing it, it is not going to be made any dearer.  That is an idiotic statement.  I beg pardon, that is unparliamentary.  The Minister is not doing his own intellect complete justice when he puts that argument before the House.  I think the Minister might now give us an example of endeavouring to do himself justice. Let him use his own mind, let him do himself justice, let him deal with these questions which we have put to him and let him answer this plain, simple, straight question I put to him: when agricultural wages are driven down should not the cost of living to the agricultural labourer be reduced as much as the Government can reduce it?  I put this plain straight question to him very sincerely and the Minister will not answer it by rubbing his fevered brow to get inspiration, as I see him doing at the present moment. Let him answer that question plainly and straightly.  When agricultural wages are driven down, is it fair and is it right or, I again say, is it even moral, to tax the necessaries of life for those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks why we do not talk about farm labourers, and says that we had confined ourselves to the towns.  I have not mentioned a town or city.  The people in whom I am interested are the small farmers in my own constituency.  These are the people who are being hit by the price of flour.  These are the people on whose behalf I here denounce this increase in the cost of living by Government taxation of food.  Let us have it out with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Let him tell <Col N="375" /> us whether he thinks it is fair to raise the cost of flour&mdash;I do not want any comparative figures&mdash;over what it would be if untaxed at the present moment when agricultural wages have been driven down and when the small-holders of this country, the ordinary country people, have been reduced to poverty by the action of the Government in depriving them of a market for their stock.</P>

On a rough calculation, speaking purely as a merchant without any experience as a miller, I understand that a tax of 6d. per cwt. on wheat involves an increase of 10d. per cwt. on flour.  Do the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party take the view that in existing circumstances, whenever a country woman goes in to buy a cwt. of flour, she should pay 10d. to the tax-gatherer as she passes out of the merchant's door?</P>

If the people want to say that, then the will of the people should prevail.  I put a little test before to Deputy Tom Kelly. I suggested that he should go down to his friends at the corner of York Street and talk about bread, sugar and tea.  He said that, having maturely considered the suggestion, he would stay where he was.  Deputy Tom Kelly is &ldquo;Honest Tom Kelly&rdquo; in this city, <Col N="377" /> and I have no doubt that if he went down to the corner of York Street be would tell the people the truth but, in the circumstances, he thought it wiser to stay in Dáil Eireann.  I think he was right.  What about Deputy Moane starting for the West of Ireland, bringing Deputy Briscoe with him, and making that comparison?  I shall tell you what I shall do.  If Deputy Moane goes down to the West of Ireland, takes Deputy Briscoe with him, puts him up on a platform and asks the people &ldquo;Is he worth 10d. a bag?&rdquo; and if the people agree that he is, we shall never again say a thing about the increase of 10d. per cwt. in the price of flour.</P>

We were informed by the Government Press the other day&mdash;some time in the month of June&mdash;that the price of the 4lb. loaf in London was reduced to 7½d.  That was about the 5th or 6th of June.  Here the price is 10d.  The Minister was not here when I was speaking to the amendment and I should like to put to him again the point I made in connection with it.  I quite agree that a reduction of 6d. per cwt. on wheat is not going to bring a sufficient reduction either in the price of bread or flour, but this was the only opportunity we had in the Finance Bill of making any attempt to bring about a reduction in the price of bread or of flour.</P>

The Minister has sat still for two years while he had in front of him on his table, or I hope somewhere near his table, a statement from the Commission which inquired into the price of flour that in the first quarter of 1934 the millers made unreasonable profits to the extent of £34,640.  Nothing has happened since.  It would be some kind of a sign that the Government were going to operate their Bread Prices Fixing Bill <Col N="378" /> in a way that would bring down prices, rather than raise them, if they took this 6d. per cwt. off wheat coming into the country because it is the top of the dam that the Government has raised to keep up the price of flour and bread in the country.

There are only two ways by which the price of bread can be reduced; one is to reduce the impost on flour and the other is to subsidise the production of bread. One wants to understand the bread trade to get at prices accurately.  When we speak of 5d. we must remember that the producer sells bread at 5d. less the retailers' discount, which fluctuates between 10 and 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion in the First Schedule of reference No. 25, and all references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for the purpose of ascertaining from the Minister the amount of additional employment given as a result of this tariff in the prayer-book industry and to what extent further production of prayer books and missals has taken place, in view of certain Press complaints made recently as to the application of the tariff to certain classes of books of a cheap kind which are not being printed here.  I should also like to know whether any use is being made of the licensing provision with regard to this duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what extra employment has been given by this duty, but the Deputy may take it that it is small.  The duty was imposed following a report of the Tariff Commission and it was designed to ease the situation in respect of unemployment in the bookbinding trade.  Some classes of religious books are printed and bound here, but whenever there is <Col N="381" /> any difficulty in getting religious books of the kind to which the duty applies, the licensing provision is being used to allow in the printed sheets, free of duty, to be bound here. I do not think it is correct to say that any difficulty has been experienced in procuring the cheaper class of books. A number of the cheaper classes of books&mdash;books which sell about 2d. each &mdash;are both printed and bound here. It was probably in connection with the dearer classes of books that difficulty was experienced.  The duty is not one of great importance, but I do not think it is one which should be removed.  The bookbinding industry in the Saorstát was, at one time, quite considerable.  It has declined very much, due to a number of causes.  It has probably declined in all countries. The result was that a large number of really skilled bookbinders were unemployed. Although this tax has not done much to lessen that unemployployment, it has relieved it to some extent, and I do not think it can be said, against it, that it has caused much inconvenience.  Therefore, I am in favour of maintaining it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of, in Part I, Second Schedule, reference No. 2, and all references thereto in columns 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with customs duty of 6d. per yard on linoleum, without any provision for licensing.  It has, in fact, come to be a revenue tariff. The statement made at the time was that it was intended to set up a factory for the manufacture here of linoleum. I should like to know what progress has been made in that connection. Again, I should like to point out that the tariff is purely a revenue tariff and, as was pointed out before, bears unequally on the working-classes who buy the cheaper class of linoleum. Linoleum imported at 7/6 per yard bears a customs duty of 6d. while linoleum imported at 1/- a yard bears the same duty of 6d.  That is inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a factory now working which is producing linoleum in sufficient quantities to supply all the requirements of the country, with the exception of certain very expensive classes of linoleum on which this duty of 6d. is not of great importance.  The factory is located in Tipperary and employs a considerable number of men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say the exact number, but it is over 50.  They are all men and, consequently, the industry is of considerable importance to that town.  It is probable that some expansion of that industry will take place but, even as it stands, it is now in an unimportant industry.  It is now in full production and able to supply all the country's requirements in linoleum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a situation which rather alarms me.  If the Minister says he has induced somebody to establish <Col N="383" /> a factory in Tipperary which employs over 50 persons and which, on that basis, is capable of supplying all the linoleum requirements of the country at the present time, then I think he has done a very imprudent thing.  At present, there is a terrific amount of building going on and if the Minister studies the output of the big linoleum factories in Great Britain, he will find that the experience there bears out my contention.  If you are going to establish a factory with a capacity to supply an inflated demand for linoleum at present, when we get back to normal the capacity of that factory will be out of all proportion to the national requirements.</P>

      <P>When the State interferes in trade the State must accept a certain liability for the result of its own actions.  If the State induced a number of men to go into the production of a commodity which ceased to be used, it would not be enough for the Minister to say that that was a matter for the people who went into such production.  If they went into it at his express suggestion, they would be entitled to turn to the Minister and say that the business had completely evaporated, that they had lost their money, and ask him what he was going to do about it.  Is the Minister prepared to stand by the statement that the factory in Tipperary is capable of supplying all our present requirements?</P>

      <P>If it is, then it is floated on an altogether inflated estimate of the normal requirements of this country in respect of linoleum.  When the housing boom is finished and a sufficient number of houses built to accommodate the population, the demand must inevitably fall substantially and then you would have a very undesirable situation developing.  I have not as yet had an opportunity of seeing samples of the Tipperary product. <Col N="384" /> I hope I soon will.  I know nothing about the quality and am not in a position to tell the House anything about the Tipperary product, but I sincerely trust that the factory has not been founded on the basis of supplying the present demand which, in view of the abnormal activity in house-building, can only be temporary.</P>

    <P>This is purely a revenue duty and I would like to ask the Minister, after 12 months' experience of the duty as a revenue duty, if he would make some attempt to justify it.  It does seem an extraordinary thing to follow the worker into his house.  We have been discussing the effect on the workers of the taxation imposed on them.  Last year there were £2,000,000 more taken in customs duty than in the year 1931-32.  One of the last things that the Revenue people did in scraping up the various amounts that went to make up that £2,000,000 was to enter the house of the workingman and put 5 per cent of a tariff on wallpaper as a whole.  I would like now to hear the Minister make any attempt to justify that after 12 months' experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put this point to the Minister&mdash;wallpaper is bought in very small quantities.  It is sometimes bought to match the paper that people have already bought but of which they did not get enough.  The inconvenience that is caused in the collection of this revenue is out of all proportion to the amount of the revenue collected.  Furthermore, I think the Revenue authorities will tell the Minister that the class of people who go in for wallpaper are principally people who live in the poorer class of house.  Wallpaper has gone out of fashion for the purpose of interior decoration.  Wallpaper is only used now in labourers' cottages and small rural houses.  It is confined almost exclusively to these.  I put it to the Minister that a revenue of £3,500 cannot justify the trouble to the customs authorities, to the merchants <Col N="386" /> importing the paper, or to the people who use the wallpaper.  I suggest to the Minister that the sensible thing to do would be to drop this tariff.  It is helping nobody and the time and trouble expended on collecting it are almost as much as the tax is worth.</P>

      <P>The tax that this amendment touches is even worse than the wallpaper tax. This is one of the cases where the Government went round to discover on what they could put additional taxation and as a result of that investigation they put on a tax of 2/- a cwt. on rice.  The Minister for Finance indicated to us last night that if he had to give certain income tax reliefs in connection with the education of children that it would be the working classes who would have to pay for it. Two Ministers have indicated that it is to the working classes that the Minister for Finance has had to go to bear the greater part of his Budget burdens. After 12 months' experience of this tax of 2/- a cwt. on rice I ask the Minister for Finance what he took in revenue on rice, and whether since it was put on he has not got the figures of the amount collected with a view to dropping it this year.</P>

We have the Minister for Education now saying that the policy of Fianna Fáil is that the poor ought to be made pay their share. That is the philosophy of every Tory Government in Europe and it always has been the policy of the skilful Minister for Finance in every Tory Government that ever existed.

I do not think it represents much.  As a matter of fact, it represents very little per family, but it is a pernicious form of taxation designed to extract revenue out of the poor, designed to carry into effect the Minister for Education's view, that the poor ought to be made to pay.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has the same view.  He thinks that it is high time that the poor were made to pay their share.  In fact, he says they feel they will be honoured in undertaking their part of the burden.  There was never a Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer who did not think so.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so simple and should not be taken so lightheartedly as the Ministers take it.  I should like the Minister to hear Deputy Costello on the matter.  There was a 50 per cent. tariff put on golf clubs in the Finance Act of 1934, and that helped a rather widespread class of people engaged as golf professionals and assistant professionals in various golf clubs.  They had already done a very considerable amount of the manufacture of golf clubs, if the assembling of various parts and the carrying out of certain additional work on the shafts and on the wooden club heads is taken into consideration.  The 50 per cent. that was put on in the Finance Act of 1934 assisted golf professionals very much, but the tariff that was put on in the Finance Act, 1935, on component parts, has done a very considerable amount of damage to the manufacturing work of golf professionals. I heard of one particular case where a professional gave an order to one of the companies that the Minister speaks about for some iron heads.  When they were supplied he found that they were bored in a manner that was entirely out of date. <Col N="393" /> I believe he refused to take delivery of them.  Would the Minister say if he has made any examination as to the type of iron heads that are being produced. Has he had any consultations with anybody representing golf club professionals, all of whom manufacture clubs and assemble clubs?  Has he received any complaints from those who are assembling golf clubs in the country and producing the finished article?  I, personally, have heard very general complaints.  The Minister says that there are four firms engaged in this particular class of work. Would he give the House some idea as to the amount of employment they are providing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's last point, I do not think that I have any figures.  There are these four firms manufacturing golf clubs in the country.  The market is not very large, but, so far as I know, they are producing in sufficient varieties golf clubs to supply all requirements. It is true that there are golf professionals who like to be able to buy any new type of club that is advertised because there is a certain number of golfers who insist on buying a new set of clubs every time that a new brand of club is put on the market in the belief that, if they possess it, it is going to improve their golf.  That type of trade for golf professionals is, no doubt, restricted. But there are varieties of clubs being produced and, so far as I know, the alteration of the duty has not had any adverse affect on golf professionals. What had an adverse affect on them was the development in production by ordinary sports firms before the change was made, when the shaft and head were brought in separately and put together, and clubs were sold by sports outfitters and other traders. That development in the sale of golf clubs has, undoubtedly, affected golf professionals.  It would have affected them in any event.  In the past, of course, almost every golfer bought his clubs from the club professional but, in recent years, the mass production of clubs sold through sports outfitters has interfered with that position. That position was not in any way <Col N="394" /> altered by the original duty.  It has been, to some extent, altered by the subsequent duty but, again, not to any great extent.  There is still a very substantial sale of clubs through golf professionals and the ordinary sports outfitters.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Cement Act, 1933 (No. 17 of 1933) shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion of Section 36.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to try to get some light on the great mystery of cement.  This matter has been raised by way of Parliamentary Question on a number of occasions since November last.  I have already drawn the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the fact that between November, 1935, and the beginning of February, 1936, the price of cement sold in the City of Dublin went up from 38/- to 44/- a ton, an increase of 6/- per ton in that period. The Minister, in a Parliamentary answer, has indicated that there was no reflex of that disclosed in the import price of cement.  He has given the average price of cement imported in November, 1935, at 25/7 per ton, and for January, 1936, the price quoted by him is 26/3 per ton.  That represents an increase in the import price of cement of 8d. per ton.  But here in the City of Dublin, in that three months' period, cement had gone up by 6/- per ton, and I understand by 5/- per ton in various parts of the country.  I have before me a notification addressed to a builder in Galway from a cement selling firm in the City of Dublin.  It is dated 18th June, 1936, and it states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are compelled to advance the price of British cement by 8/6 per ton from this date, as the manufacturers have increased their price to us by this amount.  The price of Continental cement remains unchanged at the moment, but we are daily expecting notification of an increase in the price of this also.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> That, apparently, refers to an increase in the import price that is about to take place during the month of June. There was no increase in the import price of cement from February to May. As a matter of fact, the average import price of cement in February was 27/7 per ton and in May 26/11, so that there was a reduction of 8d. per ton, as the figures that we get from the Minister and from the trade returns show.  If we have the position that, for some reason which I hope the Minister will be able to explain, the price of cement advanced from 38/- to 44/- per ton in February last, that it is now going to be advanced by another 8/6 per ton in respect of British cement and by some unknown amount in the case of Continental cement, my argument is that a situation has been arrived at comparable to the coal situation.  Therefore, I submit that the 5/- a ton which the Minister is charging in respect of the import of cement should be dropped. If another 8/6 is to go on to the price of British cement, it means that within a few months the price of cement here will have been increased by 14/6 a ton. In view of what all that means to the building work that is going on in the country, and because of the way in which we are dependent on building to give employment, my case is that the 5/- in respect of licence fees should come off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not merely moving to eliminate the licence fee, he is moving to repeal the section of the Act under which it is imposed, and that is something which could not be agreed to.  The question of the licence fee is always an open question. I do not think that we would be justified at the moment in coming to any decision about it.  The whole situation is an utterly abnormal one, due to the strike at the port of Antwerp and to the rather unusual cement situation existing in Great Britain.  At some stage the question of the amount of the fee may have to be considered, but I certainly could not agree to delete the section of the Act which authorises the imposition of the fee, because that was designed for a particular purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> There were two objects to be achieved by it.  The first arose out of the fact that when the Act was passed the price of cement here was abnormally low.  It was by far the lowest price prevailing in any European country of which I know, and that was due to the fact that, whereas the cement market all over Europe was controlled by cartels, this market was free and the various producers were in competition, with the result that the price of cement was very low, much lower than we could hope to make it on any economic basis.  The Act provided for the establishment of factories to make it, and we contemplated stepping up the price of cement from the price then prevailing to the price at which it would be available when Irish factories were in operation, with benefit to the Exchequer and in a manner which would prevent any sudden dislocation in cement prices.  Secondly, there was the reason that the total amount of cement to be produced here will be less than present requirements, and it would be undesirable that there should be any difference in price between the imported cement and the home-produced cement.</P>
    <P>The power to impose a fee&mdash; variable from time to time&mdash;or, under other circumstances variable in respect of country of origin or from port to port was obtained in order to prevent any such difference in price between imported and home-produced cement arising.  That was the idea of having that power and it is desirable to retain that power.  The situation in respect of the price of imported cement has changed considerably since that Act was passed. The reference which the Deputy read to the price of British cement being increased by 8/6 a ton is only of academic interest, because the situation which led to the repeal of the quota order in respect of cement and the cancellation of the arrangement under which we agreed to purchase a certain quantity of cement from Great Britain was that British cement producers were not interested in selling cement at the prices prevailing here.  There is apparently something like a cement famine in Great Britain and, at the moment, very high prices for cement <Col N="397" /> are ruling there.  Having regard to the demands and the prices, the British exporters were not interested in sending cement to this market at all.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there was a temporary difficulty in relation to Continental supplies, arising out of the Belgian port workers' strike.  That situation is over now and Continental supplies will be again available.  The situation under which the various Continental manufacturers were in competition with each other in this market appears to have ended.  The Danish. German and Belgian cement cartels have come to some understanding which will prevent them competing in respect to prices here and, therefore, the price of Continental cement has been moving upwards and may continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The relation between the price at which cement can be imported and the price at which it can be manufactured here is very different to what it was when the Cement Act was introduced. We can make cement here as economically as they can make it in any coun try, and the cement factories that will be established here will be as up-to date and as well directed as cement factories in any country and, consequently, there will be no uneconomic element whatever in the price of Irish cement.  We may well get to the situation when the price of Irish cement will be lower than the price at which cement will be imported, if the abnormal circumstances now prevailing in the cement market continue, but it is unlikely that they will.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that we should retain this power in order to ensure that any difference between the price of imported cement and the price of home-produced cement will be secured for the benefit of the Exchequer, because if it is not so secured it will not go to the consumer.  The standard price will be the price of the Irish product which will be supplied in far larger quantities than cement that will be imported, and consequently that section should be retained even though the situation in respect of the fee will vary from time to time, and the fee will fluctuate from time to time.  It was never contemplated that we would fix a fee at one amount and keep it at <Col N="398" /> that amount; it was always intended that it would vary as circumstances in the cement market varied and even as they varied in exceptional circumstances from port to port or in respect of the country of origin of the imported cement.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Mulcahy must, therefore, be resisted, but in resisting it I am indicating that while the existing fee will be maintained for some time and could not be changed until a clearer view of the future of cement prices is obtainable, and while the Budget has been prepared on the basis of a particular revenue from that source, a revenue which must be secured, nevertheless there is no reason to assume that the fee cannot be changed as circumstances change during the period between this and the commencement of the production of the new factories to be built.  When the new factories are built the fee will be varied in relation to two figures, whereas it is now only varied in relation to one figure, and will be designed for the purpose of ensuring that imported cement will be sold to consumers at the same price as Irish-produced cement.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when he first spoke, seemed to me to have made up his mind that he was going to reduce the licence fee on cement, but I am afraid as he went on his heart appeared to harden.  The deletion of the section, I think, was not intended&mdash; it was merely to obtain an expression of opinion as to whether the 5/- tax was now justified.  The Minister for Finance suggested to us on this side that we should ask Parliamentary Questions and that, of course, if we put down Parliamentary Questions everything would be well.  A few days ago I addressed a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is intended to enforce the quota of British cement for the Second Quota Period; if he will state if the present price of British cement has had any effect on the allotted quota, or has one-third of our total cement requirements to be taken irrespective of what is the cost of this commodity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Steps are being taken to revoke the quota order regulating the importation of cement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Some of the amendments tabled to this Bill purport to delete sections of a previous Finance Act.  About the admissibility of such amendments the Chair had no doubts.  Amendment No. 34, however, aims at repealing or annulling a section of a Cement Act.  That section had apparently a double purpose.  The Deputy was, in the opinion of the Chair, entitled to propose to annul the portion that related to a licence fee, seeing that the fee is revenue. Beyond that the Deputy could not go. The Chair took it that the purpose of the Deputy was to elicit information, and allowed the amendment.  Deputy Dockrell, however, has departed from this amendment and proceeded to discuss quotas.  That is a question for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and is not relevant to the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>If there is a duty of 20 per cent.  On cement that duty is onerous.  But if there is a duty of 20 per cent.  on cement, plus a duty of 5/-, the duty of 20 per cent.  is all the more onerous.  Therefore, we have to discuss the two duties on the one commodity when dealing with either, in order to direct the attention of the House to the fact that we are not asking to have cement made free of all duty; that it is already bearing a heavy duty, and that we only advocate the removal of the 5/- in view of the fact that cement is already carrying the additional heavy duty to which Deputy Dockrell makes passing reference.</P>

      <P>The question is wrapped up with the price of cement. Of course, I will bow to your ruling, but what I wish to point out to you before you express a definite ruling on the matter is that Deputy Mulcahy wishes to do away with the 5/- duty on cement.  I have started by pointing out to the Minister that I have asked for information on the question of cement.  If the Minister had borne with me I would have gone on to show that as far as the 20 per cent. emergency duty&mdash;reduced to 10 per <Col N="401" /> cent.&mdash;is concerned, some people are rather doubtful as to whether it has been put back again by the putting away of this quota.  The quota for British cement has been done away with.  Apparently that leaves us as we were, but some people &mdash; myself amongst that number&mdash;want to find out how far we are affected by the alteration of this quota.  I am afraid I intended also to refer to the coal-cattle pact, of which cement formed a part, and as a result of which the duty was reduced from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent.  If you wish to rule, Sir, that I am out of order, under a motion to do away with a duty of 5/- on cement, in referring to other duties on cement which are imposed by the Government, and imposed in my opinion in quite a wrong way, of course I will bow to your ruling, but I wish to ask you for a definite ruling.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, that would be a relevant question under the old procedure, but under modern procedure we do not impose tariffs in the Finance Act.  We impose tariffs by an Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Order.  They never come before the House in a Finance Bill, and you cannot amend the Finance Bill to delete them.  The only way you can come at them is by raising the question on the Finance Bill by an amendment of this kind, and then referring to the duties which were imposed by Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Order and subsequently confirmed by Statute, which in my respectful submission under the rules of order of this House ought to be looked upon as addenda to the Finance Bill which is introduced at the end of the financial year.</P>

I do not know where the quota, the licence and the emergency duty, begin and end.  They are absolutely interlocked.  Before you can get a ton of cement you have to pay your licence fee of 5/-.  Before the cement comes in you have to pay your <i>ad ralorem</i> duty of 10 per cent.  The Minister has made certain quota <Col N="403" /> orders, and then told me that they are done away with.</P>

      <P>By the Minister for Industry and Commerce, administering an Act passed by this House.  That Act is not under review now except in so far as affected by Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, that is to a very limited extent of the annulment of a fee.  It is just the point that I put a few minutes since.  The House is not entitled to advocate the annulment of any Act or portion thereof unless it operates to bring in revenue. Licence fees on cement do contribute to revenue.  The matter to which the Deputy has just referred could not be brought within the scope of amendment No. 34.</P>

Now you will, likely, ask what has the quota got to do with it.  It has this got to do with it: that there is an emergency imposition duty put on Continental cement, but not on British cement, and the quota order compels us to buy so much British cement, thus forcing us to pay so much to the Minister, and forcing us to bear the burden of whatever may be the increased cost of the British cement, and we have got to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the forcing of this country to buy cement, which carries an emergency imposition of duties tax, has been made the reason for advancing the cost of both classes of cement in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, this amendment is designed to prevent the Minister from continuing to levy any licence fee on the import of cement, and it is right for the House to remember that a licence fee is simply a new name invented by the Fianna Fáil Government to cover up the time-honoured description of a tariff.  In this case, this extraordinary power has been conferred on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that, without any reference to the House, so far as I am aware, he can fix any tariff he likes on the import of cement by fixing the import price of cement per ton.  Our case is that, although a defence might be made for this imposition along the lines suggested by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, what we complain of is that this licensing provision, which contains the power to exact a fee, is used contemporaneously with other Acts through which additional taxes are placed on imports of cement, and we feel that we are entitled, when discussing this specific figure of 5/- per ton, to ask the Minister for Finance to <Col N="405" /> explain to us what is the exact position of imported cement, at the moment, taking into consideration the various measures which he, or his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has operated for the purpose of raising the price of cement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  I want to know will the Minister afford those cement vendors, who, I am satisfied, are doing their best to give cement at the lowest possible price at which they can afford to keep their houses open&mdash; under circumstances to which we cannot refer within the rules of order&mdash; some relief by reducing or abolishing the import licence fee?  The Chair will probably say that this amendment was put down for the purpose more of ascertaining what would be the fee in the future than of amending the Cement Act itself, and I ask the Minister now to take into consideration the fact that cement is one of the raw materials of housing and that an increased price of cement means an increase in the price of labourers' cottages, and in the cost of practically every public work that is undertaken as a result of a vote of this House.  I ask the Minister to abolish this 5/- licence fee and to do away with the whole system of licensing these imports.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has made the case that he had to have this power in order to accustom the people of this country gradually to the fact that, when cement is being manufactured in this country, it is going to be a great deal more expensive than ever before. I do not think the people will be at all grateful to him for his solicitude for their feelings in that connection. <Col N="406" /> I think the attitude of the people would be that they would rather have cheap supplies, so long as they could get them, than to have to bear the burden of home-made cement when we have to bear it.</P>
      <P>There is an old saying, that you should not bid the devil good morrow until you meet him.  I can assure the devil that he is no more welcome when he does arrive, even if he is being heralded by several couriers who run in front of him.  The Minister's only defence of this arrangement is that it is a kind of herald announcing the arrival of worse times when cement is manufactured here.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted that the burdens on cement at present are altogether excessive, and he indicated that he thought a strong case might be made for reducing the licence fee substantially.  I urge the Minister for Finance to abolish it completely, and to allow the people to have the benefit of whatever the price of cement may be in the market of the world.</P>

We do not know the position in which we are left in the cement trade.  There is at present a licence fee of 5/-, and there was an emergency duty of 20 per cent., but that was reduced to 10 per cent. under the coal-cattle pact, which allowed one-third of our cement requirements to the British. What I am anxious to find out is, how far all reference to cement has been taken out of the coal-cattle pact.  Has the 10 per cent. gone, and are we back again to the 20 per cent.?  That is one <Col N="407" /> point I wish the Minister to deal with. I do not know if I can refer to the fact that taking one set of trade from one country and giving it to another, and then having to hand it back again when there is a strike, and when expenses have been increased, can only lead to increased prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that one reason why a duty of 5/- was put on was that at the time cement could bear it, and that it was a matter of revenue.  As the duty is now being continued I think it is most unfair. The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that it was quite possible the duty would continue until the Irish factories were established.  Is this a cloak to keep on the 5/- so that the Irish people and those who use cement will not get a shock by having this 5/- duty brought to their attention? The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that possibly cement could be made here as cheaply as any place else.  Let there be a start made in that direction by taking off the 5/- duty.  Then we can see where we are and consumers should be prepared to pay something extra for the Irish product. At the time the duty was put on in November, 1934, Continental cement was delivered in the West of Ireland for £2 2s a ton.  In 1935, it was £2 7s., and in February, 1936, £2 12s. 6d. Does the Minister not consider it an injustice to keep on the 5/- duty now, seeing that he started that the duty was only put on when cement could bear it?  Can cement <Col N="408" /> bear the 5/- duty now that the price has gone up by 10/6 a ton?  When dealing with the British cement quota Deputy Mulcahy said that there had been an increase in the price of Portland cement by 8/6 a ton since 18th June.  If the Minister for Finance happens to become good friends again in the course of a month with the British and if we have a new arrangement, what will happen to the 8/6 a ton plus the duty?  We were told by the Minister and by Deputies on the Government Benches that the little advance does not affect building.  I know that the Minister for Finance does not know much about the building industry, but it may enlighten him to know that cement that previously cost £2 2s., delivered in the West of Ireland, now costs £3 5s. a ton.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.  The advance in prices is sufficient without having to pay the duty.  The advance in the price of cement necessary to build a labourer's cottage, including the duty, represents about £10 10s. on each cottage.  If the 5/- duty was taken off, there would certainly be a reduction in prices there.  It is certainly most unfair to people who are paying all the time, to people who are building, to have to pay an excessive price for cement.  As building work is going on on new land holdings, on labour schemes, and on out-offices, it is unfair that the duty has to be paid. The argument of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was that it was put on when cement could bear the duty.  Now that it cannot bear it, it should be taken off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the intention of the Minister to deal with matters that arose in connection with this Bill in Committee Stage?  The Minister may remember that amongst other points raised by the Opposition was the question of title.  We pointed out to the Minister on that occasion that it was something quite unknown to the existing law of property to attempt to convey in a terminable manner a title in fee.  Under this Bill a labourer may enter into an agreement for purchase with the local authority, and when the agreement is drafted and completed on a certain date to be agreed upon, the <Col N="411" /> vesting order is made.  Up to this point the procedure of conveying the cottage to the labourer is closely analogous to that pursued by the Land Commission when it conveys a holding to a tenant purchaser under the Land Acts. But under the Land Acts, when the holding is conveyed to the tenant purchaser, the Land Commission retains a mortgage charged upon the land for the amount of annuities outstanding.  I think they have certain statutory powers whereby they can institute what are known as resumption proceedings: but no matter what device they employ to recover possession of the holding, damages are awarded to the tenant for the disturbance that results to him.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill it appears that if a cottage has been vested in the labourer, and the labourer after paying that annuity for 30 years fails to pay one instalment, he becomes liable to have his cottage taken from him, and given back to the local authority without any credit for the instalments he has paid in his 30 years of occupancy of the cottage from the date of the vesting order.  I think the Minister agreed with me that such an arrangement did not appear to be desirable.  I understood he intended to look into the matter before the Report Stage, and introduce any amendments that might be necessary to regularise the position and to ensure that the tenant purchaser would, at least, get adequate compensation for anything he paid, in the event of disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will readily understand that the difficulties, in the way of the Opposition preparing adequate amendments to meet a case of that kind, are almost insuperable because, admittedly, extremely difficult questions of title and conveyancing law may arise, and it might be necessary to redraft a considerable portion of the Bill to do that adequately.  I, therefore, took no further action after directing the attention of the Minister to the dilemma; but I now discover that nothing was done on Report Stage.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister, now, if he is satisfied with the machinery incorporated in the Bill for effecting conveyances.  So far, I think I have touched upon nothing <Col N="412" /> controversial.  I must now, however, mention one aspect of the Bill, before it leaves this House and becomes law, and I am afraid the Minister will regard it as a somewhat controversial contribution.</P>
    <P>The country was plastered, at the last election, with the announcement that Fianna Fáil were going to transfer labourers' cottages in fee simple to the tenants.  I, myself, in County Donegal, was very strongly pressed by my supporters to go flatfooted for that policy.  At first, I must confess, I was very much attracted by it, because I believe, generally, in the principle of increasing the number of small pro prietors from the social point of view. But when I came to investigate the matter closely it became clear to me that, in a very large number of cases, conveying the cottages to the tenants would be putting upon the tenants a very substantial burden.  I was not quite sure, in my own mind, that, if the tenants of cottages understood the full implication of what the transfer of these cottages meant, they would be so enthusiastic for the scheme.  I doubt if many of them realise that each of these cottages at present constitutes a burden of about £2 10/- per annum upon the rates of the county in which they are situated.  I doubt if many of the labourers understood that the rents of their cottages were uneconomic, and were unavoidably subsidised out of the rates, and that if you wanted to evolve a system of purchase it must inevitably mean that, not only the rent charged, but the character of the commitments would be substantially heavier for the tenants of the cottages.</P>
    <P>I allege against Fianna Fáil and the Government that they have not made these facts clear.  What they have done is this: Instead of preparing a scheme of cottage purchase they have introduced an enabling Bill, and left it to the local authorities to carry out the whole working of the scheme.  I do not think that is facing up to the question fairly and honestly.  I think the Minister has deliberately avoided what seems to me is his clear duty of formulating a purchase scheme.  And I believe the reason is that he felt any such scheme that he could conscientiously <Col N="413" /> recommend to this House would come as a disillusionment to the tenants of the labourers' cottages.  What will happen if the Bill becomes law is that certain local authorities will make certain schemes.  In certain districts they will make wholly uneconomic schemes that would involve the rates in intolerable burdens.  Such schemes the Minister will refuse, and send back for revision, and that will go on indefinitely. I doubt when the whole job is done whether many labourers will buy their cottages at all because they will find that the terms of the scheme that the Minister's Department would approve are so onerous that it would be better for them to stay as they are. I would like to hear the Minister on that.  I think we are entitled to ask the Minister why he did not undertake to formulate a regular scheme of purchase. Why is it left to the local authorities?  I think he is bound to state authoritatively now, having had ample time to consider the question in all its bearings, whether, in his view, it will be possible for the tenants of labourers' cottages to buy out their cottages on the instalment plan without paying a larger weekly sum than is represented by their present rent.  The labourers are entitled to that information. When we have got that information, we shall be better able to judge as to whether this Bill should pass or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Dillon, I should like to say that this is the last act of what I regard as one of the most dishonest campaigns ever carried out in this country&mdash;a campaign deliberately started for the purpose of getting cottage holders to believe that legislation would be passed by the Fianna Fáil Government which would make them the owners of their homes and benefit them to a very large extent.  I am satisfied that many members of the Party opposite lent themselves to that campaign before they realised that it was not possible to carry out the promises that were made.  So far as I am personally concerned, I can claim that I was as anxious as anybody in the House or outside it to see the workers become the owners of their houses, but I <Col N="414" /> opposed this campaign and this scheme for the purchase of labourers' cottages from the very outset.  I opposed it in my own county where, I may say, the campaign was started and carried on most enthusiastically.  I am satisfied that, as a result of that opposition of which I made no secret, I lost hundreds of votes.  I told the cottage tenants at that time that, notwithstanding the flowery speeches and promises, there was going to be no legislation that would confer any benefit upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached the final stage of this measure and, when the Bill becomes law, it will mean that an additional burden of £17,000 a year will be placed on the cottage tenants.  That is the end of the campaign which was carried on over a number of years and that is the fulfilment of the promises which were made.  Those who led the tenants into that campaign and helped to organise them are not so eager to-day to reveal the way in which the tenants have been fooled but, even already, I think most of the tenants realise that this Bill will confer no real benefit upon them.  We do not know yet what the exact nature of the schemes will be, but we do know that there is to be a reduction, taking the average, under the Bill of 3½d. per week per cottage.  As against that, there is to be responsibility for repairs carried out, not as the tenant himself considers necessary, but according to instructions by the engineer to the local authority.  Anybody who goes to the trouble of examining the proportions of the liabilities borne by the three parties&mdash;the State, the local authority, and the tenant&mdash;will see that, allowing for the 25 per cent. reduction, and taking into consideration repairs to the extent of £50,000, which was the sum for 1930, but which does not, in the opinion of some of us, represent the amount which should have been spent on repairs, the tenants are going to be saddled with an additional sum of over £17,000 a year.  The House is to be asked to pass this Bill, while the majority of the members know that it is not going to confer any benefit on the tenants.  If the members of the Government Party were free on this matter and if Party discipline had not been enforced, the Bill <Col N="415" /> would, I think, have been a much better one than it is.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Dillon is one of the most important that will arise in connection with these schemes. But the Minister, even if he had the will, has not the power to set this matter right at this stage.  The Minister is not now in a position to move an amendment in the Seanad and to bring it back to us, even if he desired to do so.  If the Minister desires to settle this question of title, he will have to go to the trouble of introducing an amending Bill.  I believe it is necessary to do that and I hope he will do so. The Minister expresses dissent.  I hope he will be able to satisfy us that there is no necessity for an amending Bill.  I do not think that any member of the House would agree that the tenant should pay his annuity for 20 years and, at the end of that time, if the contract were broken, that he should get no compensation whatever for his 20 years' payment.  That appears to be the position under the Bill and I think it is unfair.  If the Bill be strictly enforced, the tenant can very easily be deprived of his cottage&mdash;much more easily, so far as I know, than any other person could be deprived of his house or holding or have his contract terminated.</P>
    <P>The point I want to emphasise is this: here are poor cottage tenants who, like many other sections of the community, put their faith and trust in the Party opposite.  That Party said, &ldquo;Support us and we will see that you are all right, that your house will become your own without any fine. Financially you will be better off, and you will have more security,&rdquo; but the net result is that they are going to be saddled with a bigger burden than ever before.  I do not believe that there is a cottage tenant who, if he properly understood the terms of the Bill, would not say to the Government, &ldquo;We prefer to carry on as we are; we are, perhaps, better off than if the Bill were passed.&rdquo;  I myself believe that they are much better off than they will be under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, in fact, that before any Bill was produced <Col N="416" /> here, there was an opinion in the minds of a number of people, not confined to any one Party in this House, that it would not be wise for the cottage tenants to change their present status for any purchase scheme.  I have had that view put to me very forcibly by members of the Labour Party, by members of the present Opposition, and also by one or two members of our own Party, who said that no matter what scheme would be brought into this House, and without doing injustice to the three parties concerned&mdash;the present cottage tenants, the ratepayers and the taxpayers&mdash;there would not be or could not be an improvement in the present position of the cottage tenants.  That view is very strongly held by a number of people of this House, and probably by a number of people outside the House. But in the last few years I met deputation after deputation of cottage tenants, and I put frankly, fully and clearly before these deputations what, without doing an injustice to the ratepayers or taxpayers, it was likely we could do by way of a purchase scheme for the cottage tenants.  I was pressed by those representatives of the organisation of cottage tenant-holders to bring in a purchase scheme.  I have in the last few weeks received resolutions from a number of branches of that organisation in various parts of the country, stating that the purchase scheme as set out in the Bill was not satisfactory to them.  I did not expect to hear anything else, but they wanted me to push the purchase scheme ahead and get it carried, and the sooner the better.  I have had a number of such resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly know that it would be difficult to get unanimity in any organisation such as the Cottage Tenants' Organisation, or in similar circumstances in an organisation of small or large farmers if they had something of this kind going through the House, say a Land Bill or a Bill for better housing or anything of that kind; you would find that you would never have unanimity.  You would never get any organisation to say to any Government that the Bill brought in was a magnificent Bill, that it did all they wanted, and that the sooner it was passed the better.  You would never <Col N="417" /> arrive, no matter what stage of civilisation we got or what state of political development we got in this country or perhaps in any other country, at the position where you would get substantial agreement or unanimity on any matter of that kind.  But from what evidence I have had before me, I believe that there is fairly substantial agreement amongst those most interested that, first of all, a cottage tenant purchase scheme is desirable, and that, though this scheme will not satisfy all the demands of a great number, still that it will be useful financially to the cottage tenants. There will be, I am sure, many people, perhaps cottage tenants, too, who will say, when the scheme has been drafted by the Board of Health, submitted to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, sanctioned by the Minister, sent back and promulgated in the county and submitted to the tenants, that it is not satisfactory. There will be many tenants who will examine the scheme and seeing what the consequences to them are compared with their present position, say: &ldquo;We are as well off as we are and we will not change.&rdquo;  I do not think the majority will be of that way of thinking.</P>
    <P>In reference to what Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Dillon said, I have a few words to say.  Deputy Morrissey in particular talked about the dishonesty of the campaign in regard to the cottage tenant purchase scheme. I must say this, that before I ever came into this House, I heard a demand that a cottage purchase scheme should be brought in.  That demand was not started by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest for a moment that the campaign started since this Government came into office. I know that the campaign was started long before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably true, and Deputy Morrissey is probably in a better position than I to know that.  He was more closely interested in matters concerning such people in rural areas.  It was only after Fianna Fáil was established that the matter was brought to my <Col N="418" /> notice.  Looking into it I find that as far back as 1925-26, a cottage tenant purchase scheme had actually been drafted by at least two counties.  These schemes were never put into operation. Before Fianna Fáil came into existence and long before I came into this House a campaign for a purchase scheme was going on through the country.  I think Fianna Fáil has got a greater percentage of cottage tenant backing through the country, for very good reasons, than any other Party, including the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied we will hold them and gain more of them. There is not the slightest doubt about it, because despite the criticism passed on this Bill we are conferring very considerable benefits on the cottage tenants.  I do not admit that they will have to pay more.  That is not the question.  Let us say they will have to pay more in paying their instalments and doing their own repairs than they are paying at present.  Let us say that it will be slightly more, but even so, is it not a good bargain for them to pay even a small sum more?  In many cases it will be less than their present rents. But even if it is slightly more these men will become at a date not far distant the owners in fee of their own cottages and plots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No; some of them will be owners in ten years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will become owners according to the date of the building of the cottage.  That will be 15, 20 or 25 years from now.  Some of them have been paying rent for the last 45 years, and they do not own a brick in their cottages or a square foot of their own plots.  Now they can and will become the owners of their own cottages.  The present owners or their immediate family will become the owners of the cottages and plots.  That is something to be thankful for.  As I have said before more than once, it is good policy to make cottage tenant holders and as many others as possible <Col N="419" /> the owners of their own houses.  That is one way of defeating subversive social propaganda, propaganda subversive of the State and of religion, and on fundamental matters it is giving people of the kind who are vulgarly called the &ldquo;have nots,&rdquo; something substantial of their own.  Holding out to them to become property holders in their own land is something substantial.</P>
      <P>There will be a saving on the outlay by the local authorities of £24,556, and the tenants' rent will be reduced by £32,356.  Added to the tenants' rents will be the cost of repairs.  To be quite frank, in some cases these annual repairs in the case of the older houses may add slightly to the present rents, but in the vast majority of cases that will not be so.  If we bear in mind the fact that, before the scheme of purchase comes into operation and before the tenants are to pay their first purchase instalments, these cottages will have to be put in such state of repair as will satisfy the Minister and his Department, it will be seen that the matter of repairs will not make much of a difficulty.  That aspect of the matter has to be taken into account.  The people in some counties may be slow to avail of the purchase scheme, but it is better in the interests of the tenant that the scheme should be slowly put into operation rather than that the tenants should be saddled with cottages that are not in a proper condition to be taken over by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boards of health would be well advised to spend the money as soon as possible, put the houses in good habitable condition, put the scheme into operation, and hand the cottages over under the instalment scheme to the tenants.  It will save the ratepayers and the taxpayers, though not very much in the latter case.  The taxpayers will practically have to go on as they are until the purchase scheme is concluded. It will save the ratepayers considerably more than the taxpayers.  It will certainly save the cottage tenant in some cases and to some extent.  At any rate, he will have the feeling that, with every week's instalment he pays towards the complete ownership, he will be coming nearer to the day when <Col N="420" /> he can say that the house and piece of land, whatever its size, is his, and that neither he nor his family can be removed from it.  There is a considerable psychological as well as a social value in that.</P>
    <P>I went into the question of the difficulties of formulating a scheme for every county on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage of the Bill. There are differences in the ages of the cottages, the rents of the cottages, the terms under which loans were granted at different times to the local authorities and the rates of interest&mdash; there are peculiar differences in every county.  It was not found possible, or even advisable, to put into the body of the Bill or by way of a schedule anything in the nature of a cut-and-dried scheme.  We have the general outlines of a scheme already hammered out and these will be supplied to the secretary of every board of health, or anybody else who wishes to have them.  The boards of health will be asked to formulate their scheme with the information at their disposal and the help they will get from the Department of Local Government.  They will be in a position to take into account local circumstances and to try to make the schemes fair between the different classes of tenants who pay different rents.  When what is regarded by both parties as a fair scheme, for the cottage tenants and for the ratepayers, has been drafted, with the help that we will willingly give to the board of health, such scheme will be passed and sanctioned by the Minister and can then be put into operation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the scheme has been criticised, that people like Deputy Dillon, Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Brennan, and Deputies on the Labour Benches have taken such an interest in the matter and criticised it.  It is all to the good, so far as the tenants are concerned. I certainly, as the Minister in charge of the Bill on behalf of the Government, do not want any cottage tenant, as it were, to buy a pig in a poke.  I should like the tenants to know what they are doing.  I believe they will be making a good bargain in buying the cottages and be doing a good thing for themselves and a good thing for the State.  But I should like <Col N="421" /> the disadvantages as well as the advantages to be known to everybody, so that the tenant, when making up his mind what he will do, will have the facts for and against before him. When the facts for and against are weighed by those primarily interested, namely, the cottage tenants, I believe that the vast majority of them will plump for the purchase of their cottage and plot.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy Dillon in the beginning of his speech as to the title.  I made a promise that I would examine carefully the matter of the difficulty of title raised by Deputy Dillon.  I had it examined by the experts, legal and otherwise, of the Department, and, having had it examined very fully by the legal experts of my Department, in consultation with the legal experts of the Land Commission, we could find no other way than that set out in the Bill for meeting the difficulties which are there.  There are unquestionably difficulties there.  But, with the peculiar title under which the tenant holds and will hold his property, it is not possible to make the holding in fee absolute, as is done in the case of the farmer when he gets a parcel of land from the Land Commission.  The cottage tenant will not be the owner, and cannot be the owner until the final instalment has been paid.  He is in a similar position to those who nowadays buy furniture on the hire-purchase system.  He will not be the owner, and the house and plot can be taken from him if he fails to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the comparison.  At any rate, the case of the tenant farmer and the case of the cottage tenant are not on all-fours and cannot be treated alike.  In the case of the tenant farmer he pays his full due to the State for his holding. The cottage tenant does not pay an economic rent, and he will not be paying a full economic price for his holding under this scheme.  You have the State and the ratepayers bearing a very considerable portion of the <Col N="422" /> burden, and the ratepayers must be safeguarded.  There must be such a grip held on the holding as will encourage the cottage tenant to make certain that he does not lapse in his payments.</P>
      <P>I have had to find fault frequently with boards of health for not exercising their proper authority in collecting the present rents of cottages all over the country.  In some areas, possibly due largely to the officials and the members of the boards of health, rents are very considerably in arrear, unnecessarily so, I believe. The boards of health have not pressed the tenants, as they should have done, to pay their rents.  Frequently the boards of health have been circularised, written to, and called upon by officials of the Department to press these tenants who are in arrear. Frequently they have pretended to do so, but have not done so, so that the arrears have been mounting up.  Very few tenants have been evicted.  What is true of the payment of the ordinary rents will certainly be true of the payment of the purchase instalments under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that there will be any injustice committed by the boards of health on the purchase tenants any more than there was an injustice committed by boards of health on tenants who failed to pay their ordinary rents. I would like to see all over the country a better spirit on behalf of boards of health in pressing tenants to pay their rents, and I would like to see tenants in some counties, where they are considerably in arrears with their rents, show a better public spirit in the way of meeting their liabilities.  I do not believe that any grave injustice at any rate will be done to any tenants by the public authorities who will have the administration of this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if he recollects another point that was raised, as to whether it would be desirable to insert in the purchase agreements some restraint on alienation, because we envisage cases where genuine labourers might be tenant purchasers and then alienate their cottages to people belonging to a class <Col N="423" /> for whom such cottages obviously were never intended.  The Minister said that he would look into that.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give us any information as to when he expects to bring this measure into operation and as to the areas likely to be prescribed?  Perhaps at this stage the Minister may not be able to tell us what quantity of turf he thinks will be available this season. I may say that there is a good deal of uneasiness in the country in connection with this measure.  There is a certain amount of forestalling going on at present, perhaps unnecessary forestalling.  The public mind is disturbed in regard to this measure, and it would be useful, I think, if the Minister could give us a statement that would help to set the public mind at rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been very fully discussed in the House.  I do not think any single aspect of it has been shown by the Minister to be likely to be of any use either in the way of the provision of employment in the turf industry or of any greater development in that industry. The Minister considers that the turf industry can be made the second largest industry in the country.  He indicated his ambitions and his ideas in that particular direction as early as May, 1932.  Since then he has had a number of years' experience of the turf industry generally, and of the operation of societies organised for the purpose of selling turf cooperatively. He has provided for these co-operative societies special railway rates.  Turf as a national fuel has been boosted in every possible way.  A special organisation has been set up to develop and control these societies.  To assist them, the Government started off by using large quantities of turf in Government offices, but in the last couple of years Government ardour in that direction has considerably abated, so that substantially less turf was used in Government offices last year than, say, two years before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been pointed out that the quantity of turf cut in 1934, the last year for which we have information on the subject, was over 200,000 tons less than the amount cut in the year immediately before the Minister <Col N="425" /> set out to make this the second largest industry in the country.  We have not the figures for 1935, but if we want to make a comparison for 1935, with the previous years, we do know that when we examine the amount of turf carried by the railways and other transport companies, we find that the amount of turf they carried in 1935 was less than the amount they carried in 1934, 1933 or 1932.  It is my firm conviction that this Bill, so far from doing any good to the turf industry, is going to injure a large number of people who have traditionally worked at the cutting and selling of turf in the past.  It is going to prevent them making the earnings out of turf that they made before.  We have very little idea yet as to the economic dislocation that all that is going to mean to those people; all that it is going to mean in the way of injuring the economic basis of their lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had his attention drawn to that fact by Deputies from various parts of the country in whose homes large quantities of turf were used in the past.  Deputies have mentioned that they took two full ricks of turf every year from certain turf-cutters. They are going to be prevented from buying turf in that way from these turf-cutters in any area in which the Minister applies this Act, except the people who have been cutting turf join in with a co-operative turf-cutting society.  The Minister has had Deputies from various constituencies giving their experience of the co-operative societies and their methods with turf.  It has been indicated to him that there are parts of the country where co-operative societies exist and where, instead of buying the turf available to these co-operative societies, persons had to go long distances into a neighbouring county to buy turf from old traditional turf-cutters and were satisfied not only to do that, but to pay higher rates in railway charges rather than be dependent upon the provision made for them by the local co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going to mean a very serious dislocation for people who have been traditionally in the turf-cutting industry and whose home <Col N="426" /> economy depends on the possibility of their being allowed to continue.  We have the extraordinary position that a farmer may have turbary enough to provide him for the next 20,40 or 50 years. He has been accustomed to burn his own turf year in and year out.  If now he wants coal, as many householders throughout the country do use coal, he cannot get the coal without buying turf with it although, as I have said, he might have enough turbary to do him for half a century.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us no idea yet as to the type or size or location of the area in which he is going to start his experiment.  A considerable time has passed since the Bill was introduced and there has been a considerable amount of discussion on it.  Is the Minister now in a position, as Deputy Morrissey asks, to mention any particular area which is going to be the first, or the first of a number of areas, to which this Bill is going to be applied?  Deputies would like to have some idea of what this measure is likely to entail.  On every stage of the Bill it was evident that the Minister had no clear objective when he started out; if you like, his objective has got less clear as the various Stages came along.  I should like to hear from him in what area he is first going to apply the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has asked for some indication when the Bill will be brought into operation. It is difficult to give that.  I can say that I hope it will not be necessary to operate it during the coming season. That, however, is no more than a hope, It may prove to be a realisable hope, but in the event of it being necessary to operate it, it will have to be done. Of course the question can only be determined when knowledge is available of the amount of turf in the hands of co-operative societies for disposal. It is quite possible that this year that quantity will not be more than we will be able to dispose of by ordinary methods without the use of the powers under this Bill.  Assuming that not to be the case, I would say that the Bill will be brought into operation somewhat after the commencement of the fuel-purchasing season, because I think we will have to allow the season some <Col N="427" /> weeks to run, unless there is justification for not doing so, before making orders.  Possibly, however, we may get through this year without having to use the powers in the Bill at all.</P>
      <P>Last season we were apparently faced with a situation in which there was more turf available than was likely to be disposed of, and for a period at the beginning of the season it looked as if a surplus might be carried over to this year.  Then came the threatened coal strike in Great Britain and the rise in coal prices that occurred resulted in all the available turf being disposed of without difficulty.  There are a number of factors which will influence the situation.  I already indicated that the intention was to apply the provisions of the Bill in the areas where turf is produced, where it is most commonly used and where it is most economic to use turf, having regard to its price in relation to the price of coal.  One would naturally try not to keep these areas too small because, if they were kept too small, the proportion of turf to be used in relation to coal might have to be fixed too high.  But, on the general principle of applying the provisions of the Bill in these areas first, while at the same time endeavouring to ensure that the obligations imposed on merchants or consumers in any area will not be too onerous, the size of the areas and the provisions of the orders will be determined.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Mulcahy said, that we have had a number of years' experience of the problems associated with the large-scale commercial production and marketing of turf.  I think we have gained very valuable experience. I think there is available now a body of information relating to the commercial winning of turf and its sale which is entirely new, so far as this country is concerned, and, in some respects, so far as turf production in any country is concerned, and all that experience is being availed of for the purpose of devising ways and means of dealing with the matter of increasing turf production and improving turf distribution in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other points raised by Deputy Mulcahy were all of a nature which <Col N="428" /> was by no means new.  They were all discussed, I think, at considerable length on the various Stages of the Bill.  Again I say, even at the expense of repetition, that there is nothing in the Bill which prevents persons buying turf from individual turf producers, nor do I think the Bill is likely to operate in any way to discourage people from doing so.</P>

      <P>I am referring to such an area.  Where a man has turbary of his own and uses turf mainly as a fuel in his own household, he is provided for by the provisions of the Bill which enable him to purchase coal in quantities of two cwts. and less without having to purchase turf along with it. All the difficulties which Deputies have foreseen in the operation of the measure will prove to be non-existent when it comes to be applied.  I grant you there are going to be difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they will be difficulties of a somewhat different character, if my anticipations are realised.  I think we can satisfy ourselves that with the powers of this Bill we can create an important industry which will be of very great benefit to the areas of the country in which it will be located.  The bog areas are, generally speaking, the poorest parts of the country.  People residing in these areas have always had a very hard struggle to make a livelihood and, if the provisions of this Bill or the operation of a general turf scheme afford them an opportunity of earning by their work in the bog a reasonable livelihood, then I think the trouble we will have in overcoming the difficulties associated with that work will be well repaid, and I think we can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the turf development of the future takes the form of extension of the co-operative society system and of the production of hand-won turf, or whether it takes the form of mechanised production such as is being attempted now, or some other form&mdash;there are <Col N="429" /> many possibilities in that regard&mdash;the full benefit of the additional trade which will be created will go to the people residing in the bog areas.  They have been a problem in the past, but <Col N="430" /> they will cease to be a problem if this profitable employment is made available for them in their own localities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  On the 17th May, 1933, I referred to the Prices Commission the question whether unreasonably high retail prices were being charged throughout Saorstát Eireann for bread, wholesale or retail, made from wheaten flour or wheaten meal. The Commission, in pursuance of that requisition, carried out an investigation and made a report, dated 21st August, 1935, which has been laid before the Oireachtas.  The Commission reported on the price of fancy as well as on the prices of batch bread, and found that both wholesale and retail prices of batch bread were, in a number of cases, unreasonably high, but that the prices of fancy bread, save where sold retail in a baker's shop, were not excessive.  They also drew attention to the fact that there was a considerable difference between prices charged for bread in different areas, and they considered that there was no justification for such difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission made a recommendation that the price of bread should be calculated by reference to the price of flour, and they set out in their report a scale of charges which they deemed reasonable and which might not, justifiably, be exceeded.  In accordance with the provisions of the <Col N="431" /> Control of Prices Act, the Commission, as a first step towards fixing the maximum prices mentioned in the report, issued a public notice, under Section 25 of that Act, stating that the prices indicated by them should not be exceeded throughout the Saorstat and requiring bakers to reduce their prices before a date in August, 1935.  That notice was ignored by bakers in general, and the Commission, accordingly, recommended that I should make an Order under the Control of Prices Act fixing the maximum retail and wholesale prices of the commodity in question, and that such Order should apply to the entire area of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>Certain legal difficulties, however, arose in giving effect to the recommendation of the Prices Commission. The principal of these difficulties was that the Control of Prices Act gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce no power to fix the price of flour, and, secondly, the Commission had been asked to report upon the price of bread and reported on both batch bread and fancy bread, which are, in effect, two different commodities.  These difficulties, which arose in connection with the Commission's report on bread, were of a character similar to other difficulties which arose out of other investigations carried out by the Prices Commission, as a result of which it was decided to introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Control of Prices Act, and these proposals are now being prepared and will, in due course, be submitted to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It was considered, however, that the question of bread prices was one of urgency, and that a special Bill dealing with that matter should be brought forward, it being considered that, in any event, it was desirable that there should be on the Statutes of the Dáil an Act conferring powers to regulate the price of bread, which could be utilised whenever circumstances seemed to require the exercise of such powers&mdash; bread being put in that important position by reason of its importance in the dietary of the people.  This Bill, therefore, is being submitted to the Dáil.  It is, as Deputies who have read it are aware, merely an enabling Bill.  It provides <Col N="432" /> that the maximum prices at which bread may be sold in any specified area may be fixed by order.  Different prices may be fixed for different kinds of bread and for different methods of delivery, such as delivery in the baker's shop, delivery in a retail shop, or delivery to a householder at his own door.  As flour is not only the main factor in the cost of the loaf, but is also subject to frequent variations in prices, it is proposed, in making the Order, to relate the price of the loaf to the prevailing price of bakers' flour.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the publication, from time to time, of a standard price of flour in relation to which the price of bread will be fixed. In arriving at such standard price of flour, the Flour Milling Advisory Committee, established under the Cereals Act of 1933, will be consulted. Certain consequential provisions had to be made in order to ensure that the main purpose of the Bill would be effected.  In fact, the two matters to which I have referred give, in broad outline, the purport of the measure. Firstly, a standard price for flour is to be determined and published. In relation to that standard price, the maximum price which may be charged for bread under various circumstances may be fixed by Order. However, in order to prevent a reduction in the weight of the loaf, consequent upon a reduction in prices made in pursuance of an Order. made under the Bill it was found necessary to provide special powers as regards the weight of the loaf.  According to the existing law bread must be sold by weight, and it would be difficult to detect the offence of overcharging so long as bread was sold in weights involving fractions of a pound, particularly in the case of vanmen, who are not obliged to weigh bread for customers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives to the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to prohibit the sale of bread otherwise than in loaves of 1 lb. in weight or multiples of 1 lb.  The services of weights and measures inspectors will be availed of to ensure that Orders made under that section are observed.  The detection of the offence of overcharging will be in the hands of members of the <Col N="433" /> Gárda Síochána, who will not, however, be concerned with the weight of the bread, but will assume that the loaf is expressed to be sold in terms of pounds weight, and who will report on the prices charged as a price per pound.  Penalties for offences under the Bill are set out in Section 7.  I stated that I considered it desirable that an Act providing the powers contemplated by this Bill should be on the Statute Book, irrespective of the circumstances; powers that could be used at any time if circumstances called for their use.  Obviously, it is desirable we should enact such a measure, when we had from the Prices Commission a report, which indicates that during the period covered by their investigation, at any rate, in certain parts of the country, an unreasonably high price prevailed for bread.  It is quite true that that situation did not exist in all areas.</P>
    <P>In the City of Dublin, for example, the price charged during the period covered by the investigation was in conformity with the price fixed by the Prices Commission, having regard to the price of flour prevailing during that period.  In other areas&mdash;the Commission made particular reference to the City of Cork&mdash;the price of bread was considered by them to be unduly high and, consequently, if that situation is not changed by the time the Bill becomes law, I would propose to make use of the powers conferred in it, in order to fix such maximum prices as would be justified by the circumstances then existing, that is by the price of bakers' flour then prevailing. The Commission set out their opinion of the various allowances that should be made to cover expenses additional to the price of flour, which arise in the production and distribution of bread, and also for the margin of profit which should be allowed the baker.  It is true that some bakers expressed the opinion at the time the Commission published the notice in August of last year, that the price contemplated by the Commission would not be sufficient to yield them a profit. Some of them even said that bread baked and sold at these prices would be sold at a loss.  I must say that I was by no means convinced by the <Col N="434" /> representations they made, but I draw attention to the fact, that in many parts of the country the price contemplated by the Commission was, in fact, the prevailing price, and in some parts the prevailing price was even lower than the maximum price the Commission thought justifiable.  On that account, it is difficult to understand why in particular areas higher prices should be charged.  Possibly, the price of bread in all areas will be rectified by the action of the Bakers' Association before the Bill becomes law, in which case the powers of the Bill will not be utilised.  It is desirable to have them in any event, so that any upward movement not justified by circumstances in the price of bread could be checked.</P>
    <P>For the sake of clarifying the position for Deputies, I should say that if it were considered necessary to use the powers conferred in the Bill, and to make an order fixing the price of bread, I would propose, of course, to fix these maximum prices in accordance with the calculations adopted by the Commission and in accordance with their recommendations as to how these prices should be related to the standard price of bakers' flour.  I am aware that members of the Commission, to which were added for the purposes of this investigation five additional members, whose names are set out in the report, went into this matter with great thoroughness, spent considerable time on the investigation, and prepared the report with great care, having satisfied themselves that their recommendation was a just one, and that bread sold at the price fixed by them, have regard to the price of flour at that time, would be sold at a fair price and give a fair profit to the bakers.  In my opinion, nothing which was said in the Press at the time in any way shook that contention.  It was my conviction that their conclusions were sound and were supported by the fact that they bore a great similarity to the conclusions of the Food Prices Tribunal which was established in 1926 and reported in the following year.  Their method of approach to an examination of bread prices was similar to that adopted by <Col N="435" /> the present Commission, and their conclusions were much the same.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the cities some part of the uneconomic cost of bread, particularly when delivered to householders, is due to overlapping in the systems of distribution adopted by various bakers.  It is difficult to contemplate the rationalisation of the method of distribution as a result of State action.  The Master Bakers' Association in Dublin have stated that they have given the matter very close attention, and have been unable to devise a satisfactory system of preventing unnecessary overlapping in distribution, but it is obviously a matter that should be tackled by them in the first instance, because the intervention of the State would be fraught with considerable difficulties, and I doubt if it would lead to satisfactory results.  If, however, we provide a reasonable margin to cover costs of distribution, as is proposed by the Commission, then I think no difficulty will arise on that score, and, in any event, if bread is available for sale retail in shops, whether shops belonging to bakers or ordinary shops, at a fair price, and if the public are safeguarded against undue profiteering, that should be the main purpose of this legislation which I recommend to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears before the House this evening in the rôle, more or less, of a Rip Van Winkle.  He is dealing with a measure that was the subject of investigation by a Commission set up by him in May, 1933, and that reported in the case of Cork, and on the cost of wheaten flour, some time in July, 1934. That report lay in the Minister's office until October, and was printed and circulated in December, 1934.  As the Minister stated, the Commission began their investigations in 1933 and reported on the price of bread in August, 1935.  That report was printed in February of this year, but we had to wait until June to see it.  We had to wait to see the report until the Minister introduced here a measure dealing with bread prices.  In the meantime the people who are paying <Col N="436" /> for flour and the people who are paying for bread have, to the knowledge of the Minister, every member of his Government and every responsible official in his Department, been paying hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they should be paying for a commodity that is one of the essentials of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes out from time to time a cost-of-living index figure. In making out that cost-of-living index figure he takes into consideration the part that expenditure on bread and flour plays in the domestic budget of people whose expenditure he is considering. The expenditure on bread and flour is something slightly more than ten per cent. of the total domestic expenditure on the articles, the price of which goes to make up the cost-of-living index figure.  The report on bread was in the Minister's hands about five or seven months before it was actually printed.  At the time it was actually printed, the position in regard to the price of flour in this country was that Senator Total could state in the Seanad that flour could be bought at 4/6 per cwt. or 11/3 per sack less in Northern Ireland than in the Free State.  If the difference between the cost of flour in Northern Ireland and the Free State was only 10/- per sack, it would mean that the people of the Free State on their consumption of flour would be paying £1,350,000 more per annum than they would have to pay if they were living on the other side of the Border.  The circumstances were that between July, 1934, when the first report on flour was issued, and February, 1936, when the report on bread was sent for printing, the cost of household flour in Dublin had risen by 11/6 per sack. For flour alone, used either as such or as the basis for bread-making, the people of the Free State were paying £1,350,000, perhaps £1,500,000, more than they would have to pay if they were living on the other side of the Border.  Not only were they paying that during the last couple of years while the Minister was sleeping over the information he had got from the committee he set up, but he also knew from the report that was made to him in July, 1934, that the millers who are <Col N="437" /> handling this flour were responsible unnecessarily for a very considerable part of the overcharge.  The report states on page 35 that the millers in the first quarter of the year 1934 made £34,640 more in profits than the committee considered reasonable.  That report has been with the Minister since July, 1934.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from other matters involving an increase in the price of flour, the millers were making exorbitant profits, profits above those which the committee thought reasonable.  As well as that, the Minister apparently has been in full possession of information that bakers are making unreasonable profits.  If may recollection is right, the answer of some of the bakers to the suggestion that they should reduce their prices, which were considered unreasonably high, was that they further increased the price of bread. There have been cases where either on the eve of getting a recommendation that they should reduce the price of bread, or on the morrow of getting it, they raised the price of bread 1d. and the Minister has been a Rip Van Winkle all the time since July, 1934.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had documentary evidence of the fact that it does.  A situation exists now that did not exist then, and it is that the people of the Free State are paying £1,500,000 more for the flour they consume than they would have to pay if they were living on the other side of the Border.  There was no circumstance like that existing at the time. The Minister in introducing this Bill has kept very carefully away from dealing with any figures with regard either to the cost of bread now or the cost of bread, as he thinks it should be.  The Minister's attitude in regard to the Bill is that it is going to be used <i>in terrorem.</i>  He gives the House the impression that he feels it can only be useful <i>in terrorem</i> rather than in actual application.  He introduces this measure and says that he hopes that by the time it is passed it will not be necessary to use it. He does not make any attempt to explain what is his attitude on the present price of flour or why it is that the 4lb. loaf should cost 10d. in Dublin while it can be sold in the city of London for 7½d.  He does not make any comment on the observation which the Commission has made, that they see no reason why there should be any difference in the price of the 4lb. loaf in cities such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dublin.  It has actually been pointed out by the Commission, at the time they were reporting, that the price of the 4lb. loaf in Cork and Waterford was 10d., in Dublin 8½d., and in Limerick 8d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Since we have got that, the 4-lb loaf in Dublin has gone up three-halfpence, and in Cork it has gone up one penny. The Minister introduced this Bill in general terms.  It is a kind of enabling Bill, like the Turf Bill.  Again, like the Turf Bill, he hopes he will not have to use the Bread Bill this year.  Will the Minister tell us the point to which he considers the 4-lb loaf should be bought, in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, that would, to his mind, obviate the necessity for applying this measure in these cities this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister how he is going to control the price of bread.  Will he control the price charged to the shopkeepers by the bakers, or the price the shopkeepers charge to the consumer?  I want to make this case to the Minister.  I am going to go on the assumption that this Bill is not purely fraudulent, that it is not brought in for the purpose of deceiving the people of Dublin into the belief that the Minister is solicitous about the price of bread to the consumer, in order to get votes for his supporters at the Dublin municipal elections. Let me assume that the Minister is in earnest but is misled by those upon whom he depends for advice.  On what principle are they going to reduce the price of bread to the consumers in Dublin, and the country, and at the same time collaborate with the Executive Council in carrying through their wheat scheme?  Again I want to make this clear.  The cereal legislation is entirely independent of such measures as have been taken, and were necessary, to protect the milling industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effective steps could be taken to protect the milling industry in this country and the result of that would be to raise the price of flour in this country, as compared with world prices, by about 3/-.  I believe, taking into account tactical defence considerations, from the point of view of the country as a whole, and the social conditions, that a powerful case could be made for taking such steps as were necessary to maintain the Irish flour mills in production. But it cannot be too strongly emphasised that whatever steps were <Col N="440" /> necessary to do that could be carried into effect at the expense of a rise in the price of flour of from 2/- to 3/- per sack.  But then the Government confused the issue by introducing the cereals legislation requiring the millers to use a certain proportion of Irish wheat.  They further confused the situation by introducing a maize-meal mixture scheme, which is largely operated by the millers, who are also flour millers.  There you have a situation in which the price of flour in this country is raised by 11/- per sack as compared with world prices.  I see the Chair is a little alarmed on hearing me alluding to the maize-meal scheme.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But I am making a case that when millers complained of the Minister for Agriculture's Cereals Act and contended that it made the price of the mixture too high, they were told that they could make up the difference by increasing the price of flour, and that they could make representations to the Flour Millers' Association meeting, where the prices of flour are fixed for Saorstát Eireann.  At any rate we have the situation in which the millers in this country are getting 11/- a sack more for flour than in England and in Northern Ireland.  Messrs. Joseph Rank are getting 11/- a sack more for the flour he mills in Limerick than for the flour he mills in Liverpool.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that is misleading.  In Great Britain there is a system under which the miller pays into the pool 4/6 levy, in order to <Col N="441" /> finance the purchase of British wheat Joseph Rank is one of the greatest millers in the world, and sells flour all over the world.  With Spillers it is the same.  They direct the entire milling power of Great Britain, and if the truth is known I think Rank controls Spillers as well, but I am not sure of that.  His export price is the price at which we could buy flour in Liverpool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Mrs. Concannon is much longer in the Fianna Fáil Party she will realise that if she wants to maintain her reason she will have to stand on her head.  I want the House to bear in mind that the millers are required to use a certain percentage of native wheat, but there is no stipulation that native wheat is to be used in equal quantities in baker's flour and shop flour.  What is happening is that the millers are using native wheat, exclusively, in shop flour.  Of that I am sure.  The majority of the millers are using none of the native wheat in baker's flour, with the result that they are manufacturing baker's flour out of raw material as cheaply as Joseph Rank and Spillers buy in Liverpool. Admittedly they are operating in smaller units, and in some cases in inland mills, which means additional freight charges.  Allowing 3/- a sack for that extra charge they could manufacture flour for 3/- per sack more than Joseph Rank, but they are getting 11/- a sack more for that flour.  They have to use native wheat in certain proportions which the Minister fixed; but it will be used in the shop flour.  They make the case that they have to take this wheat, dry it and prepare it, and what they make on baker's flour they <Col N="442" /> lose on shop flour, and it all comes out in the wash in the end.  The fact is that the increased price of bread exclusively results from the increased price of flour to the baker who has to buy flour.  Certain Deputies will remember that there are bakers in this city who are themselves millers.  In fact, I think most of the bakers of the city are themselves millers but, in rural Ireland, very few bakers are millers.  A rough guide is that 7/6 in the sack of flour represents an increase of a penny in the quartern loaf.</P>

I saw the Minister being made a fool of on the Insurance Bill and I sympathise with him because insurance is a highly technical business and he could not be expected to understand it.  I hope he now realises what an infant he is amongst people who understand the <Col N="443" /> trade and how he can be used as an unconscious tool to do substantial injustice.  The poor man is acting in good faith.  It is just that he does not know what he is doing.  He reminds me of a child who starts fiddling with a 50-guinea watch. When he has broken the balance, he goes to daddy and says, &ldquo;See, daddy, what I have done!&rdquo; Daddy does not enjoy this demonstration of his prowess at all.  I am sure that Deputy Tom Kelly's constituents would not admire the Minister's intervention if the Deputy were to go down and tell them that it involved an increase of 1½d. in the quartern loaf.</P>

I asked Deputy Kelly and Deputy Briscoe to go down and tell them that they proposed to put 1½d. on the quartern loaf and Deputy Kelly said that he knew the people there for 40 years and he thought he was safer where he was.  I think he is right. Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce seriously tell me that he is prepared to sanction an increase of 1½d. in the price of the quartern loaf for every 4/- increase in the price of flour?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister is discharging his duty.  I think the House is entitled to know what he proposes to do and from whom he proposes to get advice. I say now that if the Minister will take 11/- off the price of flour, he can probably order every baker in this country to reduce the price of the quartern loaf by 1½d.  If he takes 7/6 of the price of flour, he can probably order them to reduce the price of the quartern loaf by 1d. <Col N="444" /> Unless he does that, if he orders them to reduce the price of bread, he will, on his own admission, be ordering them to make bread without profit. The price of flour is about 36/- ex-mill. I have not seen the price for about ten days and my memory is not quite clear.  The price of bread, so far as I am aware, is 5d. per 2lb. loaf in the city of Dublin.  Deputies will bear in mind that that is a price off which a discount is allowed to bread distributors by the bakers.  The price of bread in North Roscommon is 8/- per dozen 2lb. loaves and it is selling across the counter at 4½d.  There, competition is extremely keen.  On the other hand, the expense of distribution is probably not as high as in the city.  Let me put this fact before the House, because it has to be realised if you are going honestly to examine the price of bread in the City of Dublin.  The people of Dublin bring part of the comparatively high cost of bread upon their own heads because everybody in Dublin has got accustomed to having the bread van come to their door and deliver one or two loaves.  Anybody who has lived abroad knows that such a system does not obtain there.  In Paris, the woman of the house goes out in the morning to the local baker, buys what bread she requires and brings it home in her basket.  If you are living in America, you go to the bread shop, grocery store, or delicatessen, buy your bread and bring it home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not start to discuss bread lines, soup kitchens or free beef, because Deputy Mrs. Concannon begins to blush when we start talking about these things.  Let us stick strictly to bread.  If people want their bread delivered in single leaves at their hall-door, they have got to pay for that.  If they express their readiness to collect the bread at the baker's shop, they are entitled to an allowance for the trouble they are put to every morning in going to fetch it.  In rural Ireland, bread is bought by the consumers at a shop and they themselves carry it home.  There is no system of <Col N="445" /> delivering one loaf into anybody's house.  The bread is distributed through the medium of the smaller country shops.</P>
      <P>A lot of people are confused by the two separate systems which obtain for fixing the price of bread in rural Ireland as compared with the cities. In Cork and Dublin, the price of bread is always quoted on the basis of the retail selling price.  Those in the trade know that, in fact, what the baker gets is that retail selling price less the trade discount.  In rural Ireland, prices are quoted on the basis of the wholesale price to the small shopkeeper, who usually charges a halfpenny per 2-lb. loaf for distribution. When one hears that the price of bread is 5/- in Cork and 4/- in rural Ireland, one must remember that there is a discount of 12½ per cent. or 15 per cent. to be taken into consideration, which would leave the net price to the baker in Cork 4/2.  We know the price of bread to the baker in rural Ireland is 4/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had 15 years' experience of the bakery trade.  I suppose I could reduce my costs if I paid lower wages or if I employed more machinery.  Personally, I have always avoided that, I have avoided displacing men by machinery.  I admit that in more modern and up-to-date bakeries there can be economy in the way of overhead charges by displacing men and substituting for skilled craftsmen machine dough mixers and automatic dividers. The point I want to put to the Minister is this, that while we must insist that the price of bread is kept at the lowest figure consistent with manufacturing and distribution costs, we have to be careful that we do not go too far because in saving the people a ¼d. in the price of the 2-lb. loaf we might drive a number of highly-skilled and well-paid craftsmen out of a job altogether.  You can cut down the number of bakers very considerably by the introduction of up-to-date machinery, and you can replace the skilled men by common labourers.  If you are operating automatic dough-mixers and dividers you will not want very many skilled men.  You will only need a foreman and an oven-man and <Col N="446" /> the present trained craftsmen will disappear.</P>
    <P>Some of us in the bakery trade are still working by hand.  Other bakers do some of their work by machinery and the rest by hand.  There is a very small minority of bakers in this country who do the whole of the work by machinery.  I do urge on the Minister most strongly to remember that if he acquires the powers that he is seeking under this Bill, he should not depend exclusively on bureaucratic officials to administer the Act because its consequences can be altogether too serious and grave for a very large section of the community.  The purpose of this. Bill, if it is to be operated at all, should be to keep the price of bread at the lowest penny at which it can be efficiently produced.  If the price of flour remains as it is to-day, in my opinion you cannot take a ¼d. off the price of the loaf.  If, in spite of that, the Minister issues a ukase that a ¼d. or a ½d. must go off the loaf, what will happen is that the small bakers who are exclusively operating by hand will go to the wall and you will drive the larger bakers who are operating half by skilled men and half by machinery right over to machinery altogether.</P>
    <P>The number of skilled bakers will be immediately reduced and the whole of the business will be done by machinery.  In that case I do not think you will get as good quality bread as you are getting now.  You may get it a shade cheaper, but you will have driven a lot of trained craftsmen out of employment and destroyed a large number of small industries throughout the country.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that if he is going to lay down a flat price for bread whether it is manufactured by Peter Kennedy, of Dublin, who is a big baker, or by Pat Cawley in a country town who is baking six to ten sacks a week, the result will be that he will drive Pat Cawley to the wall and, it may be, out of business altogether. I remember a baker in Carrick-on-Shannon who baked only six sacks in the week and he always got 1d. a loaf more for his bread than his competitors got.  He did not press it on his customers, who gladly paid 1d. a loaf more for his superior product. <Col N="447" /> Now if we introduce a flat charge for everyone without regard to local conditions we may do a very grave injustice to a valuable element in our community who should not be interfered with in that way.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to fix the price of bread, I put it to him that he must take adequate precautions to ensure that the correct weight is given.  Deputies may forget that when they go to buy a 2 lb. loaf very few of them would be able to detect whether that loaf was 1½ ozs. under weight.  If I make one dozen loaves of bread that are under weight to the extent of 1½ ozs.  I have saved over a pound of bread in that dozen.  If I am selling bread at 4d. a lb., that is going to give me a profit over and above my legitimate profit of 4d. a dozen.  If a baker can get 4d. a dozen profit on bread, Deputies would be astonished at the figure that would reach in the whole year.  If a baker in Dublin could get 4d. a dozen on bread it might be worth up to £3,000 a year to him.  To the small baking-house in the country employing one or two men, 4d. a dozen on bread would be the difference between affluence and bankruptcy.  I am afraid that we cannot escape the fact that in certain cases where competition is keen, the full weight is not being given.  It is a very difficult thing to check the weight and to devise adequate formule for its checking.</P>
    <P>The baker ought to put 2 lbs. 3½ ozs. of dough into the 2 lb. loaf if he wants to give fair weight to the person who buys the loaf from him.  When that loaf comes out of the oven it ought to weigh 2 lbs. 1½ ozs. or 2 lbs. 1 oz., and it ought to weigh 2 lbs. ½ oz. at the end of 24 hours after coming out of the oven; after that time it ought to weigh 2 lbs.  If it does shrink then you cannot make the baker liable. There is going to be a pious aspiration expressed by vested interests throughout the country before very long as to this matter of eating hot bread, and we will have the suggestion that on this occasion steps should be taken to prohibit the sale of hot bread. That campaign is going to be supported by the most pious expressions of solicitude for the public health.  We <Col N="448" /> will be told that the digestive organs of the youth of the country are going to be destroyed by eating hot bread. The purpose of that is that no one will be able to check the weight of the bread&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it is cold.  If the Minister fixes the price of bread without fixing the weight of the loaves he is going to find that the whole business is going to become a farce, and, instead of this precaution becoming a protection for the public, it will become a snare.  How the Minister is going to secure that the proper weight of bread is given under the new price arrangements is a thing that I fail to see.  Even with the best intention of always securing that your bread will be the full weight, it is an extremely difficult thing to see that intention carried out.  How are you going to follow up the bread-vans around the country and take samples to ensure this?  Deputies may think that once the price of bread is fixed it will be all right.  That is not so.  The Minister can only fix the price of plain loaves. Fancy bread need not be sold by weight, and it would be impossible for the Minister to stipulate that it must be sold by weight without disorganising the whole bakery trade and doing very much damage to that industry. So long as fancy bread is left free from control I fail to see how you can make price-fixing effective.  I know, of course, that you can make anything effective against the person who wants to comply with the law, the person who, once the Minister makes an order, exerts himself to comply with it.  But there is the person who does not want to comply with the law and who wants to get the benefit of short weight.  I do not see how the Government can get at that person, because if he can be compelled to stick rigorously to the regulations governing plain bread, then he will simply go over into the sale of fancy bread and play fast and loose with that.  Personally, I think the Bill is a fraud, that fraud is written upon it from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  If there is 1d. extra on the price of bread here <Col N="449" /> over and above what the price of bread is in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, every fraction of that 1d. is due to the increased price of bakers' flour which results from the activities of the Minister and his colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I should like the Minister to clear up in regard to this Bill. Deputy Dillon referred to the price of bread in Dublin.  As far as I could understand the Minister's explanation of the Bill, he does not intend to interfere with the price of bread in Dublin.  I think the Minister said he intended, if he did make an order, to proceed on the lines of the Commission's report, and that they had reported that bread prices in Dublin were not excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time they reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there will probably be no change in Dublin.  The point I want to have cleared up is in regard to the intention as to the areas; whether the Minister proposes to fix the price for the whole State or divide it into several areas.  If the Minister intends to fix the price for the whole State, he may possibly defeat the object that he intends to achieve, because obviously he could not fix it at the irreducible minimum.  If he proceeds by areas, it may have the possible effect of raising the price in certain areas.  For instance, Deputy Dillon pointed out that in certain places bread is ½d. cheaper than in others, and other Deputies probably could do the same.  If, for instance, the Dublin area includes places within 30 or 40 miles of Dublin, where the smaller bakers are able to produce bread at less than the Dublin price, if the Minister fixes the maximum for that area at the price at which the Dublin bakers can produce it, it might mean that some of these smaller bakers would, in fact, be getting a higher price than they are charging at present.  I do not say that is going to happen, but I want the Minister to try to clear up the difficulty for me.  It appears to me that there will be a difficulty in operating the measure in regard to areas.  I more or less <Col N="450" /> agree with Deputy Dillon that any attempt made to regulate the price of bread or to reduce the price of bread, as long as flour cannot be considerably reduced in price, will end in failure.  However, there may be a little success achieved and, so far as this Bill can be successful in making bread cheaper, I certainly heartily support it.  I only hope that it will not prove to be difficult to operate in regard to the areas, and I should like the Minister to make some reference to his intention in regard to the areas when replying.</P>

      <P>A halfpenny for 3/9 is what the Food Prices Commission of 1926 stated.  However, let us come to the matters dealt with in the Bill. Deputy Mulcahy, of course, considers that we are open to criticism because we are only now acting upon a report received by us in August, 1935.  It is a fair retort, if not strictly relevant to the question, that the previous Government got a report in 1926 and did not act upon it at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only describe that statement in the expressive American term &ldquo;boloney.&rdquo;  In any event, in 1926 the price of bread was excessive, due to profiteering by the bakers&mdash;so a judicial committee, after taking evidence on the matter, reported&mdash;and nothing was done about it.  There has been some delay in this case, but I have explained the circumstances of the delay.  When we got the report of the Prices Commission recommending that an order should be made under the Prices Commission Act fixing the maximum price of bread, we proposed to do so.  We found, however, that there were legal difficulties which I have explained.  It took us <Col N="451" /> some time to satisfy ourselves that there was no way around these legal difficulties other than by the introduction of legislation.  We then proceeded to frame the legislation.  That was not an easy task, because the difficulties which had made it impossible to act under the Control of Prices Act also made it difficult to frame this Bill. We have got over these difficulties, however, and here it is.  I am quite satisfied that there has been no unreasonable or unnecessary delay in the taking of action upon the Prices Commission's report on the price of bread.</P>
      <P>Of course, most of the discussion we had has been related to the price of flour.  There are three things I want to say in relation to the price of flour, and then I will leave it.  In the first place, it is utterly dishonest to compare the present internal price of flour here with the export price of British flour, and any Deputy who does that can have no intention other than the intention of misleading.  Secondly, it is perhaps convenient for Deputies to forget the circumstances in relation to the flour-milling industry in Great Britain and in this country which prevailed formerly.  In 1931 the flour-millers of this country, having been refused protection by the Government then in office, made an arrangement with the British flour-millers under which the British flour-millers were guaranteed a market for flour in this country to the extent of approximately 2,000,000 sacks of flour per year, and the British flour-milling industry, which had been reorganised by the British Flour-millers' Association, was planned upon the basis of a production of 2,000,000 sacks of flour for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change of Government changed that situation.  The Irish millers' mutual arrangement with the British flour-millers was terminated and the importation of British flour into this country was stopped.  There were, therefore, thrown on to the British market those 2,000,000 sacks of flour which were intended for this country, and the British flour-milling trade journals were filled every week with paragraphs and articles concerning the <Col N="452" /> price-cutting which had been resumed in Great Britain.  Therefore, I say that any attempt to compare the prevailing price of flour here with the internal price in Great Britain is also invalid.  We could buy cheaper flour than we could make&mdash;there is no question about it.  We could buy flour from Canada and we could buy flour from France cheaper than we can make it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is not the same quality.  When Mr. Toal, or whoever it was Deputy Mulcahy quoted, stated that flour in Northern Ireland can be purchased at 11/- per sack cheaper than it can be purchased in the Free State, he was not referring to flour of the same quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we will not get on to that now.  I will go further and say this one other thing in relation to flour.  Deputy Mulcahy stated that the Prices Commission reported that in the first quarter of 1934 the flour-millers made a profit of £34,000 in excess of what the Prices Commission considered would have been a reasonable profit.  That statement can be made in a misleading manner, too, because the Prices Commission were referring to all the flour-millers, but they pointed out that some of the flour-milling companies did not make any profit at all, and that others of them made what the flour-millers considered to be a profit less than what would be regarded as reasonable.  The Prices Commission made a recommendation for meeting that situation by an arrangement for taking some of the excess profits made by the larger mills and distributing them as a subsidy to the smaller mills.  That was an arrangement which did not appeal to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, in relation to flour milling, a situation of considerable difficulty, and Deputies are not going to help us to solve that difficulty by these purely <Col N="453" /> propagandist statements which they are making.  I will admit at once that the price of flour here must be higher than the price at which we can import flour if we are going to grow our own wheat. I think it is a good policy to grow our own wheat.  I know that Deputy Dillon thinks that it is madness to do so.  I know that Deputies opposite have talked themselves into a position in which they do not believe it is happening; but, nevertheless, the majority of the people of this country, particularly the majority of the farmers, and certainly the Government of the country, consider that it is good national policy, viewed from any angle, to produce wheat to supply our own needs to whatever extent it can be done.  If we are going to produce wheat, and to guarantee a price in order to get it grown and to give to the farmers a fair return for their labours, then we have got to be prepared to pay more for our flour than the price at which we can buy flour from abroad, and it is worth doing it at that price.  Making all allowance for that, I am not satisfied with the price of flour, but in the circumstances in which you have big mills and small mills, port mills and country mills, it is not practicable to deal with the flour situation merely by fixing a price, and that is the whole difficulty of the position.  That is why the Prices Commission Report had to contain a recommendation for this rather unusual arrangement of taxing one class of miller in order to subsidise another, because they saw that any system which would fix a fair price for certain mills in the country, such as the big port mills, would result in a price level being enforced which would put all the other mills out of business.</P>
    <P>You can deal with that situation in a limited number of ways, all of which would involve very considerable changes.  We got from the flour-millers an assurance that they would fix a price for flour in accordance with the formula contained in the Prices Commission Report.  We have had for some time past very considerable doubts as to whether they were doing so or not, and the matter has been again under examination.  In so far as that examination has proceeded, I am satisfied that they are not doing it, and <Col N="454" /> that it will be necessary for us to take action in relation to the price of flour unless the flour-millers themselves adjust their prices to the Prices Commission formula.  But I cannot see any action which would be effective which does not involve a change in the ownership of these flour mills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is no basis upon which the price of flour can be fixed that will at the same time secure the preservation of a very large number of the small country mills, and I think it is desirable that these mills should be preserved.  However, we can discuss this flour question on another occasion.  I am merely indicating that there are these difficulties, and that these can best be met by the flour-millers themselves doing what they contracted to do, and that is voluntarily to adjust their prices on the basis of the formula contained in the Prices Commission Report.  If the flour-millers do not take that action it will be necessary to adopt another course which is going to involve very revolutionary changes in relation to the operation and control of the flour-milling industry here.</P>
      <P>Having said all that, I want to say now, for the purposes of this discussion, that the price of flour has got nothing whatever to do with it.  It is, of course, entirely fantastic to say that the price of bread, in so far as it is unduly high, is due to the price of flour when we have the Prices Commission Report saying that, in many parts of the country, the price of bread is unduly high because bakers are making undue profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the City of Cork and elsewhere.  I refer the Deputy to the Report of the Prices Commission. The Deputy also referred to the effect of a price-fixing Order on the smaller bakeries.  The outstanding fact in the report is that in the smaller towns the price of bread is not excessive, except in some of them, and that the problem of unduly high prices for bread is one that is very largely confined to the cities.  In any event, the Prices Commission <Col N="455" /> Report also deals with that question of smaller bakeries, and justifies the maximum price fixed in relation to towns being applied to the country also.  The Deputy spoke for about a quarter of an hour on the necessity for ensuring supervision over the weight of bread.  I think the provisions in the Bill are quite adequate for that purpose, but perhaps the Deputy has not read them.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else that I need say arising out of the discussion. The Bill, when it becomes an Act, will give us power to fix the price of bread.  We propose to exercise that power in accordance with the recommendation in the Report of the Prices Commission.  If a situation should exist at any time after the Bill becomes law which would justify its use, that is, if excessive prices for bread are being charged in any part of the Saorstát, and it is in our opinion desirable that the powers placed at the disposal of the Executive Council should be used, then those powers will be used when the occasion demands, having regard to the importance of bread in the ordinary lives of the people.</P>
