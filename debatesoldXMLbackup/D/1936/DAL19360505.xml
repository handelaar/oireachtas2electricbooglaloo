      <P>I would not say that no steps are taken, but there is such a variety of roads&mdash;widths and makes of roads&mdash;that it would require, I think, a fair-sized volume to give particulars of the costings of all the different types of roads&mdash;widths and lengths, different kinds of stone required, costs of stone, foundations of roads, and all that kind of material that might have to be available in making out costings.  The county surveyors do make up costings for themselves, for the information of their own county councils, from their wages books and their intimate knowledge of the particular road they are asking for a costing of in their particular county; but there are no statistics of general costings for the reasons I have given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  according to a survey of the town made in October, 1934, 88 houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> (2)  Since 1932, the town commissioners have provided two schemes of 13 and 18 houses respectively.  The 13-house scheme was completed in December, 1934.  The 18-house scheme was finished in March last.</P>
    <P>(3)  In the case of the 13-house scheme the town commissioners proceeded to let the houses without reference to the Department.  In the case of the 18-house scheme tenants have been selected and approved for 14 houses.  In the remaining four cases the commissioners have, up to the present, refused to carry out the Department's instructions.  In both schemes the houses were let before the issue of the final certificate by the engineer.  This certificate, however, is not normally issued until the expiration of approximately six months from the date of completion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>(4)  Both schemes have recently been inspected by a member of my engineering staff, and a number of minor defects have been reported.  Copies of the inspector's reports will be forwarded to the town commissioners in due course.</P>
    <P>(5)  Arrangements are being made at present to hold a public local inquiry into the application of the town commissioners for a loan to finance the proposed scheme of 86 houses.  I may add that the attitude of the town commissioners in regard to the general administration of the Housing Acts is at present receiving my serious consideration.</P>

The revised plans have not yet been received, and the matter is being taken up with the commissioner.</P>
      <P>As regards the last paragraph of the question, a scheme was undertaken in 1932, but the water at the source was found to be inadequate.  The gauging supplied at the time by the late consulting engineer subsequently proved to be inaccurate.</P>

      <P>(1) A decision was reached in this case on 29th April, 1936. (2) The decision was based on the report of a Departmental medical inspector.  Representations were recently made to me in reference to this man's claim to national health insurance benefit, and, on examination of his insurance file, it was found that the medical referee had decided on the 30/3/'35 that he was incapable of work owing to defective vision.  In view of the referee's report, the claim to a blind pension was allowed without further inspection.</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy desires, regarding completed cycles other than mechanically propelled cycles, was not required on the Census of Production Returns until the year 1934.  In that year, according to returns received, the number of such cycles manufactured or assembled was 52,951 of a value of £205,183 and an average value of £3 17s. 6d.  From information received from assemblers it has been estimated that the number manufactured or assembled in 1932 was 24,000.  Based on the 1934 average price, the value was £93,000.  For the year 1933, the number has been estimated at 42,000 and the value at £162,750.  The figures for the year 1935 are not yet available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3), page 4, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute <Col N="2141" /> a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such application may be made&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in the year 1936 at any time after the passing of this Act and before the Minister fixes under this Act the quota in respect of the sale season beginning on the 1st day of October, 1936, and at no other time, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  in any other year on or after the 1st day of January in such year and on or before the last day of February in the same year and at no other time;</P>
    <P>This sub-section (3), paragraph (a) of Section 5 deals with the case of a person taking land which is not his own on which to grow flax.  Paragraph (a) as it stands would permit the applications to be considered up to 31st March of any year, but it does not make any provision for this year. Under other clauses of this Bill provision is made for application this year as soon as the Bill is passed. As Deputies will see on reading it the first part of the amendment deals with this year.  It is also felt that the date, the 31st March, ought to be altered somewhat because the final allocation must be made by the 31st March and it would be impossible, of course, to receive applications up to the 31st March and then to make allocations. The second part of the amendment would have the effect of compelling applicants to have their applications in before the last day of February, so that we might have the month of March to consider them and to make allocations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, as a matter of fact, application should be made early in March.  This paragraph in the Bill stated we should have to receive applications up to 31st March.  We have had to alter that and now we are closing down applications on the last day of February.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4) (b), line 41, to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to secure equitable treatment for growers of flax who lost considerable sums of money after the slump in prices which ensued after the Great War.  I am particularly interested in an area in Meath and Louth which was a flax-growing area and which is to a certain extent still a flax-growing area.  I had that in mind when I introduced the amendment.  I anticipate that the Minister will eventually make an Order under Section 2 to cover that area, and with that object in view I move the amendment.  I agree that it is a very wide power to give the Minister, that of discrimination, but I hold that people who grew flax nine years ago should not have any preferential treatment, that those who grew flax 15 years ago are deserving of more sympathy.  Perhaps I should say that I agree that growers who continued to produce the crop up to the present should get some special treatment.  They have kept the tradition alive in certain areas against great odds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But my special plea is for the men <Col N="2143" /> who lost a considerable amount of money, and in some instances all their capital, when the flax markets slumped about 14 years ago.  They invested their money in producing the crop.  Then the slump came unexpectedly and they were not accountable. But those people who started to grow flax nine or ten years ago as mentioned in the Bill, produced the crop and entered the market of their own volition, knowing that uneconomic prices would be forthcoming for the crop.  I think that there is no similarity in the circumstances of the people who grew it ten years ago and those who grew it 15 years ago.  These men are expert growers.  They may not have the modern methods just at the moment.  Nevertheless, very little education would enable them to produce flax as it is being produced under the most modern methods.  I therefore, submit the amendment to the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment could be accepted.  In the first place I do not know that it is going to serve any useful purpose even for the farmers in Meath for whom Deputy Kelly speaks.  I should like Deputies to picture what will happen exactly in selecting the growers.  The Executive Council will make an Order stating what the maximum area should be.  Suppose we are to have 6,000 acres of flax. If we get applications from the three Counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, and also from the two other small areas mentioned here in West Cork and Mayo-Sligo which have continued to grow flax for the last ten years amounting to 6,000 acres, I am sure every Deputy, if he were in my place, would agree that we should restrict the flax growing to those areas.  Even though the amendment were agreed to, as long as Section 2 remains as it is in the Bill, any Minister for Agriculture will prevent the Meath growers coming in at all if we could get sufficient flax in the other areas.  But suppose we do not get sufficient response from Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and the other areas I mentioned, and we are <Col N="2144" /> anxious to get growers to fill the quota we have fixed, then if people from Meath offer to grow flax I am not in any way bound by the paragraph which Deputy Kelly seeks to amend, that is, paragraph (b) of sub-section (4), because it is only a direction to the Minister as to the points he should keep in mind if he is selecting one grower as against another.</P>
      <P>Of course, if selection is not necessary, that is, in case there is not sufficient response as a result of this Bill, and if every grower who offers to grow flax can be brought within the provisions of the Bill, then that sub-section does not operate at all, because they can be all selected.  So that from the point of view, first of all, of the utility of the amendment, I do not think it is going to be of any use, and, secondly, from the point of view of what you might call the equity of the situation&mdash;perhaps I could not give it a better name&mdash;I think anybody would agree that the growers in the areas who have continued to grow flax for the last ten years should naturally be selected first if there is going to be any selection. In these circumstances I feel bound to oppose the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I took as an example that if the Executive Council were to make an Order prescribing 6,000 acres, or such quantity of flax as would roughly be covered by 6,000 acres, because it will be done by weight in stones, as the quantity for which we would give a guarantee, and if that were not filled by the three Ulster counties and the other areas in West Cork and West Mayo, then the growers in Meath and other places would be taken in.  But if it was filled by these areas there is no reason at all why Meath should be taken in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are growers of flax in Meath who have been growers for many years, and I do not see why West Cork and Mayo should have preferential treatment meted out to them.  We have growers of flax already in Meath.  We are not asking for the establishment of a new industry there.  The scutching mill in Meath, although equipped with machinery, is not working at the moment, but it is ready for operation at an hour's notice. I hold it is the most modern mill for flax scutching in Ireland to-day.  I hold that the claims of Meath should be put on a par with those of West Cork and Mayo.  I do not ask for more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At this juncture may I inquire what all the bother is about? So far as I am aware, this Bill prevents nobody from growing flax at a price of 8/- a stone, the price fixed; this Bill will not be a bit of good to anybody. The world price is in excess of 8/- a stone.  The Minister, I am sure, will bear me out when I say that the Bill <Col N="2146" /> does not prevent anyone growing flax, but the Minister will say that before they sell a crop the farmers of one area alone will be guaranteed 8/- a stone. The farmers of Meath can grow all the flax they wish outside the Bill, and sell it at a better price than the Minister has guaranteed.  One reason why I do not see there is any necessity for legislation in Royal Meath is that the paragraph which the Deputy seeks to remove from the Bill by his amendments would be purely permissive.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may refuse, on any of the following grounds, an application for the registration of land in the register of flax-growing premises, and one of the grounds is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  that the Minister is not satisfied that flax has been grown on such land within ten years before the passing of the Act.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why he should refuse.  I submit that if a case arose, even though the Minister did not intend to give a licence to persons who had not grown flax for ten or 14 years, there is no reason why, if a Deputy made a personal application to the Minister asking to be permitted to grow flax, he should not get it.  In fact, what would happen is, that this section will not prevent persons who have grown flax in the last ten years, or persons who have not, from growing it.  It is not compulsory.  I think it should be emphasised most clearly that this Bill does not propose to prohibit any citizen in the State from growing flax.  When the Bill becomes law everybody can grow flax if they want to, but only persons who have registration from the Department will be guaranteed the minimum price that the Minister will subsequently fix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to agree with Deputy Dillon that the Bill does not in any way prevent persons from growing flax.  It is only guarding against a slump in price.  In reference to what Deputy kelly said, if they continued to grow flax in Meath in the last ten years, that is all right.  This paragraph does not militate against that.  There is no intention of treating Meath worse than West Cork or Mayo. <Col N="2147" /> It is contended that West Cork continued to grow flax in the last ten years, and that they are entitled to special preference with the three counties of Ulster.</P>

People are not going to grow flax in outside areas until they see what the position is going to be on that subject.

If the standard price for flax fibre is going to be fixed then, I say, it is not just to give the Minister the right to compel the flax grower to bring his flax to a particular scutching mill, because the flax fibre produced in any large quantity of flax may vary very greatly in quality as a result of the method whereby it is scutched.  Therefore, the flax owner should have absolute discretion to get his flax scutched in the most efficient way he can.  So I suggest <Col N="2148" /> to the Minister that if he is determined to fix the price, on the basis of the flax fibre, then he should give absolute discretion to the growers as to the mill where their flax is scutched. If, on the other hand, he feels it essential that he should have the right to control the flax mill, at which the flax is scutched, then he should fix the standard price on the basis of the scutched flax.  Either of these courses is practical, and one of them is absolutely necessary if substantial justice is to be done to the flax grower, and what is more important&mdash;because in my opinion flax is not going to become a very extensive crop in this country in the future&mdash;what is more important than the particular case, a very undesirable precedent will be avoided.  I am afraid that, if a precedent of this kind is established under this Bill, it may be followed in other Bills controlling the conditions under which agricultural produce is raised.  I do not think I am drawing attention to an unreasonable difficulty, and I think the point is one which the Minister should try to meet.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this aspect of the Bill on the Second Reading, and I support Deputy Dillon in what he has said.  In practice, inspectors will find it very difficult to determine what is a good mill and what is not a good mill.  It is only the farmers acquainted with the districts and with the craftsmen in the mills who will be in a position to judge the standard of the mill.  It would be erroneous for the Minister to impose upon an inspector the duty of determining the mill to which flax should be sent.  Anybody who is intimately connected with flax-growing knows that there are quite a number of small mills which the Minister might not think very much about but which are very efficient.  These mills may be in the hands of small farmers who may be experts in the handling of flax.  They may be very small men owning, perhaps, only ten acres or 12 acres, but they may have sons who take land in conacre for the purpose of growing flax to keep the mill going. It is in a mill of that kind that the best craftsmen are to be found.  In <Col N="2149" /> the bigger mills the farmer may not be a seutcher, or, at least, may not be a craftsman in the sense that these small men are.  Deputies who know the country in which these mills are situated, know that all these mills are efficient in the production of high quality flax.  In my constituency I could not name a mill that is not highly efficient.  I know two or three very small scutch mills, the owners of which, although small men, are the most highly-skilled flax craftsmen in Donegal or, perhaps, in any other county.  For these reasons, I urge the Minister to drop that portion of the Bill.  I support Deputy Dillon in his appeal to the Minister to bring in an alteration on Report Stage.  The power given in that part of the Bill is inherently bad, and it is also bad in practice.  The inspectors are bound to make mistakes in recommending certain mills to the Minister.  A mill belonging to a large farmer will employ scutchers.  In that mill you would probably get quite satisfactory results, but you would not get the results which you would get in the small mill the owner of which is an expert.  An inspector, nevertheless, might not be impressed by the appearance of these small mills.  I ask the Minister to drop this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister to drop this proposal. I think it is unfair to the flax growers that the Minister should specify the mill to which they are to remove their flax for scutching.  Invariably the scutching finishes at all the mills at the same time.  Take the case of Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, and other counties where you have a large number of scutch mills.  The flax-growers in these areas have been in the habit, for a number of years, of removing their flax to a particular scutch mill where they were satisfied they got the best results.  Under this Bill these men may be compelled to take their flax to another scutch mill where they may be of opinion they will not get satisfactory results.  It is a very drastic proceeding, on the part of the Minister, to insist on flax-growers removing their flax to mills specified by him.  The scutching <Col N="2150" /> process is highly technical and skilled work.  The workmen in some mills may be more careless than the workmen in others, or the owner of the mill may be more careless than other owners.  The best judge of the mill is the flax-grower.  He is anxious to produce the best-quality fibre on the market.  He has had experience of the mills, and there should be no dictation from headquarters as to where he should send his flax.  I presume we are now dealing with Section 16, which covers the standard price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon's point, I realise that it is very important, but I should like him to realise that there is at least a potential difficulty to be dealt with.  In the first place it will be noticed in Section 13 that a grower selects any scutch mill.  The power in Section 14 will not be used by the Minister unless it is felt by the Department that too many growers have selected a scutch mill which could not deal with their crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might.  Deputy Dillon said this might create a precedent. We have a similar clause in the Tobacco Act.  It has not been used, because too many growers did not select the one rehandling station.  If they had done so we would have had to ask them to go to another rehandler because the one they selected could not deal with any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And you paid for the tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>After rehandling, when the final value was made out.  As to the other point raised by Deputy Dillon, it would be impossible to value flax before it was scutched.  If I were <Col N="2152" /> to get a choice of altering one of the sections I would alter Section 14.  If a case does arise, and if we want to ask a farmer not to go to a particular scutch mill, in practice a choice can be given him.  We will naturally in such cases tell him that there are four other scutch mills in the area and to select one that is not overcrowded. As far as it can possibly be done a choice will be given.  With the present acreage there is not the slightest danger of this power being used, but with a very large increase in acreage it might be necessary to use it in certain instances.  There is no question, however, of asking farmers to go in the first instance to a particular scutch mill.  The power will only be used if we find too many farmers have selected the same scutch mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often warned this House against doing things which seem harmless but which in future will be set out as precedents.  My case here was very strong up to the point that the Minister said there was similar power in the Tobacco Act.  That precedent was quoted against me, I admit, with telling effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only made the point that we are not establishing a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And I want to point the moral.  We did that and we established a precedent which the Minister fairly referred to now as a precedent which was accepted in the past.  But obviously that does affect the merits of the case under discussion.  The Minister told us that he did not propose to use this power on the basis of the present production of flax.  I would be much happier if he did not enact it into law under the present basis of flax production.  If he does not want the power I would be much happier if he did not take it.  If he intends to increase the area under flax afterwards, and if he came and said that it was administratively necessary to have this power, I am sure the House would be prepared to meet him and to give it if he said that it would be impossible to carry on without it. It would be a graceful gesture if he dropped it at this juncture with the existing acreage and said: &ldquo;I do not <Col N="2153" /> want this power, but I warn the House that if the acreage is increased I will have to come back and get it.&rdquo;  I asked the Minister if he had to make any order in connection with tobacco to have tobacco brought to a particular rehandling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to know if the tobacco growers protested against that provision.  I would be interested to know if Deputy O'Reilly, who is very much interested in the production of tobacco, could tell us if, in his opinion, it would be desirable to vest in the Department of Agriculture the right to order him to bring his tobacco crop to a particular rehandler, or whether, as a tobacco producer, he attaches certain importance in being allowed to choose any rehandler to judge of the merits of the crop, knowing the difference there is in rehandling, as he would judge it. I think this is a valuable right and one that the Government should be slow to take away from any scutch mill.  For this reason I urge that the Minister should abandon the attempt to acquire this power unless and until the area under flax makes it imperative that he should have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I pressed Ministers repeatedly not to refer to things that were wrong in precedent but I am always met with the excuse: &ldquo;Oh, this provision is in such and such an Act,&rdquo; and of course that is the defence. Obviously this Bill is drafted on the lines of the Tobacco Act.  When I saw this provision I knew that there was no justification for it.  I am prepared to go a long way in connection with tobacco, because the Revenue authorities have to look very minutely after every ounce of tobacco that is produced.  That is not the position with flax.  If I were to be the Minister's successor I would not like to have that power, and I do not like to see the Minister seeking it.  It is a bad thing to have in a Bill such as this a provision by which it is left in the hands of any particular man to say to a farmer: &ldquo;I will give this flax to Deputy O'Donovan's mill,' or &ldquo;I will not let that flax go to Deputy <Col N="2154" /> McMenamin's mill.&rdquo;  In practice what the Minister said will not arise, because growers go to a particular mill just as people go to a particular tailor for clothes or to a bootmaker for a pair of boots because they suit their requirements.  They will go to the same place again and again because it was satisfactory and there will be nothing in the way of an experiment about the transaction.  After a man has sown a crop that is highly expensive he does not want to run any risk of having the crop destroyed, or of having a lower return as a result of scutching operations.  A man who understands flax can take a handful of it and roughly judge what it will produce.  This provision in this section is utterly impossible because the question of storage arises.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan had experience of flax in Donegal, and he knows that such a provision could not be put into operation.  I appeal to the Minister to drop the provision and not let it go to the country that the Minister said that he would not allow farmer A, B or C to send flax to a mill because the owner was a supporter of Fine Gael or <i>vice versa.</i>  I hate to have politics meeting us everywhere.  There are plenty of flax mills in Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan.  All the growers cannot send to the one mill because there is, in the first instance, the storage difficulty for flax awaiting scutching and, after scutching, waiting until the inspector comes to weigh and price it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I do not think the analogy of a person going to a particular bootmaker is true because, after all, the man who is in the habit of going to one bootmaker knows that that man can deal with twice as many people.  A scutch mill could not do that.  That is the trouble.  Deputy McMenamin has made a strong appeal that I should not embarrass him as my successor.  That is a thing I should not like to do.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All flax grown on registered flax-growing premises which is lawfully sent by the registered proprietor of such premises for scutching to registered scutch-milling premises shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  be scutched at such scutch-milling premises, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  when so scutched, be retained <Col N="2156" /> in such premises until the next paragraph of this sub-section has been complied with in respect thereof, and</P>
    <P>(c)  be inspected, weighed, graded, and valued in such premises in accordance with the next following sub-section of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how this arrangement is going to work out for the owners of mills.  If they are to wait until an inspector calls to their mills, in the first place, they will need to have a good deal of storage accommodation for the raw flax which is a bulky commodity.  Then, after it is scutched, they will have to hold the scutched fibre for a week, a fortnight or perhaps a month on their premises until it is inspected, weighed, graded and valued on such premises.  I think that is most unfair to the mill owner.  I think it would be impossible for him to provide storage accommodation, first for the raw material, and then for the finished article, until such time as the inspector will call to have it inspected and graded.  Apart from that, I do not think any mill owner would be prepared to run the risk of holding the flax fibre on his premises for any considerable length of time. The custom invariably is to have the flax removed&mdash;except in cases where you have weekly markets and at present we are not going to have them here&mdash;from the scutch mill to the farmer's own home where the farmer himself is responsible for it.  If there are any risks involved in its storage, he takes them.  I think it is very hard to expect the mill owner to hold the flax.  If paragraph (c) were withdrawn it would then be left open to the farmer to have his flax removed and the inspector could inspect it either on the farmer's own premises or at the market when it is being offered for sale.  When it is exposed for sale the inspector can weigh and grade it.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2), paragraph (a) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such scutched flax shall be so weighed by the proprietor of the scutch-milling premises in the presence of an inspector at the time <Col N="2157" /> appointed for that purpose by such inspector who shall thereupon record the weight thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may not be possible for the proprietor to be there at that time.  I think the word &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; is tying you down too much.  It should read: &ldquo;the proprietor or his representative.&rdquo; The proprietor may have a hundred other things to do at the time the inspector calls.  If paragraph (c) of sub-section (1), which I have already quoted, were withdrawn, it would meet this case and no such difficulty would arise.  Paragraph (c) is the important one and I am sure the Minister will realise that he must meet the mill owners who will not willingly take the responsibility of storing the flax and undertake all the risks in connection with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which I think presents considerable difficulty.  It is going to impose, in my opinion, great hardships unless the scheme is organised with considerable efficiency.  In this section we are imposing an onerous duty on the owner of the scutch mill and we are not giving him any compensation for that.  Deputies will observe that the owner of the scutch mill is not going to get any monetary reward out of this for all the trouble to which he will be put.  It would be monstrous in my opinion to compel him to provide increased storage accommodation, because he is not going to get any money out of it.  He is going to be used as part of the machinery of the Bill for the benefit of the farmer.  The farmer will get the benefit of the scheme and the owner of the mill is part of the machinery that is going to be used for the purpose of passing on the benefits of the measure to the farmer.  Again, this is a section that should be read in connection with the obligation to send flax to a specified scutch mill, because this section makes it impossible to send a large quantity of flax to a particular mill.  I would suggest to the Minister that something should be done to relieve the owners of these scutch mills of the responsibility imposed by this section because as Deputy O'Donovan has pointed out it is obvious that the owner of the <Col N="2158" /> mill cannot be there all the time.  He may be ill for the entire period of the scutching season.  Of course, the Minister could provide that he might be represented by an agent or some other representative.  It is essential to have some provision of that kind as otherwise that part of the measure would be unworkable.  However, that is a very small point.</P>
      <P>The important point is the proposal to keep the flax in the mill after scutching until it is weighed and graded by the inspector.  We are imposing a very onerous duty on the owners of scutch mills in that regard, a duty for which, as I pointed out, they are not going to get any reward. I think the Department will require to organise a scheme something similar to that in connection with the Pig Marketing Scheme, under which a notification is sent out that the pigs will be sold at a certain date.  On a particular date, the owner of the scutch mill could have a certain quantity of flax scutched and on that day, or the preceding or subsequent day, the inspector could be there to inspect and grade the flax.  It is all right, of course, to criticise this provision.  The trouble is to suggest alternative machinery for dealing with the matter because if the flax is taken out of the mill and is brought home by the farmer, it might happen that there would be some juggling with the flax. The inspector might weigh it, grade it and put a price on it and then, perhaps, it would be taken away and put somewhere else.  That is a possible difficulty, but it might be met if the owner of the scutch mill were required to keep a record of the amount of flax he scutched for each farmer, and if, when the flax were being taken away by the farmer, he would give him a docket on which the amount of the flax scutched would be entered.  The farmer could then take the flax home and put it where he liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a section which presents, as I say, considerable difficulty.  Of course, from the point of view of the Department it presents no difficulty, but it is going to present considerable difficulty to the owners of scutch mills. I think it very unfair to impose this <Col N="2159" /> duty on the owner of a mill without giving him any reward for it.  The question is to produce some alternative scheme.  The only alternative I can suggest is that the owner of the scutch mill should keep a book or docket in which particulars of each quantity of flax scutched would be kept.  He could keep account of the quantity of flax brought to him by each farmer and when it had been scutched and was being taken away he would weigh it, give him the weight on the docket and sign it.  Then the farmer can take it home and store it in his own place.  If I thought that this section was going to mean that the owner of a flax mill would have to build additional storage I would sternly resist it.  Such a proposal would be utterly indefensible.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on the Second Reading, this storage cannot be of a casual kind.  It must be a solid stone building with a slated roof.  Therefore, the Dáil should not impose on the owner of such mills the obligation to erect a permanent building because, as it is, the men in this business have not much out of it at present.  The owners of scutch mills&mdash;I mean now men who have no land of their own and are simply scutch millers&mdash;find great difficulty in making a livelihood out of the business for the reason that the scutching of flax only lasts for about three months of the year.  They have to make enough during that short period to enable them to provide for themselves and their families as well as sufficient to pay the scutchers whom they employ.  These scutchers are pretty well paid.  Therefore, I suggest, it would be an outrage to impose on them the obligation of erecting additional storage accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy McMenamin can hold that we are not giving the scutch millers any benefit under the Bill.  We will, at least, be putting in their way a steady volume of trade.  That will be of great benefit to them.  Heretofore, their business was of a fluctuating kind.  It has been so for the last 14 or 15 years.  One year, their business might be very big, but as against that it might be very small <Col N="2160" /> the following year.  Although they may not be paid any more per stone for the flax, still they will have this assurance: that their business will be of a more steady and regular character. It would be absolutely impossible to have the flax inspected on a farmer's premises, for the reason that there may be 7,000 or 8,000 farmers growing flax. In view of that, one can imagine the number of inspectors that would need to be employed if the inspections were to be at farmers' premises.  The season, as Deputy McMenamin pointed out, only lasts about three months. We will probably have less than 100 scutch mills and, therefore, it will be possible for the inspectors to visit the mills at least once a week.  If, from experience, it is found that it is necessary for the inspectors to visit the mills, say, twice a week in the areas where a good deal of flax is grown such, for instance, as Donegal and Monaghan, that can be arranged.  In these centres it may be necessary for the inspectors to visit the mills oftener than once a week or twice a week in order to give the millers a chance of clearing what they have in hands.  I do not think, therefore, that it will be necessary for the millers to provide extra storage.  From the administrative point of view it will be much easier to work the Bill by having the inspections made at the mills.  By doing that I do not think that we will be putting the scutch millers to any inconvenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister in what he has said.  I think that if this proposal is carried out it will mean considerable inconvenience to the scutch millers.  The Minister probably has not much experience of scutch milling.  As each lot of flax comes from the scutchers it is weighed, and the miller pays the men on the weight.  There may be two lots of flax being scutched in a mill.  Each lot, as it comes from the scutchers, is weighed by the miller.  He tots the weights, and on that the men are paid. Suppose that at the end of the week seven tons of flax have been scutched and that the miller has to weigh every ounce of that again in the presence of <Col N="2161" /> an inspector, that surely is going to cause considerable expense and inconvenience to the scutch miller.  The Minister does not seem to favour the idea that the farmer should be allowed to take the flax home and have it examined there by an inspector.  It is true that there might be some difficulty in having it weighed at a farmer's premises, as there might not be a suitable weighing machine available, but there is this point to be borne in mind, that the scutch miller is obliged to keep an accurate record of the quantity of flax scutched in his mill for each individual grower.  Should not the inspector be satisfied with the weights there recorded without insisting on having the flax weighed a second time?  If there is any difficulty in that connection there is this further point, that all flax may be sold in the public market.  I do not know if there are any markets in Donegal at the moment, but you have them in Monaghan and Cavan.  There is no reason why there should not be a market in Donegal for flax.  If the flax is taken to the market it will be weighed on the market scales and the market ticket, I suggest, should suffice for the inspectors.  It would mean endless trouble and worry for the scutch mill owner if he had to take responsibility for all the flax scutched in his mill, and had to hold it pending the inspector's visit.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 16 provides that all flax sent for scutching to registered scutch milling premises shall</P>
      <P>&ldquo;be inspected, weighed, graded, and valued in such premises in accordance with&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the provisions of sub-section (2).  Why is it that the flax must be valued by the inspector?  It is most unfair to the inspector, I think, that he should be asked to do that because, in my opinion, the only one who is a real judge of the value of the flax is the flax buyer.  That valuation can be got on the market.  The sale ticket will be available there.  All the information that is required as to weight, grade and price will be available in the market.  In my opinion it would be <Col N="2162" /> putting the inspector in a very false position if he were to be asked to grade and value the flax.  That is not his job.  The only man competent to do that is the buyer of the flax, the man sent out by the spinning company, who is an expert in the business. It would be very misleading, too, if the inspector were to grade and price the flax.  He might put too high or too low a price on it.  If, when the flax is at the mill, he puts too low a value on it, the news of that will spread quickly around the country. It will be passed on from neighbour to neighbour, and eventually when the grower takes the flax to the market the flax buyer may come along and say, &ldquo;Oh, the Government inspector only put 7/- per stone on this, and I will not pay any more for it,&rdquo; whereas the flax may be worth 9/- or 10/- per stone.  Therefore I suggest that it would be very unfair to the growers to ask an inspector, no matter how competent he may be, to grade and value the flax.  I think the Minister would be well advised to delete this paragraph from the section.  It should be sufficient for the inspector to visit the mills and check the quantities of flax that have been scutched there. The job of putting a value on the flax should be left to the man who is an expert in the business.  As I have already suggested, the inspector could attend the markets, see that the weights are correct, and check the price paid for the flax.  If there is a bounty to be paid, it could be calculated on the price paid for the flax in the public market.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy does not realise the great difficulty there would be in working out a scheme of that kind.  If he reads paragraph (d) he will see that &ldquo;every inspector, when valuing any scutched flax in pursuance of this section, shall have regard to the current market prices of scutched flax, and in particular to the current market price of the grade of scutched flax to which he has assigned the scutched flax so being valued...&rdquo;  That is, of course, really giving the inspector, if you like, an opportunity of going to the market <Col N="2163" /> and finding out what exactly flax is getting; he will do that as far as possible.  If we were to wait until all the flax is sold before we could find out the average ascertained value, it might be 12 or 18 months before we could pay the subsidy.  We would always have that difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had that difficulty, for instance, in the case of tobacco, because one particular rehandler was very slow about rehandling.  As the Tobacco Act is drawn up, we must get the value of the tobacco before we can do anything.  It meant that people had sold their tobacco before they got paid for the previous crop.  We do not want that to occur in the case of flax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to adopt the Deputy's suggestion, and take the ascertained value from the market, if any particular grower of flax under this scheme were not to sell his flax for some reason or other, I would have to wait 12 months before getting the ascertained value.  That would be the difficulty.  As the Bill is drafted the inspector can do as the Deputy suggests. He can go to the market, find out what flax is getting, and say: &ldquo;That is grade 1, which is getting so much in the market, and therefore it is valued at that.&rdquo;  At the same time he can prevent any great delay.  If any grower is neglectful about disposing of his flax, he can say: &ldquo;I value it at that, and that finishes your flax as far as value goes.&rdquo;  I think if the Deputy were to look at it from the administrative point of view he will see that if you are to take the market value, and if somebody does not sell his flax, the whole thing is held up.  I think the inspector should have power, in certain cases at least, to value on his own, although the flax is not sold, and that is exactly how the section is drafted.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must disagree with Deputy O'Donovan.  In practice there is no such thing at the present time in our county as what you would call an open competitive market, although I suppose we are marketing as much flax as any other county in the Free State.  The practice is that the purchase is made at the mill and the market is really only for delivery. There is really no open market for flax at the moment.  It is bought at the mill and delivered at the market. Previously only the inferior lots came to the market, but at the moment the practice is much as is visualised in the Bill.  I do not know if you will achieve very much by compelling it to go to the market and be graded in the market, except we revert to the war-time practice of having the whole thing done in the market.  Then it was only put into a certain grade and the grade price was determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very loath to have this section passed without further consideration.  With regard <Col N="2165" /> to Deputy Haslett's point, of course what is happening at the moment is that there is no exhibit of flax in the market at Monaghan.  At one time there would be 20 tons or 40 tons of flax used up every fortnight in the market at Ballybay, and also in Monaghan and Castleblayney.  There was a feeling that only the poor quality flax went to the market, and you had a number of farmers who were anxious to dispose of their flax at the mill because they thought they got a better price there.  But at that time the experience of those who were experts was that the proper place to sell flax was the market.  You had competition in the market; all the buyers attended there, as happens in Londonderry and Antrim, where you have weekly markets in Coleraine, Ballymena and Ballymoney.  There is no flax sold at the scutch mills.  It used to be the custom, some 40 odd years ago or more, to sell the flax at the mill, as is being done in Monaghan at the moment.  Then the people up there found that there was no competition and that the open market was the best place to sell flax.  If you had a condition like that&mdash;that all flax should be exposed and sold in the open market&mdash;it would be a great benefit to flax growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience in my time was that the buyer of flax was able to, and did pay in certain instances, a good price for certain lots of flax at the scutch mills, and that as a result of paying a good price for those lots he could get a bigger lot much cheaper.  The open market is the proper place to have it done.  If there were some such requirement in the Bill I think it would meet the case.  It would obviate the necessity of having the inspector valuing the flax and grading it.  It would also obviate the necessity of having the mill owner keeping a supply in his stores, and having to go to the extra labour of reweighing the amount of flax he would have at the end of a week or a fortnight.  The open market is the one place where you have competition. If there is to be any revival of the flax industry in this country the one thing that will accomplish it is competition in the open market.  You will have a buyer for every class of <Col N="2166" /> fibre exposed at the market and each will find the particular grade of flax he requires and pay the best possible price for it.  Otherwise, a buyer might come to the market wanting a certain grade of flax; he would buy that and there would be no buyer for the poorer grade or the better grade.  He might even buy a better grade flax at much under its value and be able to dispose of it to somebody else, whereas if you have an open market, and each of the spinning firms represented by buyers, you create a demand and you have a buyer for each grade of flax.  That would obviate the necessity of the millers storing it and an inspector having to grade and value it.</P>

    <P>4.  In sub-section (1), page 9, line 2, before the word &ldquo;stone&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In paying a subsidy, it would be rather troublesome and, indeed, of no great benefit to the growers if the average ascertained value were to work out a ½d., a 1d. or 1½d. a stone less than the standard price, because it would mean sending out cheques for 1/- or 1/6 to many growers throughout the country and no very big cheque to anybody. It would take a great deal of the time of officers in the Department to calculate the subsidy on part of a stone.  Suppose, for instance, we had a subsidy of 6d. per stone, and suppose we had 35 stone and a fraction of a stone like five-eighths, it would take a great deal of time to calculate what should be paid on the fraction of a stone.  The amendment provides that we shall not pay where the difference is less than 3d., but that does not mean that we would always knock off the 3d.  If the difference between the standard price and the average ascertained value is less than 3d., we do not pay anything, but, if it happens to be 3½d., we pay the whole 3½d. Where the difference is 3d. and over, we pay it.  In the same way a person will be paid in respect of every complete stone and it is only on fractions of a stone that he will not be paid. The same provision was found necessary under the wheat scheme when we were paying the subsidy.</P>

      <P>Apparently no alternative machinery is going to be provided in regard to the weighing, scutching and storing of flax.  A register will be kept of all the scutch mills, and I think that, when that register is compiled and the scutch mills are registered, a time-table should be <Col N="2168" /> made out for the inspectors, so that when the scutching season begins there will be no unnecessarily long period during which a lot of flax would be left to accumulate in the mills. With that time-table the inspector could visit these mills at regular times and at short intervals, to avoid the accumulation of flax in any mill.  It can quite readily be done with this register, and I think it should be done, and a tight grip kept on these inspectors in respect of that part of their duties.</P>

      <P>I do not like the phrasing of this sub-section (1) at all. I think it is a superfluous sub-section. It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any inspector shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter any registered premises or any premises in respect of which an application for registration has been made and to inspect such premises and the plant, appliances, and equipment therein and all flax, flax seed, and scutched flax in such premises and to observe all or any of the processes and methods used in the preparation for scutching or the scutching (as the case may be) of flax in such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what the purpose of that is.  There is no flax seed in a flax mill, and I cannot understand why that was introduced.  I fail to see what the inspector has to do with it.  Under the Bill, an inspector goes to a scutch mill to weigh the flax of a registered grower, and to fix the quality of it, and beyond that I do not see what he has to do with the mill at all.  Perhaps the Department thinks it necessary to take every sort of arbitrary power to protect itself, but I do not see why this is necessary.  I cannot understand why the inspector should want to inspect the mill at all.  Our function is to produce a Bill that will give a bounty to farmers, and the way that is to be done is by the registration of his land as flax-growing land, the flax from which will be scutched, inspected by an inspector, and a standard price fixed for it.  I do not see why it is necessary to go beyond that.  There may be some reason that one cannot see, but one cannot visualise why it is necessary in practice.  The Minister may see the wisdom of having <Col N="2170" /> it, but I do not see the wisdom of putting it in the Bill at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more a legal point I think than anything else, that we must get power in such legislation as this for the inspector to enter.  Otherwise, we might have very vexatious actions against the inspector for coming in at an improper time to inspect.  Growers come under this, and if, for any reason, we wanted an inspector to see if a particular grower was really growing the flax he said he was growing&mdash;I do not know much about the law but the Deputy does&mdash; it is possible that if the inspector were not protected by this section, he might be taken up by the grower for trespass or some other offence of that kind.  The section also refers to the making of an application for registration.  If a scutch miller applies for registration, it may be necessary to inspect his premises to see if the equipment is all right or if the building is properly roofed, which is necessary, as the Deputy pointed out, and an inspector might be sent down to inspect and to see if it should be registered.  When it had been registered, a report might come into the Department that that registered grower did not grow flax, but that he was getting flax from another person and passing it off as his own.  It might be necessary in that case to inspect the books of the scutch mill and, if the inspector were suspicious, he might look to see the amount of flax actually in the mill, the amount scutched and the amount not scutched, and so on.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out already, these powers do go on from one Bill to another.  Practically the same clause comes into every Bill that is introduced&mdash;that an inspector has the right to enter a premises and so on.</P>

It will be your main plank with regard to administering this thing in practice; but as to taking this power with regard to inspection, such as trying to see whether A.B.'s flax, or how much of it, is in that mill or not, you could not do that.  There will be umpteen tons of flax belonging to different people in this mill or in that mill, and the only real machine that you have got is, first, the wages the scutcher gets, and, secondly, the number of cwts. that the owner of a scutch mill gets paid for scutching by any particular farmer.  Under that section there, you could inspect away from Monday morning till Saturday night, and from the beginning till the end of the season, but unless you did that and weighed every load of raw flax that came to the mill, you would have no protection under that section.</P>

      <P>I think that is very necessary from the point of view of the growers of flax, because some mills may not be up-to-date, and while I would not suggest any drastic action being taken against a miller, who did <Col N="2172" /> not have a large quantity of flax to scutch, by compelling him to instal a lot of expensive machinery, at the same time I consider that it would be a very good thing to do.  In some mills you would have antiquated machinery with obsolete rollers, where the flax would have to be thrown into the rollers several times, and I take it that the object of the inspection of scutch mills is to see that they are properly equipped for scutching, and that at all times inspectors could visit them in order to see that they are doing their work properly, and that, along with seeing the flax weighed, the inspector would also see that the grower would be safeguarded and that there would be no butchering or hammering of the flax in the scutch mills.  Is that the intention?</P>

      <P>Now, with regard to the question of flax seed: Deputy McMenamin said that there is no flax seed in the scutch mills for inspection. Well, that is so at the moment, but perhaps the Minister might be visualising a time in the future when we might be saving our own flax seed here.  The pioneers of the new breeds of flax seed were in the North of Ireland.  As a matter of fact, the man who first started this here&mdash;I think the first in the flax-growing world to realise the advantage of good seeds&mdash; was Mr. John W. Stewart, of Coleraine, who is still alive.  He was the first to realise the advantage of good seeds, and possibly his suggestions might be adopted by our people down here, and we might be able to have the seed as well as the fibre saved in the Saorstát.  During the war period a good deal of the flax seed was saved in the Saorstát and gave very satisfactory results; but now, with the new breeds of seeds that have come in, I do not see why the propagation of these seeds might not be attempted, on a small scale at first, perhaps, by our people here, and we might have flax seed in connection with the scutch mills at a later stage.  I think it is necessary that the inspector should go to the mills in order to see that the growers were being safeguarded, by <Col N="2173" /> seeing that the scutchers were doing their work properly.</P>

      <P>Sir, may I sound a note of caution?  Flax-growing is a business, and it can be readily seen in this debate that for Deputy O'Donovan it is not only a business but a glorious romance as well.  I am afraid that we may get too far carried away by our enthusiasm in this matter.  I realise that it would be desirable that every scutch mill in the country should have the most modern plant that human ingenuity could command, but we have to bear in mind that flax milling will be only a very small industry in this country for some time to come, and we should not inflict too much expense on the millers, and thus make it impossible for them to carry on.  Let us, peacefully, and, if needs be, romantically creep before we run&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says &ldquo;creep before we dance.&rdquo;  The picture of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance displaying his terpsichorean art over the flax fields of this country would be exceedingly diverting. We should not inflict too much cost at the beginning of the industry, and I imagine that the scutch mills that are giving reasonable satisfaction should not be required to equip themselves too exhaustively at the beginning. Later on, if the crop develops and if there is a prospect of an enduring large demand on the services of the scutch mills, there could be more rigorous requirements in regard to equipment and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I enter my perennial objection to this section.  This is the section which is appearing in more and more Bills which come before this House.  It is the foundation and, at the same time, the corner-stone and the keystone of bureaucracy, and it is a section which every democrat the world over should protest against wherever he sees it, because it is transferring the seat of government from Oireachtas Eireann to Government Buildings, and that is something to which I strenuously object.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why this Section 29 should be here.  I think the Minister has got everything in the Bill that is necessary for the purposes of the Bill.  If, at any time, anything arises that the Minister wants, he can get it.  Speaking for myself, and I am sure I can speak for my colleagues also, in ten minutes we will give him any powers that may be needed in connection with this Bill; but I loathe this kind of thing.  It is the instrument of bureaucracy.  Here we have it stuck into this Bill and it is here, not because it is wanted, but because it is stuck into every other Bill that is put into this legislature and, apparently, into every other legislature in the world.  And, of course, we are told that this is democracy! It is a mockery of democracy and of democratic institutions.  We hear all sorts of talk about democratic representation and democratic institutions and yet the Government, in this Bill, seek to do this thing.  So far as I am aware, and I think Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Haslett, who know something about flax-growing, will agree with me, this Bill already contains all the power that the Minister requires. Why, in the name of common sense, is the Minister anxious to stick this section into the Bill to do things that they will never require to have done? If they did require power of that sort later, they could easily introduce another measure.  I contend that under those regulations things could be done that we never intended.  The Minister should turn his back on the tendency to do this thing.  If he wants <Col N="2175" /> further legislation, let him come to the House and, if it is calculated to be of advantage to the industry, he will get it.  We should not pass this duty on to anybody else.  If we do we will be failing in the trust reposed in us by the people.  We should not countenance these things being done by officials when we are paid to do them ourselves.</P>

      <P>If we were not permitted in our legislation to do certain things by regulation, the number of Bills coming before the Dáil would be greatly increased.  A Bill like this would have to be introduced every year, because we might have a different price and a different area.  I would have to state the price and the area, set out the records which should be kept, and submit all those other things that are prescribed and ordered from time to time.  I am not sure if an annual Bill would be sufficient; it might be necessary to bring in two or three Bills during the year.  I do not know if Deputies get enough to do in the House without adding to the pile of legislation.</P>

      <P>There is a decrease in this case of £19 on a total of £7,360. The function of the State Laboratory is obvious.  It consists of the analysis of samples for all the different Departments. It analysed 42,460 of them last year.  One might manage to get in a certain amount of romance if one went through a list of the things that they do analyse.  For instance, for the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;a very romantic Department&mdash;they analysed samples of soap, bottles, beer, spirits, wines, cider, denatured alcohol, fruit (dried or otherwise preserved), molasses, saccharin, sugar and sugar confectionery, cocoa, table water, margarine, tobacco, oatmeal and woollen materials.

Fees are also received in connection with the testing and certification of creamery appliances (volumetric glass instruments such as pipettes, butyrometers, etc.) under the Milk and Cream (Calculation of Prices) Order, 1928.

These are (a) repayments by the British Government in respect of premises occupied by British Departments in the Saorstát, and (b) agency services performed by the Government of Saorstát Eireann for the British, and a payment of £20 in respect of other agency services, such as the general medical practitioner, treatment for disabled British ex-servicemen performed by the Saorstát for the British Government or the Government of Northern Ireland, and the repayment by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, estimated at £110, in respect of the Post Office Savings Bank premises.  If the Deputy would require a list of the premises I will let him have it.  I do not carry it in my head.</P>

      <P>There are two questions, the answers to which the Parliamentary Secretary may not have at his command at the moment.  I would be interested to know, in connection with the Ordnance Survey, the significance of certain stones that are set about the country bearing the Ordnance Survey mark.  Are they marks on the map by which the Ordnance Survey correct the levels from time to time, or what purpose do they serve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are original bench marks from which all levels are taken. They are the permanent basis of surveying. When these things are ascertained, in the case of another survey one would start taking one's levels from that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The other matter is the nature of the receipts from fees payable under 23 Vict., c. 4, s. 9.  What is exactly the significance of that?  The Estimate follows the peculiar procedure of setting out in the first paragraph of the appropriations-in-aid the net receipts under 37 and 38 Vict., <Col N="2184" /> c. 70.  There is a supplementary note explaining that.  Then we come to 23 Vict., c. 4, s. 9, and there is no explanatory note.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <P>The Deputy is good enough to recognise that I cannot be expected to remember all the Acts or significance by titles of that kind.  I shall tell him what the appropriations-in-aid are.  There is a figure of £6,295 as the aggregate of the fixed annual contribution payable by the various counties and county boroughs in the Irish Free State in respect of the cost of the annual revision of valuations. The payment is made in moities on 1st April and 1st October.  As to the receipts from fees for certain books, all our books and maps are expected to realise £675.  I think that covers the points raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that arises on this Estimate to which I should like to refer, and to which I referred before in this House.  It is the question of valuation.  When premises have been improved or reconstructed in any part of the country, <Col N="2186" /> the valuation officials come to revalue them and it is stated that the value put upon the improvements or additions made to the premises are out of all proportion to the work done.  There are, as we know, in this country premises, both in town and country, that can very well do with being improved. Apart from improving the premises and the appearance of some of our towns and villages, the work gives a certain amount of employment.  There is, however, one great deterrent, and that is, that when, say, a business man decides to build an addition to his premises or to improve the existing structure the valuation officials come along and his valuation is increased very substantially.  When this happens to a licensed holder it hits him in two ways.  There is an increase in the shape of higher rates, and there is an increase in the amount of the licence to be paid.  My particular interest in the matter might be said to be twofold. Firstly, there are a great number of those dwellings crying out for improvement.  Many of them require additions, and others proper maintenance. Secondly, such work gives a certain amount, of employment, and people ought to be encouraged to spend money on improving and enlarging their premises, rather than that they should be penalised for doing so, by increasing their valuation at a rate which has been represented to me as excessive.  I raised this matter before and I do not want to develop it at any length now.  But I think it would be a good thing if the Valuation Department would soft-pedal a little, on this subject, which might encourage people to improve their houses, and to give some little more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the Vote under which fall matters of this kind.  It is apparent that the Valuation Department has no ultimate authority in the matter.  Great care is taken to see that, in practice, what the Deputy is worried about does not occur.  In carrying out their work valuers are sent down to each district in which revision of valuation is made or requested.  When appeals are made a further visit, in each case, by a different valuer is <Col N="2187" /> made.  If the applicant is still dissatisfied with the result of the first appeal he can proceed to the Circuit Court.  There are three stages before the unfair valuation, or the valuations that a man would regard as excessive could be imposed.  In 1935 the number of tenements dealt with was 44,602 as against 31,000 in 1934.  The number of first valuations appealed against was 1,063, as against 868 in 1934, showing the people are appreciative of the advantage of appealing.  The number of appeals to the Circuit Court was 23 as compared with 26 in 1934.  In other words, after the second appeal to the Revenue Commissioners the number of cases in which people concerned thought it in their interests to go to an outside tribunal was only 23 out of 44,000, rather suggesting that the valuations made by the Department are considered fairly right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It might suggest something quite different.  It might well suggest that people were not willing to throw good money after bad. It may be bad enough to have the valuation increased without incurring the further expense of going into court against the State.  I can say this.  I know of one case where a merchant spent a substantial sum of money improving his premises, with the result that his valuation was increased to such an extent that it frightened every other merchant in that town.  As a result one or two others who, to my own knowledge, were considering making structural alterations decided not to proceed because they felt they would have to pay substantially for those improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In that particular case, did the particular man appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not go to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then here is the dilemma. There is a safeguard against any wrong procedure in the Department of imposing upon anyone excess valuation. That is clear from what I have just stated.  There is a further legal <Col N="2188" /> safeguard in addition.  The only thing that could be done to meet what the Deputy desires is that there would have to be an alteration in the law, and that the Deputy, unfortunately, cannot raise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is this: that the attitude of the Department ought to be rather to encourage improvement and extension of business premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the Deputy assume that in fact that is not so, when 44,582 people accepted their valuation against 23 who thought that a court outside would give them a different decision?</P>

      <P>This is a most fascinating Department, and one upon which I would like to hear a few words from the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is a long time since I was told, at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, that the Quit Rent Office was a disappearing service, and would very soon disappear altogether.  I was interested at that time to have elucidated for me what the Quit Rent Office did.  The Accounting Officer on that occasion spoke at some length, but at the conclusion of his observations, I confess I was not much wiser.  I since perused what he said, and I still found some difficulty in understanding it.  I feel that Deputy Frazer Browne and Deputy Mat. O'Reilly, whom I see on the Government Benches opposite, would be very glad to know what the Quit Rent Office does, what service it renders, and why they are asked to vote £47 more this year for the maintenance of that institution than was voted last year.  We would be all wiser if we had an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be an appropriate revenge on the Deputy if I were really to attempt to explain what this office does.  I am myself very much in the same position.  The Quit Rent Office deals generally with the management of all forms of Crown property, including quit rents, which was transferred to Saorstát Eireann by virtue of Article II of the Constitution. Nearly the whole of the former Crown revenues in the Saorstát were derived from ancient quit rents and other unimprovable rents of a similar character, charged upon properties which <Col N="2190" /> did not belong to the Crown.  Their number was very great and the amount of each was correspondingly small.  When the question of the transfer of the administration of quit rents, collectable in the area of the Saorstát, to the Free State Government was being discussed, it was proposed by the British that a capital sum should be paid to them for the purchase of the net rental but, eventually, the Law Officers of the Crown advised that the claim of the Saorstát Ministers that the land revenues of the Crown in the Irish Free State belonged to the Irish Free State was well founded in law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A claim for the recovery of these moneys with accrued interest as well as for the capital sum secured by the British Government from the redemption of quit rents prior to the 1st April, 1922, which was reinvested in property outside the area of the Saorstát, was included amongst the claims made in connection with the negotiations with the British Government in 1932.

      <P>Before we meet to celebrate the demise of this office, it may be well that there should be a record of what its functions are.  I have no doubt that it has a very romantic history.  The main current function of the Quit Rent Office is concerned with these quit rents&mdash;not merely with their collection which in itself is now a relatively small service but with the work necessary for the redemption of the existing rents in land purchase proceedings.  From the latest figures available, the rental charge for 1934-35 was £4,500 for quit rents and £1,373 for other rents and revenues from former Crown properties.  These figures are, however, inclusive of rents charged on lands subsequently vested in the Land Commission and in respect of which collection has ceased but the rents are still charged on the rental pending final redemption.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we are entitled to discuss that but we may be able to drag it in later.  The land revenues of the Crown in Ireland were under the management of the Commissioners of Excise in Ireland up to 1827, when they became vested in the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. The rents continued to be collected by the collectors of Customs and Excise, who are paid 2 per cent. on the sums collected, plus bonus at the prevailing <Col N="2192" /> rates.  The annual expenditure involved has been about £100 in recent years. It is proposed to have the work of collection centred in the Quit Rent Office and this has already been done in the case of the Cork and Waterford areas as from the 1st January, 1935.  The work of collection respecting Limerick, Galway and Dublin areas will be transferred as opportunity arises. Since the transfer of the former Crown lands and revenue to the Saorstát, the quit and other rents have been paid into an account known as the Woods and Forests Fund Account at the Bank of Ireland, and Land Bonds transferred on the redemption of quit rents have been credited to the same account.</P>
      <P>Under the Crown Land Acts, the net income arising from the Crown lands, when collected by the Commissioners for Woods and Forests, was paid into the Exchequer for the relief of taxation. while the proceeds of sale of real property were reinvested in similar property or in redemption of charges on land, or, pending such reinvestment, were invested in trustee securities. The Department of Finance is advised that the effect of Article 11 of the Constitution is to repeal the provisions of the Crown Lands Acts so far the the Saorstát is concerned, and, as a consequence, the Saorstát has no legal authority for the utilisation of the accrued income of the Woods and Forests Fund Account. Pending the introduction of legislation, the drafting of which is at present under consideration, to enable the income arising in this way to be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer, there is no alternative to continuing to pay the income into this fund, which must, in the meantime, be maintained intact at the Bank of Ireland.  The fund is not altogether without benefit to the State at present inasmuch as the moneys are invested mainly in Saorstát Government securities. I understand that the collection used to be somewhere about £50,000, but it is now what I may describe as a gradually diminishing asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of the rental, as already mentioned, is not confined to collection.  Every case of a sale of land through the Land Commission <Col N="2193" /> has to be referred to the Quit Rent Office, and involves the complete investigation of title to ascertain the position as to quit rent and reversions. This duty is laborious and has to be performed with the greatest care, because quit rents, as well as other charges on lands, have to be extinguished in the process of purchase through the Land Commission, and, unless the quit rent is traced and redeemed at its proper value before the sale is completed, the value of the quit rent would be lost to the State. It is on this work, and not merely the collection of the rents, that the staff as a whole is engaged.  It is detailed and tedious work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the sale completed before they are redeemed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the process of sale of lands, quit rents are gradually being redeemed, and the land revenue collectable by the Quit Rent Office is, therefore, gradually falling and will continue to fall.  It was at one time over £50,000 a year, and is now about £6,000, portion of which is at present in process of redemption.  Every day it grows beautifully less.  The office, in its capacity in regard to quit rents, is, therefore, a dying service, and the revenue during the process of expiry could not, consequently, be taken as a measure of the work of the office. In fact, the staff is at present employed in extinguishing itself.  The more work that is done in the office on the land purchase references, the smaller the revenue from rental collection will be.  The staff of the grades shown in the Estimate is at present more than fully employed on the establishment of title, more especially since the automatic vesting of tenanted land under the Land Act of 1931.  The time must soon come when rent collection will have practically ceased, and the staff will be employed mainly on completing the work of investigation necessary for the final redemption of the land revenues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the collection and administration of the rental itself, the office is charged with safeguarding the interest of the State in all former Crown property transferred to the <Col N="2194" /> Saorstát by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution.  These properties include the Curragh of Kildare, the Long-meadows and Inchicore North Estate&mdash;&mdash;which latter was purchased with a view to preserving the amenities of the Phoenix Park&mdash;and foreshores in front of property belonging to the State or to Government departments.  The office manages the Kinsale property, i.e., part of the Fort of Kinsale formerly belonging to the British War Department.  There are two forts at the mouth of Kinsale Harbour, and one would be included in that.  I think the other is private property.  The office has the duty of asserting State rights to the beds and shores of inland loughs &mdash;a service of increasing importance&mdash; and general State interests in regard to rights to all property.  Its importance as an office of record is growing, and on this side references to it arising out of legal and other proceedings tend to increase.  Deputies will agree that a very comprehensive statement has been given, as far as we are concerned, in connection with quit rents.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say what lands are subject <Col N="2195" /> to quit rents?  I am afraid the brief he read from was not compiled with complete knowledge of the extinguishing of quit rents.  It does not need complete sales by the Land Commission to abolish quit rents.  Sales are completed before the purchase money is distributed.  We were told several times that all the land has been purchased by the Land Commission.  Why do quit rents still remain if all the land is purchased?  They never complete a sale without dealing with the quit rent. What function does the Quit Rent Office now perform in this State?  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the Curragh of Kildare, some place in Inchicore and the approaches to Kinsale Harbour.  If these places are in possession of the Government, why is it maintaining an office into which to pay rents to itself?  As I said in the course of an interjection, with Fianna Fáil in office, is this the link with the Crown and the British?  Even Deputy Tom Kelly has taken the shilling and still shouts for the Crown with the same gusto as he formerly shouted it down.</P>

      <P>I am rather interested in this question, because three <Col N="2196" /> or four people have made representations to me about land that has been purchased, that was originally held under fee farm grants, on which the quit rents still remain.  In the course of an examination I had to make some inquiries as to what quit rents really were and how regulated.  I discovered that they went very far back, as far as Charles II, when owners of lands trying to get exemption from service in case of war guaranteed to pay a sum of money.  That seems to have been the origin of these rents.  I would be very glad to see the end of these quit rents, as some of my constituents are greatly annoyed with demands that they get from time to time for payment of this money.</P>

      <P>The amount of the Vote for the current year shows a net increase of £132,979 on the previous year's total (as adjusted to include the Supplementary Estimate of February last).</P>
      <P>Sub-head A.&mdash;£291,181.  Salaries, Wages and Allowances under sub-head A are increased by £16,181 owing, mainly, to a strengthening of the indoor and outdoor staff and to the normal additions by way of increments of basic salary and bonus.</P>
      <P>Sub-head B.&mdash;£30,000.  The original Estimate of £30,000 for Travelling Expenses under sub-head B last year was reduced to £29,000 on the taking of a Supplementary Estimate, but the figure has been restored to £30,000 for the current year in view of increasing activities in inspection work.</P>
      <P>Sub-head C.&mdash;£2,620.  The addition of £100 Incidental Expenses under sub-head C is due, mainly, to the increased cost of advertisements inviting tenders for the construction and improvement of dwelling houses, etc. in connection with the division of untenanted land.</P>
      <P>Sub-heads D and E.&mdash;D, £828; E, £7,040.  The small additions under sub-heads D and E represent normal salary increments of the Clerical Staff of the Public Trustee's Office and Solicitor's Branch respectively.</P>
      <P>Sub-head F.&mdash;£8,200.  The increase of £700 under sub-head F is due to the increased number of appeals to the Appeal Tribunal arising cut of proceedings by the Land Commission for the acquisition of land under the Land Acts, 1923-33, involving the payment of Costs, Surveyors' Fees and Counsel's fees.</P>
      <P>Sub-head G.&mdash;£920.  The increase of £60 under sub-head G is due, chiefly, to the installation of telephones in additional offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head H.&mdash;£112,000.  The increase of £2,708 under sub-head H (which provides for the annual payment of interest and sinking fund on all land <Col N="2198" /> bonds issued under the Land Acts, 1923-33, and for State contribution to price and Costs Fund) is due to the greater issues of land bonds which are being made for the purchase of land.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I.&mdash;£606,550.  The largest increase is found under sub-head I, where an additional sum of £76,500 over last year's Vote is required for the purposes of land improvement. The sustained effort of the Land Commission to divide the greatest possible area of untenanted land renders necessary a big expenditure in equipping the new holdings created with fences, drains, roads, dwelling houses and out-offices, as well as the fencing and general improvement of parcels of untenanted land allotted for the enlargement of uneconomic holdings and of rundale holdings of tenanted land rearranged into more convenient and economic units.  It should be explained that the total of £606,550 set down in the Estimate includes £5,000 for the purchase of Tenancy Interests in holdings on Congested District Board Estates required to be taken up for division and £1,550 for payments under the Workmen's Compensation Act, etc., leaving £600,000 for actual estate improvement.  This is a large amount but it represents a judicious capital expenditure for the improvement of the agricultural land of the country which should be ultimately repaid by increased production; and, incidentally, the work provides useful employment in agricultural districts.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J, £19,000.&mdash;Under sub-head J there is an increase for the current year for advances to meet the deficiency of income from untenanted lands purchased under the Land Acts, 1923-33, last year's Vote of £12,000 (reduced to £9,000 on the taking of the Supplementary Estimate) being increased to £19,000.  This addition is due partly to an anticipated increase in advances for the purchase of untenanted land during the current year and partly to the increase in the carry-forward of the amount of purchase moneys in respect of untenanted land not yet listed under Section 24 of the Land Act of 1931.  It is necessary <Col N="2199" /> to provide under this sub-head for liability to the Land Bond Fund in respect of interest on the purchase moneys of untenanted land acquired by the Land Commission but not yet listed under the Act of 1931, as well as such charges as rates, herds' wages, etc.  The charge on the sub-head represents the amount of these items, less receipts from allottees, grazing lettings, etc., and is therefore necessarily conjectural.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K, £18,500.&mdash;The increase of £1,897 under sub-head K is due to the anticipated dissolution of the remaining two co-operative farming societies under Section 46 of the Land Act, 1927, and to some anticipated further advances for &ldquo;committee&rdquo; cases under Section 42 of that Act. The sums required under this sub-head are for the purpose of paying 4¾ per cent. interest and sinking fund on that portion of the sums advanced under these sections for which the State has assumed liability.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads L, M, N&mdash;L £100, M £100, N £500.&mdash;The amounts put down under sub-heads L (deficiencies on realisation of land bonds), M (loss on unoccupied holdings) and N (advances in respect of additional sums payable by purchasers) are the same as last year and do not require comment.  Sub-heads L and M represent merely token Votes to provide for possible contingencies.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O, £1,000.&mdash;Sub-head O is in the nature of a contingent liability to provide for the redemption of land bonds issued under the Land Act, 1931, in respect of holdings in which the purchase proceedings are subsequently dismissed, or in which the annuity is altered, and to provide for amounts that may become payable to the tenants or landlords of such holdings. No charge has yet arisen under this head, but it is deemed advisable to raise the nominal figure of £10 to £1,000 in order to meet possible eventualities this year.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads P and Q &mdash; P £1,500, Q £100.&mdash;Similarly under sub-heads P and Q the nominal figures of £10 each are raised to £1,500 and £100 respectively in order to provide (sub-head P) funds for the maintenance of embankments <Col N="2200" /> or other works which may be required during the current year, and (sub-head Q) to provide for contingencies that may arise under Section 34 of the Land Act, 1931, in respect of payment of claims out of purchase moneys notwithstanding certain defects of title.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R, £585,000.&mdash;The amount provided under sub-head R to meet deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the revision of annuities under Part III of the Land Act, 1933, is increased by £25,000 in view of additional advances expected to be made in the current year, involving a corresponding addition to the deficiency charge.</P>
    <P>Sub-head S, £7,000.&mdash;The amount of £6,500, estimated last year under sub-head S as likely to be sufficient to complete the purchase proceedings still pending under the Land Acts of 1903-09, is deemed now to be insufficient, and accordingly the amount is increased by £500.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T, £500.&mdash;Under sub-head T (which provides for the payment, under Section 14 (4) of the Land Act, 1933, of arrears of interest in lieu of rent in excess of the three years' arrears added to the purchase money, etc.) there is a reduction of £500, as the reduced sum will probably be sufficient for payments under this head.</P>
    <P>Sub-head U, £500.&mdash;Under sub-head U (which provides for payments under Section 17 (J) of the Land Act, 1933, in respect of adjustments of arrears of interest in lieu of rent between sub-tenants and their immediate landlords) the original estimate of £500 for last year, which was reduced to £100 on the taking of the Supplementary Estimate, has been restored for the current year as a precautionary measure, but no exact estimate under this head is practicable.</P>
    <P>Sub-head V, £5,000.&mdash;There is a reduction of £4,000 under sub-head V, as last year's Vote covered the charges arising in the year 1934-5 (previously unascertained), as well as in the year 1935-6, for deficiencies caused in the Church Temporalities Fund by reason of the funding of arrears and revision <Col N="2201" /> of annual payments provided for by Section 18 (9) of the Land Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>Sub-head W, £1,000.&mdash;It is impossible to estimate with any exactitude the amount which may be required under sub-head W to write off land purchase annuities on lands submerged by coast or other erosion, but it is deemed advisable to restore the round figure of £1,000 which was provided in last year's original Vote, but was cut down to £200 on the taking of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-head X, £1,000.&mdash;Under sub-head X the amount of £750, provided last year to assist migrants from the Gaeltacht to lands in County Meath, is increased this year to £1,000 in view of the second and larger colony which is to be established in another district of County Meath during the current year.  The details of the assistance required have not been yet fully worked out, but the round sum of £1,000 is put down as a reasonable estimate.  Great care and attention is being devoted by the Land Commission to these experiments in migration. There is reason for satisfaction with the results so far achieved by the first colony, and the experience gained is being utilised to good purpose in preparing for the further colonies.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote, the total amount for the current year is expected to be less by £7,540 than last year's figure.  This is due to the disappearance of the item for repayments of fees paid in connection with proceedings under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, as such fees are no longer leviable, and, therefore, there will be no repayment in respect of them.  Apart from this item, the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid show an increase of £2,460, of which £2,000 is attributable to excess annuities arising in respect of advances for improvements made out of the improvement sub-head (I) of the Vote and repayable for the benefiting tenant purchasers.</P>
    <P>As regards the general work of the Land Commission, during the past year there has been an intensive and strenuous effort to maintain or even surpass the remarkable record made during the year 1934-35 for the division <Col N="2202" /> of untenanted land.  In spite of formidable difficulties, once again the 100,000 acre mark has been passed for area divided under the Land Acts, 1923-33.  Precise figures are not yet available, as it takes some time to get back all the re-sale schemes from inspectors and to analyse and tabulate them, but the provisional returns indicate that an area of about 103,000 acres of untenanted land, acquired under the 1923-33 Acts, was divided during the year 1935-36 among some 8,070 allottees, thus surpassing the previous year's figures (of 101,800 acres and 6,244 allottees).  In addition 6,500 acres of untenanted land situate on estates acquired by the late Congested Districts Board were divided among 970 allottees.  In the previous year 21,477 acres of this former Congested Districts Board land was divided amongst 1,107 allottees.  The area in hands for division on the Congested Districts Board estate is, of course, decreasing year by year.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the adverse effect of certain judicial decisions in cases arising out of the interpretation of the Land Acts during the year, even this fine achievement would have been exceeded.  Particularly in the matter of the resumption of holdings, and the acquisition of certain classes of purchased holdings, proceedings have been delayed, and in several cases re-sale schemes, which had actually been prepared, have been held up owing to the unexpected difficulty in the procedure of acquiring the lands. Were it not for these set-backs, the total division for the past year would have reached something like 120,000 acres.  Another impediment to progress which increasingly arises is the difficulty of obtaining large tracts of untenanted land suitable for division.</P>
    <P>The average size of the holdings which the Land Commission can acquire and divide is becoming smaller. It will be understood that the process of acquiring an estate of, say, 300 acres may be as tedious and troublesome as that for the acquisition of an estate of 1,000 acres, whilst the division of smaller estates actually presents greater difficulties for inspectors and Commissioners.  It is of interest in <Col N="2203" /> this connection to compare the average area of the estates of untenanted land acquired under Sections 24 and 36 of the Land Act, 1923 (that is, compulsorily and voluntarily) in the year 1935-36 with that for the total period up to 31st March, 1935.  In the year 1935-36 the average size of each estate represented about 250 acres, whereas in the period from 1923 to 1935 the average was 400 acres.  These figures are indicative of the position with which the Land Commission now have to deal.</P>
    <P>A comparison of the division figures under the Land Acts, 1923-33, for the last two years is also interesting.  In the year 1934-35 a total area of 101,800 acres was divided among 6,244 allottees. In the year 1935-36 some 103,000 acres were divided among some 8,070 allottees.  Thus, though the area for the latter year shows but a comparatively slight addition, the number of persons provided for is substantially increased.  From the point of view both of staff work and national utility, the number of allottees provided with land is a better criterion than the area divided.  Every effort will be made during the current year to acquire and divide as much land as is humanly possible.  The staff of the Land Commission, both indoor and outdoor, are working with whole-hearted zeal in this task which they recognise to be of such great national importance.  The total of the expenditure on estate improvement works during the past year was approximately £489,000, which constitutes a record for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The various activities of the Land Commission under other heads are being well maintained.  Attention is being given to the revesting of holdings in the tenants.  During the past week some 2,000 holdings of tenanted land were vested in tenant purchasers showing a great increase over previous years.  The distribution of the purchase prices of estates vested in the Land Commission is proceeding at the rate of upwards of £2,500,000 per annum.  The collection of annuities is improving.  The provisional returns up to the 30th April last show that <Col N="2204" /> since the coming into operation of the Land Act, 1933, as from the November-December Gale of 1933, a total amount of approximately £5,137,000 has been collected on account of revised land purchase annuities, leaving an arrear of about £937,000 at that date over the five gales.  To have already collected over 84 per cent. of the total collectable is not unsatisfactory, taking account of all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think the results will indicate the hard and systematic work that the Land Commission is carrying through towards the completion of land purchase and land settlement.  It is difficult work for our staffs and I would like to express to all concerned&mdash; Commissioners, inspectors, and all outdoor and indoor members of the staff&mdash;my keen appreciation of their whole-hearted and zealous efforts.  It is due entirely to their co-operation and hard work rather than to any efforts of mine that I am able to put this record of work before you, and on that account I would like to make that known publicly to express to them my thanks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The concluding phrase of the Minister's statement brings up a matter upon which I would like to have a very clear and explicit statement from him.  He has told us a considerable amount about the acquisition and the division of land during the last year, and said that was due to the work done by the officials of the Land Commission: that it was attributable to them&mdash;to use his exact words&mdash; rather than &ldquo;to any efforts of mine.&rdquo; Now, that raises, as I say, a question upon which I would like to hear the Minister speak definitely and authoritatively, because we have had again and again from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, statements in this House that services, which are reserved services to the Land Commission, are reserved completely and entirely to them not only in theory but in absolutely strict fact: that as far as the acquisition of land is concerned, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary has nothing on earth to do with that question, and that as far as the distribution of land is concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2205" /> or the Minister has nothing on earth to do with that.  If land is acquired fast, no credit is due to the Minister and none to the Parliamentary Secretary; if land is acquired slowly no discredit is to be attached to the Minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Those are purely and entirely reserved services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told by the Parliamentary Secretary that in those reserved services neither the Minister nor he interferes.  I would like to know definitely from the Minister if things are precisely under the surface as they appear to be on the surface, and if the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary do not, in fact, interfere in the questions both of the acquisition and of the division of land. If they keep to the strict letter of the law, and if those services that are reserved to the officials of the Land Commission in which, by law, the Minister has no right to interfere, no power to interfere&mdash;to which the Minister is as much a stranger as any Deputy in this House or any member of the community who is not a Deputy of the House&mdash;then I would like to know, if that is the case, why does the Minister talk of &ldquo;any efforts of mine&rdquo; in the concluding words of his speech? He has no right to make any efforts. The rate at which the procedure goes is a reserved service.  The Minister has no right to make any efforts for the acquisition of land; he has no right to make any efforts for the division of land; he has no right to interfere at all.  If the Minister does not, in fact, make any efforts, if the Minister does not, in fact, interfere, as we have been told again and again by the Parliamentary Secretary, then they cannot have it both ways.  The faults of the Land Commission are very many.  I am going to mention some of them to-night.  If the faults of the Land Commission are to be placed upon the shoulders of the Land Commission officials, and the Minister is to wash his hands completely of them, then everything which is to the credit of the Land Commission officials as far as the acquisition or speedy division of land is concerned is not a matter for which the Minister can take <Col N="2206" /> any credit.  If on the one hand he declines to take any blame, and shelters himself behind the strict provisions of the Act, then on the other hand the strict provisions of the Act prevent him from taking any credit.  I am assuming now that the Parliamentary Secretary's statements in this House are correct&mdash;that the Minister does not interfere at all in the acquisition of land or the division of land.  It would have been very much more candid and more clear to the people of this State if the Minister had said: &ldquo;It is not due to any effort of mine; it is due to no effort of mine, because I have made no effort.&rdquo;  That being the case, and the Minister having nothing to do with the acquisition of land or the division of land, I wonder why the Minister goes on tours around the country.</P>
    <P>It was very much advertised that the Minister and one of the Land Commissioners had gone down to East Mayo lately to formulate a scheme of assistance for the people of that neighbourhood. What brought the Minister there at all?  It is a reserved service. The Minister has nothing to do with it.  The Minister cannot interfere.  It is completely reserved, and it is reserved as I have already said&mdash; quoting as my authority the Parliamentary Secretary, who surely ought to know&mdash;in fact as well as in theory. Why does the Minister go around and make those parades, deceiving the people into the belief that he is doing something and making some effort, when in truth and in fact, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, he is carrying out the law very strictly and is not venturing to make a single suggestion to the Land Commission officials as to how they should carry out the duties which are imposed upon them, which are reserved services, and in which by the Act of 1933 he is debarred from interfering?  I should like the Minister to make that point very clear.  Does he interpret the statute as the Parliamentary Secretary interprets it?  I quite agree that the interpretation is plain.  They are reserved services, but I want to know if they have been altogether as much reserved as the Parliamentary Secretary would <Col N="2207" /> lead us to believe, because certain things have happened which certainly shake my belief in the suggestion that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary have never interfered in the acquisition or distribution of land.  I should say incidentally that not alone has that statement been made by the Parliamentary Secretary, but it has also been publicly made by other members of the Executive Committee, notably by the Minister for Agriculture with reference to the acquisition of certain lands in Wexford.</P>
    <P>The matter of the acquisition of these lands in Wexford is very interesting. It has come before the House already, but I should like again to draw the attention of the House to the full and complete matter.  Certain farmers in County Wexford&mdash;all of whom are men holding comparatively small acreages of land, going from 20 to 80 acres, all of whom are residing upon their land, all of whom were tilling and working their land very properly, and all of whom are living in the vicinity of farms, some of which were let upon the eleven months system, and some of which were actually lying derelict&mdash;were selected by the Land Commission as persons from whom land was to be taken, in preference to the land which was lying, as I say, practically derelict in the neighbourhood, and the owners of which were willing to sell.  The Land Commission sent down to this body of farmers&mdash;six or seven of them &mdash;a notice saying, &ldquo;It is the intention of the Land Commission to acquire this land.&rdquo;  The matter was raised in this House, and this excuse was brought forward: &ldquo;The Land Commission have made a mistake.  The notice which was meant to be set out was a notice saying that the Land Commission intended to inspect this land with a view to acquiring it.&rdquo;  I want to know why the first mistake was made, and what explanation the Minister is going to give to this House and to the people of this country for that initial mistake.</P>
    <P>It was rather an interesting little matter.  One day one of the owners of the land that was to be acquired <Col N="2208" /> received a letter from the Land Commission. He had not written to the Land Commission and he was rather astonished at receiving a letter from them.  On opening the letter from them he discovered that it was a formal acknowledgment in Irish&mdash;as all formal acknowledgments are&mdash;with the name of his property on the heading, and the name of the person to which it was addressed, a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter in the neighbourhood, at the end.  It was perfectly obvious&mdash; at least it appears to be perfectly obvious; if there is any other explanation I should like to hear it from the Minister&mdash;that a communication had been received from this prominent person with reference to this land; that they had meant to acknowledge that communication, and that while they had put the right name inside they had put the wrong name outside by mistake.  Instead of putting the name of the addressee they had put the name of the owner of the land. I should like to know from the Minister if there is any other explanation except that.  I dealt with this matter myself at a public meeting, and I am aware that a particular individual of the same name has disclaimed writing to the Land Commission.  He told me that himself and I think it right to mention the fact in this House.  He came to see me with reference to this matter, and he told me that he had gone to the Land Commission and that the person whom he had seen in the Land Commission had informed him that they had acted in this matter entirely on the report of their inspectors.</P>
    <P>But the inspectors had never seen the land.  The Land Commission had never sent an inspector to the land at any time.  Without any inspection at all they had stated their intention of taking up the land; therefore they could not have had any reports from their inspectors.  Of course, the matter went a bit further because the injustice of this proceeding was very apparent and very striking.  The Minister for Agriculture went down to Wexford &mdash;by a strange coincidence be arrived there on Saturday and Deputy Dillon was to speak on Sunday&mdash;and <Col N="2209" /> announced that the Land Commission were completely repentant and were going to withdraw all these notices. I believe that all the notices were withdrawn, with one exception, and that that one exception has now been withdrawn was apparent from an answer made by the Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy Keating to-day. In the course of his speech the Minister for Agriculture again made the statement that, of course, the Minister for Lands could not be blamed for the sending out of those notices or the taking up of those lands; that it was not a matter for which the Minister for Lands could be blamed in the slightest bit, because the Minister for Lands had no power to interfere and had not in fact interfered in the question of the acquisition of lands.</P>
    <P>Personally I very much wish that that was the case, and that no sinister influences were being brought to bear upon the officials of the Land Commission, but I must express very grave doubts as to whether that is entirely the case, and as to whether no influences are being brought to bear upon the members of the Land Commission, because I do not think the members of the Land Commission, who are supposed to carry on this work uninterrupted, undisturbed, and unconsulted by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, have suddenly become the rabid supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, that they must have become, if, without, any influence being brought to bear upon them, they have done a certain number of things that have been done.  I very much question if there is this pre-eminence given to certain prominent Fianna Fáil supporters by the officials if influence is not being brought to bear upon the officials.  I want a very clear and definite statement from the Minister that he has strictly observed&mdash;and if he has not in the past, that he will in the future observe&mdash;the law, as it is interpreted, and, I think, correctly interpreted, by the Parliamentary Secretary, so often in this House, and by the Minister for Agriculture in the speech to which I have referred, and that he will not interfere, but will leave the conduct of the acquisition <Col N="2210" /> and division of land to the Land Commission officials entirely and will see that they are kept there un-influenced by anybody&mdash;and by that I mean by anybody using political influence upon them&mdash;in the carrying out of their work.</P>
    <P>I have said that I do not believe that the Land Commission officials have suddenly become very strong political supporters of the Government. I find it very hard indeed to accept any statement that resolutions from Fianna Fáil clubs as to what land should be acquired, do not reach, and are not conveyed, to the officials of the Land Commission, and that they do not carry weight when they do reach those officials.  I have just mentioned in connection with that Wexford case, the curious feature of this letter being sent out with the name on it, though not actually addressed to, of a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter and I believe the same thing is happening elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Let me leave Wexford for the moment and come down to my own constituency.  I have already in this House drawn attention to what I would submit is a breach of the law by the Minister.  On that question of the legality or illegality of the action of the Land Commission, I do not wish to say a single word at the moment, because, as you are aware, Sir, it is a matter upon which I have requested the Attorney-General to express his view as to whether their action is legal, and the Attorney-General has promised to express his view when he has fully considered the matter.  Therefore, I am not going to dwell upon what seems to me to be the illegality of the action and as to whether these sales can or cannot stand, is a matter which the Attorney-General has promised to consider, and, I am sure, will consider.</P>
    <P>Let me come to the particular sales themselves.  Land is acquired on an estate called the Bowen Estate.  The tenant was a man called Heshin, and the lands were the lands of Coolbawn, beside the village of Roundfort in County Mayo.  On those lands, which were acquired for the relief of congestion, <Col N="2211" /> three of the persons who were given land were one medical practitioner and two national teachers.  I put it to the House, that if national teachers and medical practitioners want building plots, as we were first told, they should go into the open market and buy them in the open market. Let them not be presented with practical gifts of land by the Irish Land Commission.  These men received eight acres, five acres and five acres respectively&mdash;18 acres in all.  The Parliamentary Secretary discovered that he could not stand over the phrase &ldquo;building plots&rdquo; and they were turned into &ldquo;cow plots&rdquo;&mdash;an entirely new phrase to me.  Eight acres of good land were given to a doctor at something like £12 an acre, and that land was bought for the relief of congestion. I want to know how the Minister explains that.  Of course, I know the explanation.  The doctor was the heart and soul, the life and the vigour, of Fianna Fáil in the vicinity&mdash;a very simple explanation.  He was a very good canvasser for Fianna Fáil.  He stood outside the election booth asking people to vote for them at the last election, and he gets his eight acres of land at £12 an acre&mdash;land acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion&mdash;and I am asked to believe that that is done off their own bat by the officials of the Irish Land Commission.  I have my doubts.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to have cleared up.  There is one thing we are entitled to in this House. When we put questions to Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, we are entitled to get the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and we should not be deceived by answers that are not true.  In the immediate vicinity of this farm at Coolbawn, there is an estate which was, at one time, the Lindsay-Fitzpatrick estate, which is now the McCartan estate, Mr. McCartan, a timber merchant, having bought Mr. Lindsay-Fitzpatrick's demesne, at Hollymount.  In that demesne there was a gate lodge, in which there was a man, John Moran, an employee of Mr. McCartan, who <Col N="2212" /> sometimes worked at timber and sometimes on the land.  I put a question on this matter in this House, and I was told that he was only a tenant at will, that he could be evicted at the wish of the Land Commission, and that the Land Commission had already demanded possession from him.  I asked why the herd's house on these lands at Coolbawn, to which I have already referred, could not be given to this man, who has a wife and a long family, and why they should be flung on the road by the Land Commission when this house at Coolbawn was available.  I asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What has become of the herd's house at Coolbawn to which I refer? Has that been allotted?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice answering on behalf of the Minister for Lands, replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand it has been given to a migrant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Has it been given to the doctor as the rest of this farm was?  Does the Minister consider that a man who was working on the Hollymount demense is not a more suitable person to get land than the doctor and national teachers who got the land?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To this the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no question here of a doctor or a national teacher.  It was a migrant who was brought in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not believe that.  I did not accept it.  I put a question to the Parliamentary Secretary later on, and the House will be astonished to hear that this particular herd's house was on the land that was allotted to this doctor.  I have been told emphatically here in the House&mdash; I read the words&mdash;that it was not; that it had been allotted to a migrant; and yet, when I press the matter up and want to know the migrant's name, I am informed &ldquo;Oh, the Minister for Justice made a mistake,&rdquo; and that the Minister for Justice, in answering this question and saying that it was given to the doctor was drawing on his imagination, in effect.  That is practically what it comes to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2213" /> Well, I do not accept that.  I do not believe that the Minister for Justice made the answer that he did make without having some documentary evidence to support it.  That is my own view, at any rate.  However it came about, there was a question arising directly out of my question.  It was not a vague supplementary question because, in the question I had put, I had mentioned this specific herd's house.  I had put it down in the written question, and therefore it was a matter on which the Land Commission, I think, must have given definite information to the Minister.  Personally, I do not believe that it was the Minister for Justice who misled this House, but however it came about, we were misled, and I discovered that a definite, categorical answer, which was given to me, was untrue in fact, and that this land which this doctor had received&mdash;these eight acres at £12 10s. an acre&mdash;did contain the herd's house I mentioned a moment ago, and that this house was available for the man from Hollymount, who was living in the gate lodge and was held to be a tenant at will and that the Land Commission had the power to put out.  I do not know whether they have actually acted on that power at the moment.  I raised the matter in the House and I sincerely hope that they do not, but the excuse they put forward was that this lodge was on land they had allotted to a migrant. Who is the particular migrant?  The County of Mayo is a congested county. It has not enough land on which to supply all the needs of the tenants who live on congested holdings within it.  It certainly has got no superfluous land into which migrants from other counties can be brought, and I discovered that this land&mdash;this mansion house at Hollymount which used to be Mr. Lindsay-Fitzpatrick's place&mdash;is given to a man who is brought in there from the County Roscommon.  Roscommon certainly is a county which has got more untenanted land in it, in proportion to its size, than Mayo ever had, and it has not at all the same acute problem of congestion as the County Mayo has, but I discovered that a man was brought in from Roscommon to Mayo and given this mansion <Col N="2214" /> house and a considerable area of land besides.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know&mdash;and I hope the Minister will be able to give me specific details&mdash;how much land did this particular individual surrender and how much land did he get together with the Hollymount house.  Was it by mere accident that he happened to be&mdash;the House, I think, can guess what I am going to say&mdash;the heart and soul, the beginning and the end, of Fianna Fáil in the portion of the County Roscommon from which he came?  It is a very strange coincidence.  There was no political influence, of course! The Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary have nothing to do with it; but by a very strange coincidence that happened.  I should like to know how much land he gave up and how much land he got and why a stranger was brought in into the County Mayo.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  There is another matter which I raised here in the House in connection with which the Parliamentary Secretary thought that he would score a verbal victory by giving the poor law valuation of one particular townland and leaving out the poor law valuations of other townlands. The question to which I refer is a question of the distribution of the lands of Brize which were in the occupation of Senator MacEllin.  That matter was raised by me here in the House some little time ago.  The motion was spoken to by Deputy Nally, and Deputy Nally and I received the unexpected, but entirely welcome, assistance of Deputy Walsh in condemning the scheme.  What were the facts of this case?  A considerable area of the land had been taken up. The Land Commission went to two men, one of them in the townland of Derrowel&mdash;a man caled Thomas Higgins, who has 22a.  1r. 20p. in the townland of Derrowel, and a poor law valuation of £7 5s. 0d.&mdash;and they asked him if he would sign what he thought was a purchase agreement&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary says that they did not ask him to sign a purchase agreement but to sign an undertaking of his willingness to migrate&mdash; and they pointed out to him a holding immediately adjoining him which they were going to give him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2215" /> Now, at the same time, in a neighbouring townland&mdash;the townland of Coolaghbaun&mdash;exactly the same procedure was adopted with reference to a man named James Lavin who had 17a. 2r. 8p. of land and a poor law valuation of £8 10s. 0d.  These men considered, when they had signed agreements to migrate, or their willingness to migrate, and when lands had been pointed out to them just beside their very doors, so to speak, to which they were to be migrated, that they would get these lands; and unless it was the original intention of the Land Commission to do so, when they were asked to sign their intentions to migrate to these holdings, when the holdings were pointed out to them, I do not know why the lands were pointed out to them.  It must have been the intention of the Land Commission to migrate them, and that would have been right and proper; but they did not.  Instead of that, they gave these lands to unmarried men who had no land at all and who were free to go off and sell that land in the morning. When I raised that question of the adjournment the Parliamentary Secretary said that a man called Biesty, who has got land, was a workman on the land before it had been acquired.  I challenged that statement then, but I have since discovered the fact.  Biesty himself has written to me stating that he was a workman and I accept his word that he was a workman on the land.  Therefore, so far as he is concerned, the giving of land to him does not seem to be objectionable.</P>
    <P>Also, on the adjournment motion, I laid down the general principle that I thought if men lost their work by land being broken up that they should get land as compensation.  But there were three young, unmarried men who had no claims.  One of them, as I pointed out in that debate, had been secretary of a co-operative society and then he had done some clerical work in Castlebar in the county council office.  He had no experience of land.  I wonder was it due to political influence that that supporter of the Government, as of course he was, suddenly received <Col N="2216" /> this holding of land?  Then these other two men received holdings of land also&mdash;unmarried men with no title to land at all.  They were free to put their holdings up for sale by auction in the morning and get considerable sums, to the detriment of the two <i>bona fide</i> farmers who had been shown the land to begin with.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in that debate that there were three townlands affected&mdash; Derrowel, Coolaghbaun and Knocknakill. The Parliamentary Secretary read out all the valuations of Knocknakill and they ran from £15 to £18 or thereabouts and he thought he had achieved a great triumph.  But what I had stated was not that the people of Knocknakill had not got a very fair area of land in extent, but that Knocknakill was not arable land and these people were not able, in their holdings in Knocknakill, to get enough land to till.  They always had been in the habit of taking conacre land outside and at least half of their total tillage was done on conacre land and, therefore, though they did not expect very large areas, they did hope for a few areas of arable land to balance the amount of non-arable land they had upon their holdings.  The Parliamentary Secretary said they were not in a congested area because their holdings had valuations of £15 to £18.  I never said they were a congested area.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary came along with the Knocknakill poor law valuations, but he forgot to bring down the poor law valuations of the three other townlands in the neighbourhood. I have here, certified by the secretary of the Mayo County Council, the areas and poor law valuations of these holdings and I will leave the House, even the Fianna Fáil Deputies, to decide, when they have heard some of the figures that I will read out, whether these lands should be utilised for the relief of congestion or whether these three unmarried men, who never worked before on the land, who never had land of their own, should have been given holdings.  I will give particulars first in relation to the townland of Derrowel More:&mdash;James Commons, 8a. 3r. 5p., poor law valuation on land, £3; Martin Reilly, 22 acres, poor law <Col N="2217" /> valuation, £2 10s. 0d.; Martin Loftus, 10a. 3r. 25p., poor law valuation, £4 10s. 0d.; Thomas Higgins&mdash;this is the man who is to be moved&mdash;22a. 1r. 20p., poor law valuation, £7 5s. 0d.; John Boyle, 23a. 3r. 25p., poor law valuation, £8 5s. 0d.; Thomas Shannon, 21a. 1r. 15p., poor law valuation, £7 15s. 0d.; William Commons, 19a. 2r. 25p., poor law valuation, £7 10s. 0d.; Bridget Toole, 1a. 2r., poor law valuation, 6/-; and Catherine Commons, 17a. 3r. 39p., poor law valuation, £8 3s. 0d.</P>
    <P>Was it not an obvious thing that somebody should be taken out of that townland, and that the congestion should be relieved?  What the Land Commission had intended doing was to take out Thomas Higgins, giving him this holding which they afterwards gave to the landless men with no claims.  They intended taking him out and letting his 22 acres be divided between the people with the £2 10s. and £3 holdings.  Did they do that? Not at all.  That is all upset.  I would like to know what was the cause of it being upset.</P>
    <P>Take the town of Coolaghbaun. There we have John Brett, 55a. 3r. 35p., poor law valuation on land, £25; James Lavan,&mdash; the man who was to be moved &mdash;17a. 2r. 8p., poor law valuation, £8 10s.; Michael Morley, 17a. 1r. 20p., poor law valuation, £8 10s.; John Flanagan, 13a. 3r. 17p., poor law valuation, £5 12s.; and Martin Sheridan, 7a. 0r. 36p., poor law valuation, £3. Again, was it not an obvious thing that those two persons, Flanagan and Sheridan, were persons who should receive additions when land was available adjoining their holdings?  There is another village adjoining, the village of Facefield.  There are a number of people in Facefield, and I might as well read out the valuations in the townland. I will just give you some of the holdings that unquestionably require enlargement:&mdash;Patrick Gannon, 14a. 2r. 37p., poor law valuation, £6 1s.; Martin Sheridan, 9a. 1r. 6p., poor law valuation, £4; Edward Murphy, 9a. 0r. 2p., poor law valuation, £4 5s.; Michael Fallon, 12a., poor law valuation, £4 8s.; and Bridget Forde, with two denominations, 6a. 3r. 10p. and 13a. 2r. 20p., having poor law valuations of £2 10s. <Col N="2218" /> and £5 5s., making a total valuation of £7 15s.  Then there is Michael Griffin, 15a. 3r. 25p., poor law valuation, £6 10s., and James Malley Owen, 7a. 3r. 20p., poor law valuation, £4 10s.</P>
    <P>Is it not as plain as anything can be that this farm was situated in a very congested area?  Those figures which I have now given to the House, figures which were not given in the adjourment debate by the Parliamentary Secretary show that this farm was situated in an area in which there is a very considerable amount of congestion, and that however you may balance the claims of the congests as against the claims of men who were working upon the land, however you may balance the equity of this work, there is one thing as clear as anything can be and that is that if the spirit of the law is to be carried out, if the law is to be administered as this House laid down that it was to be administered and if the main function of the Land Acts is to relieve congestion then this thing is inequitable.  It is an absolute certainty that this congestion exists in this neighbourhood.  That state of congestion I have demonstrated to the House by the figures which I have given.  If three men with no claims under the sun to land are to be given holdings of land in that area then I say that is entirely inequitable.  I want to know what explanation the Minister is going to give to this House for his action.  After all, whether the Minister is going to whether he does not interfere, we will, I suppose and hope, get from him a very clear definite statement.  When the matter is over he must, I submit, obtain from the Land Commission officials a clear and definite explanation as to why these extraordinary things are being done.  He must obtain a definite statement as to why it is that these persons have been selected to get land; how it is that doctors are getting land and how it is that national teachers can get land; how it is that men with no claims at all can get land, and that the claimants with real claims, genuine congests, are to be entirely disregarded.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that this is <Col N="2219" /> not a temporary matter.  We must bear in mind that the arrangement as far as the small holders are concerned is practically final.  We must bear in mind that the amount of land which is available for the relief of congestion is getting smaller and smaller every day.  We must bear in mind that really the amount of available land&mdash; what is called grazing ranches&mdash;has now almost gone.  These ranches have certainly gone in Mayo and I might say all over Connacht.  The Minister's opening statement shows that the large ranch is no longer available for distribution and that you must come down to the small places.  Therefore, the chances of persons having congested holdings getting enlargements of those holdings is getting smaller and smaller every day.  Here you see persons living on congested holdings; you see a farm of land to be broken up and you know that that is the last chance these congests in the neighbourhood have of getting their holdings enlarged.  On the other hand, you see persons with no claims under the sun; persons who are not migrants or owners of land but absolute strangers are chosen and put in to enjoy that land that should be given to the congests I have named. These people realise that they have no chance of ever having the congestion under which they live remedied if it is not remedied now.</P>
    <P>Is it not surprising, therefore, that these people in desperation should take certain measures to have this scheme broken up?  I deprecate and I always will deprecate anything approaching violence.  I deprecate and not only do I deprecate but I condemn violence or extra legal action as strongly as I can.  But I do think we must always recognise what human nature is and we must always recognise that there is a danger of violence in districts where the people's sense of justice or their sense of fair play is violated.  That is precisely what took place in this area of Balla.  The Parliamentary Secretary says he has no power to deal with the matter and no power to make recommendations but he should just send back to the Land Commission a suggestion that it was <Col N="2220" /> his view that the Land Commission ought to change this very inequitable arrangement.  As far as I have been able to gather, though that debate took place some little time ago, no steps have yet been taken to change this very inequitable arrangement.  I want a clear and definite statement from the Minister on this matter now. Is the Land Commission going to carry out its first intention and are these two men&mdash;Higgins and Lavelle&mdash;going to get the holdings that were originally pointed out to them?  Is the land which they were going to surrender going to be made available for the relief of persons who have small holdings in the vicinity?  I want further to ask the Minister if these holdings are to be given to men who have no claim to them at all?  These two men were told they were to be given the holdings that were pointed out to them?  Then there was a third holding.  Will the Land Commission undertake that that third holding will be given to somebody out of one of these adjoining townlands of which I have given particulars to the Minister? Will the land which these men thus surrender, in order that they may be given a holding in exchange, be distributed amongst their neighbours for the relief of existing congestion?</P>
    <P>I now pass away from that particular branch of the subject to another matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the House: that is, the execution by way of distress under a particular section of the Land Act of 1933, instead of proceeding in court for the recovery of the land annuities. Nothing has done more harm to this country, nothing has created more disturbance and let to more violence than that senseless method of dispensing with the courts and with court procedure, and the sending down of what were distress warrants to the sheriff. These sheriffs come and make seizures without the intervention of the courts, depriving the persons who are not able to pay their annuities of the opportunity of making their case to the district justice or the circuit judge, as the case may be, the case that they were <i>bona fide</i> unable to pay, and thus have an opportunity of being given time.  That procedure <Col N="2221" /> has led to a tremendous amount of disturbance.  I sincerely hope that in his reply the Minister will tell us that the bad practice of the Land Commission is going to terminate, and that the Land Commission will never again put in force those powers.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in that connection to which I would point.  It is a matter within my own knowledge.  I refer to the fees which the sheriffs are charging.  They are charging the fees that the sheriffs would charge in ordinary seizures when they go to a man's house to levy a distress warrant.  They are not entitled to do so.  In the case of Halpin v. the Land Commission, heard here some months ago by Judge Johnston, it was decided that the sheriff who seizes goods under a warrant from the Land Commission is not entitled to charge the fees which he would charge if he were seizing under an order of the court.  It was decided that the only sum he is entitled to recover is the sum of 2/- for making the seizure and 1/- for sending out the notice.  That is the law as laid down by Judge Johnston. It has not been appealed from, and I do not think it is going to be questioned. That is the decision in Halpin v. the Attorney-General.  If the Minister wishes to see the reference he will find it reported in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> report of last December.  In fact, I know of my own knowledge that sheriffs are charging very much larger fees.  I came upon a case the other day where the sheriff was entitled to charge 2/- and 1/- for the notice, that is 3/- in all.  As a matter of fact, he demanded £2.  That particular case may go into court, and I will not say anything further about it.  What has happened in one case may have happened in a great number of other cases.</P>
    <P>I put this question to the Minister and I should like a definite reply from him.  In cases where the sheriff has charged fees which he is not entitled to charge, that is to say, when levying distresses under these warrants the sheriff has charged sums going up to pounds on occasions where he was only entitled to charge 2/-, will the Land Commission refund these sums to the persons who have been thus grossly overcharged?  I know the Minister may <Col N="2222" /> say that the Land Commission do not actually get the sums, that the sheriff's bailiff gets the sums and puts them in his pocket.  But they are sums illegally charged and being illegally charged at the suit of the Land Commission.  I put it to the Minister that he should have all these returns carefully investigated and, wherever an overcharge has been made, he should communicate with the person overcharged.  In common justice towards these people, as a huge number of them do not know their rights, he should tell them when an overcharge has been made that they should apply to the sheriff.  As all these warrants have been sent out under the aegis of the Land Commission, if the money is not recoverable from the sheriff, will he take steps, without putting these persons to the necessity of legal proceedings, to see that either the sheriff makes a refund or that a refund is made by the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>Very large sums have been extorted from people wrongly, probably in the case of the sheriff under a mistake, before the Halpin case.  I suggest to the Minister that between the State and the subject there ought to be fair play; that the State, when it has overcharged and taken from subjects moneys that were not due by the subjects to the State, should not be looking for excuses for not returning the money.  The State ought be more than anxious to return those moneys, so that nobody will have a sense of injustice, and it will be known that the State is anxious to deal fairly with its citizens, and not that there is a Government Department taking from people considerable sums of money wrongly, and, when they discover that they have taken them wrongly, not being willing and anxious to return them.</P>
    <P>There are certain details in this Vote which I should like to go into, but I do not like to detain the House at too great length.  There is, however, one thing I should have liked the Minister to refer to in his speech, but to which he did not make reference.  One of the most useful bits of work which the Land Commission are doing is the work originated by Deputy Roddy when he was Parliamentary Secretary, about <Col N="2223" /> 1930 or thereabouts, and that was giving persons in the Gaeltacht sums of money for the reclamation of their own land.  That is far and away better than giving them unemployment assistance. Money given to people on the assumption that they will do nothing is completely wasted.  But if, instead of giving a man 5/- or 6/- a week unemployment assistance, you give him that money for doing work such as has been and is being done to a small extent upon small holdings in the Gaeltacht, I think you will be doing excellent work.  There was a very interesting article on that in the journal of the Department of Agriculture recently on this subject.  It is very excellent work, and I sincerely hope that for cutting drains on their land, liming their land and generally improving their own land, the Land Commission will give them considerably more help than they are giving at present.</P>

      <P>You can have it any way you like.  He said he was very pleased when I supported his objection to the division of the MacEllin lands.  I did object to the way in which these lands were divided.  My views on the land question in Mayo are that the relief of congestion should get precedence over everything else in the division of land. I should like to get an expression of opinion from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Nally as to whether they stand for that principle, and also whether they stand for the principle that the only landless men in the Free State who will not get land are the landless men in County Mayo.  The reason I ask that question is that at the present time the Land Commission, as far as my knowledge goes, are giving land to landless men in every other county in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2224" /> I said in this House when this question of the MacEllin lands was raised that I was opposed to giving land to landless men in the County Mayo.  I am still of that opinion.  But I certainly do not stand for the principle that the only landless men in the Free State that should not get land are the landless men in Mayo.  I am not going to tie myself to a policy of that description. If Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Nally, or any other Opposition Deputy, stands for the principle that no landless men in the Free State should get land until the problem of congestion is solved, then I am with them and will support them in that policy.  But while the Land Commission are giving land to landless men in other counties, the landless men in Mayo are entitled to their share of it.</P>
    <P>I objected to the scheme of division on the MacEllin estate.  I considered that it was unsuitable in the circumstances, as there was tremendous local congestion.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney kept the House occupied a long time in discussing the division of that estate. He also made reference to the giving of land to teachers and other in another portion of the County Mayo.  I can assure Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that neither I nor any other Deputies that I know would give land to any of these professional gentlemen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke here as if the present Opposition, when it was the Government, in the policy of their division of land, showed themselves above reproach.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands to get the files with regard to the division of the Browne estate near Castlebar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker raised a point as if it were a new custom for the Land Commission to <Col N="2225" /> give land to national teachers.  I never was in favour of giving land to national teachers though that has been going on, and land has been given them, and others of the same class, as I know, during the last 20 years.  I have known cases where, when estates were being divided up, sites and plots were deliberately set aside for the building of teachers' residences, and these plots consisted of three or four acres.  It is, therefore, not a new thing at all for the Land Commission to give plots to national teachers at the present time.  I am not in favour of that.</P>
      <P>I repeat my question: Are we to understand that the Opposition stand for the policy that landless men should not get land until the congestion problem is solved?  Are we to take that implication from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's speech and that it is the definite policy of the Opposition that nowhere, in the Free State, are landless men to get any land until congestion is solved.  If that is so I am with him.  But again I repeat that, while the Land Commission are giving land to landless men in other counties, the landless men in Mayo are entitled to their share of it, but I also say that there is no land for any landless man in Mayo considering the amount of congestion that exists in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question with regard to the division of the land at Brookhill, Claremorris.  These lands were acquired recently by the Land Commission.  For four or five years I brought this matter before the Land Commission and asked them to acquire that land.  They did nothing, and Colonel Lambert sold the land, piecemeal, to half a dozen purchasers. The moment these people bought the land the Land Commission stepped in and acquired that land from the new purchasers, and it is there still, and has not been divided.  What is the cause of this land being held up?  I also wish to know if it is the policy of the Land Commission to acquire land from smallholders, especially in the County Mayo?  I know of several small farmers who have got notice <Col N="2226" /> from the Land Commission as to the acquiring of their land for the relief of congestion.  There are half a dozen of these people near Claremorris with holdings whose valuation is not above £25 and they have been served with notice that their land is to be acquired. In one case notice was served on a man who only owns eight acres.</P>
      <P>Right beside these we have the estate of Lord Oranmore and Browne, and the Marquis of Sligo.  Memorials and petitions have been sent to the Land Commission asking them to acquire these lands.  Congestion exists in the vicinity of these estates, as has been pointed out, but nothing has been done.  On the Oranmore and Browne estate there are probably about 2,000 acres that could be acquired for the relief of congestion.  I do not know the amount on Lord Sligo's estate, but it is well over 1,500 acres.  I would like to know why the Land Commission are acquiring land from small farmers and leaving these big ranches in the possession of their owners.  The Land Commission must be afraid of something when they leave 2,000 acres alone and take land from small farmers with only 15 or 20 acres.  I have known several such cases.  I think some of these people were brought before the Judicial Commissioner and he decided the land should be taken over though the valuation is only £25 or £30 in two cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With what Deputy Walsh said about providing land for landless men I thoroughly agree.  First of all, so far as land is acquired, the owners of uneconomic holdings should get first preference.  Until such time as their needs are looked after by the Land Commission, I think the landless men should not be dealt with in Mayo.  I do not know about other counties.  Of course, a great deal depends upon the vicinity and the locality in which the land is acquired.  If land is acquired where there is congestion it should be used for the relief of congestion. Where there is any amount of land, and little congestion, the claims of the landless men should be considered.  We would all like to see landless men getting land.  We would like to see these people with large families trying to eke out an existence on pieces of <Col N="2227" /> land of from £5 to £10 valuation brought up to a proper standard.</P>
    <P>I want to refer, also, to the burning of Bloomfield House.  It was sold to a purchaser some time ago for £1,400. £500 was paid in cash, the remaining £900 was to be paid on some arrangement over a certain number of years. These premises were burned down. The owners sued the Mayo County Council for £10,000 for damages in respect of malicious injuries.  The Land Commission, in order to substantiate this, and help him, put in a claim for £3,000.  They wanted £3,000 for malicious damage to a house which they sold for £1,400.  I should like to have an explanation as to where the Land Commission came in.  I may say that the Mayo County Council defended the case, and that the Land Commission claim, and the claim of the tenant for £10,000 were scouted out of court.  Mayo County Council, I understand, got their costs.  The Land Commission should not bring such a case into court.  Perhaps they thought that they would find Mayo County Council asleep and that they would not defend these claims.  With regard to the acquisition of land, I direct attention to the estates of the Marquis of Sligo, and Lord Oranmore.  There are some lands which were vacated over 20 years ago.  I refer especially to two holdings in the townland of Ranahar, in the vicinity of Claremorris. These holdings, which were vacated about 20 years ago, have not yet been divided.  Several other holdings have been vacated and have not been divided.  In some cases in County Mayo where tenants were migrated, they have taken up the new holdings but are still grazing the old holdings.  That has been going on for eight or ten years.  As a matter of fact, they are grazing both holdings at the present time.  Several cases of that kind have occurred.  The matter was reported to the Land Commission but still nothing has been done.  I hope the Minister will look into the matter as soon as possible, and get these lands divided.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of trouble in some parts of Mayo with regard to <Col N="2228" /> co-tenants.  Where a number of tenants graze a farm, a great deal of difficulty arises with regard to the payment.  Some are willing to pay, while others do not want to pay. There is endless trouble and occasional litigation.  I think the Land Commission should look into that matter.  I hope the Land Commission will see to the acquisition of the lands of Lord Oranmore and the Marquis of Sligo, and that they will leave the unfortunate people from whom they are taking from eight to 50 acres undisturbed. I do not think that the Land Commission should take over 30, 40 or 50 acres. It is absolutely outrageous and scandalous that the Land Commission should do so.  I do not say it is due to politics but it looks very like it. All these people with under 50 acres or under £50 valuation who got notices recently are not, I understand, supporters of the present Government.  I heard that but I am not sure about it. However, there must be something in it when the Land Commission are taking their land off these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Attention has been drawn by previous speakers to the practice of resuming the lands of tenant-purchasers.  There has been a tendency in the Land Commission recently in that direction.  In almost every county, tenant-farmers have been receiving notice either that their lands are to be inspected or that they are to be acquired for relief of congestion or for some other purpose.  In fact, some holdings have actually been acquired.  I should like to point out to the Land Commission the danger of embarking in any wholesale way on the acquisition of tenant purchasers land.  It has created in the minds of a lot of farmers a great feeling of insecurity.  The practice has, in fact, been criticised almost directly by a leading member of the Government&mdash; the Minister for Finance.  In a debate recently, he made a rather remarkable statement, which emphasises the danger of this policy more than any words I could use.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Possibly, at this stage, I should remind the House that one of the fundamental principles upon which <Col N="2229" /> our social system has been built is the right of private ownership in land.  Our whole rural economy is based on that principle.  We fought the land war in order to establish it and I believe that any person who attempts to undermine it will face an opposition that would overawe a Hitler or a Stalin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the view of the Minister for Finance on this operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the practice of resuming the land of tenant purchasers, the majority of whom, so far as I know, have paid their debts. I have no evidence to the contrary. We were assured again and again by various Ministers that this practice would never be adopted, that the security of the tenant farmer would be as safe in the hands of the present Government as in the hands of any other Government &mdash; safer, perhaps, than it was under Cumann na nGaedheal.  The Minister for Defence, the Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers emphasised that the Government would not interfere with purchased tenants or that if, perchance, in exceptional cases, they had to interfere, the tenant would be suitably compensated. I shall come to the question of compensation later.  This particular action has raised grave doubts in the minds of tenant farmers in every county.  They are wondering whether the sacrifices of the land war, to which the Minister for Finance referred, were in vain and whether all the Land Acts which were passed to secure them fixity of tenure were in vain&mdash;whether at one stroke of the pen all this is to be undone.  The credit of the farmers is being rapidly destroyed and we need a definite statement from some responsible Minister that this practice is going to stop.  The banks are pressing farmers for debts and are refusing to make any further loans on the security of land, mainly because they believe <Col N="2230" /> such security is not ample, that there is a danger&mdash;and a grave danger&mdash;that the land on which they lend money may be taken from the holders in the near future.  Is there to be discrimination between one set of citizens and another?  Is the agricultural holder to be denied something which is permitted to every other member of the community?</P>
      <P>Again, I will quote the Minister for Finance.  He asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is it wrong to own land?  If not, why penalise the owner?  Is it immoral to hold land?  If so, declare that such ownership is immoral.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If you are to deprive a man of his right to property in land, might you not be equally justified in depriving him of any right to property in bricks or mortar, machines or material?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is right.  You might just as well deprive him of his right to own any other property as his right to hold land.  The Minister justly refers to the consequences I spoke of.  If you do take land what is going to happen? The Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Banks would find themselves compelled to recall some of their loans or to ask those ground-rent owners to whom they had made advances&mdash;most probably to finance industrial undertakings&mdash;to put up additional security.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what the banks are being compelled to do.  The Minister for Finance was insensed at a practice that the Land Commission are pursuing, because in the major portion of his speech, directly or indirectly, he referred to this matter.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputies who have spoken recognise that the owner of land which somebody wishes to acquire for the purpose of improving or building, is entitled to the full market value of his property.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to mark the words. If some private individual acquires land, according to the Minister for Finance, the owner should be entitled to the full market value&mdash;full compensation. When the Land Commission <Col N="2231" /> acquires land not for building houses, but for an equally useful purpose, that of putting weaker people on the land, is the State to confiscate property, while a purchaser in the other case would be required to give adequate market value?  We are not to be taken &mdash;because we are criticising the Minister in this particular matter&mdash;as being opposed to the division of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Donnelly says &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;  We are just as anxious to put people on the land as Fianna Fáil.  It is a good principle. It has many advantages in the way of social relief over other forms of relief.  There can be no better way in rural districts of improving the social lot of the people who &ldquo;have not&rdquo; than by putting them on the land.  But, as a social experiment, it should be conducted, not at the expense of the individual but at the expense of the State.  The State we are told is not going to acquire land compulsorily at a confiscatory price. But that is what is happening.  While there is untenanted land to be acquired not a sod of purchased land should be touched.  I might even go further and say that when all the untenanted land is eventually acquired&mdash;and I put in a proviso as to a few larger holdings of which the owners might be able to spare a patch&mdash;I doubt very much if it would be a wise principle to undo all that was fought for&mdash;to undo the benefits of land purchase.  Remember what is happening to tenants to-day, through the policy of the Land Commision. The partial confiscation which they suffer now may happen to the new recipients to-morrow.  In five years' time if this policy is to be pursued, and if there is to be another redistribution of the land, these recipients would have no security that the last stage of the agitation for land was not worse than the first.  It was thought that with the advent of a native Government, and with the attempts that have been made to improve the legislation of a foreign Government, tenant farmers would at <Col N="2232" /> last be secure, that they could sleep in comfort, without the fear of waking up to find that the farms they owned yesterday were to be taken from them. They were lulled into that belief and banks and others had the same degree of confidence when these tenants came to borrow money. No longer will the facilities that were hitherto extended to them exist. There are other methods of acquiring tenant-purchased land if the Land Commission are driven to that policy. I would like to emphasise that, if the State steps in and acquires any land, the full market value should be paid. The House was assured by various Ministers that if the State ever took such a step it would pay the full market value.  It was largely on such assurances that such an Act was permitted to go through this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>About 1933.  We were assured time and again&mdash;I can get the quotations and send them to the Deputy&mdash;that if the Government was driven to acquire land belonging to purchased holders they would get full and adequate compensation.  That is not being given.  Are agriculturists to be treated differently from other members of the community?  What is this going to lead to?  It means that holders of land will have no inducement to improve it, or to expend capital on property which, after a short time might be forcibly taken from them, at a tithe or a half of its value. There are other avenues open to the Government if they want to pursue this course.  Why not go into the open market, if they are prepared to give full market value for land?  There are in every county numerous farms and agricultural holdings for sale, the property of tenant purchasers.  No wrong will be done to anyone if the Land Commission pays the full market value for such land.  The owners are willing to sell and there is full consent to buy, so that there will be no agitation.  All that need be done is to pay the market value.  The <Col N="2233" /> Minister's answer will probably be that that would be too costly a procedure to engage in, as they would have to pay too much.  If that is so, is it not a clear admission that there is confiscation at present?  There is the rub.  The Government is attempting to carry out this policy in a manner that they would not attempt to pursue in connection with other problems. They are attempting to give these farms to people at very little cost to the State, while in fact other forms of relief, not offering the same benefit to the community, are largely financed at the expense of the State.  The policy of the Land Commission appears to be this: We will resume the farm of any tenant we like at any price we like, and the price we like will be the price at which we can let it to the incoming tenant.  That is a refutation of what we were led to expect when the original Act was passed.  If I remember aright at that time Deputy Haslett asked the Minister if the price that the Government would give, when acquiring a purchased holding, would be the full market price, or the price that the Land Commission could pay, so that it could be given to the allottees at a fair price.  The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The price the Land Commission will give will be the full market price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's promises are being departed from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is going to be any reality in debates in this House, if there is going to be any confidence amongst Deputies on either side, in statements made by Ministers, there should be some attempt to fulfil them. As far as the Land Commission is concerned, every promise made by every Minister in regard to the resumption of tenant holdings has been broken. We were assured, first of all, that Fianna Fáil were as anxious as we were to preserve the rights of the people on their lands.  They apparently are not, because in every county, almost in every district, tenant farmers are receiving notices that their lands are going to be inspected with a view to acquisition.  We were assured <Col N="2234" /> that if perchance the Government were forced&mdash;and they should not have been forced&mdash;to resume such lands, the price to be paid to the tenant would be the full market value.  That promise was definitely broken, because in any of the cases where land has been resumed the price paid has not represented the full market value or anywhere near the market value.  I think any Deputy who has any knowledge of the subject will bear me out in that statement.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in this policy which is greater than may appear from the present debate.  There is a danger to coming generations from this policy. There is a danger that the land question will never be finally settled in this country; that the division of land is going to proceed <i>ad infinitum.</i>  If to-day the Land Commission is compelled to divide land in which people felt they were in secure possession, in which they felt they were secured by Acts of Parliament, and if this land is distributed to other men, these men to whom it will be distributed will be in the same position in years to come as their predecessors were.  There will be further agitation, and there will be no surcease from agrarian troubles.  I hope, however, that we shall get some declaration from the Minister before the debate concludes that this practice of resuming land from the tenant farmers will be discontinued, that there will not be a general extension of that policy.  If, for any reason, some large holdings have perchance to be taken&mdash; by large holdings I mean holdings of about 200 acres&mdash;if, perchance, they have to resume any holdings, big or small, I want an assurance from the Minister that the promise given by other Ministers in this House, that the full market value will be paid, will be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance said it was a violation of the principles of justice.  I could read further extracts from the Minister for Finance, but I do not want to delay the House too long.  The Minister was more incensed at that particular policy than I could be.  Deputy Donnelly may say that the Minister for Defence is not the Minister I should quote.  I am quoting him because the Minister for Defence stood over there in that corner in charge of the Land Bill of 1933 which he shepherded through the House, and when we criticised the provisions of that Bill both he and the Minister for Agriculture made a similar statement. When we foresaw what is happening now, what any clear-thinking man might see, there was an explicit assurance given by the Minister that such a thing could not and would not happen, that the tenant farmer was as secure in Fianna Fáil hands as he could possibly be in ours, that he would not be interrupted in possession except in exceptional circumstances, and that if he were interrupted in possession, the full market value of the land would be paid.  I want the Minister now in charge of the Land Commission to say that, as far as he is concerned, if mistakes have been made of this kind they will not occur in future.  If there has been this tendency on the part of inspectors of the Land Commission&mdash;he may give the excuse, as Deputy Fitzgerald Kenney has stated, that it was done by bodies that are not under his control; that may possibly be the answer; it was given by the Parliamentary Secretary on another occasion. This is a matter that is entirely under the control of the Land Commission. These inspectors are officers of the Land Commission.  The men who are going to tell the Minister whether a particular holding should or should not be divided are inspectors of the Land Commission, and their salaries are charged to this Vote.  It is a matter on which a clear statement should, and I hope will, be made to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other matters in this Vote of a minor character to which I should like to refer.  One has reference to the actual division of <Col N="2236" /> lands.  Although I have criticised the Minister for acquiring the land of tenant farmers in a manner that should not be pursued by him, I am as anxious as any other Deputy in this House that, where possible, deserving people should be settled on the land.  I recognise, as any honest, fair-minded Deputy must, that that is one of the best forms of social advancement this State could pursue where it is possible.  The Minister referred&mdash;I think he rather referred to it in pride&mdash;to the recent tendency to give smaller parcels of land to allottees. I deprecate that practice.  I think it would be better to place ten people on holdings of land where they would have some hope of living successfully than to place 20 people on a similar area who could not possibly look forward to anything but poverty.  I do not at all agree with the policy of giving a man a parcel of land so small that he can scarcely exist on it.  That appears to be the tendency, because the Minister tells us that in two successive years, while the amount of land divided remained about the same, the number of allottees had increased out of all comparison, a sure proof that the tendency is to give smaller parcels of land to allottees.  That is a policy with which I, for one, am not in agreement.  I believe that, whatever we do, we ought to endeavour to give them as much land as will suffice for a bare existence.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the provision of houses for allottees The criticism is made in various parts of the country that the houses which are being built, while a large amount of money is being spent on them, are not of as substantial a type as they should be.  Adverse criticism has also been made in regard to the fencing of plots.  On the Vote for the Department of Local Government and Public Health, I spoke of the tendency to erect inadequate fences around labourers' cottages.  I have the same comment to make in regard to the fences erected between different holdings which are created.  The upkeep of these fences will entail considerable expense on the unfortunate holders afterwards.  When we are doing the thing at all, we should do it well. <Col N="2237" /> When we are dividing a farm amongst eight or ten people, we ought to make the fences sufficiently substantial to prevent the possibility of these people quarrelling about them in a year or two.  If what I suggest be not done then the fences that are being built by the Land Commission staff will be in need of repairs not in years but in months, with the result that you will have squabbles going on between adjoining land-holders as to the upkeep of the fences.  The fences made ought to be of a durable character.  I made the same suggestion when speaking on the Vote for the Department of Local Government as regard the fences around labourers' cottages.  As I said then, narrow bank fences are of very little use.  They will not last, and I suggest to the Minister, as I did to the Minister for Local Government, that when fences are being made around pieces of land they ought to be of a durable character.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will deal with the principal point I have raised on this Estimate, namely, the acquisition of land from purchased holders.</P>

      <P>We have listened to what I can only describe as a grand speech from Deputy Bennett on the division of land.  I congratulate him on that speech, because for years we have been listening to arguments from the Opposition to the effect that agriculture will not pay.  Despite all that, we had Deputy Bennett to-night advocating the division of land. Opposition Deputies listening to him must, I am sure, have felt, in view of the attitude they have taken up in this House to the agricultural policy of the Government, that something has gone wrong.  For years they have been telling us that land is good for nothing, and yet we had Deputy Bennett devoting a good part of his speech this evening to the question of advocating the division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain moneys are voted annually in this House for the upkeep of river embankments, and I think anyone who is acquainted with this problem will agree with me when I say that the amounts voted in the past have been totally inadequate.  The embankment problem is a very serious one for all parties concerned.  It has been troublesome and costly to the Land Commission, troublesome and costly to the owners, and I predict that it is going to be much more troublesome and much more costly in the future, for the reason that the lands protected by those embankments are used principally for the grazing of cattle, and since cattle values dropped below an economic point the owners of the land are not deriving any revenue from their holdings.  As a consequence, they are not able to put sufficient money into the annual maintenance of those embankments. The embankments are deteriorating, and, if those lands are to be saved, I believe that the Land Commission will have to step in sooner or later, and I think the sooner the better; it is going to be a very costly matter if it is deferred too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been interested in this question for a long time, and I have <Col N="2241" /> tried to induce the Land Commission to put the embankments maintenance on a more satisfactory footing.  So far I have not been very successful. When breaches occur and steps are not immediately taken to repair them, vast sums of public money are being squandered.  If an embankment breach is tackled within 24 hours, it may be repaired for perhaps the sum of £20, £30 or £40.  If it is allowed to continue for three or four days the sum necessary to repair it may be £400 or £500. On a certain occasion last September it came to my knowledge that breaches had occurred on the River Suir and the River Bride in County Waterford. I immediately wired the Land Commission to send an inspector there to see what steps should be taken to have the breaches repaired.  From previous experience I had a certain amount of doubt as to whether any action would be taken, and I came up to Dublin two or three days afterwards.  In the meantime I had not even got an acknowledgment to the wire, and no steps had been taken when I got here. I do not think that is a business-like way of dealing with this problem. In the next place, I think there is not sufficient co-operation between the Land Commission and the land owners.  I believe that, if the embankments are going to be properly kept, such co-operation is absolutely necessary. I would suggest to the Minister that this matter should now be investigated thoroughly, that a fund should be created for the maintenance of all river embankments, and that that fund should be administered by the Land Commission.  In the earlier Land Acts no provision was made for this maintenance work.  Trust funds were created under the subsequent Land Acts, but in most cases those funds are bound to be inadequate for their purpose.  I believe that, if things are allowed to drift as they are drifting at the present time, those lands will be lost to the State altogether.  They are valuable lands for their own purpose.  They are not arable, and in existing circumstances some relief will have to be afforded by the Government.  The only way in which that relief can be afforded is <Col N="2242" /> by creating an adequate fund for the future.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to refer.  I have been approached lately by a number of farmers who are unable to pay their Land Commission annuities and who wanted advice on the matter.  I told them to write to the Land Commission. They said they had done so and had not got any acknowledgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NocholasWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from recent statements made by Ministers here that if an annuitant was genuinely unable to pay, and made representations to the Land Commission, he would not be interfered with.  One man came to me and told me he was genuinely unable to pay.  I asked him would he declare that fact on oath. He said he was quite prepared to do so, but even that was not sufficient; the man's stock was seized.  I want to know how exactly a man like that can satisfy the Department that he is not in a position to pay.  I should be glad if the Minister would deal with that matter when he is replying. It is a very serious matter for those concerned, and I should like to know whether it is to be taken this way&mdash;that so long as a man has a four-footed beast on his holding he would be regarded as being in a position to pay the Land Commission annuities.  A man may have several animals on his holding and still be quite genuinely unable to meet his Land Commission annuity.  There may be other very pressing calls that he must answer, and I should like to know whether the Land Commission claim takes priority, and whether the Land Commission are going to insist, in those times of stress, that a man must make all the sacrifices possible and then be turned out on the road when he has done his best.  I do not think that is fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard a good deal to-night about the division of land. One would imagine from the speech of Deputy Donnelly that the Opposition, as he terms it, is against the <Col N="2243" /> division of land.  I never heard that policy advocated from those benches, good, bad or indifferent.  I have criticised the Land Commission in the past owing to the price which they were paying for land acquired, and I think the very fact of the decisions recently before the various courts has borne out the truth of my statements, because in cases where an appeal was made from the award of the commissioner it was increased considerably.  If land has to be divided, and I am not saying that it has not, I think it is the duty of the State to pay a reasonable price to the people from whom it is acquired. They are not all wealthy people from whom land is being acquired.  I hold that a price of £5 to £7 an acre is not a fair price for the Land Commission to pay for certain lands they acquire.  If land is to be acquired, I think it ought to be bought on a reasonable basis.  I do not approve of saddling the incoming tenant with a big rent, because he is unable to pay, and the Land Commission might just as well make up their minds at the outset that he must get it at an economic rent, and that the gap between the two will have to be met out of the Central Fund.  Give a man a chance of making good.  That is my policy briefly in connection with land division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to fences and matters of that sort upon which I will not comment, but, like my colleague, Deputy Wall, I want to emphasise this point about embankments. I live within a few miles of hundreds of acres of land which are flooded at the moment.  There is an absolute river flowing into these acres and I do not know when they will be of any use again.  I do not even know what is the law in the matter, but it is one which should be considered by the Land Commission.  If the tenant holders at present made a mistake in the past in accepting responsibility for the upkeep of these embankments, it has now come to the time when that error should be rectified. We have a home Government, and it ought to be their duty to <Col N="2244" /> remedy that state of affairs, because the longer these things are left unattended to, the worse the situation becomes in connection with the upkeep of these embankments.  As I say, I can see hundreds of acres flooded within a few miles of my own place, and when that land will be of any use again, I do not know.</P>

      <P>I might talk about that later on.  I have made a plea for those whom Deputy Donnelly is now taking under his wing, those people whom he is so glad to put into land, that they should get a fair chance to make good. If the State has to find the money, it must find it.  There is no use putting a man into a holding and saddling him with something he cannot meet.  The one thing I object to in connection with land division is the creation of uneconomic holdings&mdash;small holdings of seven and eight acres.  I do not see how a man can live on that.  I know that in my district the smaller farmers are really not farmers in the strict sense of the word.  They do a good deal of work on the roads, and, according to their statements to me, they derive a greater income from that than they do from the land.  That is what I find in connection with small holders, and I think it is a bad business to be creating more uneconomic holdings than we have at present.  I can see places in which it would be an acquisition to a district to acquire land, and I think that our Party does not stand for the non-division of land and never did.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnelly is in a very joyous mood this evening.  I am glad to see it, but the question of the division of land has no relation whatever <Col N="2246" /> to the annuities which the Land Commission have been collecting from the farmers.  It is a different matter. I explained my views in connection with the division of land, and I have now spoken about the hardship which the Land Commission are imposing on farmers up and down the country in the matter of land annuities.  I say that it is a serious problem, and, like Deputy Wall, I suggest that it would be well if we knew where we and the people stand in this respect.  It is well known, and Deputy Donnelly and every other Deputy here must know that there are many farmers in the country unable to meet the demands being made on them at present.  One would imagine from the activities of the Land Commission and the rate collectors that the farmers had no demands to meet, except the rates and land annuities. There are plenty other things in connection with the farmer's household, whether he is a big or small farmer, which have to be met besides rates and annuities, and I say that, in present circumstances, it is absolutely unfair for the Land Commission to be pressing so hard for land annuities.</P>
      <P>There is just one word more I should like to say in connection with land division.  I know good land which has been planted by the Land Commission, and I should like to know why.  I think it a very strange thing that the Land Commission should use arable land for reafforestation.  Probably some of the Land Commission officials will know the place I am referring to&mdash; Castlemorres.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th May.</P>
