      <P>asked the President whether his attention was directed to the announcement published in the <i>Irish Times</i> on December 17th last to the effect that an official of the British Dominions Office stated to newspaper representatives that his Department heard nothing of any application being made for permission to remove the remains of the late Roger Casement from the precincts of Pentonville Prison, London; whether in fact any application was made either officially or unofficially on behalf of any interest in this country to the British authorities for permission to remove these remains for reinterment in Ireland; and if so, whether he will indicate the outcome of such representations, and whether, if no such representations were made, he will now direct that formal application be made for the permission indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (a) the number of claims for widows' pensions, and (b) the number of claims for orphans' pensions received by him up to and including January 3rd, 1936; whether he will state further the number of (a) childless widows, (b) widows with dependent children, and (c) orphans, <Col N="5" /> to whom pensions were paid on January 3rd, 1936; whether he will state in respect of the childless widows, the average weekly rate of pension paid on January 3rd, 1936, and in respect of widows with dependent children the average number of such dependent children in respect of whom allowances were claimed and the average amount, including the children's allowances, paid to each such widow, and whether in respect of the orphans he will state the number of such orphans being maintained by guardians and the number maintained in institutions, and the average weekly payment in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of claims for widows' (non-contributory) pensions received up to and including 3rd January, 1936, is 21,351.  The number of claims for orphans' (non-contributory) pensions received up to and including 3rd January, 1936, is 470; the total number of non-contributory pensions paid to widows as from 3rd January, 1936, is 6,737.  It is not possible at present to state how many of that number were paid to childless widows and how many were paid to widows with dependent children, nor in the case of widows with dependent children the average number of such children in respect of whom allowances were claimed.  Arrangements are being made to have such statistics normally available in future but it is not considered desirable at this stage to occupy time in their extraction which should be devoted to the investigation of claims.  The average weekly rate of non-contributory pension paid to all widows is 6/8; the number of orphans in respect of whom pensions have been granted as from 3rd January, 1936, is 90, 84 of whom are being maintained by guardians.  In these cases the average weekly payment is 2/11.  It is not proposed to pay individual pensions weekly in the case of orphans maintained in institutions.  The payments will be made in bulk at the end of each half-year.</P>

      <P>As regards flour, I would refer the Deputy to a discussion on this matter in this House on the 10th December last.  The position has not altered in the meanwhile, and until I have reason to believe that the assurance given by the flour millers is not being observed I do not propose to interfere by legislation with flour prices.</P>

      <P>The complaints made to the Controller of Prices under Section 33 of the Control of Prices Act, 1932, in each year since the operation of the Act were in 1933, 69; in 1934, 71; in 1935, 24; and in the current year (to the end of January), 6; total 170.</P>
      <P>In more than 50 per cent. of these cases, investigation could not be made as the complaint referred to commodities not scheduled under the Act or the complainants refused to amplify or sustain their complaints.  In about 40 per cent. of the cases the prices charged were, after investigation, held to be reasonable.  Of the remainder prices were reduced in respect of seven important items in the cost-of-living figure as the result of action of the Price Controller.</P>
      <P>In no case has a price certificate been issued by the Controller.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that coal is 11/- per ton dearer in the Free State than in Northern Ireland, and if he can explain this discrepancy; and whether he proposes to take steps to see that the price of coal here will be more in keeping with prices prevailing elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that coal is 11/- per ton dearer in the Free State than in Northern Ireland.  All the information in the possession of my Department points to the fact that prices in Belfast are not at all lower than prices at corresponding centres in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that after the removal of the 5/- tax on coal on the 25th January the price charged to bellmen and other retailers for coal was 12/- more than the price obtaining on the 25th January last year; and if he will state the causes of this increased <Col N="11" /> price, and what steps, if any, he intends to take to remove these causes, with a view to bringing about a reduction in coal prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the prices charged to bellmen and other retailers for coal was 12/- more that the price obtaining on the 25th January, 1935.  My Department obtained written assurances from all registered coal importers who are vendors of coal that they would reduce their prices by not less than 5/- per ton on the 25th ultimo, in view of the fact that a refund was being made to such registered coal importers of the amount which could be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been paid as Customs duty in respect of coal held in stock by such importers at midnight on the 24th ultimo.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that statistics published by his Department show that the average cost per ton of household coal imported to the Free State in December last was only 3/10 more than the average cost per ton for household coal imported the previous January, while at the same time bellmen are being charged, with the 5/- off, 12/- more now than in January, 1935?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he is aware that the reduction given in the price of coal to consumers as a result of the removal of the 5/- per ton Customs duty as from the 24th January was only 5/- a ton, and whether he has inquired <Col N="12" /> why a greater reduction has not taken place, and, if so, with what result, and, if not, whether he proposes to make such inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  The question of the reduction in coal prices following the remission of the Customs duty on imported coal was discussed with coal importers.  The coal importers claim that their profit on sales of coal is based on a flat rate per ton, and that, when the Customs duty first became operative, their prices were increased by the amount of the duty only.  The position is still under review by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the increase in price of English coal in the Saorstát since October, 1935; whether he is aware that an increase of 5/- and in some cases 7/- per ton has taken place in the f.o.b. price of coal on the other side; whether, as a consequence of these increases, the price of coal is now dearer in the Saorstát than in October last in spite of the removal of the tariff; and whether, in the circumstances, he will consider the question of coming to some arrangement with Great Britain regarding prices, or in the alternative allowing foreign coal to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the price of English coal has advanced appreciably since October, 1935, due to the threat of a stoppage in the English coal mines which has dislocated conditions in the coal market generally. The disturbance to price and other conditions in respect of sales of coal has not been confined to this country, and the whole question of ensuring supplies of coal at reasonable prices, taking into consideration coal prices outside the Saorstát, is under active consideration in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the latter part of my question? With reference to what is known as the coal-cattle pact, has this Government made an arrangement with Great Britain regarding coal, and has the price of the coal been fixed?  It seems to me that the Government made an <Col N="13" /> arrangement to take coal solely from Great Britain but made no price, with the result that we are paying for the threat of a miners' strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>

      <P>Some applications for reinstatement have yet to be reported upon by the Committee of Inquiry into the cases of resigned or dismissed civil servants, and the proposed Bill cannot be put in its final form until all such cases have been disposed of.  Furthermore, in the course of the preparation of the Bill certain general superannuation questions of a rather complicated nature requiring considerable investigation and consideration have arisen and these have necessarily retarded completion of the Bill.  Everything possible is, however, being done to expedite its preparation, but it is unlikely to be introduced before the Easter recess.  Under the proposals which the Bill will contain, no reinstatee will suffer by reason of delay in introducing the measure.</P>

      <P>In view of the passing into law of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1935, it is not now necessary for wheat growers to become registered and, accordingly, a register of wheat growers is no longer kept.</P>
      <P>Steps have already been taken to warn farmers against the risks of sowing winter varieties of wheat when the time for so doing has passed and in addition to the issue of reminders, to growers and to seed merchants, on the subject, the importation of seed of winter varieties will not be permitted after a certain date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 29 and 30 together, as the information asked for appears to be the same in each case.  The regulations made under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts do not require maize millers to state specifically, in the monthly returns furnished by them, the quantity of maize meal mixture manufactured by them in each month, and the extraction of this information from the returns would involve a considerable amount of time and trouble.  As, however, the returns show the quantities of maize meal mixture sold in each month, I can arrange, if such particulars would meet the Deputy's requirements, to have the total sales of maize meal mixture in each calendar month of 1935 furnished to him as soon as the information has been compiled. The returns in respect of January, 1936, are not yet available, as millers are allowed a period of seven days after the end of the month in which to furnish the prescribed returns.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state why the application of James McClafferty, Dunlewey, County Donegal, Reference No. G.A. 17556, for a grant under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act was refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the five-roomed house in the occupation of the applicant was suitable and sufficient for the proper and healthy accommodation of the applicant and his family without the improvement by addition there to carried out by the applicant, the case did not come within the provisions of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts and accordingly a grant could not be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether his attention has been directed to a statement that artistes who travelled from County Donegal to fulfil engagements with 2RN received £2 remuneration; whether he is aware that this sum would not pay their railway fare for the journey, and whether with a view to encouraging exponents of traditional music to foster their art, he will increase the remuneration in such cases.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any case in which an artiste from County Donegal who travelled to Dublin solely for the purpose of fulfilling a broadcasting engagement received a fee of £2.  If, however, the Deputy will supply me with particulars of any such case I will make further enquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, the fee is fixed on the programme value of the performance. Sometimes the fee is £6 6s. 0d., sometimes it is £3 3s. 0d., and sometimes it is £2 2s. 0d., which is the minimum. We will not undertake, however, to pay the top fee to anyone who happens to come along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>If that is so, how can the Minister hope to do it if he offers a fee to the exponents of that traditional music that will not be sufficient to pay their railway fare to Dublin? If I provide evidence of the fact that such exponents, in fact, have to travel from Donegal and did, in fact, receive no more than £2 0s. 0d., will he undertake to increase the remuneration which they actually received in order to compensate them for their expenses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, the programme value of the performance must be taken into consideration, and I may tell the Deputy that very often the station arranges with these artistes, when there is some other business, but as a general rule they will only pay according to the programme value.  With regard to the question of encouraging traditional music, the Deputy is probably aware that the new Director of Broadcasting has arranged local centres from which, from time to time, broadcasts are given, and in that way, I think, very good work is being done.  As I have already pointed out, the fee varies, but we are not going to pay the average performer the very top fee.</P>

    <P>It will be remembered that after a full debate in this House on the subject matter of this Bill, that is to say, the discontinuance of the separate representation of Universities in Dáil Eireann, the Constitution Amendment No. 23) Bill was passed by Dáil Eireann and sent to the Seanad on the <Col N="47" /> 5th July, 1934.  The Bill was rejected by Seanad Eireann on the 18th July, 1934.  Under the provisions of Article 38A of the Constitution, Dáil Eireann may now resolve that this Bill be again sent to Seanad Eireann.  I ask the Dáil so to resolve in order that the rejection of the Bill by the Seanad may not be allowed to prevail against the considered decision of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once more, I think, we have occasion to admire the extreme modesty of the Vice-President. It becomes him well.  There are few members on the Government Bench whom it becomes so well.  I am sorry, however, that the man who backed this Bill is not here.  I think we had occasion to call attention to that before. I think I am correct in stating that this Bill was backed by the President and introduced originally by him.  I regret that the President is not hereat least, that the Chancellor of one of the Universities is not here&mdash;to justify the disfranchisement of one of the bodies with which he is connected and which honoured him by electing him as Chancellor.  Further, I consider that this is purely a destructive measure, and the President is obviously a person much more fitted to pilot this Bill through the House than the Vice-President.  The whole conception at the back of this proposed abolition of University representation fits in better with the rigid mind of the head of the Government than it does with the Minister who has taken on responsibility for the measure that we are now discussing: with his desire for uniformity at all costs.  That, at least, is the most charitable explanation that can be put on the effort to pass this Bill into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid there are other explanations, but it is the rigid mathematical mind&mdash;I might say the arithmetical mind of the President&mdash;that this would most appeal to: that any arguments put forward, if any are put forward, in favour of this Bill would appeal to.  But just as in the case of the Seanad, when this House, or at least an important body in this House asked for some safeguard, <Col N="48" /> instead of a working safeguard in the shape of a Second House, he offered us an arithmetical fraction. That was the best he could do to contribute to the constitutional building up of the country.  It would be much more fitting that that particular Minister should have taken charge of this Bill rather than the mild mannered and by no means so destructive Vice-President who has been saddled with the responsibility.</P>
    <P>We have listened in vain for any solid argument in favour of what is essentially a work of destruction.  It has not been shown that University representation has done any damage either to the Constitution or to the development of the country.  On the contrary, I think, notwithstanding what some people on this side might consider partial exceptions, University representation in this country has justified itself in the way in which the members elected have taken part in the Government of the country and in the work of this House.  I consider that nothing, except a purely rigid mathematical cleaving to mere formulæ, could be adduced in justification for the pushing through of this measure. But, of course there are other reasons. Even so, it is a pity to sacrifice a portion of the Constitution that has worked out so well, that has proved so beneficial to this country, merely to satisfy an arithmetical prejudice&mdash;and that is the best that can be said about it.  But other, more sordid, motives are at the back of this.</P>
    <P>If any representation has been justified in this country, the University representation has.  I cannot speak too highly of the part played by my own University in the establishment of this State and in the development of the State once it was established.  I do not care how blind Party prejudices may be; I think anybody who looks back over the history of this country for the last couple of decades must acknowledge the part played by University representatives.  They played both an honourable and a useful part in the service of the nation.  And, by the absence of that class of representation the nation will lose considerably. It is nothing less than a seandal that in order to satisfy at the best, as <Col N="49" /> I say, a mathematical prejudice&mdash; although in reality it is to seek a temporary Party advantage&mdash;what has proved so useful to the State is now to be scrapped.</P>
    <P>I need hardly mention the very honourable, the onerous and constructive part played by the representatives of my own University in connection with the government of the country. I do not think any Party prejudice, no matter how deep-rooted it may be, can possibly overlook these services, and they should not be overlooked.  If the members of the Government Party are dissatisfied with their particular University representatives, that is for them to say.  We on our side certainly are not dissatisfied with ours.  The life of this nation, the intellectual and industrial life, would have been very different had we not some of those representatives in this House.  If I may say so of the representatives of the other University, anybody who has been in this House for the last 13 years will admit that their contribution to the debates here&mdash;they have not occupied official positions in the Government&mdash;have been exceedingly useful. They have often brought to the consideration of important technical subjects a calmness of mind and a calmness of statement that was sometimes missing from the two principal Parties here.  If I might say it without at all intending to patronise, I think the part played by the representatives of the University to which I do not belong has been a useful and an honourable part, and the debates here would have been the poorer without the contributions that they have often made.</P>
    <P>Let me make one suggestion so far as some of the principal motives at the back of this Bill are concerned.  If the Government at all believes in giving fair play to a scattered minority in this country, if they believe in giving fair play to a minority scattered over the different constituencies, then they are not showing very much sympathy when they propose to abolish this University representation.  I am not asking for privileges for any class, but I think there was an opportunity here of giving representation to a class that otherwise would not be represented, <Col N="50" /> giving representation to people scattered through the country that they cannot get through the medium of the ordinary constituencies.  It is most regrettable that the Government do not see that or, if they do see it, that they do not act up to what they profess to believe.  Even if Universities had not representation, the Government should have grasped at the opportunity of giving a scattered class like that representation.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that they get anything beyond what their mere numbers should entitle them to&mdash;nothing more than that.  But if you do insist, as very often you do, in treating them as a separate class, you might at all events give them some such representation as their numbers entitled them to, merely as a part of the State and a class that otherwise will not get representation.  I am not asking that they get enough representation to sway the councils of this country&mdash;that is out of the question.  I am asking, however, that their voices should be heard. If you take the two Universities of this country that you now propose to disfranchise, I say that, since the foundation of this State, they have played an honourable part in the development of the State and they certainly deserve better recognition than is being given to them now by this Government.  It is not the spirit in which institutions that have served the nation and proved their value should be treated.  I believe that a mere narrow calculation of a temporary advantage and nothing more is at the back of this Bill and it is a pity that what are higher considerations should be left out.  We had once in the University to which I belong a Chancellor who struggled for representation for the University, a man whose services in every sphere to this country are above all doubt. I am sorry that we are not in that position at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that University representation in the last 13 or 14 years has given you in this House representatives who are exceedingly useful; who have played their part in the building up of the Government and of the industries of this country.  I do not think anybody can <Col N="51" /> deny it.  I have spoken of the contribution by the members of my own University to the building up of the culture and the politics of this State. Anybody who has been here can appreciate the contributions of the representatives of the University to the debates of this House.  It is a pity, in pursuit of a mere temporary Party advantage, that what time and experience have justified should be thrown away like this.  We are told that they can get elected for other constituencies. Some of them can if they want to; others cannot.  You speak of the respect you have for the rights of minorities.  What chance have certain minorities now under your Revision of Constituencies Bill and this Bill?</P>

      <P>You have gone as far as you can to kill the system of proportional representation.  You object to those University representatives. Why?  Because you say that <Col N="52" /> the Universities are over represented? Very good; is killing the representation a remedy for that?  Does that objection come well from a Party that has cut down seven-member constituencies to three-member constituencies. so that a 30,000 vote will have the same representation as a 20,000 vote?  Is that your idea of proportional representation? The Government has killed proportional representation as far as it can.  It has done everything possible to see that minorities cannot be represented in this House.  As I say, there are Members for Universities who, if they want to, can get elected for other constituencies.  There are others who can not, and I think the House will be poorer without their presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the extreme usefulness to this country of the presence in this House of University representatives, but I think it is also worth while making a special representation for the class that is represented.  We hear a lot in theory&mdash;I am afraid it is only theoretical&mdash;about love of education. We claim to be not merely the island of saints but also of scholars.  You do not show much respect for it in this particular Bill, when you have a chance of showing a little honour to it.  Merely because temporarily it is a slight disadvantage to the Party opposite we are determined not to show honour to it.  When it comes to anything practical, then all our protestations remain merely protestations; they have no practical results.  I can speak on this, not being a University representative myself, and I think this House or any assembly in this country will be poorer without the presence of the type of representative that has been sent forward by the Universities.  I would ask you&mdash;I suppose it is too late &mdash;not to interfere with a provision of the Constitution which has proved itself useful, and which has enabled such representatives to sit here on those benches and take part in the government of the country. That should not be interfered with merely in order to gain a temporary Party advantage.  If higher education stands for anything, and if we really have any sincerity in the respect which, in words at all events, we show for education, can we <Col N="53" /> not give some practical effect to those words?  When there is an opportunity of honouring that particular walk in life why cannot we do it?  It is not a question of taking a new step; it is merely a question of preserving what is already there.  Why go out of our way deliberately to inflict this particular slight on a form of activity that is not too highly developed in this country?</P>
    <P>If we believe&mdash;and I presume there may be a certain amount of reality in our occasional professions&mdash;that higher education is of some value; that it stands for, or ought to stand for, a certain broadness of view why cannot the House act up to professions of that kind, instead of trampling them at the very first opportunity?  I am not suggesting, and I never did suggest, that soundness of view is an essential difference between the highly educated and the ordinary man.  I am making no such pretence, but I think that the educated view ought to be represented.  It is in keeping with the dignity and with what we would like to think should have been the tradition of this country to go out of our way if necessary to show honour to education, and I certainly do not think the Government is doing it in this particular instance.  Notwithstanding all our professions I know it is not altogether an easy thing to speak up for education in this country, or to ask that a certain amount of respect be shown to it.  I know it is difficult; I know it is sneered at; I know there are Deputies in this House to whom such a consideration will make no appeal.  I doubt if there are other countries in central or western Europe where such an appeal could not be successfully made; but I know that very often the first answer to an appeal of that kind will not be an answer which has been given calm consideration.  Very often the answer is sneers.  I think even to gain a passing temporary Party advantage it will not be worth the Government's while to force through a Bill of this kind.  The question of University representation drew Deputy Mrs. Concannon to her feet to break her silence even, if she will permit me to <Col N="54" /> say so, if it were only to be guilty of constitutional hari-kari.</P>
    <P>The Government should not rush through legislation having the implications that this legislation has, without very much more consideration.  They should not look to the present or to the immediate future but to the future in general.  If we could go out of our way in this country to honour education we should do so rather than take a step, which, however you like to cloak it, is beyond question a step in the opposite direction.  Perhaps the Minister on whose shoulders has been thrust the responsibility for this Bill may be able to give me information on this&mdash;what provision of a transitional character has been made to see that University constituents who have a right to be on the University Register are not entirely disfranchised?  Has any legislation been contemplated to prevent these classes from being disfranchised? If not why not?</P>
    <P>This Bill has its origin solely in the fact that University voters did not follow the Whip of the Government. They are to be punished because the Government believes that on the balance it would gain a couple of votes if the Universities were deprived of their representation.  That really is the root of this whole business and there is no use in overlooking that fact. It is about time we either gave up the lip homage we pay to education or else that we should honour education when we have the chance of doing so.  We ought to honour it in some practical fashion.  An ex-member of the Executive Council, Deputy Geoghegan, at University College spoke of the rôle Universities could play in political life.  He did that at the time when his Government and his Party were hastening to deprive Universities of representation.  We have had lip homage from the Government members but no more.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the Government side have had their chance and they cannot say that University representation has not justified itself.  The Government Party may say what they like about their own representatives but so far as the other representatives in this House are concerned I challenge them to deny that the Opposition representatives. <Col N="55" /> sent into this House by the Universities, have not contributed more than their share to the consideration of matters brought before the House?  I challenge them to say that they have not contributed more than their share to the building up of the nation.  If Deputies will look at it merely from the practical point of view I think they must agree that they are inflicting a loss not merely on the Universities and on University graduates but on the country as well.</P>
    <P>Why should you have representation only on a territorial basis?  What is there sacrosanct about a territorial basis?  Surely it is not less but more constituencies of the type of Universities that we should look for if we can conveniently get them.  That is what we should aim at instead of trying to abolish vocational constituencies of this type.  Deputies should try to get some more representation of that kind in this House.  If they did, the House, from the point of view of giving keener consideration to legislation, would be a more useful Assembly. Such representatives would certainly contribute useful views to the debate and would give greater consideration to measures brought forward.  If future representatives would follow on the same lines as University representatives have, up to this, or even to a fraction of that extent, it would be a great gain.  Impartial minds would admit that that type of representation has justified itself.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that the Government is going along its present lines in this matter.  I am sorry for that for very many reasons.  Merely counting individuals, counting heads and leaving out institutions is not necessarily correct.  That is the most that can be said for what the Government is doing.  It would be much more healthy in the long run if institutions like the Universities were represented instead of mere individuals.  The very best that the Fianna Fáil Party can claim is that the Universities are over-represented. Now that is coming rather badly from a Government Party one of whose steps was, as far as they could, to make proportional representation absurd.  It comes very badly <Col N="56" /> from a Party that have made in some cases 25,000 votes the equivalent of 35,000 votes.  In the circumstances is it not strange to find them getting so meticulous in the matter of figures when it concerns University representation? When they have done these things down the country it does not seem worth while to be so meticulous about University figures.  But they merely consider the Party advantages which they hope for in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>In an &ldquo;island of scholars,&rdquo; if it is found that the Universities were over-represented, the obvious remedy was not total abolition, but the cutting down of their representation.  There is no reason why constituencies should be territorially bound down, unless you have that rigid mind which is rigid only when some Party advantage is to be got.  There is no argument on that side.  There are reasons to the contrary.  You had here working institutions and, instead of keeping them, you prefer to destroy them.</P>
    <P>Deputies in this House, and people in the country generally, profess a great deal of respect for education, particularly for higher education. But the majority in this House by its vote shows really what it thinks of higher education.  The contributions that we have had in the course of these debates show pretty clearly, and give an indication to the country of the real value that the Fianna Fáil Party attach to higher education.  Is it pretended that there is anything against democratic principles in having University representation?  I could understand an objection of that kind if those who vote in the Universities had also a vote elsewhere.  But they have not.  The University graduate must make his choice just the same as anybody else has to make his choice between two constituencies.  Just as an elector who has a vote in two constituencies has to decide in which constituency he is going to vote, so also has the University graduate to make his choice between his vote in the University and his vote in the constituency in which he resides.  The parrot repetition that this is undemocratic is merely a hark back to the time when in the United Kingdom, as <Col N="57" /> it then was, University voters could also vote elsewhere.  There is nothing even against the theory, much less against the practice, of democracy in giving University representation.  In this country, on the contrary, from the purely democratic point of view, a great deal can be said for it&mdash;certainly a great deal more can be said for it than against it.</P>
    <P>What is the calculation at the back of this legislation?  At present there are six University representatives in this House: two of them belong to the Government Party, one belongs to us, and three are Independents who, the Government Party think, vote too frequently against them.  They may not be quite sure, of course, about keeping, in fact I should say they are almost certain of losing, one of the two National University representatives. That little calculation is possibly at the back of their minds.  And it is petty calculations of this kind, not any respect for democratic principle, that really have induced the Government to do away with University representation.  That is the real thing.</P>
    <P>What do the speeches from the Government Benches on this particular matter amount to?  An attack on the people whom they call ex-Unionists &mdash;nothing else.  I object to the phrase ex-Unionists.  I have never heard anything obstructive to the development of this nation coming from representatives of Trinity College.  I have been in this House 13 years and nothing obstructive to any big national development came from them.  Do you object to representation of conservative opinion?  Let us leave the question of ex-Unionists out.  I do not believe there is any such thing now. That is a thing of the past.  They are not Unionists.  Their conduct in this House shows that they are not Unionists.  They may be conservative, if you like, but surely it is not harmful to have conservative representation in this House.  They represent a certain body of opinion in this country that ought to be represented.  The bulk of the representatives in this country through any Party are not conservatives in their temperament&mdash; they are quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> There is no fear that this conservative representation&mdash;if that is what you object to&mdash;will sway the decisions of this House&mdash;it will not.  But any minority, even a conservative minority, ought to have the right to have their views heard.  This particular body that is represented by the representatives of Trinity College are scattered all over the country.  Whatever way you like to look at it, as far as they are concerned, you are disfranchising them to a large extent, and you are introducing this legislation in order to disfranchise them.  That is one of your particular purposes.  You speak then of equal treatment for everybody.  It is completely lacking. You should make some effort to make your actions square with your professions.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think the part played in this State and in this House by the University representatives for the last 13 or 14 years is a part that the Universities have every reason to be proud of.  It is a poor return for the way in which these members helped in the building up of the State that they should now be kicked out.  What you are really objecting to is the representation of a conservative point of view. This country is radical enough&mdash;most of us tend in that particular way.  I see no objection to the other point of view being occasionally put before us. That is all that is asked when you are asked to keep on the representation of one of the Universities.  I cannot speak too highly of the part played by my own University during these years in the building up of this State&mdash;the part that it was able to play in the building up of the State and in building up the industries of the country&mdash; because it was represented in the Parliament of this nation.  Whatever Party bitterness there may be in this House, I doubt whether anybody in his heart of hearts could deny the honourable and great part played by men who got into this House because there was University representation. Now, in the pursuit of a temporary Party advantage, as you think, you are prepared to sacrifice the opportunity of that being continued.</P>
    <P>So far as our Party is concerned, we have nothing but admiration and <Col N="59" /> pride for the particular representatives that our Party got into this House from the Universities.  This Dáil and this country would be very much the poorer had you not these University representatives here.  It is simply shutting our eyes to the realities of the situation and it is a very poor return made for the excellent work that the Universities, through their representatives, were able to do that you should now proceed to disfranchise them.  These two constituencies, to one of which I belong myself, have played their part as no other constituency in this country has in building up this State.  I can say that particularly for the University to which I belong and pay a tribute also to the valuable contributions which have been made here in every class of debate by the representatives of the other University to which I do not belong.</P>
    <P>You are going to destroy, for petty Party advantages as I say, a portion of our Constitution that has proved useful.  You are doing it in response to no principle, because there is no question here of a double vote.  You are doing it merely in order to gain a temporary Party advantage, as I say, and you are going to inflict damage on the nation by doing it, because I believe, and I think there are members on the opposite benches also who believe with me, that the work of this country and the work of this House would not have been as well done had we not had University representatives here in the last 13 years.  I challenge anybody with any respect for the truth to differ with me in that assertion.  Now you are going to scrap it, not in order to help the nation but to gain a temporary Party advantage at the next election.  It may be worthy of the majority Party in this House, but it is not worthy of this nation.  I am sorry that the Government think it necessary to proceed on the lines on which they are proceeding.  Apart from sordid Party considerations they are sacrificing real values to abstract theory and their abstract theory is bad.</P>

      <P>This measure for the disfranchisement of the Universities, and depriving them of their due <Col N="60" /> and rightful place in the government of the country, is to my mind a shocking, scandalous, and foolish proposal. Trinity College, I will admit, was founded to establish and consolidate Ascendancy in this country.  But under the genial rays of education and culture there came forth from within its walls some of the noblest and greatest patriots that ever fought for or shed lustre on their native land.  On a former occasion I mentioned many of them; on this occasion I should like to add Molyneux, who wrote the famous &ldquo;The Case of Ireland Stated&rdquo; in 1698, when his book was burned by the common hangman.</P>
      <P>No one will deny that the students and graduates of the National University helped, in a great measure, to create and build up the Free State and place it on a solid foundation.  I think then that the country owes a debt of gratitude to both these institutions.  In addition to what they have done in the past it ought not to be forgotten that the representatives of both Universities have at all times rendered invaluable services to and maintained the prestige of An Dáil.  That is looking at the matter from the special point of view that has been dealt with at great length and with great lucidity by Deputy O'Sullivan, who is much better qualified than I to speak on such a subject.  I should like to say a word about it on a broader issue.  This Bill is, in my humble opinion, founded upon a very unsound basis.  I am a thorough and unrepenting believer in adult suffrage, but it ought to be remembered that, in the case of the Universities, each University is a centre of thought and a focus from which there is diffused, and radiated throughout the country, culture and thought and everything that helps to make our citizens pre-eminent in the civic virtues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forerunners of the French Revolution preached the doctrine of &ldquo;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.&rdquo; That travelled across the Atlantic to the United States and resulted in the famous shot that rang around the world; and the principle of human equality was firmly embedded in the Declaration of Independence.  But while that is a very good working rule, and while I am an upholder of <Col N="61" /> democracy in the most intensive form, there are still certain limitations.  The theory that all men are equal is one of the falsest that was ever palmed off on any human race.  Undoubtedly they are equal in many respects.  They all stand or ought to stand equal before the law; they are no doubt all equal at the Lord's Table, and there are certain physical characteristics common to all. If you prick us do we not bleed?  If you tickle us do we not laugh?  Still, it must be admitted, and cannot be denied, that men fundamentally differ, intellectually, morally and physically. For instance, is it not the case that no one would put Thersites or Cleon on the same pedestal with the President? No one would think of comparing Annanias with our respected Vice-President, and surely no one would dream of comparing Cacus, the cattle stealer, with the Minister for Agriculture. So much for the intellectual line. In the same way with regard to physical ability, no one would back Tom Thumb against Eugene Sandow, and no one would pit the Hunchback of Notre Dame against Dan O'Mahony. What I want to impress upon the House is that while equality is a good working rule there are certain limitations. John Stuart Mill was a very advanced democrat.  He was a great upholder of the utilitarian policy which was really founded upon the assumption that all men were equal.  Still, when he had reached his mature years he produced an illuminating work on representative government&mdash;I am sure my friend Deputy Eamon Donnelly is familiar with every line of it&mdash;and in that he laid down the principle of universal but graduated adult suffrage. That is, he would give every man a vote, but to some people according to their ability or their information or their prestige or some special qualification he would give more than one vote. That principle is impracticable in ordinary electoral life and the only case I submit in which it can be applied is in the case of the university.  University graduates are an especially qualified, cultured and educated body of men.  I think that on general principles, as well as out of consideration for the great services which they have rendered to the State in many departments, it is really a disgrace.  I am sure <Col N="62" /> nobody on the opposite benches is very proud of a Bill to deprive Universities of the representation which they have hitherto enjoyed, and which they richly deserved.  I am very much surprised to see such a distinguished scholar and such a great contributor to Irish literature as Deputy Mrs. Concannon voting for the disfranchisement of the University that she has so well and so ably represented.  The Attorney-General should be very slow to cast a vote in favour of the motion before the House. I suppose the Attorney-General will soon be landed in a much more important sphere than the one he now occupies.  When he gets there I wish him the best of luck.  I appeal in all sincerity to the members of Fianna Fáil to consider carefully and to weigh with calmness all the pros and cons of this Bill.  No harm will be done the country or to any Party by doing that, while a great deal of harm might be done to the country and its prestige damaged very badly by the passage of this Bill by a majority in this House.</P>

      <P>I determined not to traverse the old arguments.  It would only weary the House and weary myself, and be perfectly futile in the result, to repeat the old arguments and debate a lot of nonsense about democracy&mdash;pure formulism of the textbook&mdash;that has been brought out to bolster up this attack on the representation&mdash;peculiar, I admit&mdash;which brings me into this House.  I am to leave it soon.  If I thought it was the universal desire of the House that I, and the people I represent, should be silenced and their views unheard, or that we were unwelcome in this legislative assembly of Irishmen, I would pass out from your company in silence and wish you God speed.  But I do not believe that is the universal desire of the House or the feeling of the country. I know that personally I have not been a brilliant politician.  I did not come in here to be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came in here to help bind up old wounds, to try to build up a shattered Ireland.  I gave away a lot as I took over a lot, glad indeed to stand side by side with my fellow-Irishmen.  I had hoped that we were to build up a great country and an united people, <Col N="63" /> but here we are back again in Party Government, scowling at one another across the old fences.  That is what I wish had not occurred.  The University I represent I am not ashamed of.  She may not be sinless.  If men lived for 300 years there would be a few sins that history might record against them.  From her foundation three and a half centuries ago my University was privileged or honoured to send members to speak the minds of their constituents in Parliament.  Amongst the list of its members are many honourable names, names that everyone in this House honours, as of men whom they are proud to call their countrymen.  I cannot help deploring, and I cannot help thinking with great sadness, that that list ends now.  My constituents, scattered far and wide (and not merely over Ireland but overseas, because we know no frontiers), will regret it.  I think the President and the Party he represents are making a great political blunder, even regarding this matter from the point of view of expediency, in the step that they have taken.  It is said that we are claiming a privilege.  I do not want to claim a privilege, but I want the people I speak for to be represented. I do not see how they can be represented under the present system unless we have something like University representation in Parliament.  The graduates are scattered widely and, being small in number, cannot combine effectively.  Frankly I may say that perhaps they are too shy to come forward.  There may be too many University representatives in the Dáil but that is another question.  I hold that University representation for the present, at least, is essential, when we look at the history of this country and at its condition.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be tedious and I do not want to bring a note of reproach or bitterness into what I am saying, but I think I should say something about some remarks the President made recently in a speech dealing with the Seanad, in which he spoke rather to my colleague, Deputy Thrift, and myself, and reminded us of a more or less confidential meeting.  The President told us of the things he had then <Col N="64" /> hoped from us.  He told the House that he was disappointed in us, that we had not fulfilled the hopes he had then formed of us.  I hope he will not think I am reproaching him.  I may have misunderstood him; but I am disappointed also because he held out hopes and promises of a finer future. He had a function for us, perhaps that of general peacemakers, angels of light and peace, and he promised that he would help us to do everything to mend up old rifts in this country.  I felt that he had travelled very far from those days when he made the speech recently in the Dáil.  I felt that he was speaking simply as a leader of a Party, not as a statesman, not as a man going to bring the whole country together, not as a man behind whom I could fall in and follow.  Then he revealed a motive for this step.  As I have the thought in my mind I had better get it off.  I cannot help thinking that this step is taken as a punitive step because we did not vote with his Party on certain occasions, or perhaps on all occasions.  If that is so, it is rather a pity.  It is certainly unworthy of the leader I had hoped he would be.  I am disappointed in many ways, disappointed with what the President did, and as regards the dreams the President made me dream, disappointed with the hopes that I now discover were quite illusive, and disappointed with half-promises which I find were simply deceits.  Into the theory of University representation and all the arguments, academic and otherwise, I shall not enter now.  I simply wish again to record my protest against this measure as being one that will have unfortunate and disruptive consequences in this country.</P>

      <P>The great difficulty that some people have in this country in understanding President de Valera's attitude to them is as a result of their inability to understand what President de Valera means by an honest man. President de Valera, when he speaks of an honest and independent-minded man, means a man who has agreed with President de Valera on Monday, who continues to agree with President de Valera when President de Valera has changed his mind on Tuesday, and <Col N="65" /> who is prepared to say on Tuesday: &ldquo;If, on Wednesday, you intend to change your mind, drop me a postcard and I will change mine too.&rdquo; That is President de Valera's conception of an independent and honest Deputy, but I have not the slightest doubt that if the facts were properly faced, and if the Deputies representing Trinity College had been prepared to give an undertaking in that sense to President de Valera, their position and integrity in this House would have been guaranteed by President de Valera for all time.  The moment they have failed to do that, they go the way of every other man whom President de Valera can destroy and who announces his intention of using the intellect God gave him without regard to the preconceived prejudices of President de Valera.</P>
      <P>Why did President de Valera abolish the Seanad?  He abolished the Seanad because he could neither intimidate it nor buy it.  Why did President de Valera abolish University representation? He abolished University representation because he can neither intimidate it nor buy it, and President de Valera nurses in his mind at the present time ambitions to intimidate or buy every body of people in this country who are prepared to oppose him without counting the cost.  My hope and prayer is that he will discover the futility of that ambition before it leads the whole nation into a disaster from which we shall never be able to recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an interesting thing that the latest technique of legislation in this country is that when the President of the Executive Council makes up his mind to use his machine majority, to use his subservient slaves, the members of his Party, to do this particularly dirty kind of work, he shrinks from the responsibility of coming in and leading in the work of destruction. The Minister for Justice was sent in to propose the abolition of the Parliamentary Opposition on the occasion of the Uniforms Bill.  Senator Bill Quirke, as that distinguished legislator pleases to describe himself, was sent to the Seanad to invite the independent minded Senators to undertake their own destruction.  President de <Col N="66" /> Valera was described as sitting down stairs in a temper because somebody had been rude to him.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is sent in here to do the dirty work to-day.  The President is, no doubt, sitting upstairs in his office, with a basin of water, washing his hands and assuring his confidential Private Secretary that he is not responsible for the blood of this just man.</P>
    <P>We can argue theoretically <i>ad nauseam</i> about the proper way in which to secure Deputies to carry on the government of this country, and, having argued <i>ad nauseam</i>, we shall have progressed not a single inch, because in matters of this kind what really carries conviction to the mind of a rational man are the fruits of experience. One thing is apparently certain wherever democracy holds sway, and that is that we must have as the foundation upon which to build a legislative assembly, universal suffrage. That may be a perfect or imperfect system, but certain it is that in this age, and as far as rational foresight can foresee, every adult man and woman must have a voice in the choice of the legislators, and, through them, of the Government under which they propose to live.  Experience, however, seems to prove that a House of Representatives chosen by that universal suffrage derives great advantage from the leaven introduced into it by the Universities representation.</P>
    <P>Take this Dáil of which we are members and let the most prejudiced Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches ask himself this question: Will the House be poorer or richer for the disappearance from its ranks to-morrow of the Attorney-General, Deputy Mrs. Concannon, Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Thrift, Deputy Alton, and Deputy Dr. Rowlette?  I may differ profoundly, and do, from the political convictions of Deputy Mrs. Concannon and the Attorney-General.  I am perfectly certain that every Deputy on these benches, and indeed on the centre benches, would regret their departure and believes that their presence contributes much to our deliberations.  I venture to think that the most prejudiced <Col N="67" /> Deputy on that side of the House, who most bitterly resents the trenchant clarity of Deputy McGilligan's mind and speeches in this House, would agree with me that the deliberations of any legislative assembly would be the poorer for his absence.  The Deputies from Trinity College have, in my opinion, contributed very largely to such good work as this House may have done.  I do not accept the thesis that the Deputies from Trinity College represent ex-Unionists.  I know amongst them some who were hard-fighting and gallant Nationalists, in the highest sense of that term, when, from the material point of view, it was no advantage to a Trinity man to be such a thing.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is relevant to go into the question of what their political associations may have been in the past, but I think it is right to say this, that there may be a body of people in this country of an extremely conservative view who might hope to get representation in Trinity College, but I do not accept the thesis that the graduate body of Trinity College will send to this House exclusively extreme conservatives, and I do not look on the representatives of Trinity College we have in the House to-day as extreme conservatives.  It is invidious to examine the political faith of any particular Deputy in a detached way in his presence, but I make no reflection on Deputy Thrift or Deputy Alton if I venture to say that I cannot conceive a less hide-bound conservative mind than that of Dr. Rowlette. Sometimes I find him a little too radical and sometimes I find him surrendering what I consider to be liberal principles in order to go further in a radical direction than I think it wiser to go.  Let me add that I would not hesitate to turn with confidence to Deputy Thrift or Deputy Alton for support in any proposal, no matter how radical, if I believed I could carry conviction to their minds that it was in the best interests of the country that such a scheme should be adopted by this Legislature.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to speak with that detachment with which we <Col N="68" /> should speak when examining this question, but we cannot do this question justice if we do not examine the actual contribution which the Universities have made to this Legislative Assembly since they first got the right to make a contribution at all.  I do not seek to meet the Government on the ground of a theoretical discussion as to whether Universities ought to be represented or not.  I am not interested in that discussion.  Let that discussion be taken to the debating societies and the meeting places of philosophers.  We are concerned to secure that this country will be as well governed as we can make it.</P>
    <P>It is the practical aspect of this question that interests me.  My mind goes back to a Deputy who was sent to this House by the Universities&mdash;a Deputy who made a contribution not only to the legislation of this House but to the social amenities of this country; a Deputy who made a great contribution to the economic strength of this country; a Deputy whose genius evolved a scheme which provided much-needed employment for hundreds and thousands of people who might be hungry now but for the suggestion he brought under the attention of this House&mdash;and he is the late Sir James Craig, <i>requiescat in pace.</i>  It was to that Deputy we owed the scheme which set on foot the Hospitals Sweepstakes. All the great new hospitals that are being erected throughout this country are a monument more enduring than bronze to his memory.  All the thousands of people who have got work and good employment out of that enterprise owe him a debt.  All the money that has come into this country and helped us to meet the financial stresses that less responsible Deputies of this House threw upon the country is due, in some measure, to his genius and courage.  I do not suggest that he alone was responsible, but I do assert that he made no small contribution to it.</P>
    <P>Now, on that test, I ask Deputies how can they vote for this motion? Suppose that the effect of this motion is to strike out of the membership of this House to-morrow morning the six <Col N="69" /> Deputies who represent the Universities at the present moment, will this House be better or worse?  I say it will be worse.  That, in itself, to my mind, is a compelling argument against this Bill.  Let the Attorney-General answer that argument.  Let the Attorney-General undertake to prove to us that his elimination from the public life of this country will be a public benefit.  I look for his elimination only by his elevation to an even more responsible post, and I think that in that I am a fairly good prophet.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Moore is not getting so infernally innocent as to pretend that every Deputy of the Government whom we think sane ought to be admitted to this House unopposed, because, if so, he is getting extremely innocent and beginning to qualify for that position he himself envisages when we shall be obliged to oppose only those who we are satisfied are insane.  If we did come to such a decision, it might considerably alter the number of candidates we would see in the field.  However, I invite the Attorney-General to address himself to the question of whether this motion, by removing these Deputies, would improve the House or disimprove it?  I shall put another consideration before him.  Is it not a good thing in general that, in practice, we should have a couple of constituencies in this country which would return Deputies to the House who would not all face election in a constituency which required them to go upon the hustings?  It does require a certain temperament, a certain indifference to the dust and difficulty of controversial political life to go through a general election which involves an acrimonious appeal to the popular electorate.  Many of us can take that in our day's work and survive it&mdash;notably so adept an exponent of the art of the hustings as Deputy <Col N="70" /> Donnelly&mdash;but there are other equally valuable members of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because I regard Deputy Donnelly as an extremely valuable Deputy of this House&mdash;one of the few shamelessly honest Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  Deputy Donnelly has let more cats out of the bag in his day than all the rest of the Deputies put together, and I respect him for it.  But, as I was saying, there are other equally valuable Deputies, or potential Deputies, of this House who would dislike exceedingly to take part in such an election and who could not be brought to the point of facing the hustings.  Are they to be excluded from the public life of this country? Is it to be an essential qualification to election to this House that you can and will address election meetings?  If so, I cannot imagine any less desirable essential qualification.  It is extremely difficult for any man to retain his sense of responsibility and to measure his words and to attend to his parliamentary duties as they ought to be attended to if he also has to take to the hustings and woo the support of an electorate that has been demoralised to such an extent by promises of the unprecedented character that have been made to it in recent times in this country.  There are many men who can make a great contribution to this country, and who ought to be afforded the opportunity of making that contribution, who will be debarred from doing so absolutely, now that we have abolished the Seanad, if we proceed to disfranchise the Universities as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be long sorry to see this House dominated by a strongly conservative majority.  I would always wish to see the Government of this country in the van of liberal reform. But there is a vast difference between liberal reform and revolutionary upheaval, and there are many people in this country beginning to forget that that difference exists.  The tendency to abolish everything that is not subservient to your will is strangely typical of the revolutionary mind. The active resolution to reform anything that appears to you to be wrong is a healthy sign of <Col N="71" /> liberalism in any country where it appears, but in addition to that liberalism I would like to see represented in this House the mind, at least, of the extremely conservative elements in this country.  We must not close our minds to the fact that conservatism does largely develop with advancing years, and I consider that the Universities do hold out scope where that extremely conservative view might reasonably hope to secure a moderate representation, and might provide a channel through which, at least, one Deputy would find his way into this House to keep the House informed of the reaction of the more conservative elements in the country to the proposals that were brought forward.  It would provide this House with an opportunity of knowing from time to time what the actual effects of what this House was doing were upon the conservative elements in the population.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is absolutely essential to successful legislation that such information should be available to the Deputies of this House at all times.  I feel that, with the disappearance of the Seanad, it is even more urgent than it has ever been before that we should have amongst us here bodies of men and women who, by the method of their election would be probably of a more detached mind than those of us who had entered this House through the ordinary method of the constituency election and campaigning upon the hustings.  If we abolish University representation we are going to lose that element in our legislature.  The only simple way to envisage the results of that is to look at the House that we have got to-day and to contemplate the elimination from its personnel to-morrow morning of the six Deputies whom the Universities have sent to us.  Do Deputies think that that will be good, or do they think it will be ill?  I think it will be a misfortune, and I look forward with interest to the Attorney-General and to Deputy Mrs. Concannon explaining to us the reasons why it is in the national interest that both of them <Col N="72" /> should experience spontancous combustion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any arguments which have been made against this motion are very closely related to the arguments which have been used against the measure passed by this House providing for the abolition of the Seanad.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan, in their contributions to the debate, have made it abundantly clear that so far as they are concerned they are not satisfied with giving to the population of this country adult suffrage, but that they want to ensure, when the results of that adult suffrage produce a legislature, that some special class within the community will be accorded special representation in order to keep an eye upon the actions and outlook of those who are elected as the representatives of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made it clear that he liked a little sprinkling of conservative pepper on the people's legislative dish.  He wanted to make sure that there was a leavening of conservative thought in the House, and Deputy O'Sullivan made it abundantly clear that he welcomes the presence in this House of the conservative mind, which would make contributions of probably not progress but towards keeping things very much as they were.  Even Deputy Dillon in his speech, which reminded one of the kind of things that are said when one is parting with friends, was only able to pick out one of three representatives to give them a certificate of good character in respect of progressive views.  The other two he carefully excluded from the testimonial which he presented to Deputy Rowlette.  In their contributions to the debate, Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan reminded me that the clear purpose of the Party opposite in this matter is to do in respect of University representation what they were able to do in respect of the management of the City Council, namely, to provide special representation for a particular class. That representation was provided for a class, not that it was the most <Col N="73" /> needy or that it suffered most from the existing system of society, not a class that had the least wealth, but in that instance and in this instance, the special type of representation then provided, and now sought to be retained, was for a class in the community that is not specially afflicted with financial, economic or educational ills.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Party opposite to maintain University representation in its present form is to maintain in this House not merely the normal conservative type of mind that we may get as a result of an election under adult suffrage, but to inject into the House a special and a privileged type of representation drawn in the main, according to Deputy O'Sullivan's speech, from elements within the community which have specially distinguished themselves because of their conservative outlook on social, economic and political matters.  It is because this type of University representation gives special recognition to a class which is not given to the remainder of the people that I object to it as being contrary to any proper conception of democratic government.  I object to it for that class as I would object to it for any other class so long as each and every citizen in the community has the opportunity of electing, by recording his own vote, any government which he chooses to the extent that his voice and the voice of others thinking with him, can be allowed freely to determine the political complexion of the government which he seeks.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan talked of this motion as one that aimed at disfranchising the Universities in this State.  One would imagine from his speech that the purpose of the motion was to say, in respect of University graduates, that we were going to put them in the same position as the Civic Guards and prevent them from casting their votes.  That is not the position. When this motion is passed and when the Bill becomes an Act&mdash;when University representation falls from the specially privileged position which it has to-day&mdash;does not the fact remain <Col N="74" /> that every single citizen, whether he be an inmate of an institution in this country or a graduate of a University, will be entitled to vote under the system of adult suffrage which we have here?  So that when Deputies talk about disfranchising the Universities, let it be made perfectly clear that nothing in that direction is being attempted.  Rather, the University graduate is being allowed to record his vote in the same way as every other adult citizen in the country.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been said in the course of this debate to convince me that a person who is a graduate of a University ought to have a special privilege in the matter of electing people to this House that is not enjoyed by all other sections of the community.  Everybody knows that the present system of University representation, in this State at all events, was not wholly unconnected with the desire to give representation at that time to a particular class within the community.  There might, in the special circumstances of that period, have been some justification from the point of view of expediency of doing a thing then which, while not justifiable in principle, might, nevertheless, be said to have something in its favour.  But 13 long years have since passed, and in the interval there has been a sorting out, an assimilation of political thoughts, various alignments of political forces which, in my view, render it utterly unnecessary to make any special provision for that particular class of the community.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that persons can be elected to represent Universities in this House on a very small total vote. Many of the representatives of Universities can secure entry to this House by obtaining a vote probably only one-sixth, one-eighth or one-tenth of the number of votes which the ordinary representatives of the plain people are required to command.  I see nothing in the arguments put forward by Deputies opposite to convince me that there is any special reason why you should allow into this House persons who are required to obtain a lesser standard of political support than is required by others representing the masses of the people.  In any case, there was no argument which convinces me that <Col N="75" /> there should be any special recognition bestowed on that class which is not bestowed upon the rest of the people. One would imagine University electors were persons who moved about in seclusion, never coming in contact with the realities of life, never liable to inherit the political vices that some people commonly associate with polities in this country.  One would imagine that University electors were a sacrosanct, a holy class, incapable of being guilty of any of the vices of ordinary mortals and impervious to the ordinary political thoughts which run through the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that those who have been elected to represent a University properly reflect the viewpoint of those who elect them.  We come to a position where most of us who do not want to soar to the Olympian heights that Deputy Dillon aspired to this evening will have no hesitation in realising that University representatives, if they reflect the viewpoint of those who send them here will reflect the viewpoint of people who are just ordinary mortals, no better and no worse than the remainder of the community. I take it, for example, that Deputy McGilligan would be held up by the Party opposite as one who faithfully represents the National University. If Deputy McGilligan does that, presumably he is the mouthpiece of whatever body of thought in that assembly sends him here.  If we accept that viewpoint, then, as the whole House knows, Deputy McGilligan is probably the most volatile and bellicose politician in the House.  I do not imagine that even Deputy McGilligan would resent that description of himself. However much Deputy Dillon may try to paint the University electors as sacrosanct people with none of the vices of life, certainly Deputy McGilligan is able in their name to express viewpoints in this House which do not indicate at all that University people are entitled to any special privilege, or any special method of getting representation which should not be accorded to any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>Let us continue our curiosity as to the personal qualities of the representatives <Col N="76" /> of the National University.  We have the Attorney-General, perhaps not so bellicose and not so volatile, but no less a rabid Party politician. The Attorney-General claims for his Party all the virtues that it is possible for him to claim and he attributes to the Opposition all the vices it is possible for him to allocate to the debit side of their account.  The same applies to Deputy McGilligan.  Let us look, not for the purpose of analysing the characteristics of any Deputy, at the kind of representatives in this House that University representation under its present privileged position gives us.  We have, on the one hand, a rabid Party politician in Deputy McGilligan and, on the other hand, we have a rabid Party politician in the Attorney-General, so that University representation has not given to the House independent-minded Deputies who are prepared to allow their votes to be cast on the pure merits of a position as they see it individually.  The Attorney-General is bound by the crack of the Party whip.  Deputy McGilligan is bound by the crack of the Party whip opposite, whether he is in opposition or on the Front Benches, so that in respect of the National University, at all events, it has given us a type of representative who has been elected, not because he is the special guardian of the educational interests of that institution in this House, but because he has, within that assembly, a sufficient number of supporters of his own particular political point of view to enable him to come here through the medium afforded by the special type of representation which the Universities get.</P>
    <P>Although he may disagree with me, I have no hesitation in saying to the Attorney-General that if he were the most able exponent of the principles and virtues of higher education there would still be no prospect of his ever entering this House were it not for the fact that he has a sufficient number of people in the University who are politically associated with the Fianna Fáil Party.  When we pull back the curtain, when we peer into this problem a little deeper than Deputy Dillon was disposed to do, we find that University representation, as we see it <Col N="77" /> applied in this country, has not given us persons exclusively devoted towards the advancement of education in a manner divorced from the other problems with which the country is beset. University representation, as exemplified in the representatives from the National University, which I am discussing at the moment, has given us, not those specialised types of representatives, but persons who come in here with Party labels hanging round their necks from the day they seek to represent the University until the day they go back to render an account of their political and their educational stewardship here.  I doubt if even Deputy Dillon will quarrel with the fact that so far as the representation of that University is concerned, it simply gave us, out of its three representatives, two at least who have been prominent in fairly acrimonious debates here, and who have made it clear by their votes and speeches that they cannot be relied upon to take that detached interest in problems coming before the House&mdash;and that is the only basis upon which any possible case might be made for maintaining an exclusive form of representation.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to Trinity College, another institution which sends three representatives here.  I will say at once, whether it is due to any modesty on their part or to recognition of the fact that there is an environment here which they may find rather strange to them, that the representatives of Trinity College in this House have not taken that bellicose and belligerent part in our debates that has characterised the representatives of the National University.  At the same time they have in this House, on matters other than education, frequently contributed to the discussions which have taken place, and in most of the matters which came before this House they have recorded their votes in one particular way or the other, but I think hardly any of the Trinity representatives would claim that they are so immune from Party attachments or from Party and political outlook as to allow their votes and their speeches to be determined purely by their microscopic examination of the merits of the particular issue as they find it.  I <Col N="78" /> think if the records of the House are examined it will be found that the representatives of Trinity College have in the main voted with the Party opposite, not merely when that Party was in power, but even since it has gone into opposition.  In many instances, in fact in the overwhelming majority of votes recorded here, the Party opposite has been able to count upon the loyal support of the three representatives of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>It may be said, of course, that that really means that the representatives of Trinity College in this House find in the viewpoint of the Party opposite something nearer their own hearts, some policy which more closely expresses their hopes and aspirations than does the policy of any other Party in the House.  If that is so, then I suppose the Party opposite are to be congratulated on being able to devise a political, economic and financial policy which attracts to their support the representatives of Trinity College; but if it is true that the Trinity representatives support the Fine Gael Party because of their adherence to the policy of that Party, then it naturally follows that specialised representation for that institution is unnecessary in this House, when the Party opposite appears so adequately to express its viewpoint on financial, political and economic matters.  The Trinity representatives have found themselves in agreement with the Party opposite on an enormous number of occasions.  I think it would be fair to say that in the main, whatever the outlook of that Party is&mdash;subject to minor disagreements here and there now and again&mdash; the Trinity representatives see in the implementation of the Fine Gael programme the expression of their hopes in a political and national sense. There may be little trimmings here and there.  There may be little additions and a few amendments necessary, but in the main, I think, it is only fair to say that the Trinity representatives regard the Party opposite as their big brother.  They have loyally supported the Party opposite in the Division Lobbies on matters which come before this House.  The very fact of their attachment to that Party opposite shows that there is no necessity for <Col N="79" /> specialised representation for Trinity College itself, because their own votes have clearly shown that they regard the Fine Gael Party as their big political brother.  So long as that big political brother is here to represent them, and to give vent to their point of view, there is no need for any specialised form of representation for that institution in this House, particularly as the form of specialised representation is of a kind not extended to any other class within the community.</P>
    <P>One might say in respect of 1922, when it was desired to provide for the continuance of this representation, that there were certain people who might get representation through the Universities and who could not get that representation by means of undertaking the arduous task of wooing the electorate through the medium of the hustings.  That might be so in that particular year.  It might even be so in the years immediately following 1922, but it is many years ago since the Fine Gael Party have wooed and actually assimilated the element in the community for which it was sought to provide special representation through the medium of University representation as applied to Trinity College.  It will hardly be denied by any of the Trinity Deputies that the Fine Gael Party has within its membership, both outside and inside this House, persons who in the words of Deputy O'Sullivan this evening might be described as belonging to the scattered minority.</P>
    <P>The scattered minority have been able to assimilate themselves with the Fine Gael Party; have been able to secure representation through the Fine Gael Party, and have been able to secure actual representation in this House by membership of the Fine Gael Party, so that so far as the set of circumstances which existed in 1922 is concerned we find that the whole position has been transformed.  Not only now does the Fine Gael Party assimilate and cater for the scattered minority, but the representatives of Trinity College in this House on, I suppose, 95 per cent. of the occasions upon which votes were taken here indicate by their own action in supporting <Col N="80" /> the Fine Gael Party that they regard that Party's viewpoint as one which adequately expresses their own particular viewpoint.  It is because of that fact that I think there is no case to-day&mdash;and there will be a still less case in the future, if that were possible&mdash;for according to the Universities the specialised type of representation which they have had in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in an effort to give this motion a pathetic halo, said it was really a motion to decide on the exclusion of six named Deputies from this House, and he said that the going of those six Deputies would make this House poorer.  I do not think you can judge a motion of this kind from that standpoint.  It seems to be asking votes for or against the motion not on the merits of the motion but on consideration of one's like or dislike for the personal qualities of Deputies of this House.  I could gladly acknowledge that the representatives of the Universities in this House have many merits.  They have much to commend them from many points of view, and I think that educationally they have made very useful contributions to the debates in this House.  But we are not considering to-day, through this motion, the personal qualities of any particular member of the House.  When Deputy Dillon asked us to remember that we were sentencing to political death six members of this House, he was really asking us to consider the motion not on its merits but having regard to factors which should not enter into the consideration of this motion.  At all events, University representation will survive until the next election, and then there may be a complete change in the character of this House.  Probably some of the people over whom Deputy Dillon was shedding tears will come back to represent other constituencies in the House, and perhaps the Deputy who is shedding the tears will not himself be here to welcome them.  These are some of the vicissitudes of political life in this country, and we have got to take them if we are going to continue the present system of democratic government in the country.  What Deputy Dillon said this evening as applied to University <Col N="81" /> representatives might be a case for postponing the next election indefinitely lest we might lose the genial presence of Deputy Dillon himself, but we cannot order our constitutional development on considerations of that kind.  One has got to look at the principle of the motion to see whether one agrees or disagrees with it.</P>
    <P>I think this motion is one which, from a democratic point of view, has much to commend it.  The present representation of the Universities, in that specialised way in which they have representation, accords to those who are elected under that system a specially privileged position in this nation and in this House.  It is because I am opposed to privilege and opposed to giving to any section of the community special privileges and rights which are not accorded to the remaining section of the community, that I am in favour of this motion.  I think the abolition of University representation will not result in the deterioration of the House as has been indicated by Deputies J.M. O'Sullivan and Dillon.  Personally I would regret the severance from this Assembly of the six Deputies who up to this represented the Universities. But while we may share that personal sorrow at their leaving this House as University representatives, our system of election in this country has shown that it is by no means impossible for them to come back representing the viewpoint of the ordinary citizen of the country.  If they come back to this House representing the viewpoint of our common community then I feel that they will have in this House a much better standing and much better title deeds to contribute to the debates here than they can possibly have under the sheltered kind of representation that they have in this House to-day.</P>

      <P>This debate has taken very much the course which all important constitutional debates take.  The Government comes in, a Government that is conscious of the fact that it has no case, a Government which is conscious of the fact that it cannot argue its case, a Government that puts up no speakers except somebody to introduce the measure in a few <Col N="82" /> perfunctory words and tries to put the measure through in a speech devoid of argument.  Then the Front Bench is unoccupied or, if occupied, it is occupied by people who do not join in the discussion.  The Fianna Fáil contribution to this debate, as has been the Fianna Fáil contribution to so many important debates in this House, is simply this: &ldquo;You have the argument; we admit your right in the argument, but we will not attempt to answer it; we have the brute force, and brute force will conquer arguments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the attitude the Government take up.  We have had several speeches from this side of the House.  We have had a debate now for two-and-a-half hours or more and we have had nothing from Fianna Fáil in support of the motion.  The only attempt at argument, if an argument at all, is that of Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton will follow the other supporters of Fianna Fáil.  The Deputy comes to do his little job in support&mdash;I will not say of his allies but&mdash;of his masters.  Candidly, I do not think that this debate or the Government case has been very much strengthened by Deputy Norton's contributions to this question.  There might have been something in Deputy Norton's points; his speech might be worthy of consideration if any really privileged position was being given to the University graduates; there might be something in his points if a double vote had been given to the University graduates; there would be some point in it if the ordinary man in the street had only one vote and the University graduate had two votes.  In that case there might be something in what Deputy Norton has put before the House.  But there is no such thing.  No University graduate has two votes in this country.  The University graduate has got no more voting power than any single ordinary individual in the country.  He has just one single vote. But what is that?  The University graduates are grouped together and so far as these two great institutions. Dublin University and the National University, are concerned, the groups are taken out of the ordinary territorial constituencies and are placed in a group constituency.  Is there anything <Col N="83" /> undemocratic in grouping?  Is there anything undemocratic in a group being represented specially?  I am astonished at such arguments coming from Deputy Norton.  I am astonished at such arguments from the Labour Party.  I am astonished that Labour men should be making an attack upon the group system.  I wonder if the Deputy has ever heard of the institution called Trade Unions?  I ask Deputy Norton or any other Labour Deputy whether Trade Unions are not groups?  Are not Trade Unionists a privileged group?  Is there anything wrong in having a group like Trade Unionists in the ordinary economic life of the country?  I daresay the Deputy will agree with me that there is nothing wrong in that.  If he will agree that there is nothing wrong in having a group in the economic and social life of this country&mdash;and I think it is not wrong but altogether right that men should be arranged in groups &mdash;what then can be wrong in having in the political life of the country men arranged in groups and that a particular group with particular qualifications for the purpose should be assembled together in a University constituency for the purpose of returning Deputies to this House?</P>

      <P>My explanation has been given.  It is perfectly clear that if a group system in the economic and social life of this country is desirable, then there is nothing wrong in having the same group system extended to the political life of the country.  The group system is not wrong.  The group system is in itself right, and if there is a constituency <Col N="84" /> grouped around two great institutions, institutions whose function it is to do great work for the advancement of this country intellectually, then it cannot be wrong that men should be collected around those groups, around those two institutions in such a group which to my mind not only does not give them undue privileges but which is a thing which in its own self works out thoroughly right and sound.</P>
      <P>We have here established by the Constitution a certain arrangement for the election of Deputies to this House. We have in the first place a territorial representation and it is almost entirely territorial, and then we have, as far as the Universities go, the group representation. We have that in existence and the first question which any sensible person will ask when he finds a thing in existence is: &ldquo;How is that working&mdash;is it working well?&rdquo; If it is working well why change it?  Before you make any change in what you have got, if you are a man of common sense the first thing you will ask yourself is: &ldquo;Are we making an amendment which is going to improve it or is this amendment going to disimprove it?&rdquo; In other words, are we going to sacrifice efficiency to theory?  I think I have shown and I think Deputy Davin will agree with me, that we should not sacrifice efficiency to false and unsound theories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton was very strong in holding that the conservative view need not be represented in this House.  I think it is highly advisable that every point of view in the country should have a spokesman in this House as far as possible, if the group is not too small.  Deputy Norton seemed to have an idea that if you had a person with a conservative outlook your legislation was necessarily conservative. Of course that is absurd.  Your democratic legislation is all the better for being criticised by, if you like, a conservative thinker and speaker.  The most brilliant graduate that Trinity College ever put forward, and I think I might say the deepest political thinker who ever wrote in the English language, was Edmund Burke. I remember a phrase of his which runs something as follows: &ldquo;Our adversary is our helper; he will not allow us to be superficial.&rdquo;  In that sense it is of the greatest importance <Col N="85" /> that every measure should be criticised from every point of view.</P>
    <P>If the person introducing a measure is going to give out the full-rounded circle of his own thoughts and is going to give to the country and the House the very best thought that is in him, he will not do it, and he cannot do it, and it is not in human nature that he can do it unless he has an adversary criticising him who will compel him, in Burke's words, not to be superficial.  It is criticism which prevents the natural superficiality into which human nature would otherwise fall.  It is in that sense that legislation should be criticised from every point of view.  It is advisable to have a spokesman for every important body of opinion in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, towards the end of his speech, very much let the cat out of the bag.  What is behind the whole of this?  For many years Fianna Fáil could not get a representative in the Universities at all&mdash;they had no representation. Educated opinion in this country and in the National University and Trinity College was dead against the Fianna Fáil Party. At one election they got in two Deputies and that is their present position. They are timorous or pretty certain that the National University will either go back to where it was or, at any rate that they will lose a seat there.</P>
    <P>What is Deputy Norton's objection to Trinity College representatives? That they vote against him in the majority of cases.  That is the reason why it has to be disfranchised and that is why the National University has to be disfranchised.  The present Government think that they will strengthen their position at the next general election by disfranchising the Universities knowing that they have lost educated opinion in this country completely.  That is what is behind the whole Bill and nothing else.  I do not suppose there is a single person in the country who thinks for one moment that if University representation gave a majority to Fianna Fáil University representation would ever be attacked.  We all know it would not.  We all know that this is <Col N="86" /> hitting at an institution which has worked well and hitting at it because it is a danger to the Fianna Fáil political Party and machine.  That is the whole reason why this is brought forward.</P>
    <P>Does anybody say that it is morally wrong that the Universities should be represented?  Would any Fianna Fáil Deputy venture to put that argument before the House&mdash;that it is morally wrong that Universities should be represented in this House in this group system?  I wonder if the representatives of the National University who are sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches hold the view that it is morally wrong that the Universities should be represented?  If they do, why are they sitting there?  If it is wrong, if it is undemocratic, if it is a betrayal of the rights of the people that a University should be represented, what is the Attorney-General doing on those benches; what is Deputy Mrs. Concannon doing on those benches?  Are they going to be the representatives of an immoral system?  Why do they not resign? Why do they not go out of the House and say: &ldquo;It is a perfectly immoral system which has sent us to this House and we are not going to sit in this House when we ought not, when it is immoral for us to be here?&rdquo; Does anybody think for one moment that either of them will take that course?  I do not think anybody does.  I do not think that either of them thinks it is the slightest bit immoral that they should be here or that there is anything immoral or wrong in the Universities being represented. Not only that, but the whole Party would think it would be an admirable thing if Universities were represented if they were sure they would have a majority, and I believe they would think so if they even thought they had a reasonable chance of equality, because it is a sound principle.  It has been demonstrated to be a sound principle.</P>
    <P>If you are going to decide as to whether University representation is or is not suited to this country, is not the first thing you will look to to see how it works?  Deputy Norton said that Universities should not be <Col N="87" /> represented because their Deputies had not detached interests and were looking at the matter from a Party point of view.  I think the very fact that they do look at the matter from a Party point of view and that Universities send Party politicians, if you like to call them so, into this House is a merit in the Universities. I am not a believer in cranks.  I believe a democratic Parliamentary system could only work on Party lines.  I think that anybody who is going to be an efficient and useful member of this House will be in a Party and that government cannot be carried effectively or successfully except on Party lines.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it is no argument to my mind that Deputy McGilligan and the Attorney-General do not take detached interests, that they fight questions in a Party spirit.</P>
    <P>I wonder what Deputy Norton thinks.  Is he detached?  He has never regarded anything except from the Party point of view.  I wonder whether the County Kildare should be disfranchised because Deputy Norton is as thoroughgoing a Party man as sits in this House.  He talked of Deputies at present representing Universities in this House, but said he would not go into personal matters.  I think that is most important.  We want to see how University representation works in this House, and to see the type of men sent here from the Universities.  Let us go back to the beginning.  When you take the type of men that then came forward will you not find, that at that time, the Universities had very distinguished representatives in this House.  Take the National University and go through the list of Deputies that sat in this House before the present representatives.  Were they not distinguished men; they included Professor Magennis, Professor Tierney, men who made their mark in the academic life of the country; they also included the former Ceann Comhairle, Mr. Michael Hayes. I may differ from some of them, but they were all able men.</P>
    <P>Passing from the previous representatives, and coming down to those at <Col N="88" /> present representing the National University in this House, what do we find?  Deputy McGilligan is a representative of the National University. Could any University have a more brilliant representative?  Has any single man living done more for this country?  Has any living man done more to raise the status and the national position of this country since the Treaty than Deputy McGilligan? It was on the foundation that Kevin O'Higgins laid that Deputy McGilligan built.  Deputy McGilligan, as the House knows, is the real author of the Statute of Westminster which gave absolute, complete, and entire independence to the Free State.  That Statute of Westminster was entirely due to the steady work begun by Deputy O'Higgins and carried on by Deputy McGilligan.  And every single bit of legislation that the Fianna Fáil Government has carried out since then so far as it is of use has only been of use because of the weapon Deputy McGilligan put into their hand.  That is the work of one University representative. Take the other University representatives we have here to-day. The House knows them, and Deputies can form their own view as to their value as well as I can form mine.  But I say definitely and clearly that, looking at all the men the Universities have sent into this House, and what their presence here has meant, it is clearly shown that University representation has been a source of strength to this Assembly.  There is no reason on earth why that representation should be taken away.  It has been said that there should be mathematical niceties. But there is no reason for mathematical niceties.  I was told there should be no representation but territorial representation.  I asked why.  I got no answer.  Is there any answer now?</P>
    <P>We have got an existing system here, working well, and the test which we should apply when deciding upon this question is this: Are we going to make Dáil Eireann a more efficient body or a body better representative of public opinion in this country by abolishing University representation or by maintaining it?  Apply that test, and there can be no doubt of the <Col N="89" /> result.  I know that test will not be applied.  I know the Party opposite dare not apply that test.  I know the promises they have made.  I know they have burnt their boats.  I know that the Party opposite realise that they are doing a bad thing for this country, but they cannot withdraw from it now because they have gone too far.  We cannot help them, and all we can do is to make as vigorous a protest as we can against this measure and what it means.</P>

      <P>I had intended to refer to the Deputy who has just sat down, in order to exemplify the argument that depriving the Dáil of representatives returned directly by the Universities does not, in any sense, mean what is suggested it does mean, namely, depriving the Dáil of the assistance of persons who have been trained in the University. I understand that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is a graduate of the old Royal. I had intended to point to him and to several others on the Opposition Benches, and to several on these benches to show that the fact that there is no direct access to the Dáil through the University electorate does not mean at all that the Dáil is to be deprived of whatever assistance it can get from University trained minds. However, I was rather disappointed to hear from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney a speech that seemed to me to be a tissue of fallacies.  The Deputy attempted to answer what I thought was a very effective speech made by Deputy Norton.  He attempted to answer that speech, first of all by seizing on the point that there is no double vote now, and that the University voter who chooses the University as his constituency, would have no vote elsewhere.  Secondly, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said you cannot say that the present system of giving Universities representation is undemocratic. While it is true that there is no double vote, or that there should be no double vote, I am aware of several instances in which, according to persons upon whose opinion I feel I would rely, University graduates have voted in outside constituencies as well is in their University.</P>

      <P>I am in a position to say that I challenged some of these voters in my own election. I had them challenged at the poll in the University, but the legal adviser to the returning officer declined to accept that challenge, so that we were in the difficult position of being unable to prove our case.  Deputies will accept that there were such instances in which I believe, from information on which I think I could rely, this had taken place.  However, that is a very minor matter, and in no way affects the argument, even if it did happen, as I believe it did. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney disregards completely the fact that a University vote has the effect of ten votes.  That vote counts as much as from seven to ten votes in an ordinary constituency.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with your statement about Deputy Norton's point, that it was undemocratic. The Deputy said that it was not undemocratic, that there was nothing wrong about it, and that there was no privilege in the University graduates' vote.  I have been connected with University elections for a long number of years, both as an agent for candidates and as a candidate myself, and I remember that the appeal to graduates in the University was to put their names on the University register because their vote there was worth ten votes in the ordinary constituency.  I remember being challenged by my own committee, both in Dublin and in Cork, to know what defence could be made for a system which gave University graduates a privilege such as that, and I felt it was a very difficult position to defend.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney went on to misrepresent Deputy Norton, who did not say that he objected to the conservative view being represented in this House.  Deputy Norton's argument was clear.  As I gathered, it was to the effect that if it <Col N="91" /> was contended that the view-point of the representatives of Trinity College should get expression, the fact that they found the Party opposite so closely akin to them dispensed with the necessity for their own presence here.  That was the Deputy's argument as I understood it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney went on to refer to Edmund Burke.  I think it is not irrelevant to recall that one of the greatest men produced by Trinity College, when a member of the British House of Commons, if I recollect aright, represented the electorate of Bristol.  He did not represent a University constituency.  The final argument of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney semes to jettison the main argument upon which the case for University representation has been based.  In the debates in this House when the motion in favour of University representation was before it, and also in the Seanad, the great case made was that University representation should be preserved, because it gave to the House a peculiar type of mind which could not find a way into it through the medium of the ordinary constituency.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney boldly throws that over now, and frankly states the fact that I am a Party politician, that Deputy McGilligan is a Party politician, that Deputy Mrs. Concannon is a Party politician, and that University representation by Party politicians is to the credit of the University.  I cannot deny what Deputy Norton said, that University representation has got into the hands of the big Parties.  That is true as far as the National University is concerned.  The independent type of candidate seems to have very little chance there.  I came here as the representative of Fianna Fáil.  At the time of the election I said to my committee that I thought the only election address we need circulate, in order to <Col N="92" /> obtain votes, was that we were supporters of Fianna Fáil.  We came in here as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to recall exactly how it came about that University representation was first introduced into the Constitution here.  There has been a good deal of reference to the position in 1917 and 1918 when representation was first given to the National University. It has been pointed out that Archbishop Walsh at the time demanded that the National University should get representation in Parliament on the same terms as Trinity College, but it has been entirely overlooked that the committee which framed the Constitution before it was presented to the Dáil omitted University representation, and intended that any representation the Universities should have should be in the Seanad.  Apparently the committee were unanimous in that.  They examined it from every point of view, I take it, when they were considering the question of whether there should be University representation in the Dáil or not.  They examined the constitutions of other countries.  It was decided that the Constitution here should have a democratic basis, and apparently the members of the committee&mdash;and there were a number of distinguished men on it&mdash;came to the conclusion that it was out of tune with democracy that the Universities should have specialised representation here.  They might find support for that in the fact that in no other democratic constitution, except the English Constitution, does University representation get any particular favour.  I think there are numbers of countries which claim to be democratic, or which were democratic before recent changes in their Government, yet in not a single one has specialised representation been given to Universities. Everyone knows that in Italy, in Germany particularly, and in France, the Universities and everything they stand for are held in as high esteem as they were ever held in this country, yet it is rather surprising in view of all we hear from the opposite benches about the collective wisdom and the experience of constitution makers all over the world, that none of these countries deem it essential or useful or <Col N="93" /> wise to accord to Universities this particular type of privilege.</P>
    <P>I imagine that any person examining the question can readily see the reasons that inspired that.  When the question of University representation was first introduced here it was by way of an amendment to insert an Article which subsequently was inserted in the Constitution. The case for it was made by Professor Magennis and by Deputy Gerald Fitzgibbon, now Mr. Justice Fitzgibbon.  I see by the debate that took place in the Seanad that Senator Blythe paid a tribute to Deputy Gerald Fitzgibbon.  He said that Deputy Fitzgibbon was the reason for University representation, that it was the assistance he gave which won the House round to the opinion that they ought to preserve University representation in the First Chamber.  But, looking at the reasons advanced then, it is quite clear they have been disposed of.  Despite the fact that Deputy Fitzgibbon was most persuasive, and made a speech which apparently affected the House extremely, it was noteworthy that the only member of the Government of the day who made any attempt to deal with the question, was the late Kevin O'Higgins, who was then the Minister for Home Affairs. His contribution was that he had not made up his mind in favour of University representation, that in fact he was not in favour of it, and had intended that the Universities should have any representation they had in the Seanad. He wound up his speech by saying that he would not tell the House what his views were and would not decide what way he would vote until he heard further.</P>
    <P>The reasons which were advanced by Deputy Fitzgibbon were two-fold, so far as I recollect.  He said, on the one hand, that it was desirable to have a University constituency, because the moment the Constitution began to work here, the country would be cloven into two parties, and that the agricultural constituencies and constituencies in the cities would be so concerned with the particular matters which were more close to their bosoms and minds than the matters, education and such things, which would concern University Deputies and that University Deputy <Col N="94" /> would have no chance of being elected. He said that a professor, often of a higher branch of metaphysics, even though he sits next to a king, has small likelihood of finding a farmers' constituency which will return him to this Assembly.</P>
    <P>Has not that been falsified in the person of Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, who has found the farmers of Kerry very faithful and loyal supporters of his, and who has been sent in here to the Dáil in election after election?  Has it not been disproved by the farmers of Mayo returning Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, another University graduate, though not of professorial rank?  There is scarcely a constituency one can think of in which University graduates have not found favour with the selectors and with the electors.  In Mayo there have been at least two or three graduates of a University elected.  I think Professor Tierney was mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as a man who was sent in by the University, and who was a graduate of the University, and the type who would not seek election elsewhere, but he certainly fought elections in ordinary constituencies on a couple of occasions, and, if my recollection is right, he was returned for North Mayo on one occasion.  The Minister for Justice is another University man who has had the support of a constituency such as North Mayo, and the Minister for Education is a University graduate who has had the support of a midland constituency.  Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, is another University graduate.  The fear which was expressed at that time that if you did not give representation to Universities, you were going to lose the services of University-trained minds, has been completely disposed of.</P>
    <P>If I might answer Deputy Dillon, who put the challenge up to me as to whether I was prepared to say that this Assembly would be better if it lost the six Deputies, including myself, who represent Universities, I would say that I had no very great ambition to contest a University seat.  It is certainly a very easy seat to fight, and there is very little trouble from it, and, as a constituency, it is a very desirable <Col N="95" /> place, but I have been in politics for a long number of years and I have fought ordinary constituencies and I am quite prepared to fight them again. I believe that despite Deputy Dillon's prognostications, I would probably find some constituency, other than a University constituency, to return me here and I think the same is true of Deputy Mrs. Concannon, if she cared to fight an outside seat.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Trinity Deputies, are there not several men in this House of the type visualised by those who argue in favour of University representation? Have not the country constituencies shown a disposition to select, on the average, men of University training and men who have professional and other qualifications?  Is not the argument used now the argument which was used against democracy when it first came to be adopted as a theory of government?  Was it not alleged by writers, thinkers and speakers that democracy was going to reduce everything to a dead level? There were some arguments used in the Seanad about this very Bill which repeated almost in exact terms what was said by the opponents of democratic institutions.  Apparently, some of the wilder members there think that this is going to produce a sort of darkness over the land.  I do not want to mention the particular speakers but some of them went so far as to say that we were striking at learning and at the institution of the Universities, and that it was &ldquo;degrading.&rdquo; I think Deputy O'Sullivan, in his earlier speech, referred to this as a degrading Bill, which reduced everything to a common dead level.</P>
    <P>If you look at any of the books dealing with the history of governmental institutions, if you look at Bryce's <i>Modern Democracies,</i> you will find that when democratic institutions were introduced in many countries, the very same thing was said as is being said here against this Bill, and when you look at Bryce's view as to the result of democracy, you will find that he comes to the conclusion that all the prophecies of a dropping down to dullness have been falsified; that democracies have, on the whole, justified <Col N="96" /> themselves; and that learning, art, culture and all those things in support of which some of the arguments were advanced here have flourished just as much under democracies, and democracies where there was no University representation, as under any other form of government.</P>
    <P>I have given the history of how University representation came to be introduced here.  As Deputy Norton said, there might have been some justifiable fears&mdash;and I presume it was given as a concession to those fears&mdash;on the part of the minority at the time as to what the future held.  He said it might have been thought expedient to give University representation at the time to quieten those fears.  In this debate the representatives of Trinity College do not make a plea on that ground.  Deputy Thrift particularly avoided making the plea on the ground that here something was being done to hit the minority.  He did say, I know, that it was disappointing to him and that it would not help towards that co-operation which he had looked forward to, but with proportional representation in operation, with the fact, which is undeniable, that University men have stood well with the constituencies as a whole all over the country, with the fact that the representatives of the minority have secured election in constituencies in various parts of this country before, am I not justified in saying that the minority have nothing to fear from the abolition of this particular type of privileged representation?</P>
    <P>I know that that may possibly not be the view of the representatives of the University of Dublin.  I do not want to appear, or to be represented, as striking a blow at the University, or to be committing constitutional <i>hari-kari.</i>  I think Deputy O'Sullivan used that phrase.  I have had the interests of the University at heart and I would have them at heart even if I came in here as the representative of an ordinary constituency.  I believe it is a good service to the University to take away this representation.  I believe that no good has been done by introducing Party politics into the University&mdash;either into the University <Col N="97" /> or amongst the graduates.  There is a confusion with regard to this particular representation in the minds of some people.  It is looked on as a representation given to the staff which constitutes the working University, and it is spoken of as something which the institution had and of which it is being deprived.  The representation, as anybody knows, is from the graduates scattered all over the country, a great many of whom have ceased to have any connection with their University, who have no link with their University and who take part in their ordinary constituencies and work in the ordinary constituencies during elections, and who therefore cannot be said, in that sense, to be the University. If the Universities, as such, were to get representation, it ought to be given to them in quite a different way. That is my opinion.  However, I would favour legislation here to strengthen the position of University graduates in all walks of life.  I often feel that they have not the protection that they ought to have.  I feel that, if you are to have Universities, and if the expenditure of large sums of public money on them were to be justified, they ought to get more protection under the law than they do get, but I do not think that the interests of the Universities are served by this representation in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am aware myself of the strong objection taken by a number of thinking people to the fact that University representation and the contact, through it, of the Universities with political parties, brings into University life bitternesses and animosities which are foreign to University life and which ought to be kept out of University life.  Possibly, they have not experienced any of such bitternesses or animosities in the University of Dublin, because there has been no keen opposition there.  That may be so. However&mdash;I was going to use the word &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo;&mdash;it must be remembered that there was a misfire in one of the last elections which prevented an University election.  However, apart from that, from what I have learned of the way in which the division of Parties has affected Universities right down from the top.  through the staff, to the <Col N="98" /> student body, I believe myself that it is not good for the Universities to be involved in such disputes if the view is taken, as it seems to have been taken by many of the speakers here, that the University ought to occupy a detached position.  That appears to be the view expressed.  The strong ground advanced has been that University representation gives to the Dáil a detached type of mind.  Now, I agree with one thing that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said; and that is, that there is very little place in this Assembly for the detached type of mind.  I think that, if you are going to have Party politics, it must be genuine Party politics; and, so far, we have not seen that the professional crank has found any favour in the University, nor will he find it in the Dáil.  I believe that the people who come here from the Universities should have live political beliefs, and that they should be either affiliated with a political Party or be definitely interested in politics in a general way and not in a purely detached way.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I would sum up what I have said by saying that University representation is undoubtedly antidemocratic. That has not been denied. That is admitted.  It is admitted that University representation is illogical, and yet one of the arguments put forward by one of the speakers was that, because it was illogical, it ought to be kept, and that we ought not to reduce everything to mathematics, which seems to be a very strange argument. On the main grounds, however, I think that the justification for the removal of University representation, at a time when the whole electoral machinery is being revised, is that the hopes that were being expressed, in the first place, as to what University representation would give, have proved just as false as the arguments which were used to support it have proved to be fallacious.  I have shown, I think, that the arguments which were used at the time have proved, in experience, to be fallacious, and I believe that the fears that have been expressed as to what will happen to this Dáil, or what will happen the Universities, as a result of this piece of legislation, are quite unfounded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> Let us take the case of Deputy McGilligan, about whom so much has been said.  I agree with a great deal that has been said with regard to Deputy McGilligan's merit as a representative here.  Deeply as I disagree with him, and violently as I have fought with him, I quite admit that he is a very useful member of this Assembly; but does anybody doubt that, if Deputy McGilligan wanted to obtain a seat elsewhere, the Party opposite would be quite well able to place him in a seat?  Does anybody believe that, if this Bill goes through, Deputy Cosgrave will lose Deputy McGilligan's services, if Deputy McGilligan is willing to go forward for election, and if Deputy Cosgrave wishes to retain his services?  As a matter of fact, I think that, on one occasion, Deputy McGilligan did fight an outside constituency, some years ago.</P>

      <P>I think he did.  I do not think that Deputy McGilligan has that delicate type of mind which would view with horror the rough-and-tumble of an ordinary constituency election.  It is possible that Deputy Thrift has that type of mind. That is more or less borne out by the fact that he said that he does not intend to face election.  However, while there may be that rare type, I believe myself that there is sufficient respect for education and sufficient respect for learning to justify the hope that the ordinary constituency convention will favour the selection of a man of outstanding ability, training, or professional equipment of any kind. Furthermore, I believe this: that if the Universities are doing their job&mdash;and I think it is agreed by most people that they have done their job very well&mdash; the men they turn out will naturally become leaders in their particular areas and will find their way eventually&mdash;such of them as are fitted for it&mdash; into public life; and that, instead of being a disability, it would be a genuine help to any person in politics or in public life that he had had a <Col N="100" /> University training.  To hear some of the speakers here, one would imagine that it was a disability to be a University graduate and that some special provision must be made for University graduates.  Far from that being the case, I believe, as I have said, that the fact of their being graduates would be a genuine help to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke referred to the fact that graduates from the National University played a large part in the revolutionary changes that took place in the last few years in this country.  I agree with the Deputy that that is quite so, and I imagine that if these graduates were able to lead at a time of stress and trouble, there would be no difficulty in maintaining their position of leadership during a time of peace.  I do not believe that the gloomy prophecies, as to what will follow from this Bill, will be in any way justified, and that while some of the Deputies here at the moment may possibly not come back here to the Dáil, University graduates as a whole will find their way in here, and the benefit of University training will be adequately and fully at the disposal of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, even if that were not so, does not every one know that when a Government wishes expert advice on a particular matter, it frequently turns to persons who are not in public life at all?  It turns to experts in this, that or the other line, and, after all, are not the Universities there to be consulted?  The members of their staffs have frequently been consulted by the present Government.  They have frequently been brought into conference, and they are able to give their assistance in a full manner, perhaps in a much more full manner than if they were representatives in this House.  I have had myself in consultation Professor John MacNeill, who for many years was a member of the Opposition Party.  Had he continued to be a member of the Party opposite, I might not have gone to consult him with such freedom, and he might not have been as ready as he was to come to my assistance when I invited his assistance quite recently on a very important matter, so that it is ridiculous to say that the Bill is an attack <Col N="101" /> on the Universities.  In my opinion it will prove in the event to be unjustified to say that it is an attack on this House.  I do not believe that the fears of evil effects which Deputies opposite pretend to believe will follow from the passage of this Bill will be justified in the event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted against this Bill two years ago and I intend to vote against it again this evening.  I want to state very briefly my reasons for doing so.  I must say, in the first place, that I envy the members on both sides of the House the confidence, the positiveness and the certitude with which they have found themselves able to speak on this subject, because I think that the question is not at all an easy question.  I think it is a difficult and a doubtful question.  I would go so far as to say that, if there were in existence a Second Chamber of the type that I would like to see, I believe that on the whole this Bill would be justified, but, of course, that is not the case.  The Second Chamber that we have&mdash;very imperfect as it is&mdash;is going to disappear, and we are going more completely to rely on the rule of thumb, which consists in a counting of heads for the purpose of carrying on the government of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I lived in England for a few years before the war and I was a voter, and still am a voter, in the University of Oxford.  I feel bound to admit that when I lived in England I was a strong opponent of University representation in the House of Commons.  I was an opponent of it because I was convinced that, whatever might be said for it in theory, and I thought there was a lot to be said for it in theory, in practice it had worked extremely badly.  The representatives of my own University had always been found, it seemed to me, voting on the wrong side.  They did not vote on the right side on any big moral issue that cropped up for decision.  They were to be found amongst the die-hards and amongst the very worst of the Tory die-hards.  They were always elected for partisan reasons, and only for partisan reasons, and had to be absolutely hide-bound politicians and, in my opinion, politicians belonging to the wrong Party.  It so happens that, <Col N="102" /> for the first time so far as I am aware in the existence of the University of Oxford, we have just returned in the last general election in Mr. A.P. Herbert a member who is not a Party man at all or a Tory, so that I am hoping better things are ahead, even in Great Britain, with regard to University representation.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be said, in fact I am sure that it cannot be said, that here in Ireland University representation has been in any way a bar to progress or a bar to righteousness.  I do think that, for University representation to be justified, the men coming in here to represent the Universities should not be violent partisans.  They may, perhaps, be members of the big Parties&mdash;I would not rule that out altogether&mdash;but they should be men, nevertheless, who, on account of the peculiar character of their constituencies, on account of the freedom that their constituencies give them, are able to take a more detached attitude than is normal among politicians about questions as they arise: they should be men who, in the main, when there is a choice to be made between principle and Party, will put principle before Party, because they can afford to put principle before Party if for no other reason than that they have not got the usual sort of popular constituency.</P>
    <P>And so, if I were to think of the National University alone, I must admit that I should doubt whether University representation in Ireland had altogether justified itself.  I appreciate as much as anybody else the outstanding parliamentary qualities of Deputy McGilligan, for instance, but I should say that he was <i>par excellence</i> the sort of politician that ought not to come from a University, but ought to come from a popular constituency, because he is a very whole-hearted Party man: a very hard hitter, a man who says very bitter things and does not at all present the serenity of mind that one associates with an academic atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I think, perhaps, the Attorney-General's case is different.  Other people have been indulging in these personalities, so I suppose there is no reason why I should refrain.  The <Col N="103" /> Attorney-General is certainly a partisan, but I think he is a partisan with a difference.  I always find him one of the most interesting speakers to listen to in this House, because he appears to me to be a great deal more open-minded than the majority of his colleagues. I find him persuasive because of his endearing habit of admitting the strength of the arguments against him. I am not at all so sure, as he appears to be, that he would do as well with a popular constituency.  I very much question whether he would be as effective on the platform as the average Party politician either on the front benches or on the back benches. About Deputy Mrs. Concannon I can say less, because I have not had the pleasure of hearing her speak.  I have noticed, however, that she votes with commendable&mdash;I do not know whether I should say commendable&mdash;but at any rate with complete regularity in the Lobby of her particular Party, and that she never strays into the other Lobby by chance or accident.  It seems to me that even if a University representative is a member of a Party he should have that extra little amount of detachment that would guide him sometimes into the opposite Lobby from his Party, because no Party can be always right.</P>
    <P>Now, Trinity College is on a different plane altogether, and to my mind Trinity College is a sufficient argument for retaining University representation in this country.  I think of it, first of all, from the point of view of partition. I like to look at everything first from the effect it has on partition, and I think that the abolition of representation for Trinity College will have a definitely bad effect upon the prospects of getting rid of partition, because it will make a bad impression in the North and will sever us to that extent from the University graduates of Dublin who live in the North and are brought into touch with us by having votes in the University of Dublin.  Although it may be merely by an accident for which they deserve no credit, if you like, still as a fact the representatives of Trinity College, Dublin, are apart from the ordinary <Col N="104" /> Party warfare and, consequently, they do contribute a valuable element that we cannot get in any other way if that special representation is abolished.  It has been pointed out, and not denied, that the special element which they represent is so scattered through the country and is in such small numbers in any territorial constituency that, even with proportional representation, they cannot hope to return men here of the type of Deputy Thrift, Deputy Alton and Deputy Rowlette.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said to-day about the effect of proportional representation, as if proportional representation made any special representation of Universities quite superfluous and absurd.  But the difficulties of independent men getting in under proportional representation are very great; and I have a right to speak in the matter, because I have got in twice and on the both occasions on which I have been elected, I have been elected as an Independent and not as a member of any big Party. But still I say that it is very difficult. In the first place, you have to be prepared to spend £500 or £600 on election expenses and it is not easy to find people who are prepared to do that or even who are in a position to do that.  Consequently, the opportunities that proportional representation is supposed to give to small minorities in this country are very much exaggerated.  They exist in theory, but not in practice, because the money is not forthcoming to enable people to go forward unless they happen to belong to one of the big Parties.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General has said that democracy has justified itself.  There is no stronger democrat in this House than I am and it is because I am a strong democrat and I wish to see democracy safe that I resent the sort of philosophy expounded by Deputy Norton, according to which the only thing that matters is that every man's vote should be exactly equal.  The Attorney-General seems to close his eyes to the fact that democracy is crumbling all around us.  The democracies of the world are turning into <Col N="105" /> dictatorships which, I imagine, is what Deputy Norton wishes democracy here would turn itself into, because he and his Party have announced themselves in favour of a workers' republic and what is a workers' republic except a demagogie dictatorship under another name?  I believe in true democracy; I believe that a country should be governed for the greatest good of the greatest number and, consequently, that we should devote more attention to the question of seeing that it is governed well than to the question of seeing that its electoral machinery follows some hard and fast formula.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that education has its proper place in this country.  I do not believe that educated men going up for election in a constituency have an advantage simply because they are educated men.  In fact, I believe it is a disadvantage to them to be educated men.  I believe the mere fact of their being educated men puts them in the position that their conscience or fastidiousness prohibits them from using arguments that they might feel inclined to use if they were not educated; they are averse from indulging in what is familiarly described as tub-thumping. I believe an educated man going up for election in a popular constituency has to a considerable extent to degrade himself in order to tickle the ears of the people.  I do not mean by that that I would wish to see all educated men in sheltered constituencies. Far from it.  I believe&mdash;we were talking of Deputy McGilligan&mdash; that a man like Deputy McGilligan is in a far better position to use his influence for good in a popular constituency than he could if he were in a sheltered constituency.  There are a great many educated men who have not the power, the pungency, of speaking that Deputy McGilligan possesses, who would hate the idea of addressing a popular audience but who would nevertheless be very valuable in this Assembly, or in any other legislative Assembly.</P>
    <P>I would like, in theory, the country to be run by educated men.  The trouble is that if you had it run by educated men, if you had votes confined <Col N="106" /> to educated men, you might have the country run only in the interests of educated men, and that I do not want.  I want the interests of every individual in the community to be equally considered, but in order that they should be not only considered but their interests should in fact be secured&mdash;the interests of every individual&mdash;I think it is unreasonable that the vote of an illiterate man or an almost half-witted man, or a drunkard, or a ne'er-do-well should have exactly the same weight in the community as the vote of the educated and patriotic man.  It is inevitable, according to our system of voting, that that should be so and I do not see any way out of it.  But I think you want something to counterbalance that and to correct that evil, something to save democracy from that danger, and that something is really a Second Chamber of the type that I have tried to outline in this House on former occasions.  Failing that Second Chamber, we have some slight additional weight given to education and to intellect in this country by the presence in this House of University representatives.  In addition, we have a bridge between us and the North retained in this House by the retention of the representation of Trinity College, Dublin. For these reasons I shall vote against the Government's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion at present before the House appears to me to be only the latest step in the policy of the present Government to simplify, as I suppose it could most favourably be put, the Constitution.  The House is asked to send back to the Seanad a Bill for the abolition of University representation in this House and the Seanad is to have its period of life prolonged just long enough to enable it to abolish University representation before being abolished itself.  Those are two of the present proposals of the Government&mdash;the abolition of the Seanad and the abolition of University representation.  They are two steps which go to simplify, if not indeed to destroy, the Constitution. Apparently, the ideal is that this country will be best governed by a Single Chamber elected at a general <Col N="107" /> election held on one day by an electorate which is drab in its mediocrity, which admits of no distinction of persons and is based solely upon a territorial basis.  That, of course, will give this country something which will be essentially simple, but the question is: will it be adequate for the needs of the country?</P>
      <P>Most organisms in life are highly organised.  I suppose the lowest form of life is the single cell.  Apparently, the ideal aimed at is to abolish all distinctions of every class and kind and to present this country with a Single Chamber, with the Seanad gone, with every distinction within that Chamber gone, and with every part of the Constitution reduced into a position of having no power or effect. That does not seem to me to be a desirable thing.  As I say, most institutions recognise distinctions of rank and grade.  It does not seem to me that there is anything undemocratic in recognising that special needs require to be specially served.  I myself heard the President on one occasion in no less a place than Trinity College itself addressing a meeting of the College Historical Society, where the Auditor of the Society, had suggested in his paper that there should be a school for politicians, and that the persons who were to undertake the duty of governing the country should be specially trained for the purpose.  The President, whether taken off his guard or whether disarmed by the place in which he was speaking, spoke most emphatically against such a suggestion.  If I remember his words aright, he said that the difficulty about the suggestion of the Auditor was that those who are best able to use power under the sort of Constitution we have will not be able to get it.  Now, if I quote the President correctly, and if on that occasion he expressed his real view, he recognised&mdash;as we all must recognise&mdash;that there are persons who could give good service to the State in the Legislative Assembly, who are well trained in the use of power and in the functions of government, and who under the Constitution with which we are about to be provided will be unable to get power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question now before the House <Col N="108" /> must be bound up with the question of the abolition of the Second House, because the Second Chamber is the one in which special interests can be given that special representation.  But if the Second House is to go, and if we are to have no Second Chamber, why then the only place where those special interests can be represented is this House.  I was astonished to hear the Attorney-General call to his aid in argument upon this motion the report of the Constitution Committee of the Dáil at the time the Constitution was framed.  I would have thought that, having destroyed the fundamental features of the Constitution as then suggested, he would be slow indeed to rely on the report of that Committee as an argument for the abolition of University representation.  But what does it amount to?  As he put it himself, it comes to this: the Constitution Committee believed that the Universities should secure protection and representation in a Second Chamber, and, if you please, that is an argument for asking this House now to abolish University representation, this House having within the last few weeks taken the necessary steps to abolish the Second Chamber.  It has been said by Deputy MacDermot that he thinks the main reason for maintaining University representation is the position of Trinity College and its representatives.  No doubt there may be something in that, but I must confess that for myself I think the National University has an even stronger claim to representation in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton criticised the University representatives first of all on the ground that they belong to the two big Parties in the House.  He did not advert to the fact that the representatives of Trinity College did not belong to either of the two big Parties in the House, but he seemed to find in the fact that three of the University representatives were members of the Parties, and three of them were not members of the Parties, some reason for the abolition of the representation. In other words, it seemed to me that his arguments, like so many arguments put forward in this House from time to time, destroyed each other.  The first part of his speech was disposed of <Col N="109" /> effectively enough by the second part of his speech.  It may be true that the representatives of Trinity College do not belong to either of the bigger Parties in this House, but a Party after all is only an assembly of representatives of a large or small class of the community.  The representatives of Trinity College represent a class of the community just, as much as any other set of members in this House.  If any question comes up&mdash;call it a Party question or call it a national question or call it a public question of any kind &mdash;which concerns the class of persons whom the members for Trinity College may be supposed to represent, then they will be Party politicians like ourselves, and if they were not Party politicians they would not be discharging their function.  Every representative here speaks for those who sent him, and speaks for the class with whom those who sent him may be supposed to be in sympathy.  If he fails in that, he is not adequately representing their interests.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy MacDermot, in his somewhat half-hearted defence of University representation, cast a very grave slur on the members of this House in general.  It seemed to me that his description of the ideal University representative might very well serve for a description of the ideal representative of any constituency. He said that the representative should not be a violent partisan, that he should put principle before Party. Surely Deputy MacDermot does not suggest that any member of this House voting upon a question coming before this House should not put principle before Party.  It seemed to me that in Deputy MacDermot's view the only ideal representative for a University constituency would be himself&mdash;a man who is not quite sure about anything even when he addresses the House; who is satisfied to balance the arguments on one side and on the other with the utmost fairness and then come down, but not too certainly, upon one particular side.  However, I think it is fair to say that his description of the ideal representative for the Universities would serve very well for the ideal representative of any constituency in the Dáil.  I would, therefore, <Col N="110" /> respectfully suggest to the Deputy that his plea should have been not merely for the maintenance of the representation but for its extension, in order that this ideal member should become more numerous in the House. I do not think the Deputy doubted that there are, as has been said by other speakers, several Deputies in this House who might not wish to come here through the medium of an election in an ordinary constituency.  Even if they did wish that, it may be that they would not be able to make a successful appeal to the large number of persons who must be in the main uneducated, and, therefore, not persons to whom they could make any special appeal.  I think I am right in saying that before the Attorney-General reached this House as a representative of the National University he did make an appeal&mdash;and not a successful appeal&mdash;to the County Dublin, and that it was not until the County Dublin had rejected him as their representative that he was able to arrive here as a representative, and a worthy representative no doubt, of the National University.  I do not know if my recollection serves me, but I think it was said that Deputy McGilligan on one occasion sought to represent some ordinary constituency in this House, and he likewise failed.</P>

      <P>If we are to indulge in personalities, and they seem to have been freely indulged in, we find that two of the persons whose services to the House have been most canvassed in this debate actually failed to arrive here until they succeeded in coming by means of a University vote.  I am prepared to leave it at that.  I venture to suggest that the situation plainly shows that unless we are to be reduced to a drab level of mediocrity we ought to be prepared to admit, without in any way derogating from the principle of democratic government, that distinctions of grade should be recognised; that we should be able to recognise an intellectual aristocracy the members of which, to the limited extent to which they are grouped <Col N="111" /> together in the University permits, should be allowed to make their voices heard in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very much interested in this Bill, as I believe there are several more urgent things claiming attention.  There are matters of more outstanding importance which should have claimed precedence. Before giving my vote on the Resolution, however, I want to say that those who defended University representation in this House have given very little help to anybody who is eager to be sympathetic to their views.  The arguments put forward have been so mixed and so mutually contradictory that it is practically impossible to decide which of them is seriously meant.  There have been four main points made in the speeches to which I have listened and in the speeches that were made when this Bill was before the House previously.  There has first been the argument in favour of minority representation; there has been the argument in favour of the special type of mind the University produces; another argument used is that an opportunity is given to people who would not otherwise get elected; and then there is an argument as to the political unity of the country.  We find that the two Deputies from Trinity College differ absolutely on the question as to whether minority representation is or is not desirable. Deputy Thrift made it the central point in his speech when this Bill was last before the House.  He argued that minorities were entitled to representation and that Trinity College provided an opportunity for such minority representation. But Deputy Rowlette came along an hour later and said he had no patience with such arguments.  He said the sooner we got away from them the better, and he made it clear that he was not going to make that plea against the Bill.  But how am I to choose between two representatives who differ in that way amongst themselves? How am I to know which of them is making the correct case? Surely that is a matter that they should decide amongst themselves&mdash; whether we are to have University <Col N="112" /> representation <i>qua</i> minority rights or not.</P>
      <P>With regard to the special type of mind, the Trinity College Deputies were, I think, united in claiming that the University produced a special type of mind that is useful in the House. <i>Prima facie</i> there would seem to be a very strong argument in favour of that point.  But on reflection it looks as if the claim were more applicable to Parliaments one hundred years ago when most of the discussions were of a general kind rather than of the special technical kind we have to-day. Also it is based on an assumption which does not seem to me to be correct.  It assumes that every University graduate has had a training in general culture which gives him a philosophic mind.  But I think it is far from being the case that the University student gets such a general training, or that he is required, for instance, to have an arts degree before he proceeds with his professional course.</P>
      <P>I think that neither Deputy Thrift nor Deputy Rowlette would claim that if there is an engineering question before this House that a medical graduate from Trinity College would be able to express an opinion on that question that would be in any way superior to the opinion of the ordinary Deputy who had a knowledge of engineering.  I think neither Deputy would claim that in a discussion on finance here a Deputy from the University who had no special training in finance would be able to bring something to bear on the subject matter that would be of special value.  There are very few occasions in this House when the discussions are of a general character.  Most of these occasions arise on constitutional measures.  While quite willing to grant that University representatives should be able to contribute something special on general discussions such as arise out of constitutional questions, the fact remains that these are so small a part of the business of the House that in my opinion they could not weigh effectively if that is the only argument that is advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, with regard to the claim that <Col N="113" /> it gives an opportunity to people to get elected who would not otherwise have that opportunity, Deputies must surely admit that that could be said of very many other classes of people. It could be said of the members of chambers of commerce who probably would be very useful and have a great deal of knowledge in regard to a lot of matters that come before this House.  And when it is claimed that the University mind would be specially valuable here, Deputies must remember that there are other minds also which would be specially valuable here.  There have been lots of matters going through the House during the last three years relating to industries of a very technical type.  It would be very valuable to have people engaged in these industries here to criticise the Government proposals.  But it is not practicable.  We have the argument repeated and pressed persistently that there are men who will not face the ordinary rough-and-tumble of election in order to get elected to the House and that, consequently, University representation should be preserved for that particular class.  That argument tells with very little force, because if University representation is preserved there will still be a great many people who would be useful in the Parliament but who would not be eligible as University candidates.</P>
    <P>Further, on the point that the University mind is a specially valuable thing, we have to advert to instances and to look for examples in order to see whether that theory works out correctly or not.  Let us take the case of one representative of Trinity College, the late W.H. Lecky.  He was a man one would think to be of a very excellent type of mind for a political assembly.  He wrote history apparently with the utmost fairness, but when he came to discuss contemporary politics he was hardly sane in regard to the popular movement in his native country.  His attitude was certainly not that of a philosophic or non-partisan person.  With regard to social affairs, I think it could also be said that his opinion was not very useful.  For instance, he was a very hot opponent of such a reform as old age pensions&mdash;a reform that has now <Col N="114" /> come to be accepted all over the world, a reform the wisdom of which nobody now questions.  Similarly, there is the case of the late Lord Carson.  I think his could not be called a useful mind in ordinary politics.  The argument is put about by Trinity College representatives that this Bill is going to have bad effect on the political unity of the country.  That argument comes very curiously from them.  One reason why Trinity College is so unpopular in this country is that the people generally claim that Trinity College could have prevented the mutilation of the country.  They had a very great influence on Lord Carson, who had been their representative.  They had great influence in Northern Ireland, particularly amongst those who were their own graduates.  They had great influence in England.  Yet, so far as one can see, they never attempted to use that influence to prevent what they now claim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am closing my eyes to no facts.  I do not want to close my eyes to any facts.  I have no prejudice whatever with regard to this Bill.  On the case which has been made with regard to the loss in personnel, <Col N="115" /> if this Bill has the effect of depriving us of the University representatives, I am prepared to support what has been said by the Attorney-General and by many others, that every one of the representatives in this House from the Universities is a most valuable representative and their loss will be felt in the House.  But the same could be said of people who were elected in the ordinary way.  You often find that people who are very much esteemed and very valuable in this House, through some reason or other have to suffer the fate of disaster at the polls.  I do not think that could be advanced as a reason for retaining University representation.</P>
      <P>It was claimed, of course, that it was not the duty of anybody to make a case for University representation, that it was rather the duty of the Government, since they were proposing to deprive Universities of representation, to make a case against it.  That seems rather too theoretical and not a very useful course to adopt. The fact, after all, is that the Bill is before the House and it is the job of those who claim that University representation is the proper thing, that it is a good thing, that its loss will be a serious one to this House, to establish the case for University representation. I must say that I have heard such confused statements that I feel that there must be a very small case for it.  As I have said, I heard both Deputy Thrift and Deputy Rowlette express absolutely different opinions with regard to one big point on the side of the defence.  Also, I heard Deputy Dillon to-day say that there was practically no theoretical case for University representation and that he would devote himself to what he called the practical effect.  In other words, he considered only the personnel of University representation, as at present constituted.  It looks then as if the case for University representation is not at all a strong one.  While personally I would have been prepared to be very sympathetic to those who are against this Bill, I confess that the arguments advanced have not helped me in any way to side with them.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that within the last 18 months, since the Bill was previously before the House, the Vice-President, who obviously never had much stomach for the Bill himself, might have taken time to meditate on it and come to the view that there was no necessity at the moment to proceed with the measure which is now again before us.  I thought that he might have given some thought to the matter.  I do not know whether he has or not.  Certainly, in his introduction of this resolution to-day he did not give us any reason to think that the matter had received any consideration either by himself or his colleagues during the last 18 months. It would appear as if it were simply a matter of machinery, that having been rejected by the Seanad 18 months ago, it now appeared on the Order Paper and is receiving the Government support without any further consideration.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down was the first of the speakers I have heard in the House to-day to recognise the anomalous position on which the debate has gone so far.  We are not discussing the introduction of a system of University representation to our legislative Assembly and the arguments that would be relevant to such a discussion, and which were relevant in 1922, are not now relevant to the debate we are engaged in.  The debate to-day is not on the question of introducing a new feature to the Constitution, but on the question of the necessity for removing a feature which is part and parcel of the Constitution since its institution.  Deputy Moore thinks that is too fine a point to pay any attention to.  I submit that it is essential to our understanding of the question which we are asked to decide to-night.  We are not asked to decide the academic question of whether in an ideal constitution, universities or special groups should be given special representation.  We are asked to decide the immediate practical question, whether this form of representation which exists in our Constitution should be abolished or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened for positive arguments why it should be abolished and I am still waiting for them.  I have <Col N="117" /> gathered that there are two.  One of them has not been mentioned to-night. It was mentioned incidentally in one of the debates in 1934.  It was given by the Vice-President as a convincing point that the House is a good voting machine.  That was one of his answers, his main answer I thought, to the question as to why this change should be made in the constitution&mdash;that the House was a good voting machine, that he and his colleagues had decided to make the change, therefore the change was to be made and would be made. The other argument and the other reason for abolishing University representation cropped out in the previous debate and has cropped out again to-night in the speeches of several Deputies.</P>
    <P>When Deputy MacDermot was speaking a few minutes ago he gave us the reasons which influenced him in his youth to disapprove of University representation with his knowledge in particular of the representation in the British Parliament of the University of Oxford.  He told us quite frankly that the reason was that he disliked the people who were elected to represent the University. He disliked the Tory mind and the die-hards and he said that people representing that outlook only were chosen for the University of Oxford. It is quite clear from the debate to-night, from the speeches of Deputy Norton and Deputy Moore, and to a less extent from the speech of the Attorney-General, and it was quite clear from the earlier debates that the principal factor in the minds of the Government in moving them to try to bring about this constitutional change, was their dislike of the opinion of a number of the Parliamentary representatives of the two Universities.  Deputy Moore was not content with disliking some of our opinions but he disliked the opinions of our ancestors or those who preceded us.  He had a particular dislike for the opinions of the late Mr. Lecky, although he agrees with his historical views.  He disliked, like many other people, the principles and methods of the late Lord Carson.  But Deputy Moore should remember that he, and the Party which is in power in this House now, owe a great deal <Col N="118" /> to having copied the political methods of the late Lord Carson.  I say that as a historical fact without expressing either approval or disapproval of it. I take it Deputy Donnelly agrees with that.</P>
    <P>The real question before the House is whether certain features of the Constitution should be removed.  I am not going to weary the House by any academic arguments as regards an ideal Constitution, and as to how it should be based.  Reference was made a couple of times&mdash;and I think it would be odd if no such reference were made&mdash;to Edmund Burke.  If he were a representative of Dublin University, to-day, I do not know whether Deputies would like him too well.  He was a native of this city and was one of its most distinguished citizens.  He was one of Dublin University's most distinguished graduates, but he was more, he was not only one of the most distinguished men in Ireland but one of the most distinguished men in the world of his day.  His name stands out to-day as one of the greatest political thinkers of the world.  Burke was a great practical philosopher.  He was not concerned with theory or fine-spun speculation.  He was a great reformer and there was no greater reformer of his time.  He was most eager for the reform of the Constitution, but every item of it that was worthy and of practical value he would retain.  He was a pure pragmatist in testing the Constitution in its working.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the test of whether University representation should be abolished or not is the question as to whether it works well or not. It is not a new thing in the history of this country.  It has been in existence for over 300 years and we have had University representation in College Green, at Westminster, and in Leinster House.  We have had University representation in this Dáil for the last 14 years.  What reason is there for the abolition of that representation?  Presumably if it had not been doing some useful work during all those years it would have been abolished long ago.  I am not <Col N="119" /> putting up the argument that because it is old it is valuable.  I do not hold the view that because something is venerable it should be retained.  But an institution that has existed for over 300 years should not be abolished unless there is some urgent decisive reason showing that it has been mischievous in some way.  This is the position in my view in regard to University representation.  I say it should be judged by its utility.  In saying that I am not following the line taken by certain Deputies who suggested that this question should be judged on the personal qualities or performances of some of those who sit for the Universities in the present House.</P>
    <P>I must say that during part of this afternoon I felt that certain Deputies in the House were being held up for the examination and scrutiny of other Deputies, to see whether they were worthy of being retained here or not. I felt that was not a ground upon which the House ought to be asked to come to a decision.  Some of the criticisms were amusing.  Greatly to my surprise, I heard Deputy Norton describe the Attorney-General as a rabid politician&mdash;a description which the Attorney-General did nothing to prove by the courteous and reasonable speech which he made in this debate.  I was described myself as though if not quite red I was at least a deep pink in my political views.  That sort of comment may be amusing but the question is really not one of the personal merits of members of the House either now or in the recent past.  The question is whether the system of University representation works well and what are the reasons why it may continue to work well or be supposed to work well.</P>
    <P>There are certain points in this connection which I venture to submit in all sincerity.  I suggest that University representation is likely to bring to the House men of special qualities who are not likely to find their way into the House through other channels.  It has been pointed out that many who represented Universities in the past could come <Col N="120" /> here through other channels, and would be found to be acceptable to people who elect their representatives through other channels.  But it has been pointed out that two or three who, in the minds of everybody, are most useful members of this House attempted to come here through other channels and were not accepted.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General speaking of Edmund Burke said that he did not represent a University in the Parliament of which he was a member but the fact is that although he represented the great City of Bristol in the British Parliament as soon as he showed real independence he lost his seat for Bristol and had to get a seat through some &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; borough.  Examples were given here of University men who came to the House through other channels; and the Attorney-General's view is that such men will find it easy to get elected to this House by other means than as representatives of their University.  But as a matter of fact, Deputies who have come here returned by the Universities represent citizens who are not likely, I think, to get much representation otherwise.  I am not suggesting these citizens need any special protection.  That is a plea I never made; but I suggest, from the point of view prevailing in the country, their point of view is not likely to gain expression in this House if University representation as a means of expressing that point of view is abolished.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming any protection, either for the graduates of the University or for the people with whom those graduates are most in touch.  I do not believe that any such protection is necessary, nor did I believe it 14 years ago when it was urged in all seriousness in this House by some Deputy.  But I say this, that these people have something to give to the country, and something to give to the State that can be of use in this Assembly, and you are going to shut out their point of view by this Bill which, presumably, will pass.  I submit that what public life in this country needs most of all is free criticism, independent criticism.  I believe that <Col N="121" /> has been the need of Ireland all through my life-time.  There has been plenty of violent talk, and we have been strong in invective, but lacking in independent constructive criticism.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a destructive one.  That does not condemn it.  It may be a good thing to destroy a rotten branch. I want it to be established first that the branch is rotten.  No such attempt has been made to-night.  It is a destructive Bill.  It is destroying a part of the Constitution which admittedly has worked successfully.  Admittedly it has done no injustice or unfairness to anybody, but is as representative of the citizens of the country as fully and truly as representation based on a territorial basis.  Admitting that the vote in the University has greater weight than the vote of the ordinary citizen, that is not a cause for its abolition.  It would be a fair argument for the reduction of the number of University representatives.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that University representatives do not bring an independent point of view to this House. That statement was contradicted in the same speech.  Deputy Moore made the curious remark that I took a view directly opposite to that of my colleague, Deputy Thrift.  It is important that the House should realise that we exercise independent judgment; that we are not tied.  Where is the criticism in that?  It seems to me that it establishes a point that I wished to make; that we come here with an independent point of view, and that we are not afraid to express our views when we differ with each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that in making the case for University representation, the Deputy's argument was against himself; that he really expressed disagreement with Deputy Thrift on what seemed to be the principal argument advanced by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if that were so, we may be on different grounds.  If we disagree&mdash;I am not admitting disagreement&mdash;it is a tribute to our independence of view.  Deputy Norton in a most entertaining speech condemned the representatives of the National University because two of them, he said, were rabid politicians.  He was too <Col N="122" /> polite so to describe the third, and of course it would be inaccurate to do so. He condemned the representatives of Dublin University because they were not Party politicians.  What conclusions are we to come to?  I want to make this point clear, that the representatives of Dublin University have found more in common with the big Opposition Party than with the Government Party in recent years.  It has been suggested, particularly by Deputy Norton, that they have been practically merged in that Party.  Of course that statement has no basis in fact.  Dublin University representatives maintain their independence.  It is quite true that their outlook in politics, as well as their economic outlook, has more in keeping with the front Opposition Benches than with the Government Benches.  Is that any criticism of their independence?  If they in their independent judgment agree more with the political and the economic outlook of the leader of the Opposition than with the leader of the Government, is that any cause for criticism?  To suggest that they are tied to the Opposition is untrue, and has been disproved time after time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been somewhat puzzled by the advice advanced from the Front Bench in regard to the particular function of Universities in regard to politics.  In a previous debate in this House when this question was before it about 18 months ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce read a very severe lecture to the Universities and particularly to Dublin University, because it took too much interest in politics.  He said that it would receive much more support from the mass of the people if it were made clear that the sole function of the University in this country was an educational function, and if they took no part in relation to politics.  Education presumably has relation to politics.  I am glad to know that the Minister's practice is wiser than his preaching.  He has on many occasions with great advantage to the students of Dublin University come there and made political speeches to educate and to interest them in politics. That is all to the good.  His chief, the President, has also done his best to <Col N="123" /> interest the students in politics, despite the very severe tone of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he addressed this House 18 months ago.  His view then was that the Universities should be something detached from politics; that they should have no part whatever in relation to politics.  The Attorney-General told us to-night that we have an entirely wrong idea if we accept his colleague's view, and that the Universities should be anything but detached from politics.  Where are we?  In the view of one of the Ministers when speaking in Trinity College, we must regard ourselves as budding politicians.  The latter view has received the assent of the President and of the Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate to one aspect of this question which has not received the importance it deserved.  It has been the subject&mdash;I do not like to use the word&mdash;almost of a sneer from Deputy Moore.  In University representation in this House we still have Irishmen, resident in Northern Ireland, taking part in the legislation of the Free State.  They take part not merely, as Deputy MacDermot suggested, through the representation of Dublin University, but through the representation of the National University. Both Universities have very large numbers of graduates resident in the Northern counties.  These graduates are on the electoral rolls and they take a very active and interested part in the elections in these two constituencies, and through them take part in the government of this State about which they are just as keen as those living in Kildare Street or Merrion Square.  Is it suggested that it is not desirable that these separated Irishmen should take that part?  I do not think it is.  I am quite sure the Vice-President does not desire that.  I am sure he welcomes them.  But it is curious that a piece of legislation by &ldquo;a voting machine&rdquo; is going to break the last link that exists in the unity of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore blamed Trinity College for partition.  What has Trinity College to do with it?  It opposed <Col N="124" /> partition by every means in its power. This is the last word in partition possibly for our time, and at any rate for a considerable time.  It rests with the Vice-President to-night if he demands a division on this motion.  When this Bill becomes law Irishmen in Derry, Antrim, Down and other Northern counties will have no further interest in the political concerns of their countrymen south of the Border.  That to me is perhaps the most deplorable thing in a measure which I deplore, because a link, however small, which tends to maintain the unity of the country will be ruthlessly cut, and this measure is going to cut it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the speech delivered by Deputy Rowlette, and I want to say at once that while I appreciate his view, and the views of other Deputies who spoke in favour of special facilities, special representation by virtue of education for Universities, I am one of those who believe that every penny spent in education is an investment for the national good, and I would go as far as any human being could possibly go to see that education got its share, more than its share, and, in fact, the major share of representation.  There is another aspect I should like to deal with in passing.  Deputy Rowlette, at the end of his speech, said that as soon as this Bill is carried it is the end of any hope for the removal of partition. I do not agree with that.  If all this influence that Deputy Rowlette speaks about of Northern students in Trinity and in National is all to the good down here, will it not be equally to the good if, when this representation is abolished, those students, North and South, gave all their talents, mixed with the people and took a hand in righting some of the wrongs we all know exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most grievous things that did take place, as we are discussing education and representation, is the abolition of proportional representation in the North of Ireland, and I have yet to see, in any paper, one speech delivered by way of protest from the people who are complaining here to-night that their representation is being cut down and destroyed.  I will give credit to Trinity College for <Col N="125" /> all it did in the past as regards partition, and I agree with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Rowlette that there is no doubt whatever that when it was suggested that Trinity College should be partitioned from the rest of the country the late Lord Carson and, if I do not mistake, Mr. Campbell, as he then was, Lord Glenavy, ceased very soon after to be members for Trinity College.  Trinity College deserves credit for that, and it also deserves credit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not to put that interpretation on it.  There was one very big mistake which Trinity College, in my opinion, made, and I think I can relate this to the discussion and to the remarks as to the detached view which Universities ought to take through their representatives in this House.  There is not a University in the world to-day, which takes a detached view from its own countrymen on national matters.  I never heard of one in Germany, France, England or anywhere else.  Trinity College did. The greatest mistake, the greatest error, the greatest nail it ever drove in its own coffin, in the opinion and estimation of the Irish people, was the day Trinity College refused to attend the Dáil in January, 1919.  They were invited.  An election was held and they would not come.  When did this detached view suddenly spring up? Everybody knows&mdash;there is no use in cloaking it&mdash;that Trinity was pro-British, that Trinity was Imperialistic, <Col N="126" /> and that the whole tradition of that College was anti-Irish up to a certain time.  Now we have the new argument coming from gentlemen who, I should say, should know better, as to the detached view which these gentlemen bring into this House.</P>
      <P>Another argument used against this motion is that Deputy McGilligan failed to get elected in a rural constituency, and that the Attorney-General on this side also failed to get elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Let me finish the sentence.  If the Deputy, in 1918, standing on the programme on which he then stood, could have got elected for North Derry, it would have been a political miracle, and if the Attorney-General could have got elected for County Dublin at the time he stood for that constituency it would have been a similar miracle.</P>

He could hold his own in any constituency.  Let there be no mistake about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think too much attention should be paid to the argument about Deputy McGilligan not being able to survive in a rural constituency.  We, in this House, are great at talking about economies and all the rest.  Does it not seem an extraordinary thing that the 7,000 voters in the two Universities should have six <Col N="127" /> Deputies while a rural constituency has only one?  I pass by that, but yet it is a reason for this going through, and I question very much how my own vote would go were I not acting under the aegis of the Party Whip.  I signed a pledge to abide by majority rule in the Party and one of the speeches delivered in this House on the question of University representation, when the Bill was going through, which affected me most, was the speech delivered by Deputy Tom Kelly, my colleague. Although I have certain umbrage against Trinity in many ways, I cannot forget some of the people who have come out of it.  I cannot forget that some of the eminent patriots of this country came out of it and I cannot forget that it has or ought to have the tradition of Emmet, Tone and even Patrick Pearse. I never forgot that, and I always thought that if there was any combination of students in Trinity, who were really sincere in their national outlook, and who pushed home inside that College the views which those men stood for, I would go a long way to help that college, and to help those students, in every possible manner, by representation and otherwise but, unfortunately, I do not think we have arrived at that stage yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot stated that any educated candidate had a very bad chance on the hustings.  I do not believe that.  I do not know what his experiences have been in Roscommon at the general elections which he fought, but from attending conventions and listening to the criticisms of ordinary delegates at the selection of candidates, I know that in constituencies that are held to be backward, in which rural opinions predominate, one of the finest recommendations that can be given to a candidate is that he is a student of National or Trinity.  I have heard that on several occasions, and, as I said when the Bill was going through, the day is passed, and passed for ever, in this country when a University graduate will be looked upon with suspicion.  The ordinary voter wants men of education; he wants men of University calibre; he wants somebody who can put his case in the Dáil, <Col N="128" /> and a University graduate need have no fear of going to a constituency in Ireland in the future, if he can put his case and, naturally, if he is a member of a big Party.  I admit that.  It is all so much moonshine to suggest that a University graduate has not a chance at an ordinary general election, and I, for one, am glad to see that University graduates will have to go home to their own native places, and, if they want to take part in politics, instead of merely recording their vote through the post, participate in a campaign and possibly, as I have said, if they meet the bill, they will be returned for constituencies other than Universities.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Sullivan who quoted Britain in his speech after the Vice-President sat down.  He talked about University representation in Britain, but I should be very sorry that University representation in Ireland, if it were left, should ever be used in the way in which University representation has been used across the water.  After all, Universities are entitled to more consideration than that any Government should use them as safe seats for people whom other constituencies do not want.  That could happen, and has happened across the water.  It is one of the things that has happened.  It happened in Scotland the other day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  I am referring to what happened in Scotland the other day, and I could not help thinking, in view of that, how humorous it would be, at some time in the future, if this Government were not in office and a new Bill were to be brought in to re-establish University representation, if we saw, say, Deputy Norton elected as the representative of Trinity College. Something similar to such a situation as that has happened across the water. I hold that the best type of representation is the ordinary representation through the ordinary constituency.  As I said at the commencement, there is nobody who would go further or who would lend a hand with greater goodwill than.  I would in order to get <Col N="129" /> people of education and well-versed men represented in the various constituencies, and I believe there would always be a welcome for such men in any constituency in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Dr. Rowlette in what he said about some of the things that have been said here to-day.  I did not like the kind of thing that has gone on there all the afternoon, of holding up the six University representatives in this House and asking what will happen as a result of these six representatives going out of this House.  I think that was an unfair way of meeting this motion and I do not think it was right at all.  No matter how severely or how often any Deputy is criticised in this House, that is part of the day's work, after all.  Take it in good faith for what it is worth.  As I say, it is all in the day's work, but that is no reason why these six particular Deputies, if they go as a result of this Bill's becoming law, should be used as an argument in this case.</P>
      <P>I do not think that that was much of an argument at all against the motion because, independent of these six Deputies, there are other representatives in this House, representing other constituencies, who are University graduates.  Quite a number of other members here, belonging to the big Parties, are University people, and, following the argument that has been used about the six Deputies concerned, I might hold these other Deputies up and ask, if they go, what will be the end of this Assembly?  That argument does not cut much ice.  Apart from that, however, I do not think it was a very fair thing to be holding up these Deputies all the afternoon, as Deputy Dr. Rowlette said, to a kind of examination by the rest of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am voting for this motion this evening and, as I said at the commencement, were it not that I had signed the Party pledge I do not know whether I would support the motion or not.  Everybody is agreed that there should not be six of these Deputies here.  I did agree, however, with Deputy Tom Kelly that there ought to be special provision and a <Col N="130" /> special recognition of culture, art, literature and all the rest of it, and that special heed should be paid to the necessity of giving educational representation on every board and assembly in Ireland.  On this particular occasion, as I have said, I, for one, am bound by the Party Whip and I shall support this motion, but I would not object to giving one repretive to each University in proportion to the number of electors there.  As I have said, I am pledged to vote for the motion and I shall do that; but I agree to the utmost with what my colleague, Deputy Tom Kelly, has said, and also with a lot of what he said in substantiation of his argument in the course of the Second Reading.  I say again that Trinity College has given great men to this country in the past &mdash;men of culture and men of learning, as well as great patriots&mdash;and we were always proud to mention their names; but I also assert that, great as Trinity College was in the past, the National University has been just as great in the present.  Whenever this question of University representation crops up, either in the north or the south of this country, I do not think there is anybody alive in Ireland to-day who would say one word against the University that produced Kevin Barry. That is one of the things I have in mind with regard to my attitude towards this motion, and perhaps that is what actuated the mind of my friend, Deputy Tom Kelly, also; and if it were not for my pledge to the Party Whip, there is a question of what way I should be voting to-night. I believe in education and culture, but above and beyond every other thing I believe in the National University and the type of people such as Kevin Barry which that University produced.</P>

      <P>I think that the first word of anybody following Deputy Donnelly would be one of sympathy for the position in which Deputy Donnelly finds himself in having to follow the Party Whip and vote against his inclinations.  The debate on this Bill this evening has ranged over a very wide field.  This question is one which one would be interested to hear those who have had the advantage of education <Col N="131" /> discuss in a logical way, and yet I think that very few Bills that have come before this House have been discussed with less logic than the one before us this evening.  Listening to a number of the Deputies who have spoken, I would say that the best argument against this Bill would be the want of outlook and the want of education that a great number of us suffer from in this House.  The first speech I had the privilege of hearing this evening was that of Deputy Norton.  I thought, as some other speaker remarked here since, that the latter part of Deputy Norton's speech fully answered the first part.  He spoke for a considerable time about the question, and, like Deputy Donnelly, he sought to make us believe that he was speaking in a detached way.  Yet, the only detached view that either Deputy Donnelly or Deputy Norton would credit was one that was attached to their particular view.  The bullets fired by a number of Deputies were aimed particularly at one college.  Now, I have no special reason to defend either college.  But I take my argument from the broad standpoint&mdash;in this House the Minister for Education asks for and gets willingly a very large grant to supply the services of education in this country, and, of course, that is as it should be&mdash;that what our country wants more than anything else at the present time is education, education not in any narrow sense but in its widest sense.  I cannot agree with the view expressed by some Deputies that education is something in a watertight compartment.  In my opinion education might be compared to religion in this respect: that except it is woven into the warp and woof of life, except it is broadened into the ordinary channels of life, it is not worth a snap of your finger.  If education does not help to broaden the mind, to help in the great work of legislation in this country, then I do not know what else can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism was levelled at the representation that we have here from the two Universities.  I have no reason to quarrel with that representation.  I <Col N="132" /> think that those who compose it have proved themselves very useful in helping to improve our legislation.  I have been a member of the House for some years and have come into touch with all of them.  I respect them all, and if I follow unwillingly in the steps of those who have analysed the personnel of the two Universities I will say that they are as good as it is possible to get.  They are capable exponents of the great questions of the day. They are as representative of national, or present-day, politics as it is possible to get.  Under the proposed new system, are we likely to get a better type of representation than we have in the personnel of the present Deputies, bearing in mind the keen, conservative debating minds of Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Thrift, the strong, silent, liberal, thoughtful minds of Deputy Mrs. Concannon and Deputy Alton, or the mild, agreeable, socialistic minds of the Attorney-General and Deputy Rowlette?  I think that in these Deputies we have as good a representation as is to be found in any Party in the House, no matter how they may be hammered at for their so-called Party affiliations.  I think we can say of them that on many occasions they have brought to bear in debates in this House the results of their wide reading.  Because of their learning they were able to deal with aspects of legislation that were left untouched by those of us not so well endowed in the matter of education.  Why should their University connection narrow their interests?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, referring to the majority of the University representatives in this House, said that they regarded the chief Opposition Party as their big brother.  I do not see any harm in that.  I do not see any harm in seeking to help a big brother.  I think it is preferable to helping a hybrid puppet of any other Party.  If those who represent the Universities are convinced that, in taking a certain course, it is right for them to vote for a Government or for an Opposition, I cannot see anything wrong in that.  I cannot see that in doing so their independence is being wasted, or that they have done anything to smirch their character as Independents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> What arguments have been advanced as to why this Bill should be sent back to the Seanad?  During the war period a blessed word came into our vocabulary. It has been much used since on many occasions and in many connections, and that word is &ldquo;camouflage.&rdquo; In my opinion, no Bill that has ever been introduced in this House has been more camouflaged than this one.  I cannot recall any other Bill that has been more surrounded with arguments that were not the real arguments for it than this one.  That is a thought that must always strike one in politics&mdash;the unreality of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General said that the English people were the only people to adopt University representation.  Yet, it is the only country that we think it worth while to imitate in our legislation and in other things.  In my opinion, when a case is put forward for anything it should be examined on its merits.  The real arguments should be put forward as to why a change is desirable.  In my opinion, the leavening of University representation is useful to this House.  I agree with those who have said that without the University representatives this House will be the poorer.  Coming as I do from the country, I can visualise the situation there and agree with the Deputy who asked: what chance is a University representative going to have in an ordinary constituency against, say, a burlesque of Deputy Donnelly, who would carry a constituency with him?  Such a constituency would, in my opinion, deprive itself of representation, because it would be carried away by the arguments of such a person.</P>

      <P>Coming to serious things, may I ask why has this Bill been brought before the House?  I have said before that the real reasons for it have not been given from the Government Benches.  In my opinion, it would be far more honest to give the real reasons for it.  To me it seems like a game of draughts.  We see a chance of giving one man and taking two.  I suggest the real reason for the <Col N="134" /> Bill is that the political machine got to work like those playing soldiers or playing draughts.  The real reason for it is to give one man and to get two, no matter how the Government may try to camouflage it with grandiloquent speeches and high-falutin language. When we get down to bedrock we find that that is the real reason for the Bill.  I do not think that it is right to prostitute the interests of the country and the best interests of legislation in this House for any such low motive as that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnelly has often revealed himself in moods to this House that captivated the House, but never, one must agree with the last speaker, has he shown himself parading his sorrows until to-night. Here he is presenting himself as the man who has been convinced, the man whose mind is definitely made up against the Bill for which he is asked to vote, and he cannot do it.  The Party whip is too strong, the lash is too severe, the breach of discipline once effected would be hard to repair, men in that Party might begin to think for themselves, the idol's feet of clay might have been discovered and there might be a shattering and a convulsion that the Deputy would not care to contemplate if all that arose from his simple vote in accordance with his own convictions but against what has been ordered to him by his Party.  I am sorry, when he did present himself as a man who thinks well if he must act badly, that he should have attempted to fortify himself with arguments of the type he used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trinity College, Dublin, according to him, put a nail in its own coffin-on a particular morning.  If the Deputy is going to hold what people did against them and urge it as a reason for their execution because it does not agree with what he thought at a particular time, he has driven a deep nail in the coffins of very illustrious men.  If there is any doubt about the burial places of Tone or Davis, one could easily find them now.  After the Deputy's speech one would only have to dig up the clay and find if the bodies had not turned after what they had heard if they were listening to what <Col N="135" /> the Deputy said to-night.  He was not content with saying things; he had to press home what he said by detailed argument.  I would be acceptable to him as a comrade had I his view. Trinity College might have been spared this humiliation and the National this defeat if a group of students in Trinity could be got to adopt the Deputy's point of view.</P>
    <P>Was there ever egoism carried to such a point as that?  An institution, because parliamentary representation is an institution in this country, should be destroyed, according to the mind of Deputy Donnelly, who, generally on principle, is against destruction, because there is not a group of students even in one University who think the way the Deputy thinks.  I have said that parliamentary representation is an institution in this country.  I am glad to find that the mandate has not been discussed to-night&mdash;the question of the mandate for this destruction. We were told by the Vice-President in his opening speech on the Second Reading that there was a mandate because some Fianna Fáil club discussed the matter and there was a resolution passed by that Fianna Fáil club and, I think, sent to some Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  When I queried that I was told it got no publicity; it was not one of the resolutions worth while publishing.  There was no mandate even in the Party for it.  Later we got the gem, that a collection of four or five dozen people, who meet as a Convocation of the University, had voted in favour of the abolition of University representation.  So far as Trinity College is concerned, there has been no expression of opinion quoted from them.  So far as the National is concerned, that small group who met in the main for the two or three years after their graduation, when they have not much else to do and because they have not turned as zealously as other people to picture houses or to the Hippodrome&mdash;because these people pass a resolution we are told there is a mandate.</P>
    <P>The Vice-President says: &ldquo;We do not claim there is any mandate; we do not stand on a mandate; it is the <Col N="136" /> Government's duty to bring forward this legislation because it thinks it is necessary.&rdquo;  What about the mandate the other way?  Not merely is the institution of parliamentary representation age-old in this country, but when at a particular time it was thought a suitable opportunity to moot not merely the retention of University representation but the extension of such representation, then we had that wonderful combination amounting to unanimity in this country that has never been seen or any subject other than that one thing.  The Archbishop of Dublin called men to him.  At his instigation, and under the force of the letters he wrote&mdash;to graduates first, and influential graduates they were, men prominent in every walk of life in the Ireland of that day, and after them the Student Representative Council in the Dublin College&mdash;they met and made the demand, not that the representation of Trinity College, Dublin, should be taken from them, but that representation should be given to the other University.</P>
    <P>I assert still, and Deputy Donnelly agreed with me the last time I said it, that when a deputation went from the Student Representative Council to the Committee of Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin guaranteed that University representation would be a plank in their platform, and while that was going on in the House of Commons the Irish Party, who then represented the country as far as election results went, called together a Speakers' Conference, and they got put into the new Constituency Bill the right to University representation extended, not merely continued in this country, but extended to include the other Universities. That was some mandate backed by the best people in the country, backed by every political Party, and no objection taken anywhere.</P>
    <P>Then we came to the foundation of this House.  We were told by the Attorney-General to-day that the view then prevailing was that University representation should be in the Seanad.  That may have been the view, but at any rate it was brought into this House and on a free and open vote, without Party pressure, such as <Col N="137" /> that under which Deputy Donnelly labours, the House decided to have University representation here.  The only other thing urged against this is the document that the Vice-President has so often read, that a certain group of people were sent to inquire into the remaking of the Seanad and the giving to it of more powers.  Then it was thought by some of them that into that fortified Seanad, with larger powers, there might be moved the representatives of the Universities. That view did not prevail with either the members of the Executive Council, to whom it was presented, nor was it ever presented to this House for approval.</P>
    <P>This, therefore, is no new thing that we are speaking of.  It is a thing sanctified by use.  It is a thing that had the approval tacity for many years of people in the country, and when it arose as a burning question it was not from the angle of destruction, but from the angle of extending the University representation.  Deputy Donnelly, seeing the light, must sin against it, but he decides that he must sin against it while he uses this amazing argument, that some time later maybe he will get University representation restored; he will pay some sort of a tribute to himself as he is now, although I do not think he regards himself as worthy of much tribute at this moment by saying &ldquo;We will cut down the numbers, but we will accept the principle and reinstate representation.&rdquo;  But that day will not dawn until a new political mind has dawned in Trinity College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only factor which the Deputy stressed.  Then the Deputy adds that these graduates can only be successful in their entry to this House if they are members of one of the big political Parties.  So the Deputy will place University representation with a certain section of a particular University that is beginning to think like him and then they will put themselves in the same predicament as he finds himself to-night.  When they come here on some big question one of <Col N="138" /> them will have to stand up and say &ldquo;I agree with the view that certain people are urging against me is a sound one, but I am in one of the big political Parties and I must vote with them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy believes that there is going to be value in University representation so confined and in such peculiar circumstances.  The Deputy says that at a time when undoubtedly the big Party idea is in the ascendancy in this country.  At the beginning it was thought here in this country to give play to minorities; to have the benefit of whatever view-point they could express in this House; without destroying the democratic ideal, at any rate to have constituencies on such a scale that a certain small number of people voting under proportional representation could get authority to come here, and to express the view-point of those minorities.  But the University has to be destroyed when the Seanad has been destroyed, and when, under the impact of the revision of constituencies, the small groups even in the constituencies are getting less and less chance.  This objection to a detached view-point is peculiar.  I regard it as ominous.  It is surely the point of view of the absolutist; the man who dislikes criticism; the man who thinks that criticism, because it is criticism, must be unnecessary; the person who, in his egoism, can elevate himself to such a point as to think that any criticism, because it is against him, is un-national, and who will not have it in any way either in another House or in a small group here.  Surely the tendency is clear.  It is a tendency that, carried to another point of excess, would stop the Press; carried to another point would stop political Parties; carry it a little step further and the absolutist emerges clear and distinct.  We are only on the way to him yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore has amazed me to-night.  He thinks the University does provide a special type of man, but he was one who, if allowed to emerge in a parliamentary assembly, was more appropriate to the conditions of a hundred years ago when general debates were common, but not now appropriate when the matters discussed are specialised.  I wondered <Col N="139" /> whether I had taken down a phrase which inverted the Deputy's thought, until he gave me a key to his thought when he asked what good a medical man would be in discussing an engineering matter.  Is it possible to get Deputy Moore to realise that the value of a University is not in the subjects that are taught but in all the accompaniments of University life? Does Deputy Moore think that any University man would pride himself if he were a close and narrow student of a subject and lived a reserved life by pursuing that subject?  Does he think any University body would regard that man as being anything like as good a type generally as the man who, while getting knowledge in a particular branch of work, had also lived a University life, met students, and debated?  Surely the Deputy has heard the phrase about the clash of mind on mind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  I want to get to the clash of mind on mind at crossroads as engineered by the Deputy.  Does the Deputy think it is the engineer or medical man trained as such that is regarded as the valuable man here?  If there is any value in University education, when it sends people here, it is not because it sends a first-class medical man or a first-class engineer to devote specialised attention to the few specialised points that will arise in either engineering or medicine. It is because there is a general background; it is because there is a capacity to get down to first principles. Those are the things that lend aid on the general matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not admitted by the University authorities themselves that that type of general culture is not being produced by the Universities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy again is wandering, if I may use the expression. There may be a complaint all over the world that specialisation is either taking place too fast or that there is too much specialisation, but <Col N="140" /> that does not destroy my argument that in a University before a man begins a specialised course he has about him everything that makes for value in University life.  It is from that he gets his value; not because of his specialisation.  One other phrase which the Deputy used is that the medical man nowadays is not made to take an Arts course.  He might be made to take an Arts course, and be no good. He might be made to take an Arts course, and on top of that a legal course and a medical course, and if he is only a detached student of either he might be no good, at least from the angle of this representative Body.  It is not specialisation that matters; it is the life; it is the capacity to meet and argue and whittle down to the fine points of first principles.  If the Deputy thinks you get that better at the crossroads than in the Universities I envy him for the blissful state he is in.  Does he suggest that that is so? I am not going to be put in the position here of assuming a position of superiority.  I think every representative has felt here that this debate is on entirely wrong lines, and that people speaking more or less on behalf of themselves have undoubtedly forced them into a position in which they have been made to look superior to other people.  I do not want to create any such impression.  I want to argue for the type&mdash;not for the individual.  I want to argue that the University gives a better chance of men being sent here who will argue generally &mdash;not on special points&mdash;better than other people.  They have got their chance.  If they fail on that, and if they are not, on general matters, in a somewhat better position, and in specialised matters in a somewhat worse position than the specialist, then their training has been no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should not slumber in the view that the University man thinks he is likely to be of any benefit in this House because he comes in carrying with him whatever added value he has got from a year's study of one subject.  Very many fine minds have tried to put down in black and white what is the value of a University system.  It is in the <Col N="141" /> atmosphere; it is in the companionship; it is in the clash of mind on mind.  It is unarguable; it is in getting the general view; it is in what used to be called the humanities; but it is hard to get the exact thing explained.  I put it no higher than that which I have just said.  I am content to leave it at that&mdash;that there is in the system a likelihood of producing a type of person who, if he comes here, will aid us not because he is a specialist, but because he has a general power to calculate and to whittle down to first points.  If he is not of value there, he is not going to lend anything to this House on specialised matters.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. I should like to get a reference to anything to the contrary.  Do not let the Deputy say here that I will find references to the evils of specialisation. I am abandoning specialisation. I do not stand for it as the factor that counts here.  That is not an argument against it.  Deputy Moore has also gone to the second bad argument.  He seeks to disabuse people's mind of what he thinks is the second good argument&mdash;that individuals might get in here through the University system who would not otherwise get in.  If the Deputy is confining himself to individuals I leave him.  I am not going to argue about individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are there types of people who would be useful here, and who are less likely to get in here through the ordinary methods of a rough-and-tumble election than if there is some place found for them in some detached constituency? I ask that because that was the type of constituency that Deputy Norton had in his mind, or the type <Col N="142" /> that Deputy Moore had in his mind when he spoke of 100 years ago.  It might be in that case.  But we are dealing here with Universities to which the young men are going, Universities to which the farmers' sons are going; Universities to which everybody who has sprung from the democracy of the country is going, where the students are the people, and will eventually be found to be the people of this country&mdash;not a privileged class as in the old days.  The University has now come down to the people or the people have come up to the University.  At any rate the University is open to the people.  That is a very different situation from the detached constituency of which Deputy Norton was speaking.  Will Deputy Moore come with me this much when I say that if you have men educated under a University system, if you have a man accustomed not merely to have good aims but to relate means to the end, and if you have his whole mentality and attitude always built up to face questions in that way; if he knows when he comes into the light that he is going to be subjected to criticism and that he is going to argue his point and to meet minds trained in the same way as he has been trained, are you not going to get people of a different outlook and mentality than those you get at the cross-roads promising employment to 86,000 persons and not knowing or thinking how that is to be provided? Is the man whose mind is trained in that way going to the cross-roads to talk in millions without knowing where the millions are to come from? Is such a man going to whet the appetites of wretched people with visions of a feast of the Barmecides without thinking for a moment of where the millions are to be got?  Does the Deputy know that there is a habit of mind which may be a handicap at electioneering?  The man with the trained mind finds himself standing in opposition to a man like Deputy Donnelly preaching about something in which he does not believe.  The Deputy must agree that it is not a question of individuals.  It is the system producing a type, and is that type of mind to be available for this <Col N="143" /> House?  That type is such a type that the question is whether it is going to get here at all.</P>
    <P>I stress again the point where I wanted to introduce this argument, this matter of the detachment of the University.  We have come to a system in which the University in this country is as much part of the country as any other institution in it.  It is a great deal nearer the ordinary people of the country than a great many other institutions that have been established.  In this matter I speak for my own University, and if I do that there is no odious comparison meant with the other University.  It is simply because I do not know enough about Trinity College to say how far her influence has penetrated in the same way as the University College has.  University College has given to the people a very good return for what the people did for the University system in founding it.  Could this State have carried on in the beginning if it were not for those who found their education in the National University?  We had a certain point in the history of this country when there was an exodus of people who have vulgarly been expressed as holding down good jobs, people who from every angle were giving good service or service that somebody else had to give.  They left vacancies when they left.  To whom, in the main, was resort made in order to supply that service if not to those who had been educated in the National University?  If the University has been brought down and made part of the very intimate organisation associated with the life of the country, remember it has paid this back to them by the services that have been done on behalf of the people of the country and that despite the peculiar fanatical criticisms which one hears from odd quarters about that institution.  Supposing the University was completely detached and that from it you were to get people sent here who could never make their appeals, because their ideas would be so outrageous or so far removed from the views of people in an ordinary constituency, then something might be said for lopping off such an <Col N="144" /> anachronism.  Remember your University has moved with the times here. I have heard Deputies on the other side taking it as a special pride to themselves that when the country turned Fianna Fáil, the University turned that way too.  Why would it not, and back again it will come, and why would it not?  The swing of the pendulum will have its effect there because it is part of the people.</P>

      <P>Does it not?  And if it does not is that particular institution to be judged by the standards that will apply to the National?  Does Deputy Donnelly think that he is in so completely hopeless a position with regard to Trinity College that he does not think he can get a representative from it?  Will the Party organiser continue to speak in that way?  If those people were definitely alien and not conscious of the activities of the country going on around them, then certainly they might be wiped out. But they draw their students from the ordinary classes in the community and they give back good to the community. Deputy Norton cowers before them. That is the only phrase to be used by anyone who has listened to his speech. The Deputy is afraid of education as represented in the Universities.  If that is his point of view it is, if not based on selfishness, quite artificial and has no roots at all.  Why should the Deputy fear the Universities?  I had thought that even without delving back into more remote history than 1918 Deputy Norton would have got for himself numerous examples to show that everywhere in every country in which there was a revolutionary spirit the University students played a prominent part.  The University students were the first to be affected by the popular movement.  Certainly that is so in countries that have a University of the type that we have here.  But the Deputy is afraid of such a University.  That is the sort of mentality the Deputy has.  Then Deputy Moore is thinking of 100 years ago.  He is thinking of a privileged class of people who have barricaded themselves in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has made a complete mistake there.  My reference was to the parliaments of 100 years ago when most of the discussions were of a general character rather than of the special technical kind that we have to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know.  The Deputy's outlook about Universities is 100 years old, and Deputy Norton's outlook is distinctly so.  Deputy Norton is speaking of Universities as being the last resort of people who were in power and who were determined to maintain that power.  They were going to hold, at any rate, the educational field to themselves.  There was going to be no opening out of the benefits of that system to others.  That is not the situation now.  I would have thought that Deputy Norton, instead of objecting to the Universities, might have decided to found a branch of the Labour Party in some of the Colleges to see could he get somebody with a clear outlook and lucid methods of expression to put before the people plans that they say they have in their minds but have not yet expressed. They would certainly get minds that, being youthful, are not satisfied with the situation just because it happens to exist.  You are likely to get in a University community more criticism of an existing situation than you would get elsewhere.  The people are free and easy.  They have not just at that particular point of time got upon themselves the responsibility of fending for themselves.  Their minds are opening out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always attractive to be a revolutionary. The youthful mind everywhere is in favour of a revolutionary outlook.  Why cower before them? Why be afraid of what the University system will produce, unless the Deputy also has this deep realisation, that the particular type of socialistic doctrine he would like to preach in the University is not very satisfying, that it might soon be discovered to be poison and not a tonic, and he could not get very many people afterwards as the upholder of his banner?  Again it is the argument from the particular. We are told here that the University representatives in this House, although many flattering things have been said <Col N="146" /> about them in many ways, do not move forward with the people.  I challenge that statement.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy look around amongst his own Party and find does he not have here and there an individual who will approve of what Trinity College did at a particular date?  Has the Deputy in his journeys around the country not seen men who were dyed-in-the-wool conservatives and who now pose as ardent Republicans because they know they have that little bit of past to get over?  Does the Deputy always hold what he calls a sin&mdash;I do not admit it to be anything of the sort&mdash; against a man for ever?  Arguments founded upon the Universities producing only conservative people are as much based upon reality as Deputy Moore's view about the specialised minds.  It is a misconception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this from a long acquaintance with University students, that I find that sort of socialistic, social reform, or revolutionary spirit loses a little bit of its strength even as they advance to the old age period of about 22 years.  They are certainly not as much for the barricades in the streets about 21 or 22, or, say, the end of the final medical year, as the man who has just done his matriculation. Even they have been making progress along a certain line.  They have done it with their colleagues around them with arguments going fast and furious in halls, with men meeting here and there, with discussion, debate and an attempt to get reason in play.  The movement of the mind is trained forward, anyway, I do not care what their finish is, to a fixed point of view at the mature age of 22 or 23.  They are better people because they have been through that than if they simply had been revolutionaries at the cross-roads one year because they are a sort of &ldquo;not-having-anything&rdquo; class; <Col N="147" /> and strong conservatives about two years later when they have got something, because that is not an advance along mental progress.  That is only an advance because of the satisfaction of certain material matters.</P>
    <P>Without attempting, or wishing, or hoping, to present myself in any way as a superior person, might I say this?  I have been accused here, I understand, by somebody of being a partisan.  It is not a vice except when it goes to the excess that Deputy Donnelly carries it.  But there are types and types of partisans. The partisan who takes up a battle-cry, and who will defend such a slogan to such a point that he can hear nothing else, is dangerous.  I doubt if the term partisanship is properly applicable to him.  But if one has really thought out the reactions of various proposals, and having thought them out, comes definitely to a conclusion, and is strong in the affirmation of that conclusion&mdash;if that is partisanship, I am a partisan.</P>
    <P>I have had six or eight years in which certain constitutional and economic matters were pressing.  I formed a judgment upon them.  It may have been right or wrong.  I believe those judgments to be right. May I excuse myself by saying that, in the main, they were not my own, but I followed them.  Is it any harm to have people in this House to express them in a thorough-going fashion, not like Deputy MacDermot, not merely seeing good on each side, but just not knowing what side one ought to be on, because, as he said, there is so much good on one side, but because, as I suspect, there is too much evil in not being against either or both sides.</P>
    <P>I believe in Party government. Deputy Donnelly nods.  I have a reservation.  I certainly believe in Party government rather than contemplate a House filled&mdash;and I am not going to be personal in this&mdash;with 153 Deputy MacDermots.  Would there ever be finality in debate or proposal if the House were entirely composed of Deputies like that?  I think there is a great deal to be said for the <Col N="148" /> Party system.  I think it can be carried to excess, but I think the Party spirit and partisanship, if that be the result of it, is surely at its best when you have men&mdash;I am not confining this to University representatives&mdash; who have seriously argued about matters and formed definite conclusions and who express themselves with as much vigour as they can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly talked of the fate I suffered in an election.  Deputy MacDermot was good enough to say that if I carried a certain pungency into a constituency, other than a University, it might be good for myself and others.  He knows as well as I do that it is not pungency that counts in an ordinary constituency&mdash;it is a foghorn voice; it is the capacity to say &ldquo;Up Somebody,&rdquo; as if that formula wrapped up all that there was of philosophy, political or economic, in this country.  Deputy Donnelly will agree with me that in the particular constituency in which I got defeated it was not so much that I could not get my voice across to a big number of the electorate as that I could not get any number of the electorate to listen to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <P>I remember asking on one occasion the Party manager, whom Deputy Donnelly had been good enough to send up to that constituency for me at the time, if I could have a meeting at a certain place, and I was assured that I could.  And then my modesty broke out, and I indicated a small hall would do, and he said a bathing box would be too big to contain the lot.  Would Deputy Donnelly also go this length, that in the last four or five years things have become more ruthless and very low.  He knows where the responsibility for that lies.  Does he not know that in the main in the years 1929, 1930 and 1931 if one wanted to speak to one's constituents people attended not to listen to any Deputy's tution but to ask what his salary was and how often he wore his dress clothes?  Deputy Donnelly must realise that there are many sincere men who would not like to tolerate that as an ordinary habit of life.  The Deputy <Col N="149" /> might believe that audiences trained in that way, if they had not a little better tution and improvement, might not find it so easy to return a graduate and might share some of Deputy Norton's views that he was a bit aristocratic, a snob, or a man that Deputy Corry would not care to shake hands with.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Demonstration Farms&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Department of Agriculture should run several farms in each county under the direction and supervision of its agricultural instructors, independent of all other activities, on which decent wages would be paid, accounts kept and audited, balance sheets published with appropriate explanations of costings, profits, etc., for the purpose of demonstrating to farmers in a practical way how to make their industry pay.  (Deputies Patrick McGovern.  Timothy J. O'Donovan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has already been debated at some length. Although a strong case was made for it, from this side, the only reply we have had, so far, was from the Minister for Agriculture and what I might term some form of reply from Deputy Corry. The Minister said he thought that there was a political move behind this, and that it was got up for the purpose of making a further attack upon the policy of the Government, and to have another rattle at the economic war.  I assure the Minister that was not my motive when I put my name to this motion.  I had the idea for a long time, and particularly since this Government came into office, that a motion such as this was very necessary, and a right step to be taken by the Department of Agriculture.  There are others who think the same thing, as was proved by a resolution passed at the Cork Committee of Agriculture on Saturday last.  The resolution was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That this Committee invite applications for the taking of a 50-acre <Col N="150" /> farm, on which they would place one of their instructors to demonstrate the manner in which land can be made profitable.</P>
    <P>That committee consists of sensible hard working men who know their business and who have got credit from the Department officials, in the past, for having been of wonderful assistance in the development of the Department's policy.  When the Cork Committee of Agriculture sponsored such a motion as this I do not see any reason why the Minister should not accept the motion which we have tabled in this House.  We hear a lot about existing conditions in agriculture.  I do not want to refer to the economic war. In regard to the present policy of the Department we hear a lot about their tillage scheme and the amounts realised from the production of beet and wheat and other farm produce under that great scheme.  We have no account of the cost of production in the case of beet or wheat.  If we had a demonstration farm, such as mentioned in the motion before the House, it would be possible for an instructor in charge of such a farm to set out a correct account of costings and let people know the result.  They would then know whether the policy of tillage, and the growing of wheat and beet, is a sounder and better policy, financially, than the policy pursued for a number of years past in the country by the Department and its officials.</P>
    <P>There is an experimental farm quite close to my place.  The Minister said it would be impossible to carry them on without subsidies.  I agree these farms must be subsidised.  They have given very useful service to the State and are continuing to do so, but I hold they are not suitable for the purposes mentioned in this motion.  The average size of a farm in this State to-day is 40 acres.  We have farmers and their sons living on these farms.  If the son of a farmer living on a 40-acre farm goes to a 300-acre or a 1,000-acre farm, for education purposes, and spends a year there, he will come home filled with ideas much too big for a 40-acre farm.  He will come home filled with motions about reapers and binders and machinery which costs a lot of money, and the result is that the last stage <Col N="151" /> is worse than the first.  While they may give useful service I am afraid they are not suitable for the averagesized farmer.  That is one of the reasons why I stress the necessity of establishing one of these farms.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons, in reference to costings, that the Department has not so far considered.  It was tried under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government for a while.  I do not know why it was let drop.  I wish it had been continued for some time so that we would know where we stand in this matter.  We hear a great deal about the prices realised for wheat and beet, but not a word about the cost of production.  I cannot speak about beet, but I know that the average return from wheat is eight barrels to the acre. The price when most farmers sold the crop was £1 3s. 6d. a barrel.  It may be taken that £9 8s. 0d. was realised on an acre in that way, and that 30/- was realised from the straw.  I have not the items of the costings, but they can be had in the report of the Cork Committee of Agriculture.  They amounted to something like £8 10s. 0d., including seeds, manure, ploughing, harrowing, rolling, reaping, threshing, etc., rent and annuities.  That would leave a profit of something like £2 0s. 0d. on an acre.  These figures were given by a prominent member of the Cork Committee of Agriculture in the presence of the Department's inspectors, and have not been contradicted by anybody.  I take it if the costings err on any side they are on the low side.  If we had demonstration farms we could find out if these figures were correct.  The average profit on wheat would be £2 0s. 0d. per acre.</P>
    <P>Coming to cattle, the Minister in his wisdom thought fit to have the young calves slaughtered, for reasons that I do not know.  I take it that an acre of land that grows wheat must be good land.  On that land under grass I would put four calves as soon as they were ready to go out in April.  I take it that it would feed these calves until they were fit for the market, in addition to the separated milk that a farmer has, as well as other feeding <Col N="152" /> stuffs, oats, potatoes, wheat, turnips or mangolds.  The cost, including rates, annuities and labour, would be about £16.  I am putting down prices under normal conditions, if we had not the economic war, and if the market was open&mdash;the market is still open if we were wise&mdash;when these cattle would realise £8 each at the end of 12 months. Cattle of that type are at present realising £8 in the open market and more.  If the cost of producing the four calves is £16, and taking it that they would realise £32, in my estimation, that would leave £16 for the farmer.  That is a big difference from the £2 he would have on wheat.  I believe it is the same in connection with beet growing, because the cost of production is higher.</P>
    <P>In the monthly report issued by the Department of Agriculture, in calculating average prices, it mentions that first-class stores, 12 to 15 months, realised from £3 15s. 0d. to £6 0s. 0d., and that the average price was £4 17s. 6d.  Even at that price the profit realised from four cattle is much more than what is realised on wheat, not to mention the difference in the condition of the land.  Unless land is properly manured and cared after wheat there is an amount of deterioration, while under cattle the land improves.  I should like if an experiment could be carried out which would give costings and indicate what would produce the best results for farmers. I consider that the report for November, 1935, is not correct.  It states that calves under one month realised from 10/- to £1 15s.  My experience in West Cork, in the month of November, was that calves under one month were selling from 2/- to 5/- per head.  I cannot understand from what quarter a report like that came. It is a misleading report.  I cannot understand who is responsible for it. Calves from one month to nine months are given as value for £1 12s. 6d. to £2 15s. 0d.  No such price was realised at any fair in any part of the Free State for calves.  If there were such farms it would help to avoid having misleading reports and misleading the people.  I am sure the Minister is not responsible.  Such reports should not be sent out.  If demonstration <Col N="153" /> farms were available, and if the prices realised could be seen, there would be no such statement issued that calves, one month old, sold from 10/- to £1 15s. 0d.</P>
    <P>Another matter that could be dealt with by men in charge of demonstration farms is the annual cost of repairs to machinery and the expenditure incurred owing to the deterioration of farm buildings.  No farmer is able to estimate these items accurately.  He does not know where he stands between tariffs and the prices or the quality of the stuff he buys.  The expert knowledge that an official of the Department would have would enable him to arrive at what the deterioration of machinery and farm buildings represents.  When we have all these details we could see whether the policy of the Government is leading us in the right direction or not. With regard to the 50-acre farm, which is the average that the President or the Minister for Agriculture looks forward to seeing, before we go into the 50 or the 30-acre level, or whatever an economic holding would be, I should like to see demonstrations carried out on some such farms.</P>
    <P>That would prove that on the Government's policy it would be possible for farmers to pay decent wages, to replace farm implements, to provide a decent livelihood for themselves and their families, enable them to educate their children, and perhaps put something aside for the rainy day.  The important thing on these demonstration farms would be the keeping of accounts and costings showing a profit and loss balance sheet.  If we had these details farmers would know their position and the country would be the wiser.  I am afraid that very little interest is taken in demonstration or experimental plots conducted by agricultural instructors.  Nobody goes to visit them.  Reports are issued by the county committees of agriculture, but they do not reach the average farmer.  If demonstration farms were worked in each county, and perhaps more than one in each county, to show how the instructor, or whoever took charge of them, would carry out his work and to show what profit he <Col N="154" /> has at the end of the year, how the different crops pay and what their costs are, it would be highly educational for the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said he was able to make money on farming, and he invited some of our people to go down and inspect his farm and to spend some time working with him.  I do not know that there is very much to be learned on Deputy Corry's farm.  His farming may be as slipshod as a good many others in the State.  He said that he had the advantage of having a good market for his milk.  That counts for a lot, because the milk cheque is important at the moment.  Another experiment that could be carried out is in relation to the feeding of pigs.  When we in the Free State have to pay £8 per ton at present for an admixture containing 50 per cent. of barley or oats, our neighbour across the Border is able to buy maize, pure Indian meal, sold in Derry at £4 15s. 0d. a ton.  That is a difference of £3 5s. 0d. which we have to pay for our 50 per cent. admixture, and if it takes three sacks of meal, as the Minister, I think, said on one occasion, to fatten a pig, it means, with a difference of 8/- per sack, that we start with a disadvantage of 24/- in the production of our bacon as compared with our neighbour across the Border.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the resolution from the Cork Committee <Col N="155" /> of Agriculture, I hope the Minister will accept this motion and support the Cork County Committee in its endeavours to see that we will have proper costings, and that he will send some of his instructors to take up a farm in West Cork where they grow neither wheat nor beet.  It was suggested by a member of the committee who is a very competent farmer and expert that if some of his experts could go to the slopes of Mount Gabriel in West Cork or to the side of Hungry Hill and prove how the farmer can make ends meet on wheat and beet at the moment, it would be very satisfactory to know that the people in the better situated areas would be so much better off.</P>
      <P>There is very little further to say on this motion.  I commend it to the consideration of the Minister.  I ask him to accept it and to accede to the demand from the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, which is composed of hard-headed farmers and businessmen, and to let us have an opportunity of knowing, within the next year or two, where we stand, and on what the farmer can make profits and where his losses are.  It would be a lesson to all of us if this experimental farms idea were carried out; it would be educational for our young people growing up and a step in the right direction.  If the Minister's policy is one which he can stand over, and which he believes to be sound, there is no reason at all why he should not accept the motion and have these farms started immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in speaking on this matter pointed out that there were certain difficulties in regard to administration, and suggested that he could not very well utilise the agricultural instructors because they did not belong to him, that they belonged to the county committees. At the same time, I should like to remind the Minister that the Government have some obligation towards the farming community and in whatever way they are able to offer assistance to the farmer, by way of example or otherwise, in showing him how he may make a profit out of his <Col N="156" /> farm, the obligation to do so rests on the Government.  Before the present Government came into office, the farmer was making a living; he was meeting his obligations and paying his way; he was laying up a little money for his sons and daughters. But that has all ceased.  The farmers are not able to meet their obligations. What obligation has the Minister towards them?  The reason I rose at all is because I want to put a concrete case to the Minister and to sound, so far as I can, a note of warning to the Minister and to the Government. It is not a matter of politics; it is a matter of economics, purely and simply, and a matter, to my mind, at least, which is going to effect the fundamentals of our industry.  The case in point to which I would direct the Minister's attention refers to the inability of farmers to get farmyard manure for their farms at present. Once that happens, once you deprive this country of live stock, the farmers are finished, and Deputy Corry knows that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer in my locality who is 100 per cent. Fianna Fáil has 24 acres of land.  Four acres were a type of bottom land which he generally meadowed.  Last year he tilled altogether 14 acres.  That was very good from the Fianna Fáil point of view, but let us see how good it was for his own future and the future of this country.  If the Minister, or Deputy Corry, or anybody else, could show this man, who now finds himself in a dilemma, what to do in his present circumstances, I should be very grateful. He had 14 acres of tillage last year, three acres of wheat, four acres of beet, three acres of oats, and one acre each of barley, turnips and mangels, rape and potatoes.  That was very good out of a 24-acre farm.  He had four acres of callow meadow and six acres of tillage.  He manured six acres last year&mdash;four acres of beet and an acre of potatoes, turnips and mangels.  Up to last year he had three cows, six calves and six yearlings, and that was the base of his farmyard manure.  He got out of some of these live stock, and at present has two cows, four calves and three yearlings.  How is he going to <Col N="157" /> manure eight acres of land which grew cereals last year?  That man has a problem facing him, and I should like the Minister or Deputy Corry or anybody else to tell that man where he is going to get farm manure for these eight acres.  He manured six acres last year, but he had more stock &mdash;practically twice as much as he has this year.  This year he has eight acres to manure.  How is he going to do it?  The very soil has been robbed of its fertility by the Minister's policy.</P>
    <P>There is something due to these people.  Whether by way of demonstration or advice, there is an obligation on the Minister to give something to these people that will show them how they are to meet their obligations and how they are to avoid pauperising themselves and their families and the main industry of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little left for me to say on this motion because I think there has been an admirable case made for it.  The Minister has been very well answered by the very first speaker, Deputy Dillon, and by other speakers since. I think he has been answered perfectly. As far as Deputy Corry is concerned, there was really nothing to answer in his case, because, from beginning to end, his speech was just like all his speeches in this House. The first man to disapprove of this motion was Deputy Belton.  Well, the whole of Deputy Belton's speech could be summed up in one sentence, which was to the effect that nobody outside a lunatic asylum could believe that it was possible to make farming pay in this country at the present time and under the present policy of the Government.  Deputy Belton is hitting the people on the Government benches very hard.  They are not in a lunatic asylum.  They are outside it.  Yet they profess to believe this.  If people do not believe that and yet profess to believe it, they are just hypocrites.  Deputy Belton also mentioned that I was hard on some of the officials because I made certain statements, but he did not go on to prove that.  I have not <Col N="158" /> been hard on the officials, and I challenge anybody to quote anything I ever said that could be construed as being hard on the officials.  I certainly said that they were men who were competent to give instruction and to demonstrate, if they got the opportunity, whether land could pay under present conditions or under any conditions.  I repeat that statement and I am prepared to stand over it.  If I did not believe that they were competent to give instruction and to carry on these demonstration farms according to the very best methods, I would not propose this motion to which I have put my name along with that of Deputy O'Donovan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that he does not think it is a practicable proposition I have a good deal of respect for Deputy Belton's views because I know that he takes an interest in agriculture. It has been hard, of course, upon the Fianna Fáil Party when Deputy Belton said that nobody outside a lunatic asylum would believe that anybody could make land pay at the present time.  I am prepared to give the Fianna Fáil Party credit for being sincere in their belief that land would pay&mdash;although I believe it would be impossible to make land pay under present conditions&mdash;because there are very few practical farmers in the Fianna Fáil Party and very few who could make their farms pay, standing on their own, at the present time. Deputy Corry, of course, may be able to make his farm pay because he is supplying Cork with milk.  He may be getting a very good price for his milk there.  I do not know what he is getting, but it would have to be more than 3½d. a gallon in order to make it pay.  If everybody around the whole country went into competition with Deputy Corry and sold their milk in Cork, what would be the price then? I am sure it would be less than 3½d. a gallon.  Deputy Corry's case, however, is an isolated case.  I have been able to make my own land pay, as far as that goes, and I and my people have always been able to make it pay and we do not want instruction from anybody, but at the present time I do not believe it is possible to make it pay.  However, as I say, I do not want <Col N="159" /> to deal with isolated cases.  I am not here in my own capacity to speak for myself, as Deputy Corry seems to do, but to speak for the farmers whom I have the honour to represent, in the same way as other Deputies here should do.  For that reason, I take the broad view and have regard, not to my own personal interest at all, but to the interests of those I represent.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he looked on this motion as a joke and that he thought the motion was put down really to give us an opportunity to discuss the economic war.  I can assure the Minister, like my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, that it was not my intention to create an opportunity for discussing the economic war.  I can assure the Minister that the economic war is the most unpleasant subject we could touch and that there is no practical farmer trying to live by land who wants to discuss the subject of the economic war.  It is too unpleasant a subject and we would all like to get away from it, and we have often advised the Minister to get away from it.  However, although I did not want to introduce the economic war, nevertheless, the economic war obtrudes itself into every question dealing with agriculture that is introduced into this House.  It is impossible to discuss anything connected with agriculture without the economic war obtruding itself, because the economic war has destroyed our market for agricultural produce and has reduced the price for the commodities produced to less than half.  Therefore, it is impossible to get away from it, and the Minister must recognise that fact.  I did not want to introduce that subject, but, whenever it does cross my path, I do not run away from it like a coward, and I am surprised that the Minister should want to run away from it.  It must be remembered that it is only a short time ago since some of the Minister's own colleagues boasted that they fired the first shot in this economic war.</P>

Why should they be ashamed of it now? Why should they try to run away from it?  We are not ashamed of it nor are we running away from it, but we have no responsibility for it.  When the Minister has responsibility for it, let him be man enough to stand by it and not be ashamed of the baby his Party fathered.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the demonstration farms and I am answering the Minister as completely as possible.  Now, at the time I introduced this motion to the House I did not know that the experiment had ever been tried either here or elsewhere, but since then my attention has been called to the fact that this very proposal, or something very similar to it, has been put into operation in America with great success.  I will refer to the life of Walter Page, one-time American Ambassador to England.  In Volume 1, page 96, of his life we find this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. Kapp has made the discovery in relation to farms that utilitarians had long since made with reference to other human activities, that the only way to improve agriculture was not to talk about it but go and do it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the 50 years agricultural colleges had sprung up over the U.S.A. Dr. Kapp had been president of one himself.  Practically every Southern State had one or more.  Agricultural lecturers covered thousands of miles annually telling their yawning audiences how to farm. Their efforts had scattered broadcast much valuable information about the subject, but the difficulty lay in inducing the farmers to apply it.  Dr. Kapp had a new method. He selected a particular farmer and persuaded him to work his farm for a period according to methods which he prescribed.  He told his pupil how to plough, what seed to sow, how to space his rows, what fertilisers to use and the like.  If a selected farm yielded a profitable return which a farmer could sell at an increased price Dr. Kapp had sufficient faith in human nature to believe that that particular farmer would continue to operate his farm on the new method and that his neighbours, having this practical example of growing prosperity, would imitate him.  Such was the famous demonstration work of Dr. Kapp.  This activity is now a regular branch of the department of agriculture employing thousands of agents.  Its application to the South has made it practically a new and rich country, and it has long since been extended to other regions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is an example of the motion that we have introduced put into practice with the greatest possible success.  Is there any reason why the Minister should not try an experiment in running these demonstration farms here which have proved so successful elsewhere?  The reason, I suppose, is, as he has almost admitted himself, that the economic war makes it perhaps <Col N="162" /> impossible.  I confess that we might not be so anxious to have these demonstration farms at the present time were it not for the impossible position under which farmers are expected to carry on to-day.  I think that this motion gives the Minister an excellent opportunity to prove the wisdom or the unwisdom of his policy. If he believes in his policy he has a good opportunity to prove it through his own instructors on practical demonstration farms.  He can prove to the farmers of the country that farming, according to his directions, can be carried on with success.  There is no use in Deputy Corry saying that he is making his farm pay.  How do we know whether he is or not?  Why does he not produce his accounts?  If he produces his accounts and his costings we will be glad to examine them.</P>

      <P>The Minister also told us that the management of one of these farms would be a full-time job for any one man.  It seems to me that the Minister does not understand what we have in view when he makes a statement such as that.  What does the management of one of these demonstration farms mean?  An agricultural instructor could carry out what we have in mind.  It would really mean, perhaps, one visit a week to that farm. He could go there in his motor car and spend three or four hours on the farm. Suppose he had two or three farms in a county he could spend one day a week attending to the work of these farms.  He would have men working there, with one man in charge.  He would see what fields were to be broken, what cattle were to be sold, and what work generally was to be done.  He would make arrangements for the coming week until his next visit. He could arrange to visit the farms weekly or bi-weekly and make whatever arrangements he thought fit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might keep his mouth shut because before I finish I will give him something to chew.  The Deputy should remember that he is not at the cross-roads now on a herring barrel.  The Minister said that the management of one of these farms was a full-time job for an agricultural instructor.  This motion sets out clearly what we have in mind.  An agricultural instructor should have a couple of farms in his charge.  The motion speaks of several farms, but suppose we had one or two in each county for a beginning.  I would say two at least in different parts of the county, where you had different types of farming.  The instructor could put a competent man in charge of each. If he pays a man decent wages and observes decent conditions he will have no difficulty in getting competent men to carry out his instructions.  The instructor could visit the farms weekly or bi-weekly and give the men in charge instructions.  They could employ the labour necessary to work the farms in the same way as the engineers do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Cavan we have five engineers and they are responsible for 1,800 miles of roads.  All these roads are done by direct labour.  There are a certain number of gangers under the charge of the engineers.  The engineers give directions to the gangers and visit the works as occasion demands.  Does the Minister seriously contend that, if these engineers are able to attend to 1,800 miles of road, and, over and above that, carry out engineering work for the Board of Works, that an agricultural instructor would not be able to take charge of one or two little farms and direct how they should be run?  He could give <Col N="164" /> his instructions to the men in charge of the farms and see that accounts were properly kept.  We could provide them with the books.  That is all that would be necessary.  The men, I am sure, would be quite competent to carry out their instructions.  That would not be such an enormous task as the Minister seems to think.</P>
    <P>I think it was a ridiculous statement for the Minister to make that the running of one of these farms would be a whole-time job for a trained man like an agricultural instructor.  At the present time they are in charge of demonstration plots in four or five dozen places over a county and have to pay visits to them.  Would it not be much easier to have all these demonstration plots centred in one or two farms and see that these farms were made pay?  If they were able to make them pay and if they kept accounts, to be furnished at the end of the year, these accounts could be open for inspection and people would be glad to see that there was money to be made out of farming.  They would be glad to come to these demonstration farms to see how farming could be made pay.  The present system of having isolated plots, a perch in size, here and there with no records in the way of accounts or costings to show whether the work paid or not, means nothing.  The Minister asked me if I visited the Ballyhaise Agricultural College quarterly to see how things were going there.  I answered him &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I am not so foolish as that. Why should I go there quarterly? Someone on this side asked the Minister if farms such as Ballyhaise paid, and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He said the farm was there for experimental purposes and not to make it pay.  What, then, would I gain by going there?</P>
    <P>The object that we have in view in this motion is to see that successful experiments are demonstrated on these demonstration farms.  The Minister either misunderstood or pretended to misunderstand me when he suggested that I wanted to upset the experimental farms.  I do not desire to do anything of the sort, because I believe these farms are doing very useful work.  Deputy Belton suggested that I was finding fault with the <Col N="165" /> work done by these farms, especially the one at Glasnevin.  Nothing of the sort; I would not interfere with them. What we really need is the type of farm on which practical demonstrations will be given and from which the farmers will learn something.  The trouble with those experimental farms is that they all lose money.  If they cannot show that they are able to make a profit, the farmers will not bother their heads about them.  They do not bother much about lectures for the same reason.  They realise that the instructors are excellent men, but when it comes down to practical farming they do not think these men could make farms pay.  I would like to see definite proof that they can make farms pay.  Once you convince the farmers that these men can make a farm pay, then they will have a belief in these men and they will be prepared to carry out their instructions.</P>
    <P>At the opening of this debate I referred to a demonstration carried out at the Spring Show.  The Minister said that that demonstration was carried out for the purpose of teaching the farmers what not to do.  There was not a single word at that demonstration about the price beef was commanding. We were merely shown how certain experiments were carried out. The Minister admitted on that occasion that feeding cattle did not pay, and he said the pigs and the hens and other things would make up for any loss.  According to the Department's experiments at the Spring Show, feeding cattle is not a paying proposition.  According to the Minister, the farmers are not to feed cattle, but are to revert to pigs and hens.  Only a few months ago we considered a Bill dealing with the price of pigs, and an amendment by Deputy Dillon put it very plainly that the producers of pigs should get an economic price.  The Minister or some of his colleagues admitted frankly that if the farmer got an economic price for producing pigs the whole country would go in for pig production.  After suggesting that feeding cattle would not be a paying proposition, he advocates pig production, forgetting <Col N="166" /> that a short time ago he would not guarantee an economic price for pigs. Therefore, if we assume that cattle and pigs are a failure, there is nothing to fall back on but hens. Does the Minister seriously suggest that farmers must live on the profit they make from hens, because that is what it comes down to?</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, considering all these things, that we should ask him now to get his experts to demonstrate how to make farming pay?  I think that is a very reasonable proposition. Is it right to have men who know nothing about practical farming going around the country lecturing farmers to do so and so with their land and assuring them that if they do it they will be prosperous?  These men are going round badgering the farmers, saying they are this and that, that they are going to change the old system and make the farmers prosperous, I ask you in all sincerity is that right?  Why not let the experts, the men trained to do this thing, lecture and demonstrate on a farm in a manner that will have some effect?  Why not ask them to do actual farming work and produce accounts showing that the business can be made pay?  If they do that, if they can show farming will pay, then it is up to the farmers to imitate their methods.  That would be much better than going round preaching from platforms and misrepresenting the situation.  As it is, the farmers do not give them much credit because experience has convinced the farmers that it is impossible under present circumstances to make the land pay.  I myself believe it is not possible to make farming pay under present conditions, and I think it is up to the Minister, if he contends the contrary, to prove that it is possible to make farming profitable.  If the Minister has any belief in his own statements it is up to him to put his ideas into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that I am prejudiced against the instructors.  I deny that and I challenge the Minister to produce any statement which would go to show that I am prejudiced.  I merely want those instructors to get <Col N="167" /> an opportunity to teach the farmers in a more practical fashion and give the farmers some confidence in their teachings so that they will profit by instruction. If I were prejudiced against the instructors I would not be suggesting now that they should get an opportunity of putting the Minister's beliefs into practical form and demonstrate that farming will pay.  As a matter of fact, I believe if anyone could make the land pay it is the agricultural instructor.  However, I was told privately by a very prominent instructor that that would be almost impossible, but I will let that pass.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we must cease interfering with the honest farmer.  The Minister has made many charges of dishonesty against farmers and it is time he withdraw his charges.  It is a shame to charge the struggling farmers with dishonesty. The farmers of Ireland are the most honest people in the world.  If there is any dishonesty at all it only made its appearance since the Minister took up office because, through his policy, he has made it almost impossible for them to pay their way.  But who are the honest farmers.  I suppose those farmers who support his Party.  Let me read a letter from one of these honest farmers.  It comes all the way from the County Kerry, a good county:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Clahane, Tralee.</P>
    <P Just="Right">December 1st, 1935.</P>
    <P>Sir,</P>
    <P>I have seen where a motion proposed by you is now being debated in the Dáil.  It is headed in the <i>Irish Press</i> `Trial Farms Motion,' and it would be very interesting indeed to see how the agricultural instructors would succeed where men who have been on the land all their lives have failed.  I have a small farm here, about 23 Irish acres, from which I was evicted in 1907 and reinstated in 1916.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there is a part here which is personal; I will pass over that, but the Minister can see it for himself if he wants to.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I may state that I am not a supporter of your Party, and Fianna <Col N="168" /> Fáil has done little for me, but I think your proposal is honest and should be supported by all Parties so as to enable the poor old farmer to be relieved from the front line trenches.  ... I could not purchase a pair of socks out of my farm, but I am about £200 in debt at the moment, and I am just wondering where the money to pay my annuities is going to come from.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Jerh. O'Shea.'</P>
    <P>You can make any use you like of this letter.  It is the letter of a very honest farmer; he would have nothing to do with this side of the House, and therefore he must have been an honest man. There is an opinion of the policy of the present Government as stated by an honest farmer.  Deputy Corry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;made a very ridiculous speech here.  He kept repeating foolish statements and foolish mis-statements until he was ordered to sit down.  I am sorry he has left the house.  He said that I was compelled to make an apology to  the agricultural instructor for a statement I made here on a previous occasion with reference to his visits to the district.  I deny that.  Whether Deputy Corry took that into his own head, or whether somebody so informed him, I say that is not so.  I had communications from the Minister for Agriculture in connection with that statement, and the Minister could give Deputy Corry any information he wanted.  I stand by that, and I repeat that statement in this House&mdash;that we were 25 years without an agricultural lecture being delivered in the district. I now repeat it again, and I am not going to withdraw it or apologise for it, because it is true.  If Deputy Corry can only repeat that kind of thing and waste an hour in this House it would be as well if he did not speak at all. He also invited Deputy Dillon or myself to go down and be trained on his farm.  I am very thankful to Deputy Corry, but I have no intention <Col N="169" /> of taking advantage of his hospitality. From some things I heard about Deputy Corry's farm I would rather keep away from it.  I believe there is a slippy step somewhere near Deputy Corry's house.  I do not want to say anything about it.  I should prefer to learn in some other school, because we in Cavan have a reputation for straight dealing, and we are anxious to keep that reputation.</P>
      <P>The Minister wrote to me at the time with reference to the statement I made here with regard to the agricultural instructor.  I put the subject matter of this motion before the Minister at that time, and he promised to give it careful consideration.  That was the very beginning of this idea which is expressed in this motion.  The Minister promised to give it very careful consideration.  Why did he think it deserved careful consideration then, and discover now, as he stated when making his speech on this motion, that he thought it was a joke?  It was not a joke then; it was worthy of consideration, and when he came to speak on it after two years he thought it was a joke.  The Minister has been making a joke of agriculture, but I am afraid that instead of being a comic subject he has turned agriculture into a tragedy.  I am afraid he is a very bad comedian; he would make a better tragedian.  Agriculture is being turned into a tragedy in this country.  I hope the Minister will carefully consider this subject, even though he does vote against it.  I hope that those farmer Deputies who are behind him will induce him to make a beginning, and to prove to those fellows on the other side of the House, beyond nay or yea, that his policy is a sound one.  I challenge him to do it; I defy him to do it.  We are supposed to be misrepresenting the Minister's policy.  I challenge him now to put it to the test. I know that ten years ago if any man who was an agricultural instructor got the opportunity of getting farms to take over and show a profit he would be very glad to do so and get a percentage of the profits.  There never was a time until to-day that men would not be glad if they got the money to run farms and make them show a profit.</P>

      <P>At the present time I doubt if the Minister would get anybody to undertake to show that he could make a farm pay.  I am afraid the Minister himself does not believe it, and that, after all, there is something in what Deputy Belton says&mdash;that only somebody fit for a lunatic asylum would believe it.  If they do not believe it there is a good deal of insincerity on those benches.  I hold that a profit cannot be made, and I challenge the Minister to prove that it can.  Deputy Corry also referred to a certain provision that I made to the effect that only 5 per cent. of those demonstration farms should be used to grow wheat.  Suppose those demonstration farms were to grow 20 or 40 per cent. of wheat, would not every farmer in the country be entitled to grow the same proportion?  If 20 per cent. of the arable land of this country were to be used for growing wheat, where would a market be found?  Does not anybody of commonsense know that nothing should be grown except there is a market for it?  We have a market for only 5 per cent. of the produce of the arable land of this country in wheat.  I therefore confine 5 per cent. of the arable land in those farms to wheat growing.  It is a subsidised crop, and every farmer is entitled to a fair share of what is going.  Those demonstration farms may be made to pay, perhaps, by growing wheat entirely, or by producing special classes of cattle, or fowl, or seed oats or something like that.  Things have to be valued at their commercial value.  They have farms at Glasnevin, Ballyhaise, Athenry and elsewhere, on which they can try all those experiments, but the farms we have in view are farms that will be used for demonstration purposes only; farms that will be used as the ordinary farmers use their farms.  These are to be models for the ordinary farmers of the country to imitate.  They should not be used for any other special purpose because then they would not be demonstration farms at all.  I hope the Minister now understands what we have in view because in the speech he made he did not seem to understand it.  However, <Col N="171" /> I hope we have made it plain to him and that we have convinced him that it is a practical proposition, having regard to what we have in view and having regard to what is done in the United States and elsewhere.  I ask the Minister to consider it seriously as <Col N="172" /> he did two or three years ago when I first mentioned the subject.  I trust that the Deputies on the Government side will advise the Minister to take this matter up.  It would be worth while if only to convince the Opposition that it is possible to make it pay.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to-day whether he is aware that the price charged for coal by importers to bellmen to-day is 12/- per ton more than it was in January, 1935.  I asked him whether he had done anything to satisfy himself when the 5/- tax was taken off coal that 5/- reduction in the price of coal sold by importers to bellmen was sufficient and he said yes.  He denied that he was aware of the fact that the price now being charged to bellmen, with the tax taken off, is 12/- more than the price in January last year.  The answer of the Minister shows that he is oblivious of a very serious state of affairs and it is for the purpose of further ventilating the matter and hearing more of what is in his mind with regard to it that I raise the matter to-night.  It is of vital importance not only to the poorer classes in the city and country but to classes other than these.  I also venture to say that it is a matter that affects not only coal but other commodities that are affected by quota orders, licences, and such like things. I do not want to touch in any way upon the coal-cattle pact but on matters that are ascertainable, controllable and remediable inside our own shores.  The Minister's Press has called the recent move to ventilate the grievances that people lie under in regard to coal prices a political ramp.  The Minister has called it names of the same kind.  If it is a ramp to expose these things, then it is our duty to ramp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I should like to call attention.  The Minister says that political capital is being made out of this.  Political issues are being woven about this in connection with the farmers' interests and the coal-cattle pact.  As the statement has been made that those who want a further reduction in coal are prejudicing the farmers' interests and as a statement has been made by Deputy Briscoe, of the Government Party, which implies that we may see within a short time the farmers' interests in the export of £1,200,000 of additional cattle prejudiced in whole or in part to certain German interests, I want to say that if any part of those interests, <Col N="174" /> or the whole of those interests, is sacrificed by the Government to any German interests, then they will show that they simply have their tongue in their check in regard to the interests of the farmer in this £1,200,000 of exports, just as much as they had their tongue in their cheek when they destroyed £14,000,000 worth of the farmers' exports already, because more than 50 per cent. of the unnecessary and exorbitantly high price for coal to-day arises out of factors that exist within our own shores which have nothing to do with British miners or coal owners or with freights or anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What are those factors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to put before the Minister what the position is.  I am going to ask him to get after what these factors are.  If I can help him to get after these factors, I shall help him.  Deputy Cooney asked what my interest in bellmen was that I should base the discussion on the price charged to bellmen.  Bellmen are a very necessary and very important piece of the machinery of coal distribution in the city.  They are the people who serve the poorer classes in the city and those who live in apartments of such a kind that they cannot get in coal by the ton or more.  They have recently been in a pitiable condition, pressed up against the poorer sections of the people as they have been, and made the machinery for extorting out of them the high price paid for coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what I am concerned with at present is stating the net facts. The outstanding facts that we must bear in mind, and that the Minister ought to know off by heart, are these: that the average price per ton of coal brought into this country in January, 1935, was 21/2.  I asked the Minister what was taken into consideration in assessing that value and the Minister did not reply.  His own returns tell us that that figure includes the cost to the importer with insurance and freight to the place of landing here.  So that coal delivered at Dublin, the average price per ton of which in January, 1935, was 21/2, according to the Minister's figures, was, according to the figures quoted by him again to-day, 25/- per ton in December last, the last month <Col N="175" /> for which we have official figures, indicating that coal landed at the quays in Dublin had increased by 3/10 per ton between January and December, 1935.</P>
    <P>What is the price charged by importers to bellmen to-day as compared with January, 1935?  In January, 1935, bellmen and coal factors were able to obtain coal at 25/- per ton. They paid 42/- per ton in January this year, and then, when the 5/- was taken off, 37/- per ton.  They are paying 37/- per ton now, an increase of 12/- per ton on a commodity landed at the port of Dublin at an increase of only 3/10 per ton.  There is therefore 8/2 to be accounted for there&mdash;8/2 of an increase unaccounted for in any way and in no way affected by British miners or coal owners or by freight or insurance in crossing the Channel.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us he is unaware of these facts.  In addition he tells us that the 5/- reduction in price was sufficient when the 5/- tax was taken off coal.  The Minister told us in November last that the Controller of Prices had the question of coal prices under constant review.  The 5/- tax was put on in the spring and has now been taken off and the Minister says that a reduction in price of 5/- was sufficient.  But we have to see what was the position in the spring of last year.  The position was this: 21/2 was the price of coal imported in January; 22/6 in February; 21/11 in March. There was an increase per ton in the cost of coal landed in Dublin in March, 1935, of 9d. per ton over January, 1935.  What was the increase in the price charged by importers to bellmen between January and March, 1935?  In January they could get their coal for 25/- per ton, but on the 6th March it was 30/- per ton showing an increase of 5/-.  On the 11th March, it was 34/- showing an increase of 9/-; on the 15th March the price was 36/-, showing an increase of 11/- per ton. According to the Minister's own quoted price, there was only an increase of 9d. per ton on importers in March, 1935, but between January and March there was an unexplained increase in the price to bellmen of 5/3 per ton.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> We have to look at the winter position.  The Minister stated, in reply to Deputy Myles to-day, that a considerable increase has taken place in the price of coal delivered here. What was that increase?  He told us that the average import price of household coal had risen from 22/7 in October, 1935, to 25/- in the month of December, showing an increase of 2/2 per ton.  What was the movement in prices between importers and bellmen? Bellmen paid 36/- per ton in October; they were charged 40/- by the 11th December, but on the 6th January the price was 42/- and when the 5/- was taken off it was reduced to 37/-.  I want to stop at the 6th January and see what took place inside the period between October and December.  There was an increase from 36/- to 42/- in this period when the 5/- was on.  So here we have a period when the 5/- was running over the whole time and where the increase in the figure of 2/6 translated itself into an increase of 6/- when the coal came to be exchanged between the importers and the bellmen.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned yesterday&mdash; I want to refer to this parenthetically &mdash;when he addressed himself to the question of coal prices, that bell coal was sold in February, 1935, at 35/- per ton and in February, 1936, at 37/- per ton.  Now I leave him to be dealt with by the people who are buying coal for subsequent retailing to the poorer classes in the city.  I leave it to them to tell him how far away he is from the truth in stating that the price they paid in February, 1935, was 35/-.  The Minister's figures are utterly fantastical so far as the price quoted by him this morning goes.  What I want to try to get him to face up to is what I stated in the beginning; that the increase between January and December was 3/10 while the increase now with the 5/- taken off is 12/- per ton. The Minister in his answer to-day suggested that he was satisfied that the importers had done all they could do in reducing the price of coal by 5/- when the 5/- tax was taken off.  We are not going to be satisfied with that, as far as we can understand the situation and criticise it.  The people are <Col N="177" /> bearing this cost to a much greater extent than the increased cost to importers would warrant and they are not able to bear it.  The Minister has a grave responsibility in this matter. He cannot throw that responsibility over on the Controller of Prices who neglected to face the situation in the spring of last year.  It is his job to do that and to see that not only the 5/- tax is taken off.  The Controller I admit was prejudiced considering that the Minister of the Department of Industry and Commerce had consulted with the importers and was satisfied that 5/- was enough to come off when the 5/- tax was taken off.  The sum of 8/2 is being charged by importers to bellmen to-day more than they ought to be charged.  It is the Minister's responsibility to investigate that position apart altogether from the hardship which is being caused to the poor.  The fact, however, that hardships are being caused to the poor as a result of these increased charges is the responsibility of the Minister and we want to know what he is going to do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in a speech which he made last night, referred to the question of coal prices and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Opposition had been endeavouring to work up a campaign in respect of coal prices,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and he went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That campaign was utterly dishonest and based on gross misrepresentation of the facts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then proceeded to misrepresent the facts himself.  The Minister gave figures in regard to the prices charged for coal, but he was very careful of the period he selected for those figures. He selected February of last year, as against February of last year.  Why should the Minister not have taken January of last year as against January of this year?  The suggestion of the Minister would seem to convey to the public that household coal is forthcoming at practically as low prices to-day as it was 13 months ago. The Minister took care, as I said, to choose a period when the coal-cattle pact came into operation&mdash;February, 1935.  But the Minister cannot blink <Col N="178" /> this fact: that household coal, and good household coal&mdash;as good as if not better than the household coal of to-day&mdash;was forthcoming in January, 1935, at 12/- per ton less than to-day.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister telling us that British coal was so much in February, 1935, and so much to-day.  I want him to face up to this fact that household coal of as good a quality, and, taken over a period, of a better quality, and a more consistent quality, than today, was available in February, 1935, at 12/- a ton less than to-day.  In January, 1935, best Continental household coal was 35/- a ton, delivered in Dublin; in January, 1936, best British house coal was 48/- per ton.  The Minister stated to-day in reply to an interjection by Deputy Belton, regarding admitting Continental coal, that that would make no difference in the price.  Was the Minister serious about that?  Was he honest about it?  Can he advance any proof to this House, that, if we were allowed to import Polish or German coal in competition with British coal, we would get it not only at a lower price but get better coal?  Is not the Minister aware of the fact that retailers outside the city were paying, up to the removal of the coal tax, 17/- more per ton for supplies of house coal than they were paying 12 months ago?  These are facts that cannot be disputed.  Documentary evidence can be produced.  We had the Minister getting up and talking about a dishonest campaign, and of gross misrepresentation, but, in order to misrepresent the position, he deliberately took a period which would suggest to anyone reading the figure, and who was not conversant with the facts, that there was no increase in the price here and that coal was available at as low a price to-day as it was 13 months ago. If anybody is guilty of misrepresentation and of gross neglect in this matter, it is the Minister.  I should like if the Minister would address himself to the point Deputy Mulcahy put to him, and in particular to the specific point I put to him, that the only household coal available to-day is costing the people 12/- per ton more than it cost them in 1935, before the coal-cattle pact was signed.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is replying I should like to know if he will deny that we have been getting coal inferior in quality to what we were getting at a lower price as indicated by the previous speakers, before the coal-cattle pact.  I suggest to the Minister that there is no use in comparing prices now and prices a year ago.  Will the Minister apply himself to the comparative prices here and in the North of Ireland at the present time?</P>

Second English, which is sold in Belfast at 39/- a ton, compares with bell coal sold here at a net price of 37/- a ton.  That disposes of the contention that the increase in the price of coal is due in any way to the fact that Continental coal is not coming in.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has drawn attention to the fact that the price of coal has gone up.  It has gone up, and not only in this country but generally.  That is the particular fact he is trying to conceal from the people in his propaganda in relation to coal prices.  He has reversed his tactics this evening.  In his opening communication to the Press he made it quite clear that he was not attributing the rise in coal prices to profiteering on the part of the coal merchants. He said the cause which gave rise to it was the coal-cattle pact.  He ran away from that.</P>

That is a complete reversal of the position he took up in the Press for the past three weeks.  The main purpose of this campaign, this utterly dishonest campaign, is to embarrass the Government <Col N="181" /> and to do the ulmost possible national damage at the present time. The coal-cattle past has been in operation since the beginning of February last year, and there was not a word from the Opposition about the effect of that pact or about coal prices until this time.  It is for Deputies to use their own imagination in connection with the question as to why this time was selected which, I suggest, is for a reason Deputy Mulcahy knows that at this time he could do the ulmost damage in the national interest. It is the sole aim of that Party to do all the damage they can in the hope thereby that the people can be induced to turn against the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated by these Deputies that the price of coal went up in consequence of the coal-cattle pact.  They are very concerned about the price of coal.  Their concern is new born.  I gave last night certain figures concerning the price at which coal was imported to this country, not merely last year but when they were in office, and were in a position to take measures that they now suggest we should take in relation to coal prices.  The average price of British coal imported into this country during the period in which the coal-cattle arrangement was in operation f.o.b. at the English port of exportation is shown by the British trade statistics as 17/8 a ton.  That price is 2/- a ton less than the lowest price at which British coal was imported here during any of the 11 years they were in office. British coal had an exclusive market here until 1931, and British coal exporters sold coal in this country at the home market price.  The difference between that home market price and the export price of British coal sent to other countries was always fairly considerable.  In 1931 it was 3/6 per ton; in 1935, during the coal-cattle agreement, it was 1/5 per ton.  I do not think we should be satisfied with the existence of any difference, but I want to give this proof of the insincerity of the campaign with which Deputy Mulcahy is associated, that they never at any time, when they <Col N="182" /> were in charge of affairs here, expressed the slightest dissatisfaction with that position, and never made any effort to rectify it, even when pressed to do so in this House in 1929 and 1930.  The price of coal has gone up.  It has gone up owing to known causes.  Because of the situation which developed in England when the threat of a stoppage arose, all the big coal users in England and in every part of the world where English coal is used thought to anticipate that stoppage by laying in large supplies of coal and, consequently, the price was brought up, and for a period an artificial scarcity operated.  That did not affect those coal importers who had contracts, but it did affect the coal importers who were buying in the open market and who had not contract arrangements.  The effect was to secure a general rise in the price of coal all over the world wherever British coal is being used.  There is nothing that we can do to rectify that situation apart from what we have done.  The removal of the Customs duty from coal was effected by the Government because of that position, and the effect of that removal was to bring down the price of coal to what it was 12 months previously, broadly speaking.</P>

      <P>The situation is one which calls for the close attention of the Government, and it is getting the close attention of the Government. <Col N="183" /> The Government is concerned with the effect of rising coal prices upon the consumers of coal and not merely with making propaganda for a political Party.  It was because of that concern that it took the action of removing the Customs duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the future of coal prices is going to be.  It is reasonable to anticipate that, now that the threat of a stoppage in Great Britain has been removed, temporarily, at any rate, coal prices will tend to move downwards, but there are other factors in the international situation working in the contrary direction.  In any event our concern is to ensure that we get coal at a fair price and also to provide that the profits secured by the distributors of coal in this country are reasonable.  There was one time what appeared to be a ring amongst coal importers which had a definite influence upon prices, but any indications I have received with regard to that situation recently are to the effect that the ring is definitely broken and that there is keen competition between the various groups of importers at the present time.  But if there should be any reason to think the contrary, to believe that undue profits are being taken, there is power to take the necessary action. No indication of that has, however, been made available.</P>
      <P>I want again to ask that this attempt to make political propaganda out of a situation which is not under the control of the Government of this country, or, in fact, of the Government of any country, but which is due to causes which are well known, should cease.  It is not helping anybody and it is certainly not helping the poor people for whom the Deputies opposite are now, for the first time, shedding their crocodile tears.</P>

      <P>The average price at which British coal was imported into this country since 1929 has tended downwards, and, in fact, the average price in the March-December period, 1935, was slightly lower than in any of the three previous years, and very substantially lower than in the years before the change of Government. The same situation is shown by the figures relating to household coal only, as apart from all varieties of coal.  Deputy Mulcahy misrepresented the reply I gave him to-day.  He asked a question concerning the increase in the price of coal to bellmen and said that I answered that I was not aware of the facts.  What I said was, in the usual parliamentary phrase, that I was not aware that his facts were correct and neither am I so aware.  On the contrary, they are incorrect.</P>

      <P>Yes. The Deputy, however, adopted the usual Cumann na nGaedheal device of indicating that there was action which could be taken that would rectify this position, but he did not say what the action was.  There are still five minutes during which this debate can be continued, and I am quite prepared to give these five minutes to the Deputy, so that he can tell us what he thinks should be done that will have the effect of reducing the price of coal to the extent he thinks it can be reduced&mdash;by 8/6 a ton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very glad to make suggestions.  In the first place, there are two points on which I should like to get clear.  The Minister introduced the question of Belfast.  Would the Minister look at this evening's paper which declares that the Belfast Corporation, at its meeting, carried an amendment by 21 votes to 12 that the matter of giving them powers to retail coal in the city, in order to fight the high <Col N="185" /> prices of coal in the city, would be included in a Parliamentary Bill to be promoted by the corporation.  Here the Minister apparently subscribes to our coal importers fixing their prices on a level with the corporation.</P>
      <P>The Minister denies my facts and says that he has given the facts.  I am going to make the suggestion the Minister speaks of and again I restate the outlying fact that, between January 1935 and December 1935, coal delivered with insurance and freight at say, the Port of Dublin, or at any rate at our ports all round the country, increased only by 3/10. The price charged by importers to bellmen in the same time has increased by 12/-.  The Minister has his Department, the Controller of Prices and the Prices Commission. Does he ask us to believe that he has no powers to get either the Controller of Prices or the Prices Commission to investigate these circumstances and to find out whether it is a fact that a commodity which increased in price in that particular period only by 3/10 a ton is being sold at 12/- a ton increase and where the increase is being pocketed and by whom, and to take the necessary steps to stop that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, therefore, that the Deputy is suggesting that the coal importers are profiteering to the extent of 8/6 a ton?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said definitely that the reason that coal prices are high here is because of the coal-cattle pact, and the quotas and licences that came as a tail from that, and that just as this particular commodity, coal, is being influenced in this way inside our shores, the Minister will find that where quotas and licences are operating, as they are in respect of other commodities, the same position is down on the people and that profits are being pocketed. The Minister can get after this matter if he wants to do it.  The Minister is never behindhand, and never lacking in vim and energy in getting after a point he wants, and if he wants to find why and where that extra money is being taken out of the factors' pockets, and more, therefore, out of the poor, he can get after it if he wants to.  If he wants any help from me, I shall be very glad to give it to him, and I know a few more who will be very glad to help him, too.</P>

    <P>*In addition, one estate comprising 666 acres was allotted for afforestation purposes in the year 1934.</P>
    <P>Details are not kept in the exact form required by the Deputy, and as regards the special case of old I.R.A. men, it may be stated that while due consideration is given to the claims of applicants for land who in addition to their other qualifications have a meritorious record of past military service for their country, the statistical returns of the Land Commission must have regard only to the classes of allottees specified in the Land Acts. Particulars are not therefore available as to the number of old I.R.A. men included in the scheduled figures of allotments.</P>
