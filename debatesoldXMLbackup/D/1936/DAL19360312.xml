      <NameTxt>Mr. Peadar S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if the Circular No. 18/36, dated the 28th February, 1936, on the subject of the compulsory retirement of officers of local authorities is intended to have the force of an Order requiring all officers of local authorities to retire at the age of 65 years, and, if so, if he will state under which of the powers vested in him this Order has been made, and whether, having regard to the hardship such Order shall inflict on such officers, he will consider the advisability of extending the operation of this Order to a period of not less than three years from this date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular letter is intended to be an intimation to local authorities that it is essential to fix an age for compulsory retirement and that normally 65 is a fit period at which local officers should relinquish office.  No Order has been made.  Effect will be given to the circular letter by local authorities under their existing powers. In certain circumstances a period of six months grace can be allowed and it is not considered advisable to extend the period of grace to three years as proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, might I ask if he would consider the matter of granting some discretionary power to the local <Col N="2102" /> authorities to extend the period of retirement in cases where satisfactory proof of good health and efficiency were shown?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the age of 65 is going to be fixed by the Department, or have the local authorities discretionary power to fix any age that they think would be reasonable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, in view of the fact that boards of public health are not lawfully entitled to require incoming tenants of labourers' cottages to pay arrears due, arising out of the tenancy <Col N="2103" /> by former tenants, he can state the grounds on which the Limerick County Board of Health recovered the sum of £7 4s. 4d. by way of arrears of rent due by a former tenant from Patrick Shanahan, Ardshanbally, Adare, the number of whose cottage is 78 Croom District, and whether, if this money has been improperly collected, he will order that the amount will be refunded to Mr. Shanahan, and whether, in view of the fact that the board are claiming from Mr. Shanahan an additional sum of £7 10s. Od., he will inform them that there is no lawful authority for making this demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the circumstances under which the Limerick Board of Health and Public Assistance recovered the sum referred to from Patrick Shanahan.  I have already brought to the notice of the board the legal position with regard to the payment by incoming tenants of labourers' cottages of arrears of rent due by previous tenants.  There is no further action open to me in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply and in view of the answer which the Minister gave on the 16th July last to a similar question, that he would apprise the public authority concerned that they have no lawful right to this money, will the Minister still allow this practice to be continued illegally as in the case I have mentioned in the question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.A. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if in connection with the adoption of the Warble Fly (Treatment of Cattle) Order, 1936, by members of the North Tipperary County Council and the appointment of inspectors to put the Order into operation, he will make a full inquiry into all the relevant circumstances surrounding alleged irregularities before sanctioning the appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  I understand the county council have been advised that there has been no irregularity in their proceedings in making these appointments which do not require any sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, I should like to ask the Minister where he got the information he has given to the House?  I have been informed that there has been gross irregularity in connection with these appointments by the North Tipperary County Council.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has got the information from his own inspectors that there has been no irregularity in the matter?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the present position of his Department regarding proposals for the provision of water supply schemes for Clara and Banagher, Offaly; whether he has received any application from the Offaly Board of Health for grants from the Unemployment Relief Vote in order to enable such schemes to be carried out at the lowest cost to the local ratepayers and if he will state what action he has taken or proposes to take concerning the schemes mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the proposed provision of a water supply for Clara the position is unchanged since my reply to the <Col N="2105" /> Deputy's Question of the 28th February, 1935.  An Inquiry was held into the scheme in May, 1934, following which the Offaly Board of Health was informed that the scheme would require to be revised in order to provide a more ample supply.  An alternative source was suggested and the board was to submit alternative plans, but these have not yet been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are at present under consideration for the preparation of plans for the Banagher scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of making a relief grant available towards the cost of these works cannot be considered until the usual plans and other documents, including detailed estimates of cost, are submitted to the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has received representations from the Offaly Board of Health pressing him to sanction the tender for the erection, in stone, of the proposed County Hospital at Tullamore; and whether he now intends to comply with the request of the Board of Health and other local bodies concerning this matter or state when he hopes to be in a position to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No representation has been received from the Offaly Board of Health and Public Assistance pressing the Minister to sanction the latest tender received by them for the erection of this hospital in stone, except their resolution accepting the tender could be regarded as a representation. In that resolution the board accepted the lowest tender subject to the sanction of the Minister and added that, in the event of the Minister considering the price too high as compared with that for concrete, the contractor submitting the tender and the architect should be asked to meet and adjust the figure according to the Minister's wishes. The position is at present being examined to see how far the price can be reduced, and the matter will <Col N="2106" /> be decided by the Minister at the earliest possible moment.  Any representations in the matter made by other local authorities will be dealt with on their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that this contract was advertised about nine months ago and that this reconsideration has been going on since and will the Parliamentary Secretary say when he hopes to make it possible for work to begin by giving sanction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as stated by the Deputy.  It is also a fact that the cost per bed of building these hospitals is going up enormously. Last year, such a hospital could be built at a cost of about £750 per bed. The lowest tender we got for construction in stone, even as a result of the second advertisement, works out at £1,230 per bed.  The Deputy will understand that, in such circumstances, we have to proceed fairly carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the discontinuance of passenger train services between Westport and Achill has caused great hardship to the people served by that line, as adequate substitute road transport services were provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application has been made to me by the Great Southern Railways Company for an order under Section 9 of the Railways Act, 1933, authorising the discontinuance of merchandise trains on the section referred to and, <Col N="2108" /> provided the company are in a position to fulfil the statutory requirements, I am not aware of any grounds on which such an order could logically be refused.</P>
    <P>I understand that to facilitate road repair work, the company, at the request of the County Council, has agreed to a temporary reinstatement of passenger train services on the section, and to defer for the present the withdrawal of merchandise train services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a large number of harvest men and other migrants leave Achill and that, for part of the year, buses have to go to Achill at midnight to bring people into Westport, which they reach at 2 o'clock in the morning, while the railway station does not open until 7.30, with the result that the people have to wait five hours in the town of Westport, and does he consider that that is not a hardship?  I wish to ask the Minister, also, if this railway was not constructed out of public funds and if there was not an undertaking by the railway company that they would run a certain number of passenger trains per diem on this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not refer in his question to exceptional traffic, such as occurs occasionally when numbers of migratory labourers are leaving the area.  Whatever inconvenience may be caused on occasions when there is abnormal traffic of that kind, the substitute service, for all ordinary purposes, is superior to the service previously provided on the railway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My reply referred to the normal service provided. Exceptional services have to be provided on occasions when there is exceptional traffic.

The question as to the facilities made available for certain abnormal traffic is a different matter.</P>

He says that for certain reasons this mill has closed down, but he refuses to tell us what the reasons are because he says he has no control over such reasons.  I want to ask if he has not closed down several mills because he could not see his way to give them a production quota which would make it possible for them to remain open within the law.</P>

      <P>The object of the provision of a sum of £2,000 in addition to the ordinary Relief Fund provision for Dublin to be spent on unskilled labour at the rate of wages of 10/- per day on the experimental scheme at Fairview Park was to ascertain by actual trial whether there existed any difficulty or liability to hardship peculiar to Dublin and the boroughs in the application to them of the rotational system of employment of able-bodied unemployment assistance recipients, which had been tried out in other parts of the country and, if so, to find the <Col N="2112" /> solution of, or the remedy for, such difficulty or hardship.</P>
      <P>Representations were recently made to the Office of Public Works on behalf of the workmen, in respect of certain matters of administrative detail, and these were adjusted as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not aware that any valid ground for dissatisfaction remain, but if any Deputy for Dublin or any other person having knowledge of the special conditions obtaining in Dublin, and their relation to a scheme of this kind will put forward in writing a statement of any specific grievance or hardship now existing such representations will have immediate consideration.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered the question I put.  Is he aware that on yesterday Dublin T.D.s received a deputation in this House representative of the unemployed to protest against the conditions in Fairview Park, and stating that the difference in the amount of money they received by way of unemployment benefit and the amount of wages paid is not adequate for the amount of work done. They stated that in cases where a man would have 25/- unemployment benefit, by working he only earns the sum of 30/- spread over four weeks, and they protested against these conditions. The Parliamentary Secretary made reference to 10/- a day, making it appear that that might last for four, five or six days.  Is he aware that last week they got only two days, whereas their allowance from unemployment benefit would be 25/- a week?  Is he aware that the men complain that the difference between the unemployment benefit and the amount paid by his Department is not adequate for the amount of work done, in some cases only amounting to 5/- to 7/- a week?</P>

In the answer I have given, I have indicated the means of the most rapid solution of any difficulty that does exist. Deputies may take it that every single man employed on the scheme is paid very considerably more than he would receive from unemployment assistance under the scheme.  The whole difficulty is to find out whether there are any special difficulties here.  I understand Deputies concerned are going to put forward representations based upon further information.

      <P>I propose to ask the House not to accept the following amendments made by the Seanad to this Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Title.  The words &ldquo;as from the next dissolution of the Oireachtas&rdquo; deleted in lines 17-18.</P>
      <P>2.  Section 3.  The words &ldquo;immediately upon&rdquo; deleted in line 30 and the words &ldquo;six months after&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One amendment is similar in form to one that was down on the Committee <Col N="2123" /> Stage of this Bill when it was discussed in the Dáil.  The matter was fully debated by both sides of the House then, and I do not think any considerable explanation is required now as to the nature of the amendment and what it proposed to effect.  I do not think I am called upon to say anything beyond what I said when it was discussed here. I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>This amendment is in two sections&mdash; the first being to the Title and the second to Section 3.  The effect of it would be to postpone the coming into operation of the Bill, if passed, to a period six months later than that proposed in the Bill itself.  It is proposed in the Bill that it should come into operation at the next general election, and the amendment proposes that its operation should be postponed until six months after the next general election.  It is possible that if the old provision that was in the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann when it was passed in 1923, relating to the referendum were still in the Constitution, the proposition set out here might have received consideration, but in the absence of that I think there is no reason why the Bill should not come into operation in the form in which it passed the House, and passed through the Seanad likewise subject to this amendment.  I propose that the House do not agree with the Seanad in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really only one amendment, No. 1 being an amendment to the Title necessary to give effect to No. 2, so that the discussion might take place on No. 1. The decision arrived at on that should, I suggest, govern No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vice-President does not propose to give any reasons for opposing this amendment in addition to those he has given already.  In other words, he does not propose to give any reasons for opposing the amendment.  He should look up the reasons he gave to the House on the various stages of the Bill.  Most of them are not reasons.  More often they take the form of statements that <Col N="2124" /> he has not changed his mind.  I was hoping that in this particular instance the Vice-President would change his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>What a hope!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think his heart is in this Bill.  He has not piloted this Bill through the House as if he really believed in the Bill.  I have a vague feeling&mdash;it may be altogether unjustified; it may be unfounded optimism on my part&mdash;that he has not the same itch for destruction as other members of his Party, and I was hoping that he might avail of this amendment at least to postpone this little piece of destruction.  Incidentally, in the statement he has made, he has implied that there is not, what would be called by his Party, a mandate for this Bill.  That at least has emerged from the statement of the Vice-President, because he said if the provision for a referendum were still in the Constitution, he would be prepared to consider this amendment quite seriously and sympathetically. In other words, he would allow this Bill to go before the people for their judgment.  That is precisely what the amendment proposes to do, in so far as it can be done within the Constitution as it now exists; and we must deal with the Constitution as it now exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious, notwithstanding some of the hole-and-corner meetings of his own Party to which the Vice-President referred on previous occasions, that he now realises that this particular change in the Constitution was never before the country and he has some slight feeling of shame&mdash; strange on the Government Benches I will admit; I see the Vice-President realises that it is strange on the Government Benches&mdash;at the conduct of which he is now guilty.  I presume we shall be told at the conclusion as at the opening of the debate that he has nothing to add and that he has not changed his mind.  I wonder when members of the Government will realise that these, what I might call autobiographical, details about the processes of their own minds are not arguments in favour of their proposals?  No reason really has been given for this <Col N="2125" /> Bill nor has any reason been given for the opposition to the proposed amendment. The proposal is to postpone the operation of this Bill until the people have a chance to decide on the conduct of the Government, this Bill included. That is what the amendment proposes to do, to give the people such an opportunity. The Vice-President knows that the next Government is pledged to the restoration of this particular form of representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>The next Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, precisely. I say it advisedly.  It is pledged to the restoration of this particular form of representation.  We desire, therefore, to be in the position of making a proposition that can be easily put into effect.  If this Bill is passed, as it now stands, it will require, not amending legislation, but an amendment of the Constitution to introduce this form of representation once more, and to re-establish University constituencies. As I say, I am rather surprised that this amending Bill has been thrust on the Vice-President because scuttling, at the present moment, is not precisely the role he is best fitted for, or that he likes to play either here or throughout the country.  He likes to pose&mdash;and I do not say that he is at all unsuited to the rôle&mdash;as the reasonable, constructive statesman in that Party.  But scuttling is what he is doing at the moment, and even if he does it in a mild-mannered fashion, that does not make it more acceptable.  The damage is being done and I think the House ought to realise from the real lack of argument in support of the Bill that there is no excuse for this particular work of destruction that is now being indulged in.  I understand it is the intention of the Government to introduce, practically speaking, a new Constitution. I do not know whether they intend to do that before or after the next election.  On that point they have given no real information to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton always gives one the impression of not believing in what he says himself, but he should not look upon me as being a mirror of himself, even if, in build, we are so much alike.  It is the only matter, I hope, in which we are alike. Constitutional matters are bound to be discussed after the next election, whatever Government is in power.  The far-reaching nature of these Constitutional changes we are not now in a position to determine, but the presence of University representatives will be very useful in that particular instance. In the opening stages in the life of this State, the representatives from both Universities contributed very materially to the consideration and the building up of the Constitution of this country.  At a time when, as a result of what has happened, partly as a result of the action of the Government, constitutional issues must again come to the fore, I think it is regrettable that the House, and through the House, the country, should be without the help that would undoubtedly come from these particular representatives.  I think it wrong that an institution that has proved uniformly to be to the advantage, strikingly to the advantage of this House, and the advantage of the country, both through the membership of this House and through the membership of the Executive Government, should be destroyed without the matter at least being brought before the country.  I think it is of sufficient importance for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion, I put certain test which seem to me to be the most important of the tests so far as this type of representation is concerned, and I think that the country should be given an opportunity of deciding whether or not it wanted this type of representation.  The first test is: Has this type of representation been useful to this House?  I do not think that anybody, who looks at the history of this House&mdash;the debates in this House, <Col N="2127" /> the consideration given to various measures, the building up of the very procedure of this House, and the method in which we conduct business in the House&mdash;could be, for a moment, unmindful of the contribution that was made to that constructive work by the representatives of both Universities. Furthermore, anybody who looks at the constructive work of the Government of this country, in addition to the debates and to the consideration given to measures in this House&mdash;anybody who looks at the exceedingly important work of Government&mdash;must realise how well the University constituencies have justified their existence.  I am strongly of opinion that the country should be allowed an opportunity of pronouncing on that matter, and for that reason I am supporting this amendment.</P>
    <P>If there were a vital principle at stake&mdash;a principle of democracy of some kind&mdash;I could understand the determination of a Party to destroy this particular type of representation before the country had an opportunity of dealing with it; but there is no such principle at stake.  This has been debated as if it were a matter of privilege. It is not.  It is a question of whether you want absolute uniformity, and uniformity and equality are not the same thing, although members of the Government, and especially leading members of the Government, seem to imagine that they are.  There is no reason why our constituencies should be uniform.  The fact that you have some of them different from the others is no proof of inequality.  I notice that the Vice-President's bad conscience got him to misinterpret my words when, on the last occasion, I referred to an arithmetical itch on the part of the President.  I merely wanted to convey that the President wanted everything to be uniform.  The Vice-President, knowing everything that is back of this Bill, interpreted, or misinterpreted, that remark of mine as a reference to the motive of the President in introducing this Bill and as a suggestion that his motive for introducing the Bill was purely based on a calculation of seats won or lost.  I did not mean that. The question is that we are asked to sacrifice a useful institution and that <Col N="2128" /> we are asked to do that before the country has had an opportunity of dealing with the matter.  We are asked to sacrifice a useful institution, not to any principle of democracy, equality, or anything else, but merely to a passion for uniformity on the part of one or two members of the Government. That is the reason put forward.  I admit that the Vice-President was quite correct in suggesting what the motives are&mdash;another mathematical calculation&mdash;four against us, two for us, and so much on the balance.  That was the real motive at the back of this Bill, as it was revealed, as I say, by the apparent bad conscience of the Vice-President on this particular matter.</P>
    <P>Through University representation you did get here very useful work, and I think the country appreciates how useful that institution was when it sees the actual work that has been performed by University representatives. For that reason, I say that this amendment should be supported.  You have got here, in University representation, a most useful institution, an institution that has justified itself; and I fear that it is because it has justified itself and done useful work that the Fianna Fáil Party cannot keep their hands off it.  They must destroy it.  When there is no principle at stake, I prefer to rely on our experience&mdash;the experience of the excellent way in which this institution has worked&mdash;rather than on an absurd passion for uniformity.  I believe that, if the people get a chance of pronouncing on that particular matter they will agree with me. Furthermore, let us realise what this amounts to.  It is not quite the same thing as, but it is analogous to, a proposal of the Party in power almost to prolong its political existence.  In other words, the Party in power is now doing something from which, in the next election, it expects to get a political benefit.  That Party has already gerrymandered the constituencies.  It now proposes to go further.  It thinks to get an advantage for the Party itself by this particular proposal, and that is another reason why this amendment should be supported.  If the Fianna Fáil Party are so enthusiastic for this Bill, it is for the reasons I have mentioned.  The Vice-President, in his <Col N="2129" /> innocence, may get up and say that nothing was farther from his innocent thoughts, and that the last thing that struck him was that his Party should get any political advantage from this particular measure&mdash;that he never thought of it&mdash;that he never heard of it before.</P>

      <P>The Vice-President may get up and say that that idea was absolutely new to him. It was not new, however, to the Government or to the members of his Party, and the Vice-President's innocence cannot cover them.  However, here is an opportunity for the Vice-President to show the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government.  Let him show that it is not a question of political prejudice or Party advantage, but that it is merely a passion for uniformity that is urging them on, instead of a mere sordid calculation of votes.  I have no doubt that the Vice-President was shocked when he heard his colleagues &mdash;as a matter of fact, I think he heard himself speaking in the same strain&mdash; referring to votes cast by University representatives and their lack of foresight in not voting oftener for the present Government.  Even the innocent Vice-President knows that was one of the considerations influencing him. Certainly, one of his colleagues did not put a tooth in it when he suggested that one of the reasons they proposed to abolish University representation was that the University representatives exercised their consciences as to the way they ought to vote.  That independency, apparently, shocked the Vice-President and his colleagues. Well, so far as the imputation of trying to make Party capital out of it is concerned, the Vice-President now has a chance of wiping his Party free from that charge, and, if he is as innocent as he pretends to be, he will accept this amendment and he will, at the same time, do something constructive. By accepting this amendment, he will not be destroying an institution which has justified itself as much as any other political institution in this country. There may have been mistakes which our Government made when it was in power, and which the last Parliament <Col N="2130" /> made, but the present Government seem determined to perpetuate any failures or mistakes there were in the last Parliament, or which were made by the last Government, and to destroy what experience has proved to be the most useful things the recent Parliament and the recent Government introduced. For that reason, I ask that the Vice-President for once should follow what I believe to be his own views.  He may say that their being his views is not enough.  I ask that he should use his position as Vice-President in the Cabinet to save a useful institution. The amendment gives him a chance of doing so.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why this form of representation should be abolished before the next election.  There is all the less reason if there is any foundation for the Government's threats or promises to remodel the whole Constitution. If there is any sincerity in these threats or promises, if they have any hope of being in a position to do anything of the kind, it is obvious that it is when they are remodelling the Constitution that this particular form of representation should be considered in all its implication, and not by a measure introduced by itself like this. This business, I understand, was before one Fianna Fáil club.  I do not know whether it was before a higher piece of organisation in the hierarchy of the Fianna Fáil organisation, but that is practically all the publicity it got, so far as the electorate of this country is concerned.  If you are such sticklers for popular mandate, as is sometimes pretended, here is your opportunity to show it.  But when the Government begins to talk of democracy, I always find that they are great sticklers for democracy and strict uniformity when it suits their political Party book, but the moment it does not suit their political Party book, we are told: &ldquo;After all, we are the Government elected and we must be trusted; there is no necessity for any safeguards&rdquo; and then democratic institutions are thrown to the winds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every reference to democracy and to the will of the people in these matters is nearly always a case of &ldquo;heads, I win; tails, you lose&rdquo; so far as the people are concerned.  It reminds me <Col N="2131" /> of the faulty arithmetic of a dishonest trader&mdash;and I do not want the Fianna Fáil Party to say that I suggest all traders are dishonest; there may be one or two dishonest ones left in the country and I can say this without aspersing the people of this country&mdash; whose mistakes like those of the Ministry are never in favour of the customer. It is the same way with the Minister's appeal to the principles of democracy.  They are always used to bolster up the Party institutions that support the Government, and to bolster up pretensions to autocracy on the part of the Government; they are never used to protect or safeguard the rights of the people.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for anybody who has listened to these debates, and to the lack of argument on the part of the supporters of this Bill, to believe that there is anything at the back of it but the calculation of &ldquo;How many seats we are likely to get on the balance.&rdquo; Yet, from the beginning of this Parliament, there are very few important measures the consideration of which has not been enhanced, the value of which has not been increased, by the part taken, not by graduates of Universities, but by the University representatives. Now, merely to gain what they think is an immediate Party advantage the Government and the House deliberately throw away something which has proved its use.  This is not political wisdom, there is no principle in it; it is merely political folly.  You will realise, Sir, the difficulty there is in discussing this amendment and keeping strictly in order without discussing the general merits.</P>

      <P>The Vice-President has told us that he does not propose to accept the amendments of the Seanad to Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill, and until I listened to the speech of Deputy Professor O'Sullivan I was of opinion that every thinking Deputy in this House&mdash;headed, of course, by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan himself &mdash;would follow the Vice-President into the Lobby, assuming that it comes to a Division, in defence of the prestige and the competence of this House, to which the Seanad's amendments are a strident and a cynical challenge.  Let us consider for a moment what is the real point at issue for us here to-day.  It is not the merits or demerits of University representation, or even of University representatives; it is something much more vital than the question of whether University representation is to be continued in this State.  On that question, not this House alone, but the Seanad has registered a considered and very clear-cut decision, and now, when both Houses of the Oireachtas, after long, careful and detailed examination, and a most mature consideration, have arrived at a certain decision, we are asked to side-track that decision, to shunt it into some old siding to rot, and we are asked to stultify ourselves by deferring to a body not yet born, not yet conceived in the womb of days, the responsibility of putting into execution what we think is the right thing to do.  The proposition is so preposterous that I, with my halting tongue, could not possibly hope to do justice to it.  It is one of those occasions on which I should like to borrow the eloquence of some other member, but before I sit down, I should like to say this, that in the unthinkable event of this House accepting the Seanad's amendments, in which is implicit and inherent the very negation of responsible Government, we should be proclaiming ourselves absolutely unfit and unworthy of the trust which our electors put in us when they sent us here.  Our electors sent us here to do vital work and to try to solve some of the problems with which this country is faced, and now it seems to me that we are wasting time.  In order to give a good <Col N="2133" /> example to those who will follow me, I propose, having discussed the essentials of the situation as they appear to me, to make my contribution to this debate as short as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I can enumerate all the purposes for which my constituents sent me here, but I am certain of one thing and that is, that they did not send me here to abolish University representation.  I have not the guilty conscience that the last speaker thinks one ought to have if one supports this amendment.  I do support this amendment.  I am not having any opinions thrust upon me by the Seanad that I do not hold already, and I see no reason why I should throw away my own opinions because the Seanad happens to agree with them on this occasion.</P>
      <P>There seems to me to be a strong case for the postponement of the operation of this measure.  It is admitted by the Government themselves that we are in a transitional stage.  I refer to the situation with regard to the Seanad.  The Government have not made up their minds whether there should be a Second Chamber in this State.  I hope they will make up their minds that there ought to be one.  The present one is going and, according to the official statements of Ministers, there is to be a period of trial of Single-Chamber government.  I should like this amendment better if it postponed the operation of this Bill until the question of a Second Chamber had been finally disposed of.  But, although it is not drawn in those terms, although it says the operation of the measure should be postponed until a certain period after the next general election, it may roughly have the same effect. Therefore, I think it is worthy of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's hostility to University representation seems to be based upon the view that the system of popular election is complete and perfect.  I really am at a loss to understand how that view can be honestly held by any Deputy who has had the experience we all have had of popular elections.  Popular election would only <Col N="2134" /> be complete and perfect as an expression of democracy if the electors had an unrestricted choice of the best men to represent them, and also if the electors applied their minds to making that choice with a full understanding of the issues involved.  We know that is not so.  In the first place, the electors do not have an unrestricted choice.  The people who, to a large extent, make the choice are not the electors at all, but the Party conventions which are held before the elections.  We can almost leave out of account the rare occasions when individuals are in a position to stand for election as individuals, paying their own expenses, fighting their own corner, putting forward some set of views that differ from the sets of views presented by the great Parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty arises from the fact that it is, as a matter of thought, very difficult to separate the question of postponement from the question of principle. I hope I shall not overstep the bounds.  I only propose to address you for a few more moments on the subject.  What I am trying to get at is this: that on account of the special situation with regard to the Seanad we are inaugurating a period when there is to be just a Single Chamber elected by popular election and in no other way.  If there were to be constructed the sort of Second Chamber that I should like to see, I would think it unnecessary to have any representation in this House except that secured by popular election. <Col N="2135" /> But, if we are to have a Single Chamber, during such period as we are to have a Single Chamber, I think it is very important that the imperfect system of popular election should be supplemented by something else.</P>
      <P>Democracy has undoubtedly been more successful in Great Britain than in other democratic countries, and the reason it has been more successful there has been largely because of some apparent illogicalities that exist in Great Britain.  The Government have objected to University representation, that it is only found in Great Britain and the same thing could be said about the House of Lords, which, at first sight, might seem to be the most indefensible of institutions and is, in my opinion, in its present form to some extent indefensible.  But the reason these things on the whole have survived and managed to do a great deal of good is because they have acted as a check upon the system of popular election which does not succeed in being what it sets out to be. It results, if left unchecked, in a democracy that is singularly fragile and apt to turn into dictatorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on this occasion.  I think anybody with a realistic mind, if he sits down and thinks, will agree that it is not the sort of measure that ought to be rushed through owing to some passion for uniformity, and that there is a great deal to be said for postponing the operation of the Bill until the country has had a further chance to consider it, and until some final decision has been come to in regard to the Second Chamber.</P>
      <P>I suppose I can touch upon this, because it has already been touched upon.  A great deal has been said about the merits of the representatives who have sat here representing University constituencies, and that no doubt, to a large extent, has been justified.  But, candour compels me to admit that the Royal Dublin Society, or the Irish Chamber of Commerce, or other institutions might send representatives here of whom equally complimentary things could be said.  And it needs to be emphasised that the real test of the value of having members here selected by methods other than popular election is that they should be of a more detached and independent frame of mind on the issues that arise than popularly elected representatives or that they should be the type of men who would find it specially difficult to get elected by popular election and yet are valuable in this House.</P>

I believe that on the present occasion it has produced a suggestion which is not merely feasible but equitable and wise and far-seeing. The last debate on this subject was, I may say, characterised by an extraordinary absence of acrimony.  There was a remarkable display of calmness, good temper and good feeling.  I wish that all debates here were conducted on the same lines.

      <P>I must beg his pardon for speaking in this way to his face; perhaps he will turn aside. Invariably he speaks with a singular suavity; he possesses a good temper and displays a philosophic calm that, I must confess, I envy.  I felt that if he got an opportunity of putting this question on an equitable basis he would have taken that opportunity.  I thought that when this amendment came down from the Seanad the Vice-President was very likely indeed to accept it.  I am a little surprised and considerably disappointed that he has not seen fit to do so.  Then there was Deputy Donnelly, that hard-hearted politician.  If we had in our Universities a degree in electioneering I am certain he would be a master; they would make him even a doctor of electioneering.  Yet that hard-hearted master of that curious craft was so touched that he told us it required the compulsion of the Party Whip to get him into the Government Lobbies.  He practically told us that.  He did a lot to disabuse me, at least, of the idea that this Bill was based entirely on an electioneering plan of the Government Party.  It was their desire&mdash;possibly it was not a reprehensible desire&mdash;to reduce the possible majority against them.  So it was said.  Obviously there were four University members against two on the Government side, and for that reason they desired to do away with University representation. Deputy Donnelly took a higher view than that.  He recognised, if not the right of the Universities to be represented, at least the fact that the presence of University representatives in a legislative assembly was possibly agreeable.  But when he comes to the vote to-day I can see Deputy Donnelly again going into the Government Lobby.  I can see him doing it with regret, with great expressions of deep sympathy with the representatives <Col N="2140" /> whose death sentence he is sanctioning. I am afraid, a Chinn Comhairle, I cannot go into the principle of University representation now, but I would reiterate what I said at the beginning, that the Seanad has given the House a chance of treating this whole question more equitably and of giving the country an opportunity to say what they think about it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Vice-President for being so suave and smiling.  I also thank Deputy Donnelly for being so sympathetic and so deeply grieved.  In fact in this job&mdash;if one could conceive the Vice-President engaged in a job&mdash;he would make an excellent Carpenter to the Walrus of Deputy Donnelly.  You can imagine Deputy Donnelly like the Walrus: &ldquo;I weep for you,&rdquo; the Walrus said;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I deeply sympathise;</P>
      <P>With sobs and tears he sorted out</P>
      <P>Six of the largest sighs,</P>
      <P>Holding his pocket-handkerchief</P>
      <P>Before his streaming eyes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And so, after giving expression to a proper regret at our demise our Walrus would, I am sure, say kindly things about us in our obituary, just as he said them to us on our death-beds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House by any prolonged observations on the amendment now before us.  The Minister, in his opening statement, remarked that this amendment before us to-day was almost identical with an amendment which was debated here, I think on the motion of Deputy McGilligan, some 18 or 20 months ago.  He further stated that, therefore, it was not necessary for him to add much to what he had said on that occasion.  I take it, therefore, that he is adopting his speech made on that occasion as part of his argument to-day.  I would point out to him that the amendment before us now does differ considerably and materially from the amendment which was discussed on a previous occasion.  Deputy McGilligan's amendment was one which would delay the putting into operation of the Bill, when enacted, until the second next general election.  The amendment we are considering to-day is one merely to delay the bringing into operation of <Col N="2141" /> the Bill for six months after the date of the next general election.  There might be a difference of several years in these matters.  One could understand that the Government&mdash;while seeing some terrible evil and terrible danger in this system of University representation, and not seeing its way to consent to delaying putting such a desirable reform, from their point of view, into action for the length of a Parliament&mdash;might readily conceive that it would not be dangerous and might even be fair to delay putting that reform into operation until the electors of the country had an opportunity for the first time of expressing their opinion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment which the Seanad has sent down is merely to give the electors such an opportunity of expressing their opinion.  We had a good deal of debate a couple of years ago on the issue as to whether the electors had really any knowledge or anticipation that such a measure would be dealt with during the life of the present Parliament or during the tenure of office of the present Government.  Frankly enough the Minister, after some pressure, admitted that there was not any general knowledge of such a proposal being in the programme of the Government prior to the elections.  He did state that the matter had been mentioned at certain public meetings in Dublin.  He did say that it had been mentioned at the Ard-Fheis of his Party on various occasions, but he was unable to tell us if any of those references to the question had ever seen publication in the Press of the country.  Therefore I think it is fair to say that, whatever may have been in the private programme of the Party, the public of the country when voting for the members of the Government and their supporters had not before their minds that this was part of the programme.  The Minister, in drawing back to a certain extent on that point, put forward another argument. He said: &ldquo;It is also a fact, I think, that all Governments introduce such legislation as they think right or proper, or for the good of the community, whether they had ever put such legislation in the forefront of <Col N="2142" /> their programme at a general election or not.  That is a practice common to every Government that has so far been on these benches.&rdquo;  He might have made it wider, and said it is a natural practice for any Government which attempts to carry on its duties.</P>
    <P>A Government must deal with the questions of the day as they arise, and it must not allow its hand to be held up by lack of any statement put in its programme before the general election. But when any change has taken place, or when any sudden danger has arisen, or when any new problem has to be dealt with, it must be met.  When one is dealing with the Constitution of a country which is unchanged since it was first made, you are faced with an entirely different question.  I do not wish to state it as a completely accurate statement that Governments in this country have not altered the Constitution in certain particulars as the occasion arose, but I think I am right in saying that they only made such alterations when they believed they were faced by emergencies or by some new problem which showed that the Constitution did not give them the scope to achieve or carry out what they thought was their duty.  I think when the Government has established to the satisfaction of the House that such emergency arose, they would have in that quite sufficient justification for acting.  But I say that when no new factor has arisen, when nothing has happened to alter this fact of University representation; when the persons who represent the Universities here have not proved themselves by their conduct in the House or outside the House a danger to the community and not likely to be a danger to the community; when it has been shown in the most convincing manner that University representation has not interfered in any way with the performance by the House of its duties to the community, then they have failed to show that an emergency has arisen.</P>
    <P>The Minister dropped an interesting remark in his speech to-day.  He said if the Referendum was still part of the Constitution, this topic of University representation would be a suitable topic to put before the country through <Col N="2143" /> the Referendum.  I notice on many occasions that the Minister and his colleagues have spoken with a kind of tender regret of the abolition of the Referendum.  But they have been in office four years, and during that time they made no attempt to reintroduce the Referendum into the Constitution. My suggestion to the Minister is that being deprived of this useful instrument&mdash;the abolition of which I regret, as do many Deputies in other parts of the House as well as on the Government Benches&mdash;but having been deprived of that instrument of the Referendum, the Government should be more cautious in making a Constitutional change.  Before doing so they ought to make sure that the electors should have an opportunity of expressing their views on the proposed change. This amendment from the Seanad gives them that opportunity, and it does so without any inconvenience to themselves and without any inconvenience to the next Dáil.  It does so without any deleterious effect that one could possible conceive.  This House wants to alter the representation in this Assembly.  It is only fair then to the electors of the country that they should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion as to whether that change is desirable or not.  I see no answer to the suggestion that has come from the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There are some other points to which I had thought of referring, but I pass over them as being outside the strict application of this amendment.  There is one thing implicit in the Minister's arguments to-day, and not only implicit but explicit in the speech which he delivered on the 14th June, 1934, and which he adopted to-day as part of his argument that the Government has the right to press legislation.  Nobody questions that the Government has the right to press legislation.  But the Minister falls into a confusion which I have already noticed in the speeches from the Government Benches.  Ministers do not take the trouble to distinguish between what people have a right to do and that which it is right for them to do.  It is perfectly true that the Government has a right to <Col N="2144" /> press legislation.  That we as individuals have a right to do many things is perfectly true.  But it is an entirely different thing to say that the Government would be right in doing everything that it has a right to do, or that a private individual would be right in doing everything that he has a perfect right to do.  The confusion is one that cuts very deep, and is implicit even in the arguments before the House.  It was implicit in the Minister's speech when he said: &ldquo;I do not think anybody will dispute the right of the Government to do that.&rdquo;  That is to introduce legislation.  But there is another question&mdash;whether the Government is right in introducing legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>We listened to-day to an amazing, and, if the word is not offensive, a very immoral speech from a University representative.  I confess on listening to that speech&mdash;and I want to avoid being personal&mdash;that Deputy Mrs. Concannon gave the first jolt to my belief in the efficiency of University representation in this House.  The argument that Deputy Mrs. Concannon, put before the House, as far as I could understand it, and I listened very carefully to what she said, was this: that it was a gross impertinence for the Seanad to make any representation to this House; that it was a cynical challenge for the Seanad to make representation to this House and that, therefore, this House ought to reject the representations whether these representations were good or bad.  I do not think that even the Government Bench would join their supporter in that view.  Ministers on the Government Benches have, time after time, come back here with Bills from the Seanad and, by their implicit acceptance of the amendments sent from that House, have expressed their approval of the amendments made there in Government Bills.  If these amendments have increased the efficiency of the legislation carried through the Oireachtas, why should it now be stated that this one particular amendment from the Seanad which does not alter the Bill in any matter of principle is a cynical challenge to the Dáil?  Even if it were, why should Deputies in this House <Col N="2145" /> give away their own independence of judgment in order to reject representations made to them, whether good or bad?  We are asked by Deputy Mrs. Concannon to tear up the amendment and throw it back to the Seanad because they have the impertinence to send it to us.  That was Deputy Mrs. Concannon's argument and that is why I say it is an amazing suggestion to make to the House and also an immoral one.  It is a suggestion that we should throw away our judgment and our consciences because the suggestion has come from a quarter with which we disagree.  The Minister has told us that he did not think there was any need to go over any of the arguments advanced to-day in favour of this amendment, that he was relying on the arguments advanced by him in the House one and a half years ago. That is to say, that the fact that he has already put them to us in this House is proof that the arguments are true and that, therefore, the passage of the Bill through the House should not be delayed.  I would suggest again that, while the House has undoubtedly time and again approved of the principle, it has not yet discussed the question which we are asked to discuss to-day as to whether the electors should be given an opportunity of considering the matter further and in a way which will not hamper the judgment and opinion of the next Assembly which will meet here after the general election.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Concannon said it would be a degrading thing that we should pay any attention to the wishes of future Assemblies and that we should regulate our duties to-day without any consideration of the Dáil of the future.  Surely any wise statesman looks not merely to the public opinion of the moment but to what public opinion is likely to be a considerable time in advance.  He legislates not for the month or the year but for the future.  The Minister said the House has approved of this measure. I agree.  I am not going to try to reopen that question.  But whether a Bill has passed through the House once, twice, or three times does not establish the principle for all time.  My colleague who spoke a few moments ago <Col N="2146" /> quoted from Lewis Carroll.  Something that the Minister has said reminded me of another incident in one of Lewis Carroll's books where one of the characters says: &ldquo;When I say a thing once, twice, three times it is so.&rdquo;  The Minister has told us that the House has approved three times of the principle of this Bill; therefore, it is right.  We, however, still may be sceptical.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter in view of the fact that he admits the amendment has some point in it.  We can imagine that if the referendum were available this Bill might be referred to the people for decision.  I wish to stress that.  This amendment gives the people that opportunity.  As, unfortunately, the Government did not intend the damage done by the previous Administration in eliminating the referendum perhaps the Minister would consider this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment would give the people an opportunity of saying what they think about this Bill.  The time specified is short, only six months after the next general election.  It is only a question of six <Col N="2147" /> months to consider whether University representation should or should not exist.  The idea is that the Act should not become effective until six months after the general election.  It is only a question of time.  Notwithstanding the views expressed by Deputy Mrs. Concannon, I do not think the National University representation would do any harm for six months more.  I think the Government could easily afford to let that representation exist for that length of time.  I think the Minister should act in a statesmanlike way, change his mind upon the matter, and give that period of six months asked for. I do not think it would do the Government, or their political Party, one bit of harm if they did that.  Of course if they are to be dependent on three votes after the next general election, well then I say God help the country.</P>

I feel that when the Vice President goes home to-night he will recite most fervently the seven Penitential Psalms and add some trimmings and <i>agusiní</i> of his own.  I am sure that he feels deeply the compulsion placed upon him when conducting this Bill through the Dáil, and I am certain he does not approve of it in his heart and soul&mdash;if he has a heart or soul at all and I believe he has.  I agree with every word spoken here by Deputy J. M. O'Sullivan and other distinguished professors who have spoken.  I am entirely in favour of the amendment, still I feel this debate is really waste of time and wind.  The decree has gone forth.  In the olden times it came forth from Rome; in modern times the decree comes forth from nearer home&mdash;<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>&mdash;University representation must be destroyed.

      <P>I see no objection whatever, and I do not see any danger to Church or State, by adjourning or postponing the decision upon this matter until after the next general election.  The representatives of the universities have contributed materially to the building up of the Free State.  They have given freely of their services, they have been of great and material use to the community, and, therefore, the amendments properly suggested by the Seanad ought to be accepted by this House.  Of course, I know they will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister what I consider to be one good reason why we should accept the amendments.  When the Bill was before the House the Minister did not give any convincing reason for it.  He and his colleagues in the Government are very fond of telling us when they bring a piece of legislation forward that they have got a mandate for it.  That is a word they are very fond of using.  I suggest to the Minister that in order to get the mandate which he and his colleagues are so fond of he should agree to the amendments.  That will give them an opportunity at the next election to put before the people the question of the abolition of University representation, or are we to take it that they are so doubtful about the result of the next election that they want to make sure of wiping out University representation while they are in a position to do so?  If they have regard for the wishes of the people and for mandates, surely <Col N="2149" /> the amendments from the Seanad offer an excellent opportunity to test the people's opinion.  There is really no reason for refusing to accept the amendments, except the reason that there was for introducing the Bill.  It is purely a question of the number of votes that the Government can marshal in this House.</P>
      <P>I must confess that at one time I had not very much love for University representation, but, as a result of my experience since I became a member of the House, I have been convinced that University representation and the representatives they send here have been a great acquisition and have stamped certain qualities on legislation that perhaps cannot be got outside Universities, in particular upon social legislation going through the House. I stress that point because I think University representative show the peculiar quality of University representation in the particular interest they take in social legislation introduced in the Dáil.  However, as Deputy Burke said, I feel that it is merely beating the air to appeal to reason or sense in this matter.  The Government have made up their minds that University representation is to go, and, having done so, there is no question of listening to sense or reason.  I am as doubtful as the previous speaker whether the Minister is as much in love with this measure now as when he introduced it.  I think he would be the first to admit that some of the most valuable contributions made to legislation, particularly legislation introduced by himself and by his Department, were made by University representatives.  I am satisfied, as a result of my experience here, that University representatives will be a definite loss, not only to this House, but to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed by the Minister on two grounds.  He said that the proposals introduced to this House in connection with the Constitution had not embodied in them University representation in the Dáil.  That is quite true. As University representatives took part in the discussion of the Constitution in the Constituent Assembly, the case that these University representatives <Col N="2150" /> made completely and unanimously satisfied the Dáil to have them included as Dáil representatives in the Constitution.  It was due to the case that they made that the Constitution as drafted had the provision in it which we are now asked to take out.  The Seanad, in its sober wisdom and in its detachment, as it were, from the peculiar political mind that prevails here upon occasions, has suggested a very sensible amendment, which, in essence, amounts to this, to let the next Dáil try University representatives in their presence, and if they are satisfied that they should be condemned, let them be condemned on their merits and in their presence.  We have got this position, that as far as this House is concerned we are judging not the present University representatives.  The Minister's proposals are not concerned with them. The Government say that they are prepared to tolerate them, that they have to put up with them and will bear with them.  Why should not the next Dáil be given the privilege that this Dáil has got of weighing up the merits and the advantages that the Dáil derives&mdash;if it derives any&mdash;from University representation?  The last Dáil, on the initiative of a University representative, benefited all classes of the community by a single Act that it passed.  The Minister is going to get more value out of that politically, as he will have a few millions to spend owing to the initiative and the industry of that particular University representative.  Quite recently the Minister's Department had to withdraw proposals in connection with social questions by reason of the case that was made by University representatives. We are not at the end of social legislation.  When people talk about conservatism and say that they want to do away with the conservatism that hangs round Universities, let us remember that those labelled with conservatism have themselves been most remarkable for the radical views that they put forward and for the sound objective they had before them with regard to social legislation.  That was perhaps most marked in connection with the Milk Bill that was introduced by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> Why is it that people say there is a certain amount of conservatism about Universities?  Mainly because of their age.  That happens to be a thing that alters with time.  We have a young University and an old University in this country.  Instead of getting all the advantages we can from each of these Universities, the Dáil in its wisdom is going to be regarded as an institution which said: &ldquo;No, whatever we will stand for, we will not stand for special representation for educated persons.&rdquo; That is certainly not to its credit.  The Seanad in its wisdom has at least given us a way out; it has given one opportunity to postpone a decision of that sort, or of giving a court of appeal. The Minister is also responsible for legislation that was introduced and passed into law dealing with public representation.  We have the name &ldquo;proportional representation.&rdquo;  That is all that is left.  The Act that was passed here did everything that was possible to do violence to proportional representation.  It is inevitable that legislation will have to be considered on that question.  If they were not satisfied with proportional representation, let us have the other system; but what we have is neither one nor the other.  It is certainly not a credit to the House, and it is certainly not proportional representation.  By reason of University representation there is an opportunity for a certain section to send representatives to this House, strangely enough without voicing their own particular opinions.  I have heard them do that least of any section of the community, but they do add whatever contributions they can, derived from their associations or contracts, to improving legislation in a detached but nevertheless constructive fashion.</P>
    <P>One of the statements made by the Minister was that he would be prepared to consider this amendment if he had the Referendum in the Constitution. The Minister will, I think, on an examination of the Constitution, find that whatever alterations his Ministry has made in it have all been destructive. They have been all amputations. There have been no additions.  He had an opportunity, as Deputy Dr. Rowlette <Col N="2152" /> said, to put back the Referendum.  The Referendum is one of those things about which every opposition likes to talk.  We heard a lot of talk about it when we were the Government, but there is nothing about it now when we are the Opposition.  Almost every government which has had experience of the working of referenda will tell you that they do not pan out exactly as people think, and they seldom produce what is expected of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave us two reasons.  One, at any rate, was that if the Referendum were in the Constitution he would be more willing to consider this amendment.  His other reason was concerned with historical matters, that certain persons were appointed by the Provisional Government to draw up a Constitution, that they drew up that Constitution and presented it to the members of the Provisional Government, who considered it and brought it here before the House.  These were his two reasons, and he did not elaborate them.  The real reason for Government haste with regard to this Bill is, unfortunately, a political one.  It is not even a fair political reason.  It is a discreditable one.  If there were six votes against them out of the whole six representatives of Universities, there would probably be some justification for it.  As there are really only two against them in the present instance, the Bill is not alone discreditable; it is unsavoury.  They have no objection, I believe from what we have heard in connection with this matter, to the class of representatives who have come here from the Universities. What objection then is there to allowing that representation to continue <Col N="2153" /> in the next Dáil for six months, so that it can be judged on its merits? It is quite possible that after the next general election there would be some alteration in the Government's view regarding this whole business of representation. It is quite possible, having regard to their activities in one of the Universities, that they might get a representative there.  They would then have a representation of three to three. Would that satisfy them?  Is that the point at issue?  The country's interests demand that we should get a basis of representation that would enable us to call upon these institutions of the State which are best qualified to give us the highest type of representation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the last remark made by Deputy Cosgrave, that the country ought to get, and is entitled to get, the best possible type of representative that can be elected to this House, but I say these people ought to be got from the ordinary country constituencies.  There is plenty of room there for them without having class representatives, such as the University representatives might be designated. It is not so long since the then leader of Mr. Cosgrave's own Party argued with that Party in favour of class representation, in favour of having the National Assembly elected on a class basis and having vocational representation, a Corporate State and a Corporate Party.  What did Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy MacDermot, who was then associated with him, do with that leader and his propositions about class representation, the Corporate State and the Corporate Party?  They gave him the boot very quickly.</P>

      <P>It is a long way from the amendment, but I am just answering the remarks made by Deputy Cosgrave, who was a member of a Party the Leader of which was in favour of a Corporate State and vocational representation.  They gave him the boot very promptly, and got rid of himself and his Corporate State pretty quickly.  Deputy Cosgrave ought to remember that before he recommends <Col N="2154" /> such a proposition again in this House. He, Deputy Rowlette, Deputy MacEoin and others, are anxious, I am sure sincerely, for a referendum on the question of the retention of University representation in this House.  They have told us that they intend to have a referendum on this matter.  They intend to refer the matter again to the electorate when they have an opportunity. They give way until then.  If ever they get an opportunity of exercising power, perhaps we shall have them coming along with proposals for representation for Universities, representation for chambers of commerce, to which Deputy MacDermot referred, and perhaps for the Trade Union Congress; for doctors, engineers and all the other classes of a professional and vocational character to which they propose to give privileged representation in this House.</P>
      <P>I do not know where Deputy Morrissey was for the last year or two when this question was being debated. He was not always asleep I know.  The fact that we heard his voice occasionally in this House prevents us getting that idea into our heads but he must not have been listening to the debates on this question because if there was one question that was debated here <i>ad nauseam</i> it was this question of a mandate.  I was interested to hear that he is following the career of a gentleman whom, probably, he might have regarded as leader, in thought at any rate, in his earlier and probably less experienced years, a distinguished member of the British Cabinet.  I refer to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald who, like Deputy Morrissey was at one time a great opponent of University representation. I wonder if Deputy Morrissey, thinking out a kind of future for himself when the Party with which he is now associated finds it convenient to drop him for some reason or when he drops them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Cosgrave, and perhaps somebody else&mdash; these two gentlemen, at any rate&mdash; referred to the destructive activities of the present Government so far as the Constitution is concerned.  I think, if there was a close comparison made as to the destruction done on the Constitution by way of amendments and eliminations&mdash;demolitions, as Deputy O'Sullivan called them&mdash;the career of Deputy Cosgrave's Government would not compare very badly with our own. I think that they would have the advantage of us in that matter.  Undoubtedly, to begin with, they constructed that Constitution, or at least the Government that preceded them constructed it and partly gave it to this Free State, and they took it as it was given to them, in other respects; while our idea, as we have said often, is that there were many things in that Constitution which had to go. Many of them have gone, and some others still remain to go, and I hope that the constructive part will soon begin.  I think that it will.  To use a phrase that ought to be familiar to Deputy Dillon, I think that the constructive part of the Constitution will begin, in the words of the late John Redmond, &ldquo;at no far distant date,&rdquo; to the great relief, I think, of Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  I do believe, however, honestly and sincerely, that this type of representation ought not to be in the Constitution. That is certainly my belief.  I am not discussing here, and I am not going to discuss in this debate in connection with this matter, any more than I discussed it through the various debates that took place in connection with this matter, either the merits or the demerits of the individuals who were sent in here by the Universities. I could certainly pay as good tribute to these individuals&mdash;we are talking <Col N="2157" /> about individuals&mdash;as anybody in this House.  I certainly pay that tribute and I pay it most sincerely; but we are not discussing that question. Whether they were good or bad, does not arise.  Whether, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, they justified their existence or not, does not arise, to my mind, on this motion.  I believe they did excellent work here&mdash;some of them at any rate&mdash;and I believe equally that other graduates of Universities did excellent work here.  I believe also that people, who have never put a foot inside a University, did equally good work.  That, however, is not the point at issue.  It is quite true that the individual University representatives contributed largely, and contributed, not alone largely, but well, to the legislation that has been put through this House ever since this House was established.  That is, undoubtedly, true.  Without distinction of Party or of political difference there have been many useful and constructive suggestions made by University representatives and there have been some very distinguished men amongst them.  Again, however, that does not arise.  There have been useful suggestions and constructive suggestions made from all sides of the House and from all classes and all Parties in the House, and I do not regard that as an <Col N="2158" /> argument in favour of this special type of representation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy MacDermot quite properly said, we are in a transitional period.  I hope that we will soon bring to an end the destructive part of the constitutional programme and that we will soon be able to begin the constructive part.  I think that will not be very much longer delayed&mdash;the beginning of the constructive part of our programme.  As the question of a mandate was discussed at such great length before, I do not think I will go into it again.  I believe that the Bill is a right and proper one.  I believe that this amendment, the object of which is to attempt to delay the putting into operation of the Bill still further, has no merit in it.  The Bill has already been delayed for more than 20 months. The Seanad exercised its right under the Constitution to throw out the Bill and delay its passing for the allotted period of 18 months and more, and I think that the country has had time enough to discuss the matter in order to have its mind made up.  I believe, furthermore, that the House and the country have their minds made up in the matter, and I believe we are doing the right thing in asking the House not to pass this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 3 and 4, Section 6 (1), to delete paragraph (e), and substitute two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e) three members (in this Act referred to as insured persons' members) appointed by the Minister from a panel of ten persons to be submitted to him by the General Council of County Councils of whom one shall be from Munster, one from Leinster and one from Connacht or the Ulster counties of the Saorstát, and</P>
      <P>(f) two members (in this Act referred to as insured persons' members) appointed by the Minister from a panel of ten persons to be submitted to him by the Council of Municipal Councils.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I was rather sorry I could not have been here for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I have had an opportunity, however, of reading the debate on the amendments moved, particularly two amendments which stood in my name. I should say that, with one exception, these amendments of mine form a scheme, and I think I can best make my case on amendment No. 1.  The Minister, apparently, misunderstood the purpose of the amendments which were before the House the last day, one of which I think he offered to give further consideration to, namely, the amendment with regard to a medical member of the committee.  One of the reasons why I proposed my original amendment, that the chairman of the society should also be a trustee, was to enable me to get in the medical member without altering the number of three trustees or enlarging the committee as set out in the Bill.  That was one of the reasons.  Of course, there were many others which I shall not go into now.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister did not make any case for the rejection of the amendment dealing with the medical member.  I have read very carefully what he said and I must say that I was very disappointed.  I was of the opinion that the Minister would welcome the suggestion to have a medical member on the committee and I can only come to the conclusion that the Minister's further consideration of that matter has not been favourable, as he has not put down an amendment for this stage dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To anybody who has any knowledge of the working of national health insurance the necessity for at least <Col N="2161" /> one medical member of the committee will be apparent.  Deputy Rowlette, I think, made a very good case, perhaps a much better case than I could make. I want to approach this matter from two points of view: one is the point of view of recognising, even in that way, that this is a national health service and that it ought not to be the beginning and end of this service merely to pay certain moneys when persons are sick.  It would be of very great advantage to any committee, charged with the management of a society such as this, to have at their disposal the advice and experience of a registered medical practitioner.  There is another reason that is, perhaps, the most important reason of all, and I should like the Minister to consider it.  One of the great difficulties in dealing with national health insurance in this country has been the question of medical certification.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of that, but probably he is.  The Minister ought to be aware that it is one of the big questions that have not been solved.  It is one of the questions which committees of management under the old system were unable to deal with, and I suggest to the Minister that it will not be dealt with by the committee of the Unified Society unless they have at their disposal a person who can give them advice from practical experience.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably have some idea of what this question of certification means to the expenditure of the society.  I have some experience as a member of a committee of management under the old system.  I know it was one of the big problems we had to deal with and which we had to watch very carefully.  I do hope, for the sake of the proper and efficient working of the Unified Society, apart altogether from what is perhaps even more important, the question of having proposals dealing with the health of the members continually brought before the committee of management and suggestions made which can be passed on to the Minister, that the Minister will very favourably consider the inclusion of a medical member.  There is nothing whatever to be said against including a medical member on the committee.  I do not think the Minister was wise in suggesting <Col N="2162" /> to the House that there was no difference between suggesting that a lawyer should be put on the committee and that a medical member should be put on it.</P>
    <P>To come to this amendment, which is my alternative to the Minister's scheme outlined in the Bill for electing insured members' representatives on the committee of management, I wish to say that it is not a perfect scheme by any means, but it is the best I can think out.  I suggest to the House, and I hope to be able to show, that it is infinitely better from every point of view than the scheme in the Bill, to which the Minister appears to be wedded.  Many Deputies, I am afraid, and certainly the greater part of the public, do not seem to appreciate what a huge service this national health insurance is.  It is perhaps the biggest service we have in the State.  It embraces 500,000 members.  There is approximately a reserve fund invested amounting to £3,500,000.  The yearly income of the society is approximately £1,000,000.  The committee of management of this huge society, dealing with millions of pounds and with 500,000 persons, is presumably being set up for the purpose of managing this society, and the committee that is to manage such a huge organisation as this is going to be selected in the haphazard and absurd way set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, no harm briefly to outline what the Minister's scheme is. The Minister's scheme is that local authorities shall, having regard to 5,000 and 2,500 insured members in their functional area, nominate so many insured persons to form what is called the electorate.  This electorate, formed in this haphazard, loose way by county councils and corporations all over the Free State, will number anything from 100 to 120 persons.  There is to be no question as to their knowledge of national health insurance, whether they are completely ignorant of it or not; no qualifications whatever will be required beyond the fact that the person selected by the country council or the corporation must be an insured member.</P>
    <P>Eventually, if the scheme works, we <Col N="2163" /> will be presented with an electorate of anything from 100 to 120 members. This body is to hold office for three years.  The main, the only function of this particular body that is to be brought together in some part of the Free State once a year, is to select from amongst themselves five members to act on the committee of management. Again, there is going to be no question as to whether those persons will be useful members, whether they will have any knowledge of the National Health Insurance Acts or the working of them.  We are going to appoint those persons, without any regard to their qualifications, to a committee of management which will be charged with the control of a society dealing with a reserve of £3,500,000, an income of £1,000,000 a year, and with the claims of, roughly, 500,000 people. I think it is the most absurd proposal I have ever heard.  I cannot for a moment believe that the Minister has any regard for the scheme outlined in the Bill.  I expect he has given considerable thought to this matter, but surely some more feasible scheme might have been devised.  I agree it is not easy to get a scheme which will give you direct nomination from the membership.</P>
    <P>My proposal, in a nutshell, is that instead of every corporation and every county council&mdash;there are 27 county councils in the Free State&mdash;functioning in the way set out in the Bill, the General Council of County Councils, one body representative of all the county councils, from amongst the names of insured members submitted to them by the members of each county council, will submit a panel of ten names to the Minister.  That will ensure that there will be some selection, some filter if you like, before the panel reaches the Minister.  He thus gets a panel of ten names from which he can select three.  This will again enable the Minister to use his discretion and knowledge and whatever advice may be given to him so as to ensure that from the ten he will get three men likely to give the best service on the committee of management. That is not a perfect scheme, but I suggest it is infinitely superior to the <Col N="2164" /> Minister's.  It is less cumbersome and less costly.</P>
    <P>The second part of my amendment suggests that a further panel of ten shall be submitted to the Minister by the Council of Municipal Councils and from amongst the ten the Minister can select two names.  Again, it is left to the Minister to get from the ten the men he considers will be able to give him the best service.  My reason for dividing up the five in that way is this, that it is essential to see that you have as fair representation as possible, and it is desirable that we ought to try, as far as we can, to bring about some local contact between the insured members and the representatives on the Committee of Management.  That is also my main reason for setting out in my amendment the provincial representation. One of the drawbacks of the unified scheme is that it removes all local or personal contact between the insured member and his representative on the Committee of Management. Then there is the further point that you have 27 county councils and the active and closely organised insured members in rural areas are mainly road workers.  When I say closely organised, I mean those who can be organised and who can use their votes and strength in a particular way much more easily than a scattered and diffused membership.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that under his scheme, whilst his electorate is going to hold office for three years, the five members appointed by that electorate to the Committee of Management are to hold office only for one year, being, of course, eligible for re-election.  On the Second Reading the Minister intimated that he had a very sound reason for making it one year as against three years, but he did not give us the reason, and I shall be very glad to hear it.  I will be surprised if the Minister will give a reason that will satisfy the House.  You are going to bring 120 persons together from all over the Free State and they will hold office for three years.  They will appoint five to act on the Committee of Management for one year.  These five men may be completely ignorant of the working of national health insurance.  They are to be put on the committee of management, and at the end of 12 months, <Col N="2165" /> just when they are getting some knowledge of how the Insurance Acts work and of their responsibilities in regard to membership and the funds, they are thrown out and you get five fresh men who, perhaps, may be men with a fair general knowledge of the Insurance Acts, but it is quite conceivable, on the other hand, that they may be persons who have no knowledge whatever of the working of the Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows quite well how these things are worked when it comes to selections by county councils and corporations.  The Minister knows it does not always follow that the person who would be best qualified to act will be selected by the county councils.  It might conceivably be a person who knows nothing at all about national health insurance, but who is perhaps a sound, a strong and a vocal supporter of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil and who would be selected for that and for no other reason.  I can claim to have some practical knowledge of the working of national health insurance under the old system, and yet to-morrow, if I were an insured person, I have not the slightest doubt that, as it is at present constituted, I would be the last person in North Tipperary who would be selected by the North Tipperary County Council.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to keep these things in mind, and I will ask the House to realise that we are appointing a committee of management, not of a club or anything else of that sort, but of one of the biggest organisations in the country, a committee that will presumably have responsibility with regard to the investment of surpluses and the handling of £1,000,000 a year. Of course, there are certain statutory regulations with regard to the investment of surpluses, etc., but I need not go into that now.  Whether the Minister's scheme is to be retained or whether my scheme is to go into the Bill, I have heard no reason advanced why the committee of management, the insured members' representatives, should not hold office for three years instead of one year.</P>
    <P>I think there is everything to be said for their holding office for three years. The only reason I think which could conceivably be advanced against that <Col N="2166" /> is that the Minister is afraid that the persons he will get in the first election will be so hopelessly incompetent and so hopelessly ignorant of the work they are being called upon to do that he wants to be in a position to remove them and have another gamble as quickly as he can.  I think my scheme gives the Minister an opportunity, to say the least of it, of ensuring that he will get a better type of men&mdash;a better type in the sense that they will probably know more about the working of the Act or that those of them who do not will probably acquire the knowledge much more quickly than those he will get in the haphazard fashion set out in the scheme contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I say, in this speech of mine I am covering all my amendments, with the exception of No. 2, which is rather a separate matter, but is to a certain extent bound up; it is the question of the one or three years.  Whether my amendment is carried or not, that will remain, and in my opinion it will be more necessary, perhaps under the Minister's scheme than under my scheme.  I shall be very interested to hear the Minister on my scheme as against his own, and I shall be very glad indeed to hear from the Minister that he is prepared to adopt the suggestion of having a medical member on the Committee.  I think whatever scheme of selection or nomination is to be adopted finally, it is desirable and essential for the proper working of the society that you should have a medical member.  I sincerely trust that the Minister will meet us on that.  It is a most important point.  I hope that for the sake of the smooth and good working of the society he will adopt my scheme instead of his own.  If he does not, I can assure the Minister that it is my honest opinion that the Unified Society will not and cannot work, and that the Minister or his successor will be forced to make this service a State service.  That, I think, will happen eventually in any case, whether it is my scheme or the Minister's scheme that is adopted, but I think the Minister's scheme will bring the necessity for it much nearer.</P>

      <P>That is about the only good thing I can say about the Minister's scheme, because I was always one of those who held the view that once you departed from the old system there was no half-way house. The Unified Society is not getting a fair chance under the scheme set out in the Bill.  I want to have it tried out to the fullest, so that when we do go on to a State Service we will go on to it convinced that it is the best.  We ought to realise that we are dealing with a big social service.  It is perhaps the most valuable social service provided for the workers of this country. Only those who have been dealing with it in a very close way realise how valuable it has been to working men and women.  We know how valuable the maternity benefit has been, particularly in the homes of the very poor. It is, in my opinion, a great service.  It is because I look on it as a great service, and a service which I hope to see extended in the near future, that I am anxious that we should get the best type of Committee of Management which it is possible to get.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Morrissey's arguments in reference to such of his amendments as were not already under discussion. I gave my opinion on Friday last on one of the points to which he has adverted now, that is, the appointment of a medical man as a member of the Committee, and I do not intend to touch on that again but to refer rather to amendment No. 1, which deals with the manner in which those members of the Committee who represent the insured persons are to be chosen.  It is quite clear that the Minister and his advisers were in considerable difficulty to devise a scheme to get members of the Committee who could fairly be regarded as representing the insured people.  I do not think <Col N="2168" /> the Minister is likely to be greatly enamoured of the scheme that he has inserted in the Bill.  It has certainly the drawbacks that it is cumbrous and that it puts the insured members' representatives a considerable distance away from those they represent; it does not commend itself as likely to be a workable scheme. There was undoubtedly great difficulty in the matter, but I think that Deputy Morrissey is coming nearer to a workable scheme than that which the Bill puts forward.  It has a great advantage from that point of view, as well as from another point of view, over that embodied in the Bill.  It gives the Minister a considerable choice from a panel put before him by a responsible body.  I do not think that the General Council of County Councils or the Council of Municipal Councils would be very suitable bodies to be entrusted with the duty of directly choosing the representatives of insured people, but I think that they could probably put forward a panel which would include a number of people who could properly be regarded as thoroughly representative of insured members.  The amendment would then put on the Minister the responsibility of selecting from the names before him those of the people who, in his considered judgment, would be the most suitable and useful members, and most representative of those they were supposed to represent. I believe the Minister would be in a better position to choose useful and representative members than the councils and public bodies whom he has proposed in the Bill to entrust with that duty.  From the point of view of getting a useful and representative committee I think Deputy Morrissey's suggestion is a better one than that before us in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason which appeals to me very strongly, as it appeals to Deputy Morrissey, and apparently as it appeals also to the Minister, judging from a remark which he threw out a couple of minutes ago.  There is a change which is almost certain to be forced on the Government within, I hope, a comparatively short time, namely, the change of this service <Col N="2169" /> from being what it is at present&mdash;a monopoly, with the support of the Government behind it&mdash;to being a true State service under the control of the Government and, therefore, under the control of this House.  Like Deputy Morrissey, I have held for several years that once the change to unification was made there was no defence against the further change of making National Health Insurance a State function.</P>
    <P>I think there are two roads open to us.  Deputy Morrissey in his amendment suggests giving some more power to the Minister.  The Minister put rather a Machiavellian suggestion before us&mdash;namely, that the worse the Committee was the sooner he would have to change it to a State service, and therefore, he appealed for Deputy Morrissey's support for what Deputy Morrissey deemed an unworkable scheme in order that he might demonstrate the unworkability of this system and change it to a State service. We have our choice in that matter. We should make a gradual change to a more efficient and useful system.  The Minister's suggestion would amount to using a certain amount of sabotaging of the present system.  If I were in agreement with the Minister in that I would go into the Lobby with him in order to show the unworkableness of this scheme and, therefore, stimulate him to make a more radical move.  On the whole, I think it is better to proceed step by step than by setting out to damage a scheme which is doing useful work.  I would rather try to amend the scheme gradually than smash or damage part of it in the hope of putting up something better.  I do not think we could manage to secure a better scheme by damaging or destroying part of the administrative scheme we have to work.  There is a good deal to be said for competition in industry, and there was also a good deal to be said for competition between the various approved societies.  There is a good deal to be said for state control of such services as National Health Insurance.  State control, at all events, is under responsible criticism, namely, criticism by this House and criticism by the public.  But there is nothing to be said in favour of a monopoly by the <Col N="2170" /> present Society or by the Society we are to have in future.  Under this scheme there would be no criticism.  It is self-governing, and it is dealing with funds contributed by the public though the public has no control over the expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the experience of the Government in the matter of other schemes of monopoly has been altogether happy.  I never thought that the experience of a monopoly in National Health Insurance would prove happy either.  I rather gathered from what the Minister said as to the desirability of State service that he himself is not altogether happy about the monopoly established some years ago.  My second reason for giving my support to Deputy Morrissey's amendment is that it is more workable and it lays down a more easy road for reform in the future and renders that future somewhat nearer.  I hope the Minister will consider that amendment with an open mind.  It is not brought forward in a contentious spirit.  It is brought forward with no motive other than to make National Health Insurance a greater service than the great service it is at the moment.</P>

      <P>From my experience in this House I am satisfied that there is hardly anybody here who takes a greater interest in the subject of national health insurance than does Deputy Morrissey, even including Deputy Rowlette, who also takes a great interest in health insurance.  I realise that Deputy Morrissey knows a great deal about national health insurance, and I know he has had experience&mdash;I do not know how long&mdash;on the committee of management of an approved society.  Therefore, he is entitled to speak with authority on certain matters that we are discussing to-day.  I believe, as Deputy Rowlette has just said, that the amendment put forward now and the suggestions made have been put forward and have been made in the best of good faith and with a view to improving the machinery of the National Health Insurance Society.  I have said so much in order to disabuse anybody's mind as to any suggestion there might be that on a matter of this kind which is purely non-contentious and non-Party, there is any <Col N="2171" /> tendency towards viewing it in a Party spirit.  I think everybody is anxious to do the best he can to make this arrangement for the benefit of the insured persons.  That much being said, I must say that as the father of the child&mdash;I stand in <i>loco parentis</i> in regard to this Bill&mdash;I am as enthusiastic about my child as Deputy Morrissey appears to be about his.</P>
      <P>Parents are usually prejudiced, and I am afraid that neither Deputy Morrissey nor I can claim not to be prejudiced for the things that we are responsible for having evolved.  I claim that my scheme is better than Deputy Morrissey's.  I claim under my scheme that there will be produced as good a type of representative, and perhaps a better type of representative on the Committee of Management than under Deputy Morrissey's.  My scheme is more democratic, and it will get into more close touch with the insured person than Deputy Morrissey's suggested scheme would get.  Deputy Morrissey talked of the way in which matters are managed in the local councils and bodies.  I have had some experience of that too, perhaps not as much as Deputy Morrissey, but I know something of this.  Does Deputy Morrissey say there will not be got a good type of representative on the Committee of Management through the General Council of County Councils or the council that controls the municipal authorities?  The same procedure will govern.  There will be probably a caucus which will say who is to be elected.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. I think through my scheme you are closer to the insured persons by getting the representatives on the Committee of Management through the county councils.  There are only five persons directly elected by the insured persons.  If they are all to be elected by the General Council of County Councils they will not be selected by the insured persons.  Now on the General Council of County Councils <Col N="2172" /> there might not be one member who is himself an insured person.  In the ordinary county council there would be some member who would be an insured person, and who would look after their rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a nominated body and a hand-picked body.  It will not be hand-picked in the same way. You will have more freedom of choice. It may turn out as Deputy Morrissey says, that I am entirely wrong and that I ought not to have confidence in the local councils.  But I still think that in these matters they will be out to get the best representatives irrespective of Party or any other division of that kind.  At any rate that is my opinion.  In the past we have not had any reason to regret the delegates sent up by the public bodies to represent the local county councils and the various other institutions. The councils usually selected responsible people.  I do not fear that we are likely to get from the county councils as delegates any people except people whose sole concern will be to safeguard the interests of the society, and particularly the interests of the insured persons.  It is possible that some people may be selected who will be ignorant of national health insurance, but I imagine that the corporations and county councils will look for people who have experience in these matters.  If I myself were a member of a county council I would look for a person like Deputy Morrissey, who knew the subject and was interested. It is such a person I would vote to have put on.</P>
      <P>I think that the ordinary person elected to a county council would not have any different idea.  There is no profit in it for anybody.  There is no great glory in it for anybody, and I think they will look for useful people to represent them at this annual gathering and instruct them to select the type of person who will best govern and manage the affairs of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have certain ideas with regard to <Col N="2173" /> the development of national health insurance.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that it is a very big and important service and has rendered great assistance to the poor in days gone by. In the days to come, the machine can be made to render even greater service. I did not ask Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Rowlette to adopt this scheme with a view to its early scrapping or with a view to proving it unworkable.  I believe that the scheme is a good one despite the arguments put forward by Deputy Morrissey, who knows the subject and can put his case with knowledge.  I believe the scheme set out in the Bill will prove as good as any I have heard suggested in the debates on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I beg now to move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 7, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The insured persons' (trade union nominees) members and the insured persons' members shall hold office for three years and shall be eligible for reappointment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to give the committee of management a life of three years rather than one year. The position of the committee of management, at the moment, is that those nominated by the Minister, that is seven out of fifteen, will hold office, as far as I can understand it, for a period to be prescribed by the Minister. The representatives of the insured persons are to be elected only for a period of 12 months.  The electorate, that is this large body of 100 or 120 persons, have to be brought together once a year; because I do not see, so far as the Bill is concerned, that they had any function except to nominate and elect from amongst them five persons to retain office only for a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on the Second Reading, told us he had a very sound reason for that.  But he had some reason for refraining from giving that sound reason.  I think there is everything to be said for giving the persons nominated and elected a period of three years.  These people will have a lot to learn, no matter what their knowledge of the Act may be.  They will, from meeting to meeting, get a better grasp of their duties, and of the working of the machinery in general.  It seems to me surprising that you are going to deprive the committee of the services of those particular members, at a time when they have acquired sufficient knowledge to make them efficient members. I do not want to delay the House any longer.  The Minister knows my views on this matter, and now I am anxious to hear that good reason the Minister told us he had for sticking to one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all the committees of management of the old societies were elected annually.  In my view, so long as the people were content to attend their meetings, no change was required.  Why should not that same procedure be good enough for the Unified Society?  There is no reason why it should be changed for us; but there is no reason why the society should not have the opportunity if they wanted a change.  So long as they are attending to their work and proving that they are good, efficient, reliable and trustworthy persons, in all probability they will not want to have a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey provided another reason as to why we should have the elected members for one year when he spoke on the last amendment.  He then said that our scheme was bad.  If so, that would be one good reason. <Col N="2177" /> However, I do not think there is much in that.  I do not know any reason why we should not carry on the procedure of the old societies.  In those societies, whether small or great, as a rule&mdash; there may have been one or two exceptions&mdash;they all had annual elections for the committee of management, but the percentage of change in regard to the whole body was small.</P>
    <P>One other point.  I should like to have the excuse of the annual elections for bringing that body together.  I should like to have the opportunity of bringing together the body of delegates to the electoral college, as we might call it, for the purpose of giving them an opportunity of airing their views in regard to National Health Insurance.  Probably they could be brought together, and there would be a good reason for doing so for the annual elections.  Having done that, there is no reason why they should not meet to discuss all and any aspect of national health insurance, and to call the attention of the public, the Dáil, the Minister or Deputies to whatever grievances they might have or to whatever matter they might be interested in in the way of propaganda for national health insurance purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Minister, there is, of course, no comparison between the method of management under the new system and the old system.  In the old days an annual meeting was held and a number of members, 20 or 100, who lived adjacent to the headquarters of the society, attended and elected, or reelected, a committee of management with, perhaps, one or two additions. Those who lived in proximity to the headquarters had personal knowledge of their representatives and knew if they were working the society satisfactorily or not.  The position is going to be different in future.  You may have 100 persons brought together from the Twenty-six Counties to elect five representatives, and they may have no previous knowledge of them or of their connection with the work of national health insurance.  Only at the end of 12 months would they know whether the work of their representatives was done in an efficient manner or not. <Col N="2178" /> There is no machinery by which attention could be called to the way the business was managed or as to the grasp these five representatives had of the working of the Act.  As to bringing them together to air their views, there is very little use in doing that unless there is some person with authority who would take a note of the views expressed by the delegates.  Prior to that, some person should give a considered and a written report on the work of the committee of management for the previous 12 months.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  It is beside the point to suggest that there is no analogy whatever between what happened under the old system and the present one.  I do not suggest that there is any point in what the Minister said, and I believe it is impossible to meet the case I made in favour of three years, as against one.  I am satisfied that it is in the interests of the society, as well as securing good service, that the committee should be appointed for three years.  I urge the Minister to give the question further considerations.  If he consults with people conversant with the working of the Acts, as to the necessity of having people on the committee of management who have at least a general idea of the work that requires to be done, I think my amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I want to call attention to the provisions of Section 18.  I have no sympathy with an employer who has failed to pay contributions, and I am not making a case on his behalf, but when a section like this is inserted there are other aspects of failure to comply with the regulations to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  He is, no doubt, aware that a practice has grown up of juvenile employees stating their ages incorrectly.  At one time those in charge of the unemployment and national health offices insisted on certificates of birth, but that practice has fallen into disuse, and as a result in a number of cases employers have been called upon to make good the shortage in stamps.  I submit that that practice should not be encouraged, and that provision should be made where juvenile employees make incorrect statements as to age, or where the age is incorrectly stated on the cards, whereby some penalty might be inflicted.  In such cases employers should not be called upon subsequently to make up the stamps, where cards were stamped in good faith.</P>

      <P>We have gone into the matter and so far as I have been able to ascertain, up to the <Col N="2182" /> present at any rate, it is not possible to make such arrangements as would not in the end probably lead to greater hardship, for this reason, that non-compliance is the greatest evil, practically, that there has been in connection with national health insurance. It has been the most widespread evil.  It is thought that anything that relieves the individuals concerned of the responsibility for looking after their own interests&mdash;the stamping of their own cards&mdash;will lead further to the spread of non-compliance. The matter has been examined before, and it was examined again, and the fear does seem to reside very strongly in those who are expert in the matter that if anything is done further to relieve an insured person from his own, or her own, responsibility to see that his cards or her cards are stamped it will mean that the cure will be worse than the disease.  That is the view taken by experts in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That there shall be charged and levied on every licence to import sugar issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, under any Act restricting and controlling the importation of sugar which is passed in the year 1936, such fees as the said Minister may from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, appoint.</P>
      <P>(2)  That every such fee shall be paid by Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>(3)  That a refund of the whole or part of the fee so charged on any such licence may be made in respect of sugar imported under such licence which is subsequently exported or is used in the manufacture in Saorstát Eireann of an article of food which is so exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained yesterday, the provision for the fee is designed for one purpose and for one purpose only. That is to ensure that if there should be, in relation to the quantity of sugar to be imported, a slight differential between the price at which sugar can be imported and the price at which sugar is sold by the company, that differential will be taken up for the benefit of the Exchequer. The differential in any circumstances will be much too small to allow of its being passed on to the consumers of sugar.  Last year the benefit went in increased profits to the registered sugar importers, and without this provision for a fee it would go in increased profits to the company.  In our opinion that is not desirable.  Under no circumstances is the difference in price likely to be so great as to enable a reduction in the retail prices of sugar to be effected.  Before you could have a reduction of 1/4d. a lb. in the price of sugar, there would have to <Col N="2184" /> be a reduction of 2/4 per cwt. and a reduction to that extent is extremely improbable.  If it should happen, as it may well happen, that the price at which imported sugar plus the duty is available is equal to or exceeds the price at which sugar manufactured here is available, then no fee will be charged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has just said focuses attention upon the price of sugar manufactured by the company.  We have got no figure as regards that.  We have never had as far as I know.  I have not seen it in any statement or explanation by the sugar manufacturing company.  It did not appear in the balance sheet. The only information we have on it is from people who buy sugar from the company.  In the price that is charged there is provision for various items.  The Minister in dealing with the sugar company yesterday paid a tribute to their genius in having factories established in the three districts where the factories were erected and to the engineering skill displayed.  These things are all very fine.</P>
      <P>We have splendid examples, not alone in this country but in many other places, of beautiful buildings and fine houses built over 150 years ago, models of architectural skill, expensive institutions that nobody now occupies or can afford to maintain.  What we should like to know is something about the price of sugar, something about the provision which is made in respect to depreciation, reserves and so on because that is not available from any other source.  The Minister mentions that the price of imported sugar is to be regulated by the price of sugar manufactured by the company but we get no information as to what that is. We are at sea, absolutely at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister invites us to believe that variations in the price of imported sugar are so small that he cannot give any reduction to the consumer.  The consumer at the present moment is paying a very big extra price for sugar manufactured in this country, amounting to £16 per ton or 1¾ per lb.  It may be that sugar can be imported at <Col N="2185" /> a price plus the customs duty which would be smaller than the price at which sugar can be manufactured here, but in our zeal for correct prices and so on, we say that any profit that will accrue will fall to the Exchequer.  One would imagine that the Exchequer was the consumer's pocket-book.  It is nothing of the sort.  Assuming for a moment that there is a differential, to use the Minister's phrase, of 1/- per cwt., it is true that you cannot pass on the reduction in respect of that cwt. to the consumer but you are not confined to purchasing one cwt.  You are going to purchase 20,000 tons of imported sugar this year.  Cannot the reduction in price be given for one week or a month in the year so that people will get cheaper sugar for at least that period?  One fifth of the sugar to be consumed in the coming year will be imported sugar.  Assuming that you could not give a farthing's reduction in price in respect of every cwt. imported during the year, could you not given a reduction of 1/4d per lb. for one month of that period?</P>
    <P>Assuming that it is 1/2 a cwt. cheaper, in respect of 20,000 tons have you not got 20,000 tons at 2/4?  Is it really held by the Minister that the price of sugar&mdash;1¾d. per lb.&mdash;which they are paying, is not enough?  The extra price which has to be paid is in respect of the manufacture of sugar by the Irish Sugar Company, together with the other imposts in respect of Customs duties and so on.  Is not that enough?  It is admitted that sugar in Northern Ireland is cheaper than here.  Sugar is an item which enters largely into the poor man's household, and we were told some years ago, when there was a small impost put on, that it was beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  Now, however, we have to put into the Exchequer anything that may accrue in respect of the increased price on the taxpayer plus the 21/- tax.  Surely the Minister should give us some information in respect of the price of sugar&mdash;whether he has been satisfied with regard to the items in the balance sheet; whether too much has been allowed for depreciation; what is the reserve fund; and also, perhaps, if he has a lucid <Col N="2186" /> interval, he might be able to give us some details as to the question of the 6 per cent. preference shares in connection with this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot quite relate the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave to the motion I moved.  I do not quite see how the business methods of the Irish Sugar Company, and the amount of their earnings which they allocated to depreciation and so forth, can have any bearing on the question of controlling the import of sugar.  The sugar has to be imported in one way or another.  The price at which the Irish Sugar Company sells at the present time&mdash;at least, the price of the sugar produced during the recent campaign&mdash;is 29/4½d. per cwt.  That is the net price, carriage paid, at 40 different centres in the country.  That arrangement of paying carriage to different centres in the country is designed to ensure that the price of sugar will be uniform, so far as it is possible to arrange it, in all parts of the country.  That has not been the arrangement heretofore. Heretofore, people in rural areas or in the central parts of the country paid a substantially higher price than the people living in the port towns; but the device of the Irish Sugar Company, by which they pay carriage to a very large number of centres in the country, has changed that position.  The price they are charging is an economic price.  It is a price which enables them to pay a reasonable price for the beet supplied to them by the farmers, to pay reasonable wages to the workers employed in the factories, and to enable the factories to operate efficiently.  The factories are very efficient.  They are amongst the most up-to-date factories in the world and they have been worked very competently by the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The return which the company gets on the capital invested in the enterprise is, of course, something that may fluctuate from year to year.  They have obligations in respect of debentures and on their preference shares, and their obligations in respect of these, of course, are known in advance; but any return over and above the amount necessary to pay the <Col N="2187" /> debenture interest and the dividend on the preference shares, in so far as it is not allocated to reserves of one kind or another, is available for the ordinary shares, and all of these are owned by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.  It is to be anticipated that the company will be able to reduce its manufacturing charges according as the staffs of the factories become better trained in their work and as the various difficulties, which are inevitable in the initial years of a big concern of that kind, are overcome. Even allowing, however, for the fact that these initial difficulties are there, and that the staffs are not fully trained, the price at which sugar is sold here by the company is substantially lower than the price at which it is sold in the majority of European countries.  It is very much lower than the price at which sugar can be bought in the countries whence there are sugar exports.  I mentioned before that the fact that we can buy CzechoSlovakian sugar at 7/- a cwt. here has to be related to the fact that the people in that country have to pay very much more, retail, for their sugar in their own shops.  In other words, the export of sugar in that case is being subsidised, and it is entirely unfair to relate the price at which that subsidised sugar can be bought here to the price of the sugar produced here.  The British Government have a beet sugar scheme in operation, but they are assisting the development of the industry in a different manner to that in which we are doing it.  They are paying a direct subsidy similar in nature to the direct subsidy which was paid to the Carlow Sugar Company before the establishment of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.</P>
    <P>The only question that arises here is whether it is better to control the import of sugar by one method or another.  In that connection, I want to emphasise the fact that the quantity we will have to import in future years will be very small indeed.  It is true that 15,000 tons or 16,000 tons of sugar will be required to be imported this year to supplement the 84,000 tons produced by the factories, but in future <Col N="2188" /> years that will not be at all necessary, and in fact sugar will not be imported at all except in small quantities and of a special class to be used as raw material for particular types of manufacture. There are certain types of manufacture in which particular kinds of sugar, such as cane sugar, must be used, and only such quantities of sugar as must be used for such industrial purposes will be imported in future years.  It would be completely impracticable to regulate that importation under the Control of Imports Acts.  I explained yesterday that, to enable one importer to get a small quantity of sugar under the present arrangement, it would be necessary to make a quota so large that every registered importer could share in it. The quota would have to be made sufficiently large, in order to ensure that the one importer, whose interest it was desired to meet, would get the amount that he required, and as every registered importer could share in it, it would mean that a very large quantity of sugar would have to be imported unnecessarily, delaying the clearance of the Irish Sugar Company's stocks and creating new difficulties in the financing of these stocks. The difficulty was so obvious, and was working out so much to the detriment of the sugar importers as well as to the administration, that it was the importers themselves who originated the suggestion that the sole licence to import sugar, to whatever extent is necessary, should be given to the Irish Sugar Company.  That required legislation because, as the law stood, the sugar company could not get a licence to import sugar, and that is why this Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>The question of the fee with which this resolution deals only arises because of the possibility of there being at any time a slight difference between the price at which sugar can be imported and the price at which native sugar is available.  It is extremely improbable that that difference would ever be enough to enable a reduction in the retail price of sugar to be effected.  Sugar comes in here at a price, exclusive of duty, of 7/- to 7/6 a cwt., but there would have to be <Col N="2189" /> a reduction of 2/4 a cwt., before one farthing in the pound could be passed on to the consumers, whereas the difference is only one of pence.  The suggestion that we should accumulate whatever difference there might be over a number of weeks, for the purpose of giving a reduction in one week, could only be applicable to the circumstances of this year and might operate unfairly for a number of people in the country.  A very large proportion of the sugar we use is used by manufacturers.  It is not consumed by householders, but is used by manufacturers in the production of commodities of one kind and another, such as jams, confectionery, sweets and so forth, and if one manufacturer, merely because he purchased his supplies in one week, got his sugar at a lower price than another manufacturer who had his stocks purchased earlier he would have an advantage over his competitors. The manufacturers themselves are particularly desirous that an arrangement should be made which will keep the price of sugar uniform throughout the year, and this arrangement does that.</P>
    <P>The price of imported sugar is rising and all the indications are that it is going to continue to rise.  It may, in fact, rise substantially, if the political and other conditions on the Continent of Europe do not improve, in which case, of course, there will be no question of a fee at all, because the price at which imported sugar will be available will be equal to, and may possibly exceed, the price at which home-produced sugar is sold.  In these circumstances, this question does not arise, but if there should be a slightly lower price for imported sugar, amounting to a few pence or 1/- a cwt., the question is who should get it.  It cannot go to the consumer.  It went last year to the sugar importers in the form of increased profits.  They got their normal profit, plus that difference, on that sugar, and that, I think, is not a desirable position.  Should it go to the sugar company or should it go to the Exchequer?  The view of everybody who has examined the matter is that it is better it should go to the Exchequer, if that situation should arise.</P>

      <P>It was not quite like that.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a suggestion to the Minister.  There is money in it.  Assuming that there is, the sugar company, this blessed institution which is conferring so many benefits on humanity here at a price of 1¾d. per lb., regulates its price by the cost of the beet, £800,000 and the cost of the wages they pay, £160,000, making £960,000.  They got approximately £1,848,000 for the sugar they sold. There is a good balance there for all the other things that are going to be provided for.  Those things are (1) the debenture interest, £1,000,000 at 4 per cent., £40,000, and (2) 6 per cent. on £500,000, £30,000.  Then the Minister for Finance gets his profit on the £500,000 he has invested in it.  He seems to be doing very well out of the whole transaction.  In the first place, he has 4/8 Excise duty on sugar; he has the profit on his ordinary shares which are going to be provided for; and he is looking now for his rake off, which is going to be infinitesimal, but which he wants, no matter how small it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sugar company, as I see it, is going to find out, first of all, what the beet costs, what the wages cost, the managing expenses and all the other <Col N="2191" /> expenses, plus the profits on the various characters of shares that are held, and then on top of that, depreciation and perhaps a reserve fund.  If there is a profit on this sugar why should it not go in there along with the rest of that, so that the bulk of the sugar can be sold more cheaply?  Is it that we must get some fraction which will give 2/4 of a reduction or an increase, in order that there can be an equitable price all round?  Assuming for the moment that you cannot get that fraction in one year, why not give it to them for the second year and give us six months or three months of cheap sugar?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a competition between the importers, who say, &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, take away this profit,&rdquo; and the sugar company, which says, &ldquo;We do not want it.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance has his hands out for it all the time.  That is the situation we are asked to accept.  Now, we do not accept it and we say that if there be a profit, let it reduce the price which, Heaven knows, is dear enough at present.  There is an import price of 7/6 as against, let us say, 28/-, giving you the 1/4½.  That is practically four times the amount, and it was lower than 7/- some time during the year.  This manufactured sugar in the country costs approximately four times what the imported sugar costs, and in all sense of decency, that money ought not to go into the Exchequer. It should go towards reducing that price.  The Minister says it is negligible, but why does the Minister for Finance want it?  Between the figures the Minister has given us and which are admitted&mdash;£800,000 for beet and £160,000 for wages&mdash;and the £1,800,000 which they get for the sugar, there is a big margin.  Too many precautions <Col N="2192" /> are being taken to ensure that you will pay the big dividends, that the money is certain, while, at the same time, it is going into the Exchequer, and it is all at the expense of the one unfortunate individual in this country, the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point in connection with that.  I think it is undesirable that the sugar company should make any profit out of the importation of sugar.  The job of the sugar company is to make sugar here sufficient in quantity to supply our requirements, and, on that account, we decided not to allow for any possibility of profit on the imported sugar, so it would be in their interest as much as in the national interest that the importation of sugar should be reduced to a minimum. With regard to the figures which the Deputy mentioned, he left out one important item.  He referred to the cost of beet, the cost of wages and the capital charges of the company, but he left out the cost of making the beet into sugar which is a fairly substantial item.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparently a substantial item.  The Minister says that the company should not have a profit.  Why?  It is employed for a certain purpose&mdash;to keep the peace between the various sugar importers in the country and the people who purchase sugar from them.

To-night he told us that the factories are equal to the production of the requirements of the country. Will the Minister relate these two things for us?</P>

      <P>I mentioned yesterday that the sugar company in estimating last year the requirements of beet for the season were, in my opinion, unduly cautions.  They were afraid of having too much sugar.  As it turned out, the sugar content of the beet was, on the average of the whole lot, lower than in previous years, due to climatic and other reasons.  The result is that their production of sugar will be so much short of our requirements.  At the same time, the sugar company could not now establish the precedent of buying beet for which they had not contracted, because if they were to do that, similar beet would be grown next year and the following year, as the people would grow it in the hope that it would be bought from them. Although production was not up to requirements this year, nevertheless, they have refused to buy beet for which they had not contracted.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that the sugar company were in error in pointing out to certain growers that they did not require their beet.  I am not speaking of the contracts.  They were in error in thinking that the amount of beet produced would be more than sufficient for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Error is perhaps the wrong word, because information as to the actual requirements of sugar could not be ascertained precisely.  In fact, the requirements of sugar are increasing because, of course, commodities in which sugar is used as a raw material are being manufactured here now, where formerly they were imported with the sugar in them.  It is only now that we are getting really precise information as to the exact extent of the market.  Furthermore, the sugar company could not tell in advance what the sugar content of the beet would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I am afraid that there is another cause for the increased sugar market, and that <Col N="2195" /> is the sweetening qualities of the home-produced sugar.  I am afraid it has not the same sweetening quality as the other sugar.  However, the sugar company were not correct in their estimation of the amount of beet required for sugar.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister and Deputy Corry endeavoured to make political capital out of it.  I think that ought not to be done. <Col N="2196" /> We could have done with more been than was grown, because we are still short of sugar.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The sugar company also started to make cube-sugar for the first time this year, which absorbed a certain proportion of the beet.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 9 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) The following provisions shall have effect by way of qualification of the provisions of the foregoing sub-section of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the year in which any such bag as is mentioned in the said sub-section was packed is clearly stated on a seal securing the mouth of such bag, the statement required by the said sub-section to be on such bag of the year in which such bag was packed may be in the form of a statement to the effect that such bag was packed in the year stated on such seal;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  different particulars and different things may be prescribed for the purposes of the said sub-section <Col N="2198" /> in respect of different classes (defined by reference to such matters (including the retail price) as the Minister shall think proper) of containers or of bags.</P>
    <P>This amendment was withdrawn by me last night in order to consider the matter further and, on consideration, and after consultation with the legal people, I find that it will be impossible to alter this amendment in any way without making rather drastic alternations in the Bill.  It is really a matter either of accepting the amendment as it is or rejecting it. (a) and (b) in this amendment deal with two different matters, as I explained yesterday. (a) deals with the dating on the bags or packages up to 7 lbs. weight, and it is provided in this amendment that the date may be put on a seal instead of on the bag itself. (b) however deals with a different matter.  It provides that different particulars may be prescribed for different classes.  In discussing this matter last night I said that the object of the amendment was to enable packers to distribute those small sealed packets without putting on their names.  It does, of course, apply to other things also.  Regulations might be prescribed with regard to the name of the trader, the place in which the seed is packed and the nature and variety of the seed&mdash;all those different matters as set out in Section 9 of the Bill.  I think on the whole I would be inclined strongly to recommend to the House that (b) should be accepted, because it is quite possible that it may be necessary to prescribe different regulations for those small packages than will be prescribed for the larger packages containing anything from 2 to 7 lbs.  Of course, even when this is passed, there will still be power in the Bill to compel packers of those small packets to put on the name. If at any time there is abuse, or if the business is not being done in a proper way, the name can be prescribed. I think that a good case can be made for allowing (b) to stand.</P>
    <P>With regard to (a) on the other hand, the only possible argument that can be used in its favour is the economy to the wholesale seed <Col N="2199" /> merchants.  That was mentioned here yesterday.  They send out quite a number of those bags with seeds in them, and a fair number are returned by the retail seed merchants throughout the country.  If the date is to be stamped on the bags the bags will be useless.  On the other hand, if the date is put on the seals, the bags can be used again.  I think that, for the farmers who are buying the seeds, there is sufficient protection in the fact that the date is stated on the seal. The amendment says: &ldquo;Clearly stated on a seal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that any farmer who is in the slightest way anxious about the date will have no great difficulty in making out the year from the seal.  I would, therefore, recommend that the House should accept both (a) and (b).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is really any justification for the Minister feeling so delicate about putting the date on the bags.  After all I am sure the Minister would not place very great value on those seed bags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless there is a very big number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The value would be very small indeed.  Even if they had to pay 1d. per lb. extra, or even 2d., or 6d. per lb. extra, it would be much better for the people who buy seeds to be sure of getting good seed rather than be compelled to sow seed that would not germinate.  I do not think that the Minister ought to go so far to facilitate the trade because of those few bags that would be returned and that would then be useless.  I think, after all, that the interest of the farmers and those who buy and sow seed generally is paramount.  I think they ought to be protected.  If we are not going seriously to protect them we should not provide a machine at all.  We should either provide an effective machine or none at all.  Consequently, I certainly would vigorously oppose putting the date upon a tag or label tied to the mouth of the bag.  It is no safeguard, to my mind; it is just <Col N="2200" /> a certain type of indication which can be altered, and which has been altered to suit the requirements of the seedsmen.</P>
      <P>With regard to (b), again I do not think the Minister has made any case for its acceptance.  The same arguments hold as held yesterday, and I think they were overwhelmingly in favour of not inserting that particular amendment.  There is no reason in the world why any reputable seed firm should be either afraid or ashamed to put its name on the packets, no matter how small they are.  As was pointed out from these benches yesterday&mdash;and I think the Minister entirely agreed&mdash; those small packages are bought by the smaller people, by the people whom I think everybody is anxious should grow vegetables and seeds of various kinds, and who have to be educated in the growth of those particular seeds.  If you endeavour to educate them to grow seeds and vegetables, and if in the beginning they once get &ldquo;had&rdquo; with bad seed, their education is finished.  I think that when we are providing a machine at all it ought to be an efficient one.  Let us see that, even if the seeds are to cost more, the people who buy them are protected. The only way that can be done is by having the date on the bag and not on a tag or a label.  I do not think the Minister has made a case for the acceptance of either (a) or (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the packing of those seeds, I am afraid the Minister is not going to achieve his object merely by packing the seeds and putting the date on.  Supposing I have a bag of turnip seeds or mangold seeds which have been three years in my possession, and I repack them.  The very fact of putting the date on them makes them comply with the Minister's law, but is no guarantee to the farmer that the seeds are correct.  Would it be possible for the Minister in any way to protect the farmer to the extent of having some definition or statement on the bag in regard to the year in which the seeds were sown?  The Minister will immediately see the difficulty on this point.  He wants to put the date on the seal.  Suppose a farmer buys, <Col N="2201" /> say, a 7-lb. packet of turnip seed marked &ldquo;April, 1936.&rdquo;  I may have taken that small packet and repacked it from a large quantity of seed which had been left on my hands for a couple of years, and still I would be complying with the Minister's law. The farmer would believe it to be fresh seed, and at the same time he would be &ldquo;done in the eye.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That brings me back to a point which we will have to discuss later on as to the reliability of the seed merchant.  I am afraid that, although this Bill is a very laudable one and seeks to achieve a very good purpose in regard to protecting farmers in the matter of seeds, the Minister will have to go further and look for some more credibility from the seed merchants. Those licences should be issued only to creditable people, and people who have some knowledge of the seed business. The whole trouble with regard to the seed business in this country is that it has developed into a crossroads trade.  Everybody selling boot laces or a penny catechism sells agricultural seeds too.  That is wrong. We are developing and improving agriculture, and I think the Minister ought to see that the seed trade is retained and will be retained by the most reliable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make perhaps a slightly different point from those made by the two previous speakers.  I did not see this Bill until yesterday, and it may be that there are some other answers than what the Minister gave yesterday.  I gathered that the Minister made reply, in the following form, to the contention which Deputy O'Neill has put up to-day.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are asking to have only the year of the packing of the seed put on the bag, because the seeds will be tested for germination value and other things.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a gap in the Minister's argument and he should fill that gap.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;we have power to prevent seeds that do not come up to a certain standard being packed,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>but if there is no such thing in the <Col N="2202" /> Bill what Deputy O'Neill says is quite correct, a man can fulfil the Act if he puts the year on the bag.  He complies with the requirements.  Deputy O'Neill and other Deputies seem to think that the date showing when the seed was gathered is the proper thing but I understand the Minister has said that once you controlled the date on the bag you controlled the supply of good seed.  That may or may not be the case.  The thing I am anxious about is this&mdash;why complicate this machinery?  The Bill starts off with a clear-cut plan&mdash;every bag must have on it a variety of slogans, one being the date.  That is stated in the Bill. Then we have an amendment which says that instead of the date being on the bag you can put the date on the seal on the bag and have a note added: &ldquo;See seal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last night did he not think when this amendment was embodied in the Bill that the procedure would be that nobody would put the date on the bag for if you put your date on the bag you would ruin its use outside the year for which it was dated. It would be better therefore to print on the bag &ldquo;See seal&rdquo; or &ldquo;See the date on the seal.&rdquo;  I think this is a complicated section.  First you enact that the date must be put on the bag, and then you have an amendment saying that one need not bother about putting the date on the bag.  The thing seems to be peculiarly complicated. It looks very much like paying the land annuities through a tax on the cattle instead of directly if I may use an opposite illustration.  I ask the Minister to make up his mind what really is the procedure to be adopted. He cannot leave it as it is&mdash;providing that the date is to be on the bag and then amending that by a clause which does not insist on putting the date on the bag.</P>
    <P>Why not amend it simply by saying that there shall be on each bag a clearly printed reference to the seed like you have in the case of a railway ticket which says &ldquo;see conditions at back?&rdquo; And the conditions are generally in a Bill which is referred to on the back of the railway ticket.  But we will be getting back to that kind of <Col N="2203" /> legislation which does not lead to giving satisfaction to the travellers. Apart from the merits of this Bill there was a matter which Deputy Dillon discussed last night in a way that I thought convinced the Minister.  I want first to ask a question on a point of detail.  We are told in (b) that different particulars and different things may be prescribed.  I may take it that they are limited from stating particulars which are stated in Section 9 (1). The Minister cannot go outside the particulars to which he is limited in Section 9.  Is that the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then amendment (b) only means that amongst the particulars which may be prescribed by the last four or five lines of 9, (1) that certain things may be prescribed in respect of different classes of containers or bags.  But is there any possibility that in that phrase the Minister is taking power to prescribe entirely different particulars altogether? If the latter would be the case, it is an amazingly wide enlargement of what was already before the House and would mean, Sir, under your ruling of yesterday, something in addition to the principle that was discussed under this measure and would be out of order now.  The merits of (b) were discussed here last night.  I came new to this last night and I may not have understood the Minister's phrase correctly.  The reason he gave for the phrase struck me as peculiar. He said the difficulty was that reputable firms would not sell these small packages and put their names on them, and if we did not allow the Minister to sanction the removal of some of these particulars then, presumably, disreputable firms would apparently put their names on.  If he is not going to relax, disreputable firms only would put their names on.  When the Minister says that, he means, I take it, that the particulars prescribed would not be fulfilled.  He is going to meet that serious difficulty by saying: &ldquo;I am likely to take away the requirements with regard to all the particulars from the firms.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon <Col N="2204" /> countered the argument by saying that the man who made his purchases through the medium of these small packages should be protected as well as the larger purchasers and that there was as great a necessity in the matter of the small packages as in the large. The Minister did not do anything to counter the arguments advanced by Deputy Dillon.  Apparently he was convinced that these arguments were very cogent.  We should have some statement now as to how he proposes to meet the disreputable firms.  I am surprised that the Minister did not insist on these particulars being printed bilingually on the bag.  We should be allowed to get the labels on our seeds mixed as well as the brains of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point is, apparently, to safeguard the farmers in the getting of good seed.  I will admit at once that it would be very hard to devise any regulations to prevent a trader being dishonest.  The dishonest man can get around most regulations. But the great majority of traders are not dishonest.  The man who makes up the seed should have his name on the back of the bag.  That would be the greatest safeguard that the farmer could have when buying the seed in large or small quantities, because then he would have the guarantee of a reputable seed merchant. Seed merchants are extremely keen about their reputations.  If there is any substitution of their seeds by any country seller they would take jolly good care, if complaints are made to them, that they would look into the matter and have the man who acts dishonestly brought to court for his offence.  We have seen cases of the kind throughout the country.  There cannot be any apparent difficulty in the case of a seed merchant putting his name on small packages as well as on the larger ones.  I remember some years ago there used to be a reputable firm of seed merchants in another country who were doing a very large trade in this country in 1d., 1½d. and 2d. packages of seeds.  It was largely because of the reputation of that firm, the fact that their name was on the bags <Col N="2205" /> and that the people knew where to go if they had a grievance that that firm enjoyed a special sale for their products in this country.  That is the most vital section in the Bill.  It is a straight way of safeguarding the grower, if safeguards be of any use to him, to insist that the name of the wholesaler who supplies or mixes the seed should be on every package, large or small.  These people are very careful of their own reputation and their anxiety to preserve their reputation will, in the end, be the greatest safeguard for the farming community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan said that even if farmers had to pay a little more on account of the bags being unusable in the second year, it would be better, on the whole, that they should do so.  Deputies should realise that they will have to pay more.  We all know that if a wholesale seed merchant suffers a loss he is not going to meet it himself.  He will pass it on by way of an increase in the price of the seeds.  I do not think that any Deputy with experience of this matter can claim that there was any abuse in that particular trade&mdash;the selling of turnip and mangold seed in sealed packets with the date on the seal at the mouth of the packet.  I have never heard a complaint from any farmer as regards that particular line of trade. Where a trade has been carried on successfully and satisfactorily for many years I do not see any great necessity for changing it.</P>

Another Deputy said that no reputable firm had refused to put its name on the packets.  Reputable firms have refused.  The most reputable firms in Dublin are packing and sending out to hucksters' shops small packages without their names.  They will refuse to put on their names because they cannot guarantee that the hucksters' shops will dispose of them in the time provided.  They have refused.  If they have refused, we are entitled to take it that they may refuse again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid of their getting it; they are not afraid.  These firms have a reputation to maintain. If we compel them to put their names on these packages, and if they send these small packages to hucksters over whom they have no control, they may keep the seed in a place where it will get overheated, or in a damp place, or they may keep it too long. If the seed, in these circumstances, fail, these firms do not want to suffer in reputation.  They want to have control over the seeds or they will not <Col N="2207" /> stay in the business.  If we compel them to put their names on the packages, it is likely that less reputable people will go into the business.  As regards the date, what I said last night was that the date is useful in this way: if a person is brought into court for having seeds not up to standard, and if he puts forward a defence that the seeds were bought from a particular wholesaler, the date being on the packet for that particular year, the wholesaler will obviously be liable. If there is no date, the wholesaler can make the defence that he sent out the seed two or three years ago and that it remained with the trader.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy was buying a small packet of parsnip seeds he would not, when he brought them home, put them on the hob where they might get overheated or leave them outside where they might get damp. He would keep them carefully until they were sown.  The year in which the seeds are grown is a different matter.  Beet seeds and mangold seeds are very often kept for two years and they are quite as good then for sowing as they were the first year.  The date of packing is the important thing, because if our inspector goes into a store, takes a sample and finds that it is up to the proper germination standard, he gives a certificate for that particular lot of seed.  The seed merchant has in respect of every packet of that seed sold in that particular year, if an action be taken against them, the defence that he has not been at fault.</P>

      <P>It is the date he packed in the particular year, at any rate. Deputy McGilligan raised what is more or less a drafting point when he said that he thought this amendment was prepared in a slovenly way.  Why not prescribe, he asked, that the date should be on the seal of all packages. The reason is that you do not have these metal seals on other containers. On paper packages you would not have the metal seal.  Therefore, the date must be put on the bag or container. It is necessary to have that distinction. The different particulars that may be prescribed relate to matters which are referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 9&mdash;the name of the firm, the place at which the seeds are packed and the nature and variety of the seeds.  Apart from the point of compelling these firms to put their names on the small packages, we may have to make a distinction in other ways.  In the case of mangold seeds, which are put up in fairly large packages, it may be necessary to compel the sellers to give particulars about all these matters&mdash; the name of the firm, the place where packed and the variety and nature of the seed.  But when you come to the small packages you may not have room to have all these things put in.  We may have to cut down the number of them but we may insist upon the name. Apart from that altogether, even if I was convinced that the name should go on, I think this amendment is necessary to give some freedom of action to those dealing with regulations and dealing with seeds generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured that it is all right.  It follows the usual lines of legislation of that kind.  The <Col N="2210" /> words: &ldquo;As prescribed or to be prescribed&rdquo; occur through the Bill in other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives power to prescribe by regulation, and powers are regularly taken in the Bill to prescribe. There is power to prescribe in Section 2 in regard to seeds.  In Section 14 the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in the Act.  But there is Section 8 which states that:</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to sell or offer or expose for sale any agricultural seed which contains more than the prescribed percentage of the seeds of any prescribed injurious weed.</P>
      <P>That seems to demand a clause similar to clause 2 giving the Minister power to prescribe certain weeds as injurious weeds.  If there was a second clause 2 to run in harness with that it would give the Minister power to do what he proposes to do in the way of prescribing in respect of injurious weeds. But he has nowhere taken that power. Deputy Dillon suggested that the Bill would require either an enlargement of Section 2, or a Section 3 following Section 2 saying that the Minister shall prescribe a class of weeds which shall be injurious weeds for the purposes of the Act, and which would prescribe what would be injurious weeds for the purposes of the Act. That is not there.  The Minister quite correctly says Section 14 is a corollary to Section 2, but it is not in the double harness with which it should run, and there is something forgotten in Section 8 about the powers of the Minister to prescribe weeds that are injurious weeds.</P>

      <P>Whenever the Minister is of opinion that permitting the growth of any particular class of plants in any particular area to continue to the stage of normal inflorescence would be likely to interfere with the production in that area of pure strains of agricultural seeds the Minister may by order prohibit, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that on Second Reading.  The point raised by Deputy McGilligan would, I think, lead us much further.  There are a number of things which we must prescribe, for instance, under the variety of circumstances in Section 9, and, also, the places where seeds are packed.  I do not want to follow Deputy McGilligan into the legal argument, but it appears to me that I would have to add a fourth section to meet his point.</P>

      <P>The whole Act in every section applies, but it is only for one particular purpose that we prescribe injurious seeds amongst a particular class of seeds.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister casts his mind back to the Cereals Acts that were passed he will find that he took power to prescribe in different sections a variety of things, and having done that he had an omnibus clause by which he could make regulations. That applied to about five sections.  The Minister says that Section 14 enables him to prescribe injurious weeds, and that ought to be sufficient.  Why he puts in a clause enabling him to prescribe seeds and does not put in one enabling him to prescribe injurious weeds I do not know.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister to reconsider the question of increasing the valuation limit from £25 to £30 or to £35.  Where the land Commission are giving parcels of land to small holders, sometimes woodland or land on which the valuation <Col N="2214" /> is very high is given, and that puts small holders outside the scope of the Bill as far as grants for the reconstruction of their homes are concerned.  The same applies to other cases where small additions have been made to holdings or to the original farm.  A number of estates have been divided in the midlands and as this difficulty has arisen I am asking the Minister to reconsider the question because it is not possible for a private Deputy to move when money is involved.  The expenditure necessary would not be very large but the concession would be of great benefit to many families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the suggestion of Deputy MacEoin, that the valuation in respect to reconstruction grants should be increased to £35. When the Housing Act was going through the Dáil originally, many Deputies who felt strongly on this question, intended recommending that the valuation limit should be increased even beyond £35, but an extraordinary thing happened&mdash;I am sorry that we have not had more incidents of the same kind&mdash;as the Opposition and the Government decided to finish the Committee Stage at a certain hour.  Two or three of the amendments that were on the Order Paper took a good deal of time, although to my mind they were relatively unimportant, and only five minutes were left to conclude the Committee Stage.  Consequently the other amendment went by the board.  That was one instance where unanimity between the Opposition and the Government did not work out to the advantage of small farmers, who should be entitled to facilities in the way of reconstruction grants.  I ask the Minister sympathetically to consider Deputy MacEoin's suggestion for an extension of the valuation limit.  I know several cases where most deserving people, some of them badly off, who should certainly be entitled to consideration, have been unable to get grants for the reconstruction of their homes.  As people with holdings where the valuations are between £25 and £30 are often unable to incur the necessary financial expenditure, it would be most helpful to them if they could get <Col N="2215" /> grants to make their home habitable. The advisability of increasing the valuation limit at least to £35 is obvious.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Gibbons in their request to the Minister.  I suppose the Minister will tell us that financial considerations have to be thought of.  If public funds do not permit of these grants being given to the class mentioned, I suggest that there should be a sliding scale.  I know cases of great hardship where the valuations are £25 10s. and where the people are in poor circumstances.  On the other hand, I know other cases where the valuations are £20, where there is a considerable income, and where the grants were given.  I suggest that there might be a sliding scale, and that a grant of £40 be given where the valuation is £20; £30 where the valuation is £30, and £20 where the valuation is £40.  That would prevent cases of hardship.  Money given in that way would be well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might favourably consider the suggestion that has been made, particularly, when we hear that some of these people are badly off.  In certain parts of the country this would be a great advantage.  I am glad that Deputy Victory has suggested a practical way in which this might be considered by the Minister.  If there is an objection to the higher valuations, a sliding scale system would be very good.  There is no use in having a fixed limit because it has worked out very badly in the past.  You may have a case in which a person with a farm of £20 valuation is very well off, whereas a person owning a farm of a higher valuation is in poor circumstances owing to matters over which he has no control.  The whole House being so obsessed with the necessity of giving this matter attention, I hope the Minister will accede to the wishes so unanimously expressed by Deputies.  These reconstruction schemes are amongst the best features of housing activities.  Very good work is being done, and the money granted in these cases is being spent <Col N="2216" /> in a manner that is not alone a benefit to the people concerned, but is a help to the whole countryside.  One can see from the face of the country that the grants have redounded to the general good.  Representing as I do a very poor portion of the community where these reconstruction grants would be of great advantage to the people, I hope that the Minister will see his way to fall in with the wishes expressed by Deputy MacEoin, who was so ably supported by Deputies on the other side of the House.</P>

If a concession is now made to people who have not yet proceeded with these reconstruction schemes, I think the people who took the initiative themselves and spent their own money, should participate in any benefit which may accrue.  I know of cases myself where men took the bit in their teeth, when they were refused the grant, and went on with the work themselves.  Such a man should not be penalised now because he has done the work.  I think in any case where an application has been received for a grant, where the application has been turned down because of the valuation of the applicant&mdash;in some cases they were only 10/- over the limit&mdash;and where the applicant subsequently proceeded with the work, he should now get the benefit of any concession that is made.  Perhaps he expended the money before he was finally refused the grant, in the hope that he would get it ultimately.  I think it would be a great hardship to such a man if his neighbour, who waited until he would get this advantage, should now get the grant while he is deprived of the grant by the fact that he went ahead with the work.  The Minister should reconsider all these cases.</P>

      <P>I am in entire sympathy with the appeal made by Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies.  There <Col N="2217" /> was another matter raised on a previous occasion, the question of floor space.  I do not think, if that condition were abolished that it would entail any further expenditure as was the case made on Second Reading.  It was said that this regulation was being evaded by people and that they were availing of the grants.  The floor space was so circumscribed that a type of house which was an eyesore was being erected, a house which would not otherwise be erected.  I think the Minister will agree that any person who wanted to avail of the grants did avail of them by building a type of house that conformed to the circumscribed floor space laid down, afterwards adding to the house when he had received the grants.  That regulation did not save the Exchequer anything, while it gave us a type of house in the country which really ought not be allowed to be erected at all.</P>

      <P>It does not bode well.  I do not pretend to know as much about rural conditions as Deputy MacEoin and my colleagues on this side of the House, Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Victory, but it strikes me that the owner of a farm of £40 or £50 valuation would hardly like to be described as a poor man or as a small farmer.  I know very few of these men intimately, but I do know a few of them who have valuations ranging from £40 to £50, with farms of from 80 to 100 acres, good holdings, not in what are regarded as the poor counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  These people would not describe themselves as the poor type of farmer to whose assistance the State should be asked to come.  I do not know, if a scientific examination were made all over the country, how far one should go down in arriving at a limit where a farmer could be described as a poor farmer who was entitled to the aid of the State in building or reconstructing his house, but I would suggest that a valuation of £25 is a reasonable limit.  I have heard of cases of persons, and I have had applications before me from persons, who regarded themselves at any rate as poor or as having poor holdings, the valuations of which were slightly over the maximum limit of £25. Of course, they were ruled out.  We cannot consider the case of an individual farmer whose valuation is over £25.  That is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fact bearing on these cases is that a very small percentage of the total applications for reconstruction grants came from people whose valuations are between £20 and £25.  Taking some counties as examples of the whole country, there are not 5 per cent. of the total applications from farmers with valuations between £20 and £25. If Deputies say so, I certainly accept their word that there are some hard cases here and there where there are people on individual holdings where the land is highly valued.  I have heard of some such cases in Roscommon, and Deputy Victory mentioned some in County Longford, while Deputy Gibbons mentioned others, but it is not easy to legislate for hard cases.  You have to legislate for the generality of the people.  I do not think that, so far at any rate, a case has been made out for increasing the limit of the valuations especially as we are spending so much money on housing.  We are spending an enormous amount of money.  This is the second time since the Act of 1932 was passed that I have had to come to the House to ask for an additional £700,000.  I must say that the House has granted it willingly, but it is a very big sum to ask for.  It is a very big slice of the taxpayers' money.  At any rate, until we have gone further, and have seen that all those with <Col N="2219" /> valuations under the present limit of £25 have been provided for, I do not think there is a strong case for raising the limit either to £30 or £35.  There will be hard cases, of course, but there would also be cases such as Deputy McMenamin spoke of where, if we were to change now and go back, the people who have already reconstructed their houses would say: &ldquo;Well, we have already reconstructed our houses, and why not pass along the grant to us?&rdquo; I think it is just as well to let such people know that they were not eligible when they reconstructed their houses, and that they are not likely to get any cash from the State for that reconstruction.  They were evidently well enough off to be able to reconstruct their houses without the Government's assistance.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Brennan said, there are difficulties from time to time with regard to floor space, but it is extraordinary the ingenuity that people can display in getting around rules and regulations.  Some have got around the rules and regulations by doing the reconstruction, if not exactly artistically, at any rate sufficiently to satisfy the law, and, so far as I know or can ascertain, the question of the floor space has not proved to be an insurmountable object in stopping people from reconstructing their houses with the aid of a Government grant, and afterwards reconstructing their houses to suit themselves.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might say that in many counties the holder whose valuation has just now crossed the border line, so to speak, is in a number of cases a person to whose land an addition has just been made by the Land Commissioners.  I am giving that as just a sample case.  I am sure it will be admitted by everybody that the Minister is doing good work in connection with housing, and I suggest to him that this little bit more would be what I might call putting the coping-stone on the work he is doing.  I think that, considering the small sum that is involved, it would be well worth it.  It is not 5 per cent., but yet I suggest that not to deal with that 5 per cent., such as it is, would serve to take away from the good work the Minister is doing, and I respectfully suggest that he should reconsider making the valuation £35.  That is an increase of £10 in the valuation, but it would make all the difference in the world to the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to call the Minister's attention.  This question of valuation is rather a difficult one.  There is a great deal of discrepancy in the valuations of land in different parts of the country.  Now, the necessity for dealing specially with this question of valuation has already been recognised by one Department of Government, and if the principle is recognised already by one Department of Government, I think it should also be recognised by another Department of Government.  The Minister is probably aware that the <Col N="2221" /> valuation of many holdings of land at the present time bears no relation to the actual value of these holdings. The Minister is probably aware that, along the seaboard especially , when the valuations were originally fixed, certain factors were taken into consideration in the fixing of these valuations and that these factors no longer exist.  It is an actual fact that, when the Land Commission are dividing land in these areas at the present time, they take no cognisance whatever of the existing valuations, because they recognise that the existing valuations are no index to the actual present value of these holdings.  If one Department of Government recognises that these people have a special claim in this question of land valuations, surely the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should also recognise that that type of tenant is deserving of special consideration from his Department when grants are being allocated either for the erection of new houses or the reconstruction of old houses.  That type of tenant is very common, especially along the seaboard, but the type is also common in many inland counties.  Various considerations weighed with Griffith and his assistants when fixing these valuations. It is outside the scope of this debate to go into these considerations now, but that circumstance is well recognised by anyone who is acquainted with that period.  I do think, however, that this class of tenant is deserving of special consideration from the Minister, and if it is not possible to make any provision for these people in the present Bill, at least I hope that the first opportunity will be availed of in order to make some provision for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, Yes.  We heard a great deal about that this afternoon. <Col N="2222" /> I put it to the Minister that the financial commitments involved in this will not be very great.  He has stated that about 5 per cent. of the applications that have come in for reconstruction grants were from farmers with holdings of between £20 and £25 valuation, and I am sure that the percentage will not be any higher if the valuation were between £25 and £35.  The Minister has said that, from interviews with Deputies and in other ways, he is aware of cases of hardship where the cases would be just over the border-line, and I believe that the Minister is sympathetically disposed towards favourable consideration of the representations that have been made to him. I know myself of what might be described as border-line cases&mdash;perhaps not very many of them, but I believe they are deserving of very special consideration.  These are people who are unable from their own resources to reconstruct their houses.  Deputy McMenamin made a point which rather confused the issue&mdash;something in the nature of a red herring&mdash;about people who had already reconstructed their houses.  Well, all I can say is that if they did so, they must have been in a position to do so, and consequently did not come within the ambit of the provision.  Therefore, we are not concerned with them.  There are a good many of the people between £25 and £35 valuation&mdash;and even the £40 mentioned by the Minister&mdash;who are in comfortable circumstances and in rather good holdings, and they do not require reconstruction grants; but we are concerned with the people who are really necessitous and who, as I said before, are amongst the most deserving sections of the community.  I believe that it would be good policy to help these people to make their homes habitable and decent and, as Deputy MacEoin said, by doing so, the Minister would be putting the cornerstone on what he has already done. I think he should give favourable consideration to this proposal.</P>

      <P>It is not very easy to follow this Bill, because it is largely a matter of reference, but it appears &mdash;I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;as if Section 10 of the 1932 Act is repealed.  All the provisions in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) are repealed, but apparently paragraph (h) is reinserted.  It appears that every person, other than those covered under paragraphs (a) and (h), is struck out from the provision granting exemption of rates or relief of rates.  If that is the case, a very large section of the community who are building houses or buying utility houses and various other classes are treated very harshly.  I should like to ask if that is correct, because paragraph (h) looks innocent enough until you refer to the Principal Act.  I should like to know if my assumption is correct, that large sections of the community who have put up or bought houses are going to have the concession which they got in respect of rates swept away. At the present time, the building of houses is not getting cheaper and these people are certainly entitled to the remissions which they formerly enjoyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The great hurry there was about the discussion on this Bill last night has somewhat abated, and we can take it rather more leisurely to-night, and can examine in detail this particularly scandalous transaction with better documentation as to exactly what did happen than was possible last night.  The section which it is proposed to amend by enlarging the date is a section which itself was an amendment of the earlier Act. That section in the 1933 Act allowed any person, or the duly authorised agent of any person who claims to be a subscriber to the External Loans (or either of them) at any time before, but not after the 31st day of August, 1934&mdash;that is now being changed to the 30th day of June, 1936&mdash;to apply in writing in the prescribed form and manner for the redemption of the amount of External Loans claimed to be due to such person.  It also provided that no person who has omitted to make an application for redemption shall be entitled to be repaid under the Act the amount of the External Loans due to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stop at that point to make this observation, that apparently a person who claims to be a subscriber, or a person who claims to be the duly authorised agent of a person claiming to be a subscriber, may put in a claim, but when we come to the payment section, we find that payment apparently is only to be made to such person, but not to a duly authorised agent.  That may be a slight handicap on the efforts to get this public money through to the <i>Irish Press</i>, because the President will have to take on himself the somewhat odious task of directing his Minister for Finance to pay him certain moneys, although he, the President, being entitled to claim as the duly authorised representative of a subscriber, is not, in fact, a subscriber and cannot claim to be such.  He will, possibly, however, swallow that as easily as he swallowed quite a number <Col N="2226" /> of other things, and give orders to have this money paid to himself for his paper.</P>
    <P>It is possible after better consideration of this matter to get the whole affair more in line.  What is it proposed to repay?  It is proposed to repay moneys that were subscribed by people on a certain guarantee.  The bond which will be repaid is headed &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&mdash;Bond Certificate.&rdquo; Then there are some dots and there follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, Eamon de Valera, President of the elected Government of the Republic of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Times have changed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;acting in the name of and by the authority of the elected representatives of the Irish nation, issue this certificate in acknowledgement of your subscription of............dollars to the First National Loan of the Republic of Ireland.  This certificate is not negotiable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That ought to be remembered&mdash;that it is not negotiable.  The people who floated this had the view that there should be no ugly trafficking in this money which people were asked to put up for the special purpose of the foundation of the Irish republic. &ldquo;This certificate is not negotiable, but is exchangeable&rdquo;&mdash;under very rigid circumstances as the bond itself sets out&mdash;&ldquo;if presented at the Treasury of the Republic of Ireland one month after the international recognition of the said republic for one dollar gold bond of the Republic of Ireland.  Said bond to bear interest at 5 per cent. per annum&rdquo;&mdash;this, of course, was clearly drawn by somebody who had a mathematical turn&mdash;&ldquo;from the first day of the seventh month after the freeing of the territory of the Republic of Ireland from Britain's military control and said bond to be redeemable at par within one year thereafter.&rdquo; What &ldquo;thereafter&rdquo; applies to I have not been able to find out.</P>
    <P>There is the bond with &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; on the heading.  The President described himself as the President of the elected Government of the Republic of Ireland.  The subscription is acknowledged as being a <Col N="2227" /> subscription paid &ldquo;to the First National Loan of the Republic of Ireland.&rdquo;  It is not negotiable, but it is exchangeable when presented at the Treasury of the Republic of Ireland a month after the international recognition of the republic.  It is to be exchanged for a dollar gold bond of the republic and is to bear interest after the lapse of the time I have mentioned, the time to date from &ldquo;the freeing of the territory of the Republic of Ireland from Britain's military control.&rdquo;  I emphasise that because the Minister for Defence last night seemed to forget that the republic had ever been mentioned, or that the determination of the event at which the payment was to take place was couched in terms of the republic.  He used a rather namby-pamby phrase for him, &ldquo;When the country was free.&rdquo;  It is an interesting commentary on his activities that he is proposing now to pay, his idea being that the payment should be made when the country is free.  Even by that rather roundabout route it is good to get that declaration of the Minister's mentality as regards the country at the moment. There was the situation&mdash;bonds floated in the name of the republic and to be paid, when the international recognition of the republic had taken place, in the currency of the said republic. They were apparently going to have dollars.  That was the idea then.</P>
    <P>The next step is, after the money is collected, an action is taken in the courts in America.  This matter was discussed at great length and I do not propose to go into it.  But the salient facts are that the man who is now President of this State engineered an action against the then Government of the country on the ground that that Government had no right to pay back any of those subscribers to this loan and were not entitled to get any of the money subscribed because they were not the inheritors of the second Dáil.  But the man who is now Vice-President was acting as envoy of the republic in America at that time. When that action, on the argument that the Government then existing was not the inheritor of the second <Col N="2228" /> Dáil, seemed to have taken a wrong turning, as undoubtedly it did, the man who is now President got Mr. Seán T O Ceallaigh, then envoy in America, to engineer a group of bondholders to take another action on a different line, with the result that, of course, another group of bondholders had to be engineered to go into the courts on a different line again, the result being that about £100,000 of the money was lost in legal activity.</P>
    <P>The man who is now President then travelled across to America.  In court he was cross-examined in a rather pungent way by Judge Peters as to the proof he had of the republic having functioned.  The President incidentally held firm and fast to the idea that the republic had been established and was functioning.  He was asked the question whether the republic had a postal service and other services of its own, and he said, &ldquo;No, we use the British.&rdquo; That was regarded as rather an evasion by the judge.  The judge told him twice that that was not the question he was asked; that he had given an answer to a different question.  The judge did not know President de Valera as we do or he would not have regarded that as surprising.  He did comment on it twice.  The judgment which was handed down declared that these moneys were to be repaid to the subscribers&mdash;the original people.</P>
    <P>Round about that time the man who is now President of the State was operating a sort of second Government inside the country, passing resolutions in which they, amongst other things, were condemning the Hierarchy and protesting to the Vatican against the Hierarchy not recognising a different Government from the lawfully constituted one as being the Government of the country.  In that mood and in that atmosphere the journey to America was made and this rubbishy argument put up as to the republic. But the judge wiped all this out and the subscribers were to get back their money and they were to get it back through the medium of the American courts.  A receiver was appointed, but he was in some difficulty, because £100,000 of the money was wasted in litigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> That was the situation when the President decided that another national aid was emerging.  It was no longer the freeing of the country from British military rule, or the declaring of a republic, but the founding of another Irish newspaper.  The President sent out a circular signed by the lawyer who fought the case unsuccessfully for him in the courts.  It was addressed to each subscriber and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear friend, the money which you gave in the years 1919 to 1921 to help the cause of Ireland is about to be given back to you.  You are probably one of those who gave your money at that time as a free gift, expecting no other return for it than the satisfaction of participating in a just cause and aiding the people of Ireland in a time of need.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These two opening sentences are to be noted&mdash;the money you gave previously will now be given back to you and you probably never expected to get it back.  The atmosphere of the two sentences is: &ldquo;Here is a windfall for you.  You subscribed and you never expected to get a cent of the money.  You are going to get some part of it.&rdquo;  There is a certain amount of emotional appeal in the first sentence. Then it continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel accordingly that when you read this leaflet you will be disposed to make the money available a second time, again in a good cause and for the benefit of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>Let us compare the position.  The bond issued was issued in the name of the Irish Republic.  It was headed &ldquo;Republic of Ireland.&rdquo;  It was expressed to be paid on presentation at the Treasury of the republic.  But it was certainly presented, not as being in the name of the head of a political Party&mdash;not a Party business, but a State business.  And the idea of State as opposed to Party is carried forward in the letter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel, accordingly, that when you read this leaflet you will be disposed to make the money available a second time, again in a good cause and for the benefit of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2230" /> Then there is a hurried insertion of a sentence, for fear people should think that the cause of Ireland was too much bound up with one individual:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While these funds are being solicited by way of donations, Mr. de Valera will, of course, not derive personally any monetary benefit from them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, clearly, the President is not going to make any money out of this.  It is the State; it is Ireland.  The cause of Ireland is again being pleaded and people are being asked to subscribe in defence of Ireland.  Then there is the following sentence about the President not getting any monetary profits:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He intends to make the necessary and proper arrangements to ensure that if any profits accrue from the enterprise, or if there should be any distribution of assets, such profits and the amount of any such distribution will be made available for the donors, according to their respective donations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, live horse and you will get grass, put in another form.  But there was a very definite promise contained later in a secondary leaflet that was sent out and that was, that if people subscribed to a certain amount, if their subscriptions were turned into the <i>Irish Press</i> for ten dollars, or more, they were going to be recorded, more or less, as shareholders; just what rank they were to occupy for the purpose of getting dividends or profits is not stated.  It was stated that if they did not subscribe to the extent of fairly large denominations, if they subscribed amounts such as ten dollars and were only amongst the smaller fry, they were going to get an immediate return; they were going to be put on the free list for the reception of copies of the weekly edition of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  That was a really good consideration! There has not yet been a weekly edition of the <i>Irish Press,</i> so that if the first phrase is &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass,&rdquo; the second was even a still greater extension by way of duplicity of that term, because it was simply to say: &ldquo;We will put your name on the list of free recipients of the <i>Irish Press</i> weekly edition.&rdquo;  I hope, for the sake of <Col N="2231" /> honesty, there was added afterwards: &ldquo;If and when the same is printed and published.&rdquo;  People who did subscribe in the smaller denominations, less than ten dollars, have honestly had that bargain abided by.  I am sure their names are on the free list for copies of the weekly edition of the <i>Irish Press.</i> It does not cost anybody anything and I am sure it is a pledge the President would be delighted to carry out.</P>
    <P>With that appeal to people to subscribe for the good of Ireland there went a boost of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The President was to found a national newspaper.  I believe I was wrong when I said last night that quotations were given from only two people in support of the view that there was a great necessity for a new newspaper in the country.  I understand, after refreshing my memory by reading the old debates, that there were three people.  There was, first of all, the Reverend Father Devane, whose permission does not appear to have been sought for the lifting of the quotation but who, at any rate, has made no objection.  Then there was Professor O'Rahilly, who stated afterwards that he had given no authorisation for the use of his name.  Thirdly, there was Professor Tierney, who vehemently objected to his name being associated with this.  Without any disrespect to the other two, I would suggest that the only useful name was Professor Tierney's.  I do not say it was useful because he stands higher, either as a scholar or in any other way than the other people; but he had this special value at that time, that he was a member of the then Government Party and, by introducing his name, colour could be and was given in America to the pretence that here was a paper, the desirability for which had been expressed by members both of the Government and of the Opposition. Professor Tierney's name was deliberately dragged in in order to give that colouring.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald reported here that when he was in America he found many people regretting they had turned over their subscriptions to the foundation of this <Col N="2232" /> paper because they had been deluded by the use of Professor Tierney's name. It was deliberately and cutely done. That was the situation at that point. Many subscribed for a national purpose following an appeal by a person who was a national leader and they were only to be paid back when the national objective had been achieved and when it was clearly ascertained that the objective had been achieved by the determination of two very specific events, the international recognition of a particular state of Government in the country and the clearing out of British military authority from the whole country.  I pass the judgment on it that that was not mere propaganda, although there was, undoubtedly, a propaganda atmosphere about it.  It was to indicate to people what was undoubtedly the intention at that time, and that was that this money was being collected for a definitely national purpose.  The man who went over did not go as the head of the Sinn Féin Party; he did not state himself to be such.  He represented, himself, as far as he could, the country, the nation, and the pledge to the people was &ldquo;that this money is going to be used only for national purposes and you will get your repayment when that national purpose is achieved and that national purpose is the foundation of a republic.&rdquo; Hence, these other terms, &ldquo;You will only get it on application to the republican treasury and you will be paid in republican currency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress all these things to show that the whole thing was clouded around. Perhaps that is a wrong phrase and I should have said that I stressed these things to show that the whole thing was inside the framework of nationality, the nation, and not any political Party in it.  The leader of the Government which is now paying out these moneys in a round-about way to a Party newspaper indicated how strongly he held that view when he opposed, in the courts, the repayment, because he said the time had not come, that the event which was to determine the repayment had not come about and, secondly, the people who proposed to seize the money and pay it out only for that purpose&mdash;there was <Col N="2233" /> going to be no handing over of it to Party organs in those days&mdash;were not entitled to get it because they were not the inheritors of the Dáil which represented the Republic.  Then there is the sudden twist shown in that letter, carefully hidden in that letter. Again the appeal is made: &ldquo;You will make this money available a second time in a good cause and for the benefit of Ireland.&rdquo;  I am just stopping at that as if there was nothing else done.  It is getting money by false pretences, getting money on that letter and applying it to a newspaper which is nothing else, and nobody is going to make any claim that it is anything else but a party organ.</P>
    <P>A Government representing a Party in this country may get such an idea of the importance of that Party, and of the Government that comes from it, as to think that anything they do is national.  But only the blindest, only the most intoxicated person&mdash;intoxicated by his own egotism&mdash;will claim that an organ which is purely and entirely a Party organ represents the nation; an organ that is founded for the advancement of a particular Party; an organ which has &ldquo;Party&rdquo; written all over it.  If anybody did not know its foundations, I suppose a perusal of its columns for a week would make it quite clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that a more partisan paper does not exist.  Being partisan, it is only carrying out the objective of its founders.  But it is put up to the people here &ldquo;Will you make the money available again in a good cause, and for the benefit of Ireland&rdquo;?  And there is an added duplicity; in order to make it appear that the organ is not a Party but a national one, you have the use of the names of the Rev. Fr. Devane, Professor O'Rahilly, and a member of the then Government Party, Professor Tierney.  I would still think it was a scandalous proceeding, but one could say at any rate that the scandalous proceeding was openly brought to the notice of the American people, and that they subscribed openly, if the phrase had been used &ldquo;we are going to found a Party organ; that Party organ is going to be controlled by the same Eamon de <Col N="2234" /> Valera who once was described as President of the Republic of Ireland, and who hopes to get a republic.&rdquo;  He would have been a wise man if he said that he had such a republic inside his hand but refused to grip it.  But that is another matter.  Suppose it had been said: &ldquo;This same person who once did come to you speaking as a national representative now comes to you speaking as a Party representative and wants you to give him over this money&rdquo;; if he had got it then, there could have been very little complaint. But the money is got there under the guise of a national subscription, a national purpose, a national objective. Again it goes right back to the earlier sentence, where &ldquo;there was no return expected, other than the satisfaction of participating in a just cause, and aiding the people of Ireland in a time of need.&rdquo;  That is a letter written by a very acute-minded lawyer, and obviously carefully drafted with the intention of getting money from people to help a Party organ under the guise of a national subscription. That is how the money was got.  Now the money has got to be repaid.  To whom?  The original idea was to repay it to the subscribers or, where a subscriber had died, to the legal personal representative.  When this clause that we are seeking to amend now was under discussion before it was sought to limit the people who might make application or might get payment, because a variety of people was covered.  We tried to cover, as coming under the word &ldquo;subscriber,&rdquo; a person lawfully claiming on the death of a subscriber as personal representative. That was the original, good idea.  It was also sought to cover &ldquo;one of the next-of-kin&rdquo;&mdash; another good idea &mdash; and &ldquo;a beneficiary under the will of a subscriber.&rdquo;  If a person died leaving by will those particular bonds to certain people, then those people should come in.  Then there was sought to add: &ldquo;or a bona fide purchaser for an amount of not less than 60 per cent. of the face value of the subscriber's subscription.&rdquo;  We are told that the <i>Irish Press</i> is doing magnificently.  It was rather more difficult to argue that in 1933, because the directors were a <Col N="2235" /> little bit new to the game then, and they published, with all the glaring defects that were revealed thereby, the balance sheet of the Company.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the 60 per cent.  We were told then that a subscription to the <i>Irish Press</i> was good value.  Was it worth 60 per cent. of the value of the bond?  Is a subscription to the <i>Irish Press</i> now worth 60 per cent. of the value of the bond? If so, the amendment we put in allowed the moneys assigned&mdash;even though they were assigned under a mistake, and I think got by false pretences&mdash;to remain.  One test action would have decided the question: Is what has been given&mdash;shares in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;equal to 60 per cent. of the value of the bond? Was the share of a person who subscribed a dollar to the <i>Irish Press</i> worth 60 cents?  Was a dollar subscription worth 60 cents when transmuted to an <i>Irish Press</i> share? That was the test.  The Government refused to accept that test.  It was clear in 1933 not merely that there were false pretences in the obtaining of these moneys, but also that no matter how obtained they could not stand that monetary test: was the consideration that has been given 6/10ths of the face value of the bond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was accused last night of having used harsh words about the activities which led to obtaining this money. Just think of what has gone to that point; an attempt to utilise a national subscription for the flotation of a Party newspaper; an attempt, by the use of the same name, to misrepresent a Party leader as a national leader. Nobody can contend that when that letter was sent out Deputy de Valera was anything but a Party leader. There was, thirdly, the use of three names in a circular that was sent out, and the deliberate use of one of them as a Deputy of the then Government in order to get the pretence that this was a desirable event in the minds of all Parties in the country.  There was that, as I say, obviously conscientious <Col N="2236" /> acceptance of the position that the money had not been properly obtained.  But leaving all that aside, the assignments had been got, and the Government were not even ready then to face the test.  In ladling out State money in so-called repayment of a debt due by the State, and in diverting portion of that to a Party organ, the Government could not stand the test as to whether they were giving those people value to the extent of 60 cents in the dollar.  We are asked now to extend the time to allow the Government to pay the people from whom those assignments had been got under false pretences, and in a way that could not stand the test even of the value of the consideration given. We are asked to extend the time by a further period.  I do not think that should be done.  The whole thing is scandalous from beginning to end.  It is a very unsavoury transaction.  The Act of 1933 is passed and we cannot do anything with it.  It has full force and effect, but its period is exhausted. We are asked now to drag this malodorous business a bit further.  I suppose if there is another bad spasm in the fortunes of the <i>Irish Press</i> there will be some further way of seeing that the pockets of some of those people can, and will be, searched to get some further moneys in this underhand way for Party purposes.  Other matters arise in this debate, but these are the salient points.  I think at this point we should stop.  The Act of 1933 ran its course and it gave to those who had been vigilant their time. They should have done this by the 31st August, 1934, and if they have lost the opportunity we will not give them a second chance.  We will give the original subscribers to the loan a chance for ten years.  Those people, at any rate, subscribed to what was the national cause then, but certainly there should be a limit of time on the activities of those who, because they have got possession of the purse strings of the nation, have found it easy, though it is demoralising, to pour out some of those moneys for the purpose of maintaining a hack organ, for it is certainly that.</P>

Deputy Dillon described it as &ldquo;a shady transaction,&rdquo; and Deputy Cosgrave said that &ldquo;it was not an honourable business.&rdquo;  Remember that these phrases were used about the business of a man who was elected by the Irish people here at one of the greatest periods in the country's history; that he is to-day the representative of the majority of the Irish people and, as I say, a man who is the greatest leader that Ireland ever produced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon said last night that the value of the bonds was <Col N="2238" /> in question, that the American subscribers, the bondholders, were asked to invest their bonds in the <i>Irish Press.</i> And we are now told that the value of the bonds was in question.  Deputy McGilligan relieved me of a good deal of responsibility, in replying to that accusation&mdash;an accusation which was based on these frightful statements I have quoted.  He did so by reading out to-night the letter that was circularised to the subscribers by the friends of Ireland in America.  From this circular Deputy McGilligan quoted the statement:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;the money you subscribe is now being returned to you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the money they subscribed was being returned to them, if it was on that representation that the bondholders were asked to invest in the <i>Irish Press</i> shares, can it be truthfully said that the value of the bonds was in question? There were two means by which an American could invest in shares in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  He could pay in dollars or he could pay in bonds.  Any business man will say that if I want to purchase anything in this country that it is perfectly legitimate for me, if the seller is agreeable, to pay either in pounds or in national bonds.  The people in America were told that the Irish people here&mdash;thousands of them, thousands of small workers, thousands of small farmers and business men &mdash; had invested in shares in the <i>Irish Press,</i> and people in America were asked to subscribe for a certain portion of the capital that was required.  They were given the alternative of buying these shares, cent for cent, and dollar for dollar for the worth of them, or paying for the shares in bonds.  Can it be said that a man doubted the value of the bond that he held, if he was given the option of paying for <i>Irish Press</i> shares in these bonds or in cash?  Was it not a clear indication to him that it was held by the people asking for them that the bonds were worth their value in United States currency, cent for cent and dollar for dollar?  Deputy McGilligan raised quite a lot of other interesting historical points.  I wish I had time to deal with them all, but I think it is rather outside the scope of this business.  There was one thing <Col N="2239" /> I was glad he stressed and that was that the American courts held that the Government which Cumann na nGaedheal set up here was not the legitimate successor to the first Dáil.</P>

      <P>That Government went over to the United States and they claimed that they were, but the United States courts turned them down ignominiously.  It held that they had no right to the money that was subscribed for the first Dáil.  Now, to Deputy McGilligan, this open and honourable transaction is &ldquo;a malodorous transaction.&rdquo;  Of course, unfortunately, I have no control over Deputy McGilligan's nostrils.  To the badger the sweetest smelling rose in the world just smells badger.  To a pig that has been wallowing in his own dirt the sweetest smelling rose in the world just smells pig manure and to Deputy McGilligan the most open, honourable transaction in the world just has the stench of the excretion of his own foul mind.  Deputy McGilligan and a few other Deputies on the opposite benches have been deliberately trying to make politics so dirty in this country that clean and honourable men will not take part in them.  I have watched the President on many occasions here being annoyed by these Deputies, and I have often had same feeling that I have often had when I saw a noble animal being annoyed by vermin.  There are two ways of dealing with vermin.  Unfortunately&mdash;or, perhaps, fortunately&mdash;one way that was common a few hundred years ago of dealing with persons like Deputy McGilligan has gone out of fashion, and all we can do is to rely on the electors to use Keating's Powder.  If the Irish people are going to stand for this sort of thing, if they are going to stand over representatives like Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon befouling and besmirching a man whose boots they are not fit to blacken, then God help this country in the future.  Are we ever going to get to the stage at which we can discuss a thing on its merits?  The people at the last general election got <Col N="2240" /> rid of a few foul-mouthed Deputies from this House and I hope to God that, at the next election, they will get rid of a few more.</P>

      <P>This section gives power to extend the time for repayment. There is no amendment to the section and I want any Deputy who proposes to vote for its rejection to realise what he is doing.  About 15,000 people &mdash;some of the finest people in the world &mdash;who subscribed to the first Dáil loan did not put in their applications for payment in the time provided in the Act of 1933.  There is no amendment to exclude bondholders to whom bonds were assigned, and the effect of the defeat of this section would be to prevent 15,000 people, scattered over the United States, who hold bonds of various values, being repaid.  It was promised by Michael Collins and everybody in charge in this country during the Black and Tan war and since that these bonds would be repaid.  We are bound in honour to repay them.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate for the people who are anti-national, who do not want to see a national paper, a paper that will give a fair crack of the whip to everybody, that a number of these bondholders exercised their right to give the value of their bonds to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It is unfortunate for people who have something to conceal from the Irish people, something of which they are ashamed, that the <i>Irish Press</i> exists to give the people the truth. Deputy Cosgrave would sleep a lot easier in his bed if the full facts regarding the Secret Agreement of 1923 could be kept from the Irish people.  What is hurting these people is that the <i>Irish Press</i> gives the truth without fear or favour.  It showed the Irish people within the past few months, in a controversy over the Secret Agreement, what a most frightful idiot the British made of Deputy Cosgrave in 1923.</P>

      <P>The Chair did wait because the Chair now says the remarks were not applied to any individual.  I would not ask the Chair to reprove the Minister for the use of such language.  The Minister moves easily in such language; his vocabulary is of that kind.  The Minister's mentality can only be expressed in language of that type.  The Minister speaks best of what he knows. I think I can leave it at that.  Now there is no doubt about it that the harangue we had from him is not argument.  A man who can get up and say that the <i>Irish Press</i> is the greatest newspaper the world has ever seen, can also, with the same reason, or absence of reason, say that President de Valera is the greatest leader this country or the world has ever seen.  I do not deny the Minister the right to pass both judgments: but it was unfortunate that he made both statements on the same night, and in the same speech.  They will appear together to-morrow, and there will be as much justification for the one as there is for the other.  I was accused of using strong language.  I did use the word &ldquo;malodorous.&rdquo;  I did not use the word &ldquo;stench.&rdquo;  I did say that it was an unsavoury transaction.  I did not say anything about pigs and manure.  I went so far as to say that this money was got by false pretences.  I did not need to call in greater or lesser vermin <Col N="2243" /> as an analogy.  These phrases are hurtful because they are true.  They are true as I demonstrated to-night. Let me summarise again why they are true.</P>
      <P>This claim was made by a man who went to America as an Irish leader. He put it in these terms.  He said &ldquo;you are again asked to make sacrifices for the good of Ireland.&rdquo;  And he tested that by trying to fight in court, and get a declaration that the government that wanted these moneys to be paid to the subscribers should not get them because they were not representative of the first Dáil.  And a republican Minister gloats over the misrepresentation that the Government lost that case.  I wonder who lost that case?  Does the Minister remember the finding in that case?  It was that the so-called Irish Republic never existed.  Is that ignominy for Deputy Cosgrave and no ignominy for President de Valera?  Did President de Valera not get a judge in America to declare that the so-called Republic in Ireland never existed?  Who was under ignominy by that judgment? Was it the people who were running the Government here established by the Treaty or the people who met in a back-room, pretending still, in the face of that constitutional event, to be the Republican Government and who then went to America and got an American judge to say there was no Republic in Ireland; in fact that it never existed, and that it was merely so-called?  The Minister for Defence thinks it politic to draw attention to that.  I wonder what kind of language any of the Minister's colleagues, with their minds trained to the use of metaphors founded on the same felicitous model, would apply to him.  I think it would be language, much more vehement than the language that was allowed to pass because it was thrown out generally, and not in reference to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this whole transaction was based on false pretences, because the statement was put up &ldquo;We want this money again for the national cause,&rdquo; and because it was induced by a circular to which was appended the name of three people one of whom was a member of the Government Party of <Col N="2244" /> that day.  That was false pretence. It was as false as anything could be to pretend to anybody that Professor Tierney was in favour of the <i>Irish Press;</i> but that was done and done deliberately.</P>

      <P>The President admitted that it might colour the minds of some people and that the argument put up might be taken to include all parties.  I say that was a false pretence.  Is there any other phrase to describe it?  Why did the greatest leader the country ever saw talking about the greatest newspaper in the world ask for funds in these terms?  Why did not the greatest newspaper the world ever saw, according to the Minister, say &ldquo;We will hand back the moneys, if the people who subscribed them did not know what they were doing at the moment&rdquo;?  Why did they not say: &ldquo;Instead of giving you a full share in the <i>Irish Press,</i> we will give you only a half share, and will ask you to put up the rest of the money again, because you find you are connected with this most magnificent enterprise, world wide in its reputation&rdquo;?  Why did they not say to the people who subscribed, or why did they not put in one advertisement in an American paper that would say to anyone whose eye chanced to light upon it, that if they wanted to ask back the bond assigned they could have it back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the case is so strong for the <i>Irish Press,</i> if it is to be established nationally, and if it is a notable success, money ought to be had for the asking, particularly for the asking from people who have already subscribed to a great national cause.  The question that must occur to everyone is, why is it to be regarded as offensive to ask that that should be done?  There is only one answer, and that is, because the people to whom <Col N="2245" /> the question is put, and to whom an appeal is being made to waive these assignments, know very well that the money could not be got on the representation that it was for the <i>Irish Press,</i> which is known to be what it is, a Party organ of very doubtful success.  I am very mild at that&mdash;I could say a notorious failure, and allude to the first balance sheet. Why is it regarded as harsh to say that the man who peddled round America and got these moneys on these sort of representations carried through an unsavoury transaction?  I ask one pertinent question, why is not the man who did that here to explain through this debate?  I could admire some things, not perhaps the same hero worship as Deputy Aiken, but I like to have information brought down to earth now and again.  This is the transaction that I am describing as false pretences, as unsavoury, as malodorous.  Why is he not here to defend it?  Why can he not tell us what he did?  He got the chance before, but nothing clear came from it in the way of explanation.  Have we had an explanation with a chance of coming down to details?  Why is it necessary to extend the date?  I heard that there were 15,000 subscribers who were too late in claiming.  Could we have that settled in two categories? How many of the original subscribers are there, and how many of the claims are by people who are agents of people claiming, but who were not original subscribers?  Could we be told how many of the 15,000 late subscribers are <i>Irish Press</i> applicants?  To get to the point, could we be told how many are outstanding still, and if they were not late in making a claim, was a claim made on their behalf?  I am going to ask the House to divide on this matter to stop this rot, and the very definite demoralisation there was, when this House could be used to get out of the moneys of the people a certain sum which was not to be repaid to the subscribers, in view of the circumstances and of very definite pledges, and to have it diverted to the coffers of a Party rag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has asked the House to divide on this <Col N="2246" /> question.  I only hope that Deputies realise that what he is endeavouring to do, by asking them to vote against this, is to prevent the people who subscribed to the first Dáil loan being repaid, or the present bondholders to whom the original subscribers assigned being repaid.  I hope the vote against such a proposition will be very small.  There has been talk about the repudiation of debts.  The phrase has been used here very often.  If we are going to be selective in the repudiation of debts, and if the Dáil is going to repudiate bonds held by individuals or organisations, just because some people here do not like them, it is a pretty bad principle of law.  If this Dáil can issue bonds as the first Dáil did, and if it is to be shown by any sort of vote to-night, that a certain number of Deputies hold that the Dáil can select the individuals who are to be repaid, and the individuals who are not to be repaid, I think it will be a pretty shaky business for State credit. People who are spiteful in regard to this matter should realise what they are doing.  Remember there is no amendment to the section which reads:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;(1) Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 1933 is hereby amended by the deletion of the figures and words &ldquo;31st day of August, 1934,&rdquo; now contained therein, and the substitution for the figures and words so deleted of the figures and words &ldquo;30th day of June, 1936,&rdquo; and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing about division there.  Even if a few members of the Dáil thought it right that this State should take up the attitude that it would repay the debts due to some individuals, and refuse to pay other individuals, there is no amendment setting out who shall be paid and who shall not be paid.  There is no amendment suggesting that the date shall not be extended in respect to those who hold bonds which were assigned to them.  By voting against this section Deputies are voting against an extension of time to all bond holders and original subscribers to the loan.  I think the transaction that we are asking <Col N="2247" /> the Dáil to ratify is perfectly honourable and straightforward.  The course we are taking was promised by Michael Collins; it was promised by Deputy Cosgrave when he was President; it was promised by Deputy Blythe when he was Minister for Finance, and it is being carried out by us.  I say deliberately that if any man thinks such a transaction malodorous, shady or ugly trafficking, he should look within himself to see what has caused such a transaction so to seem to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point clear.  I put down an amendment to the first section to give the word &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; the meaning it had in the 1924 Act, but unfortunately it could not be decided upon, although it was debated.  I intended this Bill to give effect in relation to the original subscribers.  That was not allowed, and I am going to divide against anything being paid to other than the original subscribers.  There is no necessity to go over the errors, but briefly Michael Collins never promised to pay except to the subscribers and neither did Deputy Cosgrave. Nobody ever decided to repay to the <i>Irish Press</i> except this present Government.</P>

I cannot help thinking, sitting here, that when scarcely a month ago President de Valera lost his son, the sympathy of nearly the whole world went out to him.  Practically the head of every Government expressed their deep sympathy with him.  It was an extraordinary manifestation of the place that President de Valera holds in the hearts of the world. What do we see here?  Two hours last night, and a lot of time to-night, were taken up by a man who is professor in the University, who should show here an example to the young men and women who may come under his tutelage.  He tries to hold the President up to the scorn of the <Col N="2249" /> world by endeavouring to make him out here, with all his language, as a liar and a thief.  I would not be doing my duty here if I did not make a protest.  I think we must make a protest against that.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 40, to delete the word &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;each subscriber&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments have a very limited objective, and that is to make it clear just where the money has gone, so that the people will know afterwards how many of the original subscribers got repayment and what proportion of the bond money went to the <i>Irish Press</i> and to the Chinese Mission, if you must have it.  The object is simply to make as part of the audit that there shall be a distinction as to the categories of people.  I think it is quite a useful suggestion.  It is not going to prevent the money going, but it will be an indication of where the money has gone.</P>

The Comptroller and Auditor-General is not bound to divide them into classes or categories.  I think that this Dáil should say to the Comptroller and Auditor-General that, when making a return, he should indicate how far the subscriber or his legal representatives got this money.

If proper returns are made, the returned and cancelled cheques and so on issued to the bondholders will be open to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for examination, and the section as it stands empowers him to seek for those documents, together with all other relevant documents, and in the ordinary course of events he will get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that the Minister may be in a position to deal with the situation, I intend to give him the facts as they have been given to me by a member of the council.  The facts are that, at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the County Council of Tipperary (North Riding) held in the Courthouse, Nenagh, on Thursday, 6th February, 1936, an inspector from the Department of Agriculture attended in connection with the adoption by the council of the Warble Fly (Treatment of Cattle) Order, 1936.  A vote was taken by the committee and the majority voted for the adoption of the Order.  Is this a question which should or could be decided by a committee of the council? By circular letter dated 13th February, 1936, from the secretary of the council, all members were notified to attend the quarterly meeting of the council to be held on Wednesday, 19th February, 1936.  This letter included the agenda for the meeting and item seven read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To consider the adoption of the Warble Fly (Treatment of Cattle) Order, 1936, and, if adopted, to draw up a scheme, appoint six inspectors to administer the Order and to lay down the conditions of appointment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although the adoption of the Order was to be considered by the council of 19th February, an advertisement appeared in the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> on 15th February, inviting applications for posts of six temporary inspectors, signed by the council's secretary.  A very large number of applicants, over 200, made application and each was handed a copy of a leaflet headed: &ldquo;General Conditions and Duties of Inspectors&rdquo; to which was attached a schedule setting out the six areas into which the North Riding had been divided for administrative purposes under the Order.  The first condition on the leaflet read: &ldquo;The applicant must now be a resident of the district for which application is made&rdquo; and the third condition read: &ldquo;Age limits, 21 to 40 years on 19th February, 1936.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the quarterly meeting, without notice to members or applicants, ten inspectors were appointed in lieu of the <Col N="2256" /> six vacant posts advertised.  The district areas had been completely changed beforehand and the council members of one political Party came to the meeting with a schedule of the altered areas and the change from six to ten vacancies.  The other members of the council had no foreknowledge of these changes and when the appointments were made, these changes were challenged by members of the council who were overruled.  In making the ten appointments, the council appointed at least one applicant who was considerably over the age limit set out in condition three above quoted in the council's leaflet to applicants.  I am not going to ask the Minister whether he has power to sanction those proceedings or not.  I think it is a case rather for the application of sanctions in these circumstances, but if the Minister's Department is willing to stand over actions of that kind and over proceedings carried on in that manner, all I have to say is that the Department has altered very much during the last ten or 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this matter.  I happen to have some local knowledge and I can inform the Minister, in case he has not got the full report on the matter, that it is looked upon in Tipperary as a public scandal.  The position is as Deputy Bourke has described it. The council, at their meeting, decided to appoint six persons and to divide the county into six areas with an inspector for each area.  Certain other conditions were laid down and there was a definite age limit.  The secretary of the county council issued a notice in the local Press inviting applications for these six posts.  The applicants were to be between the ages of 21 and 40.  There were over 200 applications received.  When the full meeting of the council met to consider the matter, they were faced with a new proposal which came from members of one particular political Party, supporters of the Minister, changing the districts which had been fixed by the meeting of the council which decided to appoint the inspectors, and changing altogether the terms of the advertisement which had been issued, <Col N="2257" /> and in answer to which the applications had been received.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the applications before the council at their meeting on that date were applications received in response to an advertisement which asked for applications to fill six posts, laying down age limits, and so on.  Certain members of the council, without any notice, but in order to provide some extra soft jobs for their supporters at the expense of the ratepayers, altered the number of areas from six to ten, and the number of vacancies from six to ten, completely ignoring the age limitation set out in the advertisement. I suggest to the Minister that this was a grossly irregular proceeding and should not be countenanced by him or by his Department.  It was unfair to many people who perhaps would have applied if they knew (1) there were going to be ten posts; (2) the districts were to be altered in the way in which they were altered, because, in the original advertisement, one of the regulations laid down was that every person applying should be resident in the district for which he applied.  Any person who had intended applying for one of the positions, and who was over the age of 40 years did not apply, because 40 years was specified in the advertisement, but, as Deputy Bourke has said, in order to provide certain people with a number of these posts, when it came to the actual making of the appointments, they ignored completely the age qualifications.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that proceedings of that sort are not going to earn respect for public bodies, and particularly such an important body as a county council, and I suggest to the Minister with all respect that he has a definite duty in the matter to see that councils carry out their duties with due regard for the interests of the public and the interests of the ratepayers, and with due regard for the people who will have to pay the salaries of ten instead of six inspectors.  The Minister, I think, ought to have seen that the posts were readvertised, if the conditions were to be altered, because people were precluded from applying by the terms of the original advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> If the council decide to increase the number from six to ten and to waive certain conditions which were in the original advertisement, they were not empowered to make the appointments on that date, but should have readvertised under the new conditions and for the increased number of vacancies to give people an opportunity of applying for the positions, if they thought fit.  To put it in a nutshell, the whole thing was a slick move on the part of a political majority on the council. The Minister, who is charged with a certain responsibility in the matter as head of the Local Government Department, ought not allow any political Party&mdash;it does not matter which Party &mdash;to use their majority in that way and to abuse the responsibility placed on them by the electorate by doing business in that slick way for the purpose of finding additional jobs for their supporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not fully acquainted with the circumstances that Deputies Bourke and Morrissey have set out.  As a result of this question being put down, I made certain inquiries and I am told that the county council was informed officially that they were legally entitled to do what they did.  I do not see that I have any responsibility in this matter.  As these are purely temporary appointments for a very short period, county councils are not bound to seek the sanction of the Department for them.  If they had to seek sanction, I would have some opportunity to intervene, but as they are not obliged to ask for sanction the Minister has no power in the matter.  The proceedings may have been irregular and undignified, as Deputy Morrissey says.  I am not saying that they were, as I have not the full facts.  Even if they were, I suggest that the North Tipperary County Council is not the only council against whom the charge of want of dignity could be laid even in this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that.  I do not care which Party is responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am with the Deputy there.  There have been undignified <Col N="2259" /> proceedings in connection with similar appointments by county councils where the political majority is on the other side.  There is not much credit attaching to any of these bodies who have acted in that way, whatever their political complexion may be.  As Minister, I am without any power to intervene or even to attempt to correct the procedure in this matter.  These are temporary appointments under an Order made by the Minister for Agriculture and they do not come under my jurisdiction in any way.  If irregular methods and proceedings in this and similar matters were to be taken cognisance of by the Minister for Local Government he would be kept very busy dealing with all the county councils.  In this particular case there is no authority to intervene.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the regulations were made by the finance committee of the county council and it has been put to me that the county council, at their full meeting, had every right to alter the regulations made by the finance committee.  That may or may not be so.  As I say, I have not got full information on the matter.  I have applied for information and I am told that the county council were informed that they had legal power to do what they did and the Minister has no right to interfere with their action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no questioning of the right of the county council to make the appointments, but I suggest to the Minister that if a county council, over the name of their secretary, publish an advertisement for a given number of appointments, setting forth certain conditions, and then assemble to make the appointments arising out of that advertisement from applicants who have applied under the conditions set forth in that advertisement, that they are not justified in changing the terms of the advertisement and increasing the <Col N="2260" /> number of appointments to be made without any notice to anybody, but simply at the behest of a particular majority.  I do not care if it was a Fine Gael majority that did it, I would condemn it.  I say it is a scandal.</P>
      <P>I can quite understand that the Minister has not got as full information as he would like and, therefore, I do not want to press it unduly.  But I am not satisfied that the Minister has no function or duty in the matter.  I think he has.  I put it to the Minister that undoubtedly people were deprived of the right of applying for these positions because of certain conditions set out in the advertisement, which were afterwards wiped out by the county council, or by certain parties on the county council, without any notice.  It is news to me that the Minister has no authority or power to act in the matter.  It is one of those actions which do not bring any credit on public bodies or increase the respect for them.</P>
