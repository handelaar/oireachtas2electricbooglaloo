      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that there exists at present a profitable market for Irish matje herrings in Germany and if any steps are being taken to secure this market for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been aware of the possibilities of the German market for Irish cured herrings and have made representations to the German Government in this matter.  I regret to say that these representations have not been successful.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that no opportunity will be lost in pressing on the German Government our claim for a herrings quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, was any suggestion made to the German Government that we would be prepared to meet them even on more favourable terms than in years previously, provided that they expressed their willingness to take Irish cured herrings for their market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think representations were made in these terms, but representations were made when the recent agreement was being negotiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister try to see, hereafter, that in any arrangements that will be made efforts will be made to secure a place in the German market for our cured herrings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President see when arrangements are made on a preferential basis of one to two or one to three that they will contain an agreement in connection with our herring industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state when it is proposed to pay to Patrick O'Neill, Old Church, Enniscorthy, the compensation awarded at the Wexford Circuit Court, under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, over 12 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question by the Deputy on the 26th June, 1935, I indicated that certain information in regard to this case had come into the possession of my Department which had not been before the Circuit Judge at the hearing of the claim.  The case has since been the subject of close inquiry, but I am not yet in a position to indicate what payment can be authorised on foot of the recommendation of the Circuit Judge.  There will be no avoidable delay in disposing of the case.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance on Thursday night spent from 9.10 until 10.30 pretending that he was dealing with the general Budget resolution but, instead of that, as I said, he was dealing with the personal habits, appearances and antecedents of certain Deputies who spoke from this side of the House.  He particularly took up some of Deputy McGilligan's remarks on the income-tax.  The Minister made no attempt on that occasion to analyse the figures or statements made by Deputy McGilligan indicating that the condition of the country was such that the receipts from income-tax had fallen substantially, when we take into consideration the rise in the rate from 3/- to 4/6, compared with the yield from income-tax before the Fianna Fáil policy fell on this country.  The Minister, as I say, made no attempt to deal either with the figures or statements of Deputy McGilligan.  The Minister surely had an opportunity in moving this resolution of stating what the position is from his point of view and indicating clearly if the yield from income-tax is increasing, and if the yield that we are getting from income-tax shows that income-tax payers are able to bear the burden they are bearing at present.  The Minister suggested that the statements of Deputy McGilligan were injurious to the credit of the country.  He is the person on whom the safeguarding of the credit of the country primarily rests, more <Col N="756" /> particularly in respect of matters in respect of which he thinks the credit of the country is being injured.  In moving that this House should accept a rate of income-tax of 4/6 in the £, it is the duty of the Minister to deal in a systematic way with the statements that he has already referred to only in an oblique way and answered only by personal reflections on the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter upon which I should like to have some further information from the Minister than he saw fit to give to the House when speaking on Thursday night last, bearing in mind that a further opportunity will arise for discussing this question more fully on the Finance Bill which is coming along.  It escapes the memory of a good many people in this country that the fixing of the income-tax at the standard rate at present is not unconnected with the alteration of the basis of valuation which was made last year for the purpose of assessing income-tax on house property.  My information from a number of persons who are householders is that that tax is bearing very heavily upon them.  I heard that complaint from a number of persons of the class whom the Minister professes to be peculiarly solicitous about, that is, young married men with a growing family.  I would be interested to know from the Minister if any complaint of that character reached him, because, as I pointed out on more than one occasion, I believe that hypocrisy on a matter of this kind is peculiarly damaging to the State as a whole. It ill becomes the Minister to get up and profess his great solicitude for the young married men with a rising family, when he alters the incidence of the income-tax, at the same time that he is increasing the burden of income-tax upon these very people substantially by his alteration in the basis of valuation.  I feel that the five-fourths valuation provision is a great hardship.  I believe that the maintenance of the present standard rate of income-tax, bearing that in mind, is pressing very heavily on a considerable number of people who are ill able to afford it.  I cannot imagine <Col N="757" /> that representations have not reached the Minister in that regard and I would be glad to know if the Minister is prepared to extend his solicitude for the young married man from that class of person who has no income-tax to pay at all to the other type of person who is struggling to pay whatever assessment is proper, but who now finds, under this new arrangement, that a substantial addition has been made to the burden he is required to carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point to which I should like to call the attention of the Minister in the hope that between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill he might find it possible to look into the matter and to do something to remedy what I think would be regarded by most persons as a hardship in many respects and an unfair burden on a certain class of income-tax payers.  At the present time it is possible for an income-tax payer, whose child is receiving fulltime instruction in school, to claim the children's allowance until the child reaches 16 years of age.  It is possible to claim that children's allowance up to a much later stage if the child happens to be attending a University. But, it is not possible to claim an allowance of that kind in the case of a man who apprentices his son to a trade and is possibly required to pay a fee to secure that apprenticeship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child who goes to a trade is receiving education in the same sense as the child going to a school or to a University, except that the education, instead of being, perhaps, of a literary character, is of a vocational and technical character.  The person who apprentices his son or daughter to some trade should, I think, be entitled to claim in respect of that child the same allowances as can be claimed by that person if the child happens to go to a secondary school or a University.  Most of the income-tax payers who apprentice their children to trades may be said to be in the category of ordinary working-class folk.  A well-to-do person can send his child to a University and get an allowance because of that fact, or can send his child to a secondary school and get an allowance <Col N="758" /> because of that fact, but the working man in constant employment cannot afford to send his children to a University or some of the more costly secondary schools, and thinks he is doing better for the child by apprenticing that child to a trade.  He is not able to claim the same allowance that the more wealthy income-tax payer is entitled to claim in respect of his child.  As I said, it can be argued that both children are receiving education, although in a somewhat diverse direction, and I think a strong case can be made for regarding the workman whose child is apprenticed to a trade as eligible to receive the same kind of allowances as are paid to wealthy income-tax payers whose children get education in a somewhat different sense.  I should like if the Minister would look into this matter between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy this: the one thing that Deputy McGilligan did not deal with in the course of his speech on the general Resolution was this question of income-tax.  As to what may have been said on Resolution No. 14&mdash;and we are now discussing Resolution No. 1, Sir&mdash;I hope that I shall be able to deal with that on Resolution No. 14 when it comes before the House on Report, or possibly on the debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Why not deal with income-tax on the Income-tax Resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there will be an opportunity of dealing with it more adequately in the Committee discussion on Section 1 of the proposed Finance Bill.  Then I hope that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon, if they have anything pertinent to observe on that section of the Bill, will be here to make those observations.  With regard to what Deputy Dillon said, so far as the class of whom he speaks is concerned&mdash;the class, I assume, in which members of the Labour Party were keenly interested in last year's Budget&mdash;if I am challenged in the proper place and at the proper stage, that is, on the debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill or on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, I think I can say that that particular class is at least no worse off in the year 1936 than it was in the year 1931.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Norton, I will deal with it at length on the Finance Bill.  I may say that this matter was raised by Deputy Keyes last year, and I promised to look into it.  I have looked into it very carefully and with every desire to meet the point of view expressed by Deputy Keyes, but I am sorry to say that the practical difficulties in the way are such that we cannot do more than do as we have done this year, that is, to increase the rate of allowance in respect of children who are not earning and who are at school.</P>

      <P>It is not, I suppose, strictly in accordance with the rules, but if I may be permitted to answer the question put by Deputy MacDermot I may say that the fact that we are estimating the yield from surtax as slightly less than last year is due to the fact that there is an element of arrears which recurs from year to year in regard to the collection of surtax, and that last year that element was rather above the normal proportion to the total collection.  We do not anticipate <Col N="760" /> that this year the amount to be brought in in respect of arrears collected will be as much as last year, and that would account for the difference. It is purely a casual variation.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it, then, Sir, that this debate on the Report Stage of the Financial Resolutions is going to be continued on the basis that the Minister for Finance declines to answer any questions, bluntly announces his intention of ignoring the House and its procedure, and is postponing any observations he has to make to the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill?  If that is the attitude of the Minister, the sooner we wind up the House the better, because our proceedings have become the greatest farce.  As I understand the procedure of this House, it is designed to afford representatives of the minority an opportunity to put the Minister on his proof, at certain stages, as to legislation or alterations in legislation.  If the Minister blandly says, &ldquo;I am not going to reply, and I defy the authority of the House to ask any questions,&rdquo; it is waste of our time, waste of money, and waste of your time, Sir, to remain here any longer.  We should wind up the proceedings.  We should proceed in regard to the Dáil as we proceeded yesterday in regard to the Seanad&mdash; wind it up.</P>

If the Deputy had really been taking an interest in the business which was done in the House to-day he would have seen that the reply to a Parliamentary Question, put down by a Deputy who is really interested in this matter, gave him all the information which he desires.  In any event, Sir, as you know, the regulation is that on Report Stage a Deputy makes only one speech.

One of the functions it ought to have is to afford to the House an opportunity of getting some information which may be useful to them on the Finance Bill.

      <P>No, because I submit, Sir, with all respect, that the proper stage to interrogate the Minister is not the Report Stage of the Resolutions. A special time is provided by the rules of the House for interrogating the Minister, and one Deputy availed of that already to-day.  Of course, Deputy O'Sullivan was not here in his place to hear the answer I gave, but the information is available to the Deputy, just as it is to other Deputies, and surely Deputy O'Sullivan does not claim that he is entitled to suit his own convenience, to disregard the rules of the House, and come in here and put questions at a most untimely stage of the business of the House and hold up the business of the House merely because it has not suited him to be in his proper place at the opening of business?  I gave the information in reply to a question by a Deputy who is interested in this matter.  I gave all the information that was asked for. If Deputies require information, in order to enable them to discuss adequately proposals before this House, the House has provided a certain procedure for the purpose of eliciting that information.  That procedure is the procedure of putting down a Parliamentary Question, but, of course, Deputies have to think out a Parliamentary <Col N="764" /> Question; Parliamentary Questions cannot be just put on the spur of the moment; they involve a certain amount of preparation.  All that information has already been given, in so far as it was asked for, by the procedure of Parliamentary Question, and I do not think, Sir, with all respect, that the Report Stage of a Resolution is the proper place to ask for that information.</P>

I understood that we came here to-day for the purpose of getting information, and now the Minister says that he will not give the information required. What is the purpose of the Report Stage, if we are not to be provided with the information we require?  Is the procedure to be something in the nature of a Chinese prayer-wheel? Surely we are here for some purpose. I take it that the purpose we are here for is to get information, but if the Minister will not give the information, we might just as well set up a prayer-wheel and give it a twist for one stage, and then turn it around again for the next stage, and then, at the end of that, proceed to our next business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 2.</P>
      <P>This Resolution, as the House is aware, arises out of the Local Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1934, which provided for deductions from the remuneration payable to officers of local authorities for the year which ended on the 31st of March, 1935. Section 3 of the Finance Act of 1934 provided that, for the purpose of computing an assessment in regard to income-tax for the year 1934-35, a person who was an officer within the meaning of the Local Services (Temporary Economies) Act should be allowed a deduction equal to the amount of the deduction to be made in respect of that year, under the Local Services (Temporary Economies) Act, from the remuneration paid to the officers of the local authority concerned. It happened that Section 9 of that Act also provided for adjustments in the amount of the cut up to the end of the year 1935 and, accordingly, the amount of the cut which was to be made under the Local Services (Temporary Economies) Act was not necessarily determined finally in all cases up to December, 1935.  Now, of course, the operations of the income-tax code could not be suspended in respect of these officers of local authorities until December, 1935, and it happened that, while in general the assessments on the salaries actually enjoyed by these officers of local authorities were made equitably, in a small number of cases, taking the assessments for 1934-35 and 1935-36 together, the allowances in respect of the cut were either too little or too much.  Thanks to the courtesy of the Opposition, I had not an opportunity to explain this matter fully on the Committee Stage, and I am explaining it now.  The purpose of this Resolution is to provide for any adjustments which may be necessary in view of the fact that, in some cases, the assessments were either too little or too much.  In other words, the purpose of the Resolution is to make an equitable assessment on all the officers of the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give any example of cases where the assessment was, in fact, too low?  I am sure the Minister will understand what I am getting at, because I can envisage a case in which a man's outgoings would approximate pretty closely to his income, and, having made his assessment too low in the first case, that man might be considerably embarrassed now if there were any wide difference between what he actually paid and the amended assessment proposed under this Resolution. Of course, if the proposed alteration only involves a difference of a pound or two, it would not matter very much, but I should like to know from the Minister whether there is any danger that any official will be called upon to pay any substantial sum in the form of an amended assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I am not in a position to say, because naturally I take the advice of my advisers in regard to these matters.  They say this provision is essential in order to deal equitably with all assessments. No person will be called upon to pay any more than he would be in equity bound to pay, in view of the purpose for which the special provisions were inserted in the 1934 Act.  If any person will be found to pay more, I also believe that there are some other persons called upon to pay less than the amount of the assessment.  This is merely necessary to put all officers of local authorities upon the one basis.  I do not deal with individual cases, because individual cases are not brought to my notice, as a rule.  I have not the information that the Deputy asked for.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 3.</P>
      <P>This clause is designed to abolish the six years' period for making assessments. In the case of assessments on executors of deceased persons, the existing prohibition against the making of such assessments later than the end of the third year after the year of assessment in which the deceased person died is retained.  Assessments for all years back to 1922-23 may be made and exercised provided that it is done within a limited period of three years after the year of the death of the deceased.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the discussion on the Finance Bill, Deputy Costello referred to this new proposal of the Minister, and amongst the various reasons he adduced in opposition to it was one in which he described the conditions under which an ordinary person can recover debts over a certain period.  The Statute of Limitations fixed that period at six years.  It was not only in the interests of the debtor but also of the creditor that that statute was passed.  There ought to be some period at which people would know how they stood with regard to such business.  That statute, generally speaking, was a feature here until slight alterations took place in our income-tax code.  It is now proposed to alter the position, and to alter it to the disadvantage of the taxpayer.  It is conceivable that the income-tax authorities may not have secured every penny to which the Exchequer was entitled, but it is equally conceivable that taxpayers have had to pay sums beyond the amounts they were legally entitled to pay.  A taxpayer is entitled at present <Col N="768" /> to get back any over-payments for a period of three years.  If he neglects or forgets that he has the right to get back the money, and does not exercise it within a period of three years, under the law he has no cause for action against the State.  The State is legally in possession of money to which he is entitled.  It is morally due to the individual, but he has then no rights whatever against the State.  The proposal in this Resolution is that the income-tax authorities are to be entitled to go back to 1922.  In support of his case the Minister in his Budget speech mentioned two or three instances in which money had been lost to the Exchequer because of the limitation of the law.  But we got no estimate and no information from the Minister as to how many taxpayers had been refused refunds because of neglect to make claims during a certain period.  It is quite conceivable that one would balance the other.  The Statute of Limitations was a code of law that was not passed merely to give an advantage to a person who owed money.  It was to put an end to a period of uncertainty.  If a man was not repaid or did not stake a claim in respect to money due him within a certain period he lost it, and so we were saved that endless litigation which neither the legal profession nor the bench desire to see going to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of security was mentioned, that of leaving a person who was in possession of a disputed debt in secure possession of it, unless it was claimed by other people within a certain period.  This innovation creates this position, that no one in the State subject to income-tax can now be sure of the charge he may get from the income-tax authorities.  We heard from the Minister of cases of fairly large estates where sums of money were lost to the Exchequer.  It is going to go from the larger estates to the smaller ones.  It would be interesting to know what has been the effect of all this insecurity.  We had a phase of it in connection with the winding up of estates, when a clause was put into an Act during the last couple of years, by which executors cannot be absolved from responsibility <Col N="769" /> in connection with them unless they get a certificate from the income-tax authorities that no charges in respect of excess profits, income-tax, or matters of that sort are due.  Looking at the published returns of receipts from income-tax and supertax for the last few years, one is struck by the information furnished in respect of assessments and receipts.  Receipts from supertax and surtax are given as £789,000 for 1931-32.  The Minister has not succeeded during the last year in getting within £130,000 of that figure, although he increased the number of persons liable for supertax by making it a charge from £1,500 to £2,000, and in addition there was 10 per cent. added.  Although that was done, he is not within £130,000 of the figure I mentioned.  It will interest Deputy Norton to know that there was a fall in the yield.  Those whom the Deputy in his candour and enthusiasm described as &ldquo;the rich man's Government&rdquo; got £130,000 more out of the rich men than what he described as &ldquo;the poor man's Government&rdquo; got, notwithstanding all the taxes that have been put on.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know, in view of the information the Minister gave the House a short time ago, what reduction has taken place in the number of those who are liable to supertax, and whether or not certain people have packed their bags.  If they have, it represents a loss not alone in surtax but also in income-tax. If there is one thing more than another that is likely to make them do it, it is introducing such resolutions as this before us.  It is unfair to the person who is liable to an assessment that the State can go back to 1922 in respect of its claim against him, whereas in respect of any claim which he may have against the State he is limited to three years.  That is an unfair discrimination against the income-tax payer.  There is a worse feature than that.  The very uncertainty, to which a resolution of this kind is bound to give rise, is of itself of such a nature that an income-tax payer would be well advised to take out an insurance against it, if such an insurance could be placed.  When a Deputy, having the experience as a <Col N="770" /> jurist that Deputy Costello has, makes it his business to deal with a matter of this sort, and to direct attention to it from the pure ethics, if one might so describe it, of the law, I think the Minister might reconsider this proposal.</P>
    <P>It will bring in £50,000 this year, we are told.  What Deputy or Minister in this House at the present moment can say how he stood in 1922-23 with regard to his income or income-tax? How long is an income-tax payer going to spend upon his accounts of 14 or 15 years ago, even assuming that he has no business at all, that he has merely either a salary or derives an income from investments?  How long is he going to spend on the calculations and the examination he is required to make in connection with that matter?  Assuming he does all that, that he employs an income-tax expert, and perhaps a solicitor and counsel, that he succeeds after all his efforts in showing to the satisfaction of the inspector that he owes nothing, what does he get for all the expense that he has incurred and all the trouble that he has taken in order to prove it?  Not a penny.  Does that not prove that people will be satisfied to pay what they do not owe, to escape the costs that they would be put to in order to prove that they owe nothing?  On the whole case it is not a resolution which the Minister in his sober judgment and calm wisdom would recommend.  It is certainly one that, if he were on this side of the House, would cause him almost to reach the ceiling with his hat in his indignation.</P>

      <P>I think that where there is a serious or a well-established principle, like the Statute of Limitations, the assumption should be that that principle was not set up without good reason.  The assumption should be, so to speak, that it embodies a great deal of practical wisdom.  Assume, if you like, viewing the question in an abstract manner, as regards the debt between individual and individual that there is a lot to be said against that particular statute. After all it can be pointed out&mdash;the <Col N="771" /> Minister will have no difficulty in pointing it out&mdash;that not merely in the relations between the State and individuals, but in the relations between individual creditor and debtor, there are cases where the operation of the Statute of Limitations prevents his getting money that in the ordinary sense was owed to him.  It is clear to everybody that there are innumerable cases of that kind, but for a long time past it has been the practice&mdash;and that practice, as I say, is embodied in the Statute of Limitations&mdash;to recognise the fact that a great deal more damage would be done to the economy of the State and even very often to justice itself, unless some limitation were fixed beyond which debts cannot be claimed for.  We must take it for granted that it is not without reason that such an obvious departure from the ordinary strict rules governing the relations of debtor and creditor should have been adopted.  I think everybody will admit that it is only right that if a person has a claim against another he should, within a reasonable time, put forward that claim, that if it is possible for an individual to go back beyond a period of five or six years, you may have very often a greater offence against justice, and you certainly will not have that settled frame of mind in business circles which it is desirable to have.  It is obvious that that is not the result of mere theoretical thinking, but the practical working of the system of creditor and debtor, of exchange, that has led to the building up of this particular principle and to its adoption.</P>
      <P>What do we propose to do to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose to scrap that principle, even though there is no fraud whatsoever in the relation between one particular creditor and one particular debtor&mdash;the State and the State's debtor.  We are going on behalf of the State, which has, it must be confessed, rather considerable powers, and which, as everybody knows, has very great machinery for finding out what is due to it, and for collecting its debts, to scrap this principle, and to leave it untouched as far as the relations <Col N="772" /> between ordinary debtor and creditor are concerned.  That is unwise.  You can always in the case of any principles that have behind them the practical wisdom of generations put up a case, an individual case, basing on it a demand for the removal of the principle.  There is practically no wise principle of administration which would not have a fatal ending if that type of reasoning were applied to it. Naturally, if you have a principle such as the Statute of Limitations applied to State debts, it is inevitable that there will be cases in which the State will lose, but what the House has to consider is whether the sum that you will get by revoking the Statute of Limitations, in practice, as you are doing&mdash;there is no question of fraud&mdash; is not a dear price to pay for your violation of the principle.  By doing that you create a general feeling of insecurity.  I leave out of account the other aspect of the matter which was raised by Deputy Costello in his speech in connection with the Budget statement, the impracticability, for most people, of going back and getting satisfactory evidence for a number of years. There is the fact also that if they do establish their claim against the Revenue Commissioners it will be as a result of an extremely costly operation for which they cannot get reimbursement from the Revenue Commissioners. Very often it will be cheaper for individuals to pay down what is asked rather than defend themselves.  The only reason that, very often, will induce them to defend themselves is the feeling that if they do not do so they may be assessed in the following year for a much bigger sum.</P>
    <P>They are, therefore, in this extraordinary dilemma, that if they defend themselves and make a good case it may be dropped by the Revenue Commissioners, and, as Deputy Costello pointed out, they will then get no reimbursement for the immense cost that they have been put to in connection with an entirely unsustainable claim, or else if they do pay up they may feel that by doing so the Revenue Commissioners may say in the following year: &ldquo;This man paid up rather <Col N="773" /> easily last year, so that we must have assessed him at too low a figure; we will try him with a higher demand this time.&rdquo;  Is that situation not likely to give rise to a feeling of insecurity? We have had occasion to protest against many measures of the Government as being liable to increase that feeling of insecurity.  This is one of many examples.  I admit that from the Treasury point of view there is an immediate gain of about £50,000. That, I think, was the figure given by the Minister for Finance.  There is that immediate gain also in the case of the private individual who has a debt against another.  In the case of property that he has allowed to pass into the hands of the other, it would be a great advantage to him if he were allowed to claim beyond the six years at present permitted by the law.  But, as I have said, the apparent wisdom of generations has frowned upon that sort of claim.  So far as property is concerned, the State, which regulates the details of these matters, has put its machinery at the disposal of an individual to collect debts that are a certain number of years out of date, but the State for a long time has determined that it is not in the interests of the State or in the interests of the community, or even in the interests of justice, that an individual should be permitted to sue after the lapse of a certain number of years. Now, what is not allowed to the individual is apparently to be allowed to the State, as if the State had not a much more powerful machine at its disposal than the individual.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the case.  The other side of the case has been put by Deputy Costello&mdash;I do not intend to enlarge upon it&mdash;namely, that there is no corresponding right given to the individual.  Even if he had that right, I doubt whether, as the law stands at present, it would be worth his while trying to get anything back against the powerful machinery of the Revenue Department.  Let it be recognised that the individual is pretty helpless at present against that Governmental machine.  He is now going to be made still more helpless because of the extreme difficulty of giving evidence in regard to matters that go back over <Col N="774" /> a long number of years.  After he has gone to a lot of trouble and expense, the Revenue Commissioners may drop their claim, but they will make no return to him for his out-of-pocket expenses.  Under this proposal there will be an immediate gain to the Revenue, but it is a gain that I suggest is very dearly bought by upsetting an established principle.</P>

      <P>I will repeat for the Minister what Deputy Costello said when speaking on this matter last week.  He quoted the following statement made by Lord St. Leonards, at one time a Lord Chancellor in England and a great jurist.  He pointed out that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All Statutes of Limitations have for their object the prevention of the rearing up of claims at great distances of time when evidences are lost, and in all well-regulated countries the quieting of possession is held an important point of policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a great principle stated in the archaic language of the law. May I put it to the Minister in a more homely form?  Could he tell us now, or could he prove to the Revenue Commissioners, what his income was in 1923?  I am not putting that particularly or specifically to the Minister. I put it to any member of the House, whether he could produce evidence of a character that would satisfy the Revenue Commissioners as to what his income was in 1923.  Let us not be drawn into the open road of suggesting that no members of the Fianna Fáil Party had any income then, and that that is the reason they are in Dáil Eireann.  We will pass that over. Let us assume that they were capable of making some kind of an income before they came in here.  I put this to them as rational men: do they think that they would be able to produce to the Revenue Commissioners satisfactory evidence of what their income was in that year?  I think they will readily realise that unless they were running every day of their lives a limited liability company no such records would exist.  It would be extremely difficult for them to say what their income was 11 or 12 years ago, so that, in fact, they would be <Col N="775" /> absolutely in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.  They would have to a convincing answer to any assessment that was made against them, because they would not be in a position to give a convincing answer to any assessment levelled at them by the Revenue Commissioners at so distant a date.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Finance that there can be no justification whatever for putting the Revenue Commissioners in a position preferential to that enjoyed by any trade creditor in the country.  We all know that there was an archaic privilege vested in the Crown in feudal countries giving it certain rights which the ordinary citizen did not enjoy. Those feudal privileges have no place under modern conditions, and it is ridiculous to suggest that the Board of Revenue Commissioners in Saorstát Eireann is in fact a pseudo-king because much as we venerate these distinguished public officials there is nothing regal about them.</P>

      <P>I am talking now on the Report Stage of the Financial Resolutions for 1936.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee as to what was in the Finance Act in 1924.  I am discussing now a principle which it is sought to overthrow by this Resolution, and in so far as any previous Finance Act trespassed on that principle, I deprecate it.  The Minister is here seeking to confer on the Revenue Commissioners a privilege which would be appropriate to a mediaeval king.  I have no reason to believe that these gentlemen desire, or that this House desires to establish any analogy between the Board of Revenue Commissioners and the King's Court, as it was known in the Middle Ages.  All that we are suggesting is that the Revenue Commissioners should be put on the same basis as the ordinary citizen as to their right to claim payment of a debt.  We do not contest that where there has been fraud the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="776" /> should be released from the ordinary restrictions of the Statute of Limitations, because otherwise it would be wrong.  It would be compounding a crime.  But where there is no fraud, and where there is good faith on both sides and where the Revenue Commissioners believe that an error has crept in, it is not reasonable to put a man on his proof as to what the state of his affairs was 13 years ago when he has no records to help him, while the Revenue Commissioners have the entire machinery of the State at their back.</P>
      <P>If you are going to collect £50,000 this year, you are going to create a wholly undesirable precedent and a precedent that will develop, to the great inconvenience of everybody in the State.  I urge most strongly on the Minister that this principle should be abandoned, and that we should return to the principle that obtained before the Resolution was introduced.  In that connection, I do not want to press for a similar concession to the taxpayer. I realise that if the Minister gives this concession to the Revenue Commissioners, he ought to give it to the taxpayer.  But I do not press for that.  I do not like the breach of the principle.  I think we ought to have some date beyond which no person in the State will be entitled to go for the purpose of prosecuting a claim.  If you have not such a date, the Minister knows the amount of instability and insecurity that will arise.  People ought to be settled in their property some time. One of the great grievances against the Revenue Commissioners is the difficulty of getting them to settle any claim finally.  The Minister has heard complaints along these lines in respect of other parts of their functions, particularly in regard to the winding-up of estates.  It is a bad thing that such procedure should be carried into the every-day life of the person who is trying to settle his income-tax with the Revenue Commissioners.  I strongly urge on the Minister that he should restore the six-year limit beyond which the Revenue Commissioners cannot go except in the presence of fraud. Nobody desires to protect the person who fraudulently attempts to deprive the State of that to which it is entitled.</P>

      <P>I am rather sorry that Deputy Cosgrave is not here.  He raised a point which was not strictly within the ambit of this debate, but, as I know he takes a great interest in these matters, I should have liked to give him the information which is in my possession regarding it.  He pointed out that the yield of surtax in 1931-32 apeared to be above the yield for 1935-36.  I should like to explain the reasons for that.  The first reason is that in 1931-32 the collection of arrears of supertax and surtax was particularly large.  The second reason &mdash;it is a much more effective reason&mdash; is that in 1931-32 it was the practice to credit all double taxation reliefs against income-tax and to accept surtax and supertax as being paid in full.  This operated, in regard to a considerable number of claims made in 1931-32, to swell the yield from supertax and surtax in respect of that year.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the main purpose of the Resolution.  I am glad to notice that Deputy Dillon and I are in accord for once.  Deputy Dillon desires that there should be some limit of time beyond which the Revenue Commissioners may not claim in respect of income-tax and surtax.  There is a limit in this Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  The Deputy need not go around beating his breast for the sins of the Cosgrave Government, because we have met the difficulty and fixed the limit at 1922. If the same problem confronted us as confronted our predecessors in 1924, we should have taken exactly the same course that they did&mdash;that is, give priority to the claims of the State in regard to these matters.  We should have done as was done in the Finance Act of 1924 and attached to all claims of the Central Fund all the rights, privileges, and priorities which formerly attached to debts due to the Crown.  There was a very good reason for that.  I should like the Deputy to read that particular section of the Finance Act of 1924, in the light of some of the declarations which have been made from the Opposition benches since 1932, and try to study <Col N="778" /> the mentality behind the drafting of that section.  In any event there was very good reason for that section.  If the State cannot collect its revenues, no civilised life in any community is possible, and the enforcement of remedies for ordinary debts becomes impossible.</P>
      <P>An attempt has been made to put the defaulting income-tax payer on the same plane as the ordinary debtor. The ordinary citizen, when he gives credit, gives it on his own conditions. If he does not want to sell his goods upon credit, he can demand, before he cedes them, that the person to whom he gives them will pay cash on the nail, or he can provide for payment within a certain period.  The State is not in that position.  It has to give all its services&mdash;courts, police, schools, etc.&mdash;to any citizen upon demand and it cannot say that it will only give them to a particular citizen if, at the moment, he pays cash.  It has to rely upon its ability to collect what is due to it in taxes from every citizen alike the moment he begins to owe the taxes or at such time as his liability for those taxes becomes plain and apparent to the State.  An attempt was made by Deputy Costello, in his speech on the General Resolution, and to-day by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon, to confuse the issue by dragging in the Statute of Limitations. The purpose of the Statute of Limitations is to confirm a citizen in his rightful ownership and to secure him against vexatious litigation.  Deputies opposite forget that the income-tax code places upon a citizen the onus of disclosing his true income.  If he fails to discharge that onus, he is guilty of a breach of the statute.</P>

There is no person can come in here and argue that a citizen does not know what his true income was in any particular year, within reasonable limits, within the limits of human error.  The Deputy challenged members on the Fianna Fáil Benches to say what their income was in 1922 and 1923.  I can tell the Deputy that, so far as my earned income is concerned, it was very low in 1922 and 1923.  I was not permitted to earn an income in 1922 and 1923.  I was in prison.</P>

      <P>If an estate is of significant value, the Revenue Commissioners eventually do find out. They find out when the affidavit is sworn for estate duty.  There was one case in which an estate was sworn at £350,000 and if the Revenue had got all it was entitled to from that estate, it would have got £40,000 more than in fact it got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  It is not necessarily fraudulent, but possibly so. It is not necessarily such fraud as one could prove within the four corners of the existing law.  The question is that these people are dead before their evasion comes to light, and, under the existing law, even if the assessment is made within three years after the year of death of the income-tax payer, it is not possible to go back for more than six previous years from <Col N="780" /> the date of the assessment.  Here it was quite clearly a case in which every penny piece ought to have been collected by the Revenue, and the fact that £40,000 was not collected by the Revenue was visited upon every citizen who had a fixed income, who was in receipt merely of a salary.  He had to make good that £40,000 either in direct or indirect taxes.</P>
      <P>I do not want to argue this case at length, but I say that I read Deputy Costello's speech, and the Deputy seems to have been under a misapprehension in regard to the powers under the existing law.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot make assessments for more than six previous years, even where there was fraud or wilful neglect. They can recover penalties where they are in a position to prove fraud or wilful neglect.  Very often they take those penalties as against the income-tax, payment of which was avoided by the income-tax payer, but they are limited by the six-year period for assessments.</P>
      <P>To get back to the Statute of Limitations, the statute was never intended to apply to cases in which there was an element of fraud unless the fraud was connived at by the person affected. I have heard Deputy O'Sullivan talking about the Statute of Limitations. I read Deputy Costello's speech in regard to it, and I have listened to Deputy Dillon on it, too, but the fact they are forgetting is that that statute was introduced to avoid vexatious litigation against a person who was in rightful ownership of a property which he enjoyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  After all, they do operate the income-tax code in a reasonable and humane way, and where the penalties will compensate them for the tax which has been improperly withheld from the revenue, they will take the penalties in commutation of the income-tax; but where the amount of penalties is less than the amount of tax withheld, the revenue is the loser by that amount. That is the position, and we hope to cure that by this amendment of the code.  All we are asking is that a person who has succeeded in evading the tax will be made to pay the tax for the benefit of every other taxpayer, including the income-tax payer. The difference between us and Deputy Cosgrave is that we are seeking to protect the taxpayer, while he is seeking to protect the tax evader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is matter upon which we want information.  The Minister has just told us that the remedy to recover by penalty is not effective, because, he says, in many cases the penalty is adequate to compensate the Revenue Commissioners, but cases can arise in which it is not, and he therefore wishes to confer on the Revenue Commissioners the right to collect the penalty, to go back and get all that is due to them.  I say surely the penalty bears a relation to the loss.  The Minister has been advised that the Revenue Commissioners have the right to collect by way of penalty any sum up to three times the amount of the loss in case of fraud.  My submission is that, where the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to prove fraud or wilful neglect, they can go back to the day when William Ewart Gladstone imposed a penny in the £, or whatever it was, when income-tax was first being enacted.  If they can prove fraud or wilful neglect, they can sue the defaulter, or his heirs or assigns, in respect of whatever default there was, and recover a fine of £20 and up to three times the amount of the default.  Now, I say that is adequate protection for the Revenue Commissioners. But where there is no fraud, where there is no wilful neglect, where the taxpayer has acted in perfect good faith, and has been anxious to reveal to the Revenue Commissioners all that he could reasonably be expected to know, and holds himself ready to pay, is he never to be able to say: &ldquo;I am now free of any claim by the Revenue Commissioners for all time?&rdquo; The Minister himself admits that there does come a time when he must give the taxpayer that freedom, and he fixes 1922.  In fact, all the Minister does is to extend the Statute of Limitations by eight years in this financial year, and by nine, ten, 11 and 12 years in the <Col N="783" /> years to come.  How can the Minister maintain that this is fair?  How does he defend the suggestion that the remedy by penalty is inadequate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to indicate that with a <Col N="785" /> view to giving us an opportunity of comparing the tariffs that he was putting on here and tariffs, if any, already imposed, on articles mentioned in the Schedule, the Minister indicated that he would circulate a memorandum that would meet some of the questions we asked when we last discussed this matter.  The Minister has not circulated any memorandum that would help us, so that we are now left without any information beyond the proposal, so far as No. 1 is concerned, to put 9d. per cwt. on Plaster of Paris, Keene's cement and Parian cement, and at the same time to operate licence conditions whenever he thinks that these products should be brought in without duty.  I hope that the Minister realises he is asking the House, without any explanatory statement, to impose a substantial burden of taxation on people by a whole series of new taxes ranging from 40 to 75 per cent.  That is one point.  The other point is that he contends he is going to create a certain amount of industry and employment.  We do expect, when we are asked to place a fairly substantial tariff on a wide range of articles, that the Minister will give some information as to his object in doing so and what prospect there is of achieving that object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister how far this duty is intended to go.  I take it that it is not intended to go any further than plaster of Paris, Keene's cement and Parian cement.  Plaster of Paris, Keene's cement and Parian cement have a certain family resemblance in that they are the products of burning gypsum to various stages, driving off portion or all the water of crystallisation.  There are a couple of other things, such as slabbing plaster and Roman cement, and I take it that they are not intended to come under this category and that this category is only for the articles mentioned in the Schedule.  I will be glad to have some information on that point when the Minister is replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell is correct in assuming that the duty applies only to the articles mentioned in the second column, plaster of Paris, <Col N="786" /> Keene's cement and Parian cement. With regard to the circulation of a memorandum, I think I explained here during an earlier consideration of these Resolutions, that it would be impracticable to circulate a memorandum explaining why it was considered desirable to impose certain duties.  That is a matter that can be discussed now.  A memorandum explanatory of the effect of the proposals could be circulated.  In so far, however, as the duties imposed by Resolution No. 4 are concerned, not much additional information could be given over and above that contained in the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all new duties to this extent, that some of them have been in operation under Emergency Orders, but are now coming before the Dáil for the first time.  Resolutions Nos. 10 and 11, which deal with the alteration, or amendment, or cancellation of existing duties where the Schedule contains references to previous enactments, are in a different category, and Deputies could reasonably expect a memorandum explanatory of the effect of these Resolutions. I understand such a memorandum is being prepared.  I cannot say whether it will be ready this afternoon, but it will certainly be ready in the course of a day or two at the outside, before the Finance Bill is taken.  With regard to the rest of Deputy Mulcahy's remarks, I gather he was complaining that I did not explain the effect of the tariff and the reason for imposing it.  My answer is that the Deputy did not give me a chance, because by tabling his amendment he got the right to speak first and he did so.  I assumed that when he put down his amendment he intended to give the reasons why the duty should not be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister flatters himself, and draws on his imagination, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's intention is as he has stated, then I welcome his co-operation.  It gives me the opportunity, which I intended to make available in any event, of explaining the nature of the proposals embodied in the Schedule and the results which we think will follow from their enactment. If I may make a general reference, at this stage, I would like to say that a large number of the tariffs set out in the Schedule are of minor importance.  They represent minor additions to our tariffs lists, which will not in themselves involve any substantial industrial development. A few of them are of importance, and may have important reactions on employment and industrial production generally.  The first represents plaster of Paris, Keene's cement, and Parian cement.  These articles so described are produced from gypsum.  The purpose of imposing a tariff of 9d. per cwt. is to afford protection to that industry in the Saorstát.  The production of plaster of Paris from gypsum was commenced by a company formed for the purpose some time ago. Gypsum deposits in County Cavan are being worked for the purpose of producing this plaster of Paris.  The Saorstát market for that commodity is valued at about £17,000 a year, and it is anticipated that the whole of that market can be supplied from the County Cavan deposits.  Plaster of Paris produced there is of a very satisfactory quality, and is available at the same price as the best British product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health have had experience of the quality of this plaster and they are quite satisfied with it, and have expressed their willingness <Col N="788" /> to specify the sole use of Saorstát plaster in the erection of houses subsidised under the Housing Acts.  Furthermore, the Department of Local Government and Public Health, which is definitely interested in matters relating to housing, and the cost thereof, have raised no objection to the imposition of the tariff.  An appreciable amount of additional employment for adult men will result from the granting of this protection.  The amount of the duty is not heavy but it will, in our opinion, be adequate to afford the protection necessary to secure the development of these deposits.</P>
    <P>The power to grant licences, when necessary, is to ensure that there will be no difficulty in allowing requirements to be met during the period that the plaster of Paris works in County Cavan may be developing so as to be fully adequate to supply our needs. Having regard to the undesirability of holding up housing activities, or increasing the cost, it was considered desirable in that period to have power to issue licences for the free importation of plaster of Paris.  I do not anticipate that these powers will have to be used, to any extent, because I understand the Cavan Company will very soon be in a position to supply in full the country's requirements of these products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if he discussed the facts with the Cavan Company before putting on this duty?  Will he also say if he got information as to the amount of adult employment given at the present time and of the amount that it is expected will be given when the requirements of the country are being dealt with in the Cavan works?</P>

      <P>To delete reference No. 2 and all relevant references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment in order to delete reference No. 2, which puts a 40 per cent. duty on whip-thongs and whip-lashes.  The Minister's action in this connection, I think, requires some explanation.  In the case of plaster of Paris the Minister made no attempt to give any opinion as to the number of men employed in the Cavan works or likely to be employed, or to give the amount of money expected to result from this tariff. Is he in a position to give any information as to the extent of the new employment that will be effected by the imposition of this 40 per cent. tariff on whip-thongs and whip-lashes? On the other hand, is he in a position to say how much increased revenue will arise out of the imposition of this duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this tariff will result in any substantial increase of employment.  These articles are made by harness makers throughout the country.  An application was made for the imposition of this tariff, and I could see no good reason why it should not be imposed.  The rate of duty was determined by the fact that it is the same rate that applies to other leather-manufactured articles. It is desirable, from the point of view of administration, that we should, if possible, have a uniform rate on all articles of a similar kind manufactured of leather.  The present rate is 40 per cent., and for that reason this duty was adopted in this case.  It is not possible to give any estimate of the quantity of these goods that will be required over any period.  No statistics are available.  I am not putting this tariff forward as a serious contribution to our industrial policy. It is a small matter.  But on the ground that producers should be assisted to develop their production by protective duty, if necessary, I can see no reason why it should not be done here.</P>

      <P>To delete reference No. 3 and all relevant references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>The general complaint about many of the schedules in the Act of last year was that some group of Government inspectors had searched every corner of the poor man's house and had put a tariff on everything that came under his eye, from the linoleum on the floor to the paper on the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  We were told that big industrial development was coming in the manufacture of wallpaper; but that is all the Minister knows about it.  Coming to the schedules to-day, we find that the inspectorial swarms have gone round again to the poor man's house.  Now we are going to have a tax on pepper, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  I think the Minister would be well advised to leave the ginger and the nutmeg and the pepper in the list this year, considering he is making such a strong effort to try to make people forget what happened last year. I oppose the putting on of an additional tax on the household budget of the ordinary worker of 6d. per lb. on pepper and whatever goes on cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total value of the imports of pepper and spices into the <Col N="791" /> Saorstát, all of which are at present ground before being imported, is about £14,000 per year.  We have been able to make an estimate that if the commodities are imported in an unground state the value of the imports would be reduced by about £5,000, and that some new employment would be created by the doing of the grinding process in the Saorstát&mdash;direct employment in the grinding process and indirect in the production of the containers, etc. Arrangements have been made for the grinding of pepper and spices here, and these arrangements are such as to ensure that the supplies of the country will be met. The retail prices of the finished product will not be affected by having the grinding done here.</P>
      <P>As, however, the production may not yet be sufficient to ensure that requirements can be met in full in the immediate future, a licensing provision is being inserted, and that will be used temporarily only, and for the purpose of enabling requirements to be met in the event of there being any deficiency in the home production.  It will not be an important industry, but in so far as the retail prices will be the same, in so far as the work can be done here, and in so far as certain employment can be given in the doing of it, and the value of our imports can be reduced by some amount by the doing of it, I know of no reason why it should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good reason why it should not be done.</P>

      <P>I shall be glad to hear of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not surprise me that the Minister has not heard of it. The Minister says the value of these imports amounts to £14,000.  How many firms can profitably engage in the grinding of that amount of merchandise? One&mdash;and that firm will not be profitably occupied; it will have to do it as a side line of some packing process.  That means that you are going to create a complete monopoly in the sale of ground spices in this State, because if anyone wishes to compete he must pay 6d. per lb. on anything he brings in for the purpose of <Col N="792" /> competition.  It would be out of the question to set up equipment to carry out the grinding process in more than one establishment, because there will not be sufficient occupation for two men for more than six weeks or two months to grind all the spices named in this schedule and consumed in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>There are, to my knowledge, at least nine grades of white pepper which can be at present purchased on the London market, which is the great centre of the spice trade for this part of the world.  The man who gets the concession under this tariff will bring in any pepper he likes and grind it, and if you do not like it you can lump it. I am just taking one head.  Pepper is an article which extends from highly aromatic spices down to something which closely approximates to sand which comes within the legal definition of pure pepper.  The person who gets this concession cannot carry nine grades of white pepper, five grades of black pepper, seven or eight grades of ginger, and the various grades of each of these comestibles, with the result that the distributors to this country must take whatever is offered in the form of pepper by this one individual, or else pay 6d. per lb. on the imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly pointed out in this House, and I sometimes despair of making any impression on the minds of Deputies, particularly Labour Deputies, that there are two ways of raising prices on the public.  One is to add money to the marked price of a given commodity, and the other is to leave the marked price as it was and reduce the quality.  By juggling in the qualities of comestibles like pepper, I can alter the margin of profit available on the sale of that commodity from 10 to 60 per cent.  It is only when I get to such a wide differentiation as that the ordinary consumer will be able with confidence to go back to his grocer and challenge the comparative qualities of the pepper I have been supplying. But if I choose to alter the margin of profit, say, from 10 to 40 per cent., no ordinary person consuming that comestible can confidently say that the quality of what I was giving was <Col N="793" /> substantially lower than what I used to give.</P>
    <P>The form of this Resolution is going to create a monopoly in these commodities. It certainly is going to affect the value that the consuming public is going to get.  But one of the greatest dangers is that it is going to inform every grocer in the country that any obligation that he had to his customers to look for the best value he could get for them has now gone by the board so far as these things are concerned.  All that he is now allowed to do is to send his order to whoever has got what will be a monopolistic concession and take what he gets.  If retail distributors in this country had any justification for their existence, and, being one of them myself, I think they have, I believe it was that our duty was to search the markets of the world and provide for our customers the best value that our money could buy.  If we fail to do that, and the Government are gradually driving us into the position that it is no longer possible to do it, I say that every merchant will become a parasite on the body politic.  He is simply a person who is skimming a profit off the merchandise that travels from the Government-controlled monopolist out to the consumers of the country.  In so far as all these commodities are concerned, any person who distributes them simply becomes a public nuisance. It would be much better to get rid of him and let people who want pepper go to a depot and get it, because there will be only one quality of pepper, only one quality of ginger, only one quality of nutmeg, and only one quality of the other commodities set out in this list.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of the question. The other aspect to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention is the inclusion of an article called curry powder mentioned in M.  This is a purely vexatious provision.  Curry powder is a compound product and very few people use it.  Those who do use it have fads and attach special importance to getting certain curry powders which they have always been in the habit of using.  Just because the Minister takes a whim, he inserts the words &ldquo;curry powder&rdquo; there.  It does <Col N="794" /> seem ludicrous to object, because the amount of curry powder coming in would not be more than £100 per annum.  But, simply because we stick it into that Schedule, we are going to carry into the houses of those individuals who like that particular thing an inconvenience and an annoyance out of all proportion to any benefit that can be conferred upon the community by including curry powder there.  We know that pepper is pepper, but curry powder is of a particular quality according to the person who manufactures it.  All this tariff legislation is bound to give rise to a good deal of personal inconvenience here and there. Generally, if we accept the Minister's philosophy, which I do not, one must reconcile oneself to the fact that individual members of the community must be expected to bear those inconveniences with equanimity, but there is no necessity to accentuate them beyond what is necessary for the implementation of the Government's policy.  To include an article like curry powder there is a kind of Hitlerite gesture of the Minister, who does not give a damn.  If he annoys somebody, if he puts them out, well, they are just another egg that must be cracked in order to make an omelette. My suggestion is that he should not crack eggs when there is no necessity to crack them.  Taking the 200 or 300 people who use this comestible every year in the country, there is no use in cracking them and giving them a weekly annoyance through their inability to get a trivial thing of this kind when no proportionate advantage is going to accrue to the community.</P>

I take it that it is our duty to place any information we have at the disposal of the House and the Minister when the occasion arises.  One does not require to be a grocer or an expert to be able to tell the Minister that you cannot go out to a laundry and grind up nutmeg in a mangle.  You must put in proper equipment for spice grinding.  You cannot use the same equipment for the grinding of bay leaves and pepper.  A nutmeg will not fit through the same mesh as a grain of pepper.  The Minister should know those things without turning to an expert for information on them; but does he expect us to believe in anything he says when he tells us that three firms at least are going to divide between them £3,000 worth of business? If he does, he expects us to believe that when Swift wrote about Gulliver's travels to Liliput he meant that to be taken literally.</P>

      <P>I think the whole thing is absurd, and I think the Minister's figure is absurd.  You are either going to have a monopoly or you are putting a tax on.  If you are not giving them a monopoly you are putting a tax on, and in either case the Minister has not shown that there is going to be an increase in employment. There is never a tariff he puts on that is not going to produce that result, according to him.  An increase in price is the inevitable result of putting on taxation.  The Minister's only idea of decreasing the price of what the people eat is by taxing them more heavily.  You put on a tax of 6d.  Is that meant to be prohibitive?  We have no idea.  We were not told.  The only thing the Minister told us, before he lost his temper, was that he was welcoming the opportunity of giving information to the House.  I must say that he is not making much use of his opportunity of giving information to the House.</P>

Surely it would be much more convincing if he were able to tell us &ldquo;the same thing will happen here as happened with regard to So-and-so.&rdquo; This is not the first tariff of its kind, and we would be more in sympathy with this case if he were not so very theoretical.  He might give us some examples of the great inconveniences caused by those arrangements for packing and grinding in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and several other Deputies on that side are in business and ought to have experience of this kind of thing.  We would be a lot more in sympathy with them if they could point to the disorganisation of their business, and to the inconveniences caused to their customers by the tariffs which have already been imposed.  Evidently, there is no example of that kind to be quoted.  The real reason why I stood up was to ask the Minister whether, in fixing tariffs of this kind, this point has been taken into account &mdash;that at present a great deal of those goods comes in through the different ports around the country, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Cork, and so on. Obviously, the freight is very small. Under the system of grinding and packing in the Saorstát, presumably all those goods will be distributed from the one centre.  I should just like to know, for my own information, whether in fixing the tariff consideration has been given to the increased cost of distribution of the product.  If not, it would look as if the tariff could not be a success.  If those articles now being ground, say, in Dublin have to compete with the finished product imported direct to Limerick or Tralee, will the tariff be sufficient?  I think that with regard to some of the tariffs already imposed that difficulty has arisen.  Firms distributing from Dublin found that they were far from having the advantage which they at first seemed to have&mdash;that on account of cheap sea freights, and so on, the tariff did not give them that advantage that had seemed to be promised when it was first proposed to them.</P>

      <P>What I am talking about is not protection from internal competition, but protection from external competition, where the article is going direct to the town where it is required. <Col N="799" /> Take the case of a firm here distributing from Dublin, it is in competition with Liverpool when it comes to sell its products in a seaport town in this country.  I should like to know from the Minister whether, in fixing the tariffs, considerations of that kind are taken into account.</P>

      <P>I am not a business man.  Deputy Moore spoke more or less from the business man's point of view in connection with this particular tariff and seemed to think that the business people may not get as much advantage out of it as they ought to get.  A lot of people were congratulating themselves that there was nothing particularly hot in the Budget this year.  Well, here is the spice and the ginger now.  It is in this and the other Resolutions that are being proposed here.  When the people come finally to get some knowledge of all of them, they will find that they are only new methods of extracting money from the people, apart from what the Minister put in the Budget, and when the Minister comes in here and tells us coolly and calmly that there are going to be no extra costs on pepper, ginger or any other spice, we shall take it with a grain of salt.  I think that Deputy Dillon was right when he said that you will either have to pay the piper or the pepper&mdash;either you will get worse pepper or you will have to pay more for it.  Deputy Moore almost confirmed the fact that we are either going to pay more or get less value for our money when he said that the Minister had not taken into account, when putting on the sixpenny duty, whether it would cover everything, including, say, the cost of freight from Dublin to Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>You asked whether the Minister had taken into account whether or not this tariff would be sufficient to cover all of this.  In other words, I take it that the Deputy's point was that there would not be sufficient room in a tariff of that kind. I am afraid it will mean either an <Col N="800" /> increase in the price or a reduction in the quality of the commodity, and that it will be just like the other cases of 25 per cent. and 75 per cent. tariffs in connection with other commodities.  It appears to all of us that when a duty of 6d. a pound eventually gets, by that 6d. a pound eventually gets, by one way or another to the customer. Either it is added on to the price of the commodity which the consumer buys or there is an equivalent reduction in the quality of the article.  That has been the experience of people in connection with the majority of the tariffs introduced in this State, and I do not think that anybody can point to the contrary.</P>

      <P>There is one point in this discussion which, in case a wrong impression should be given to the House and in case some of us might be taken as being in agreement with it, I should like to have made clear.  When is a monopoly not a monopoly?  That is the point which was raised on this side of the House, I think, by Deputy Dillon.  In one breath we are asked to consider giving a monopoly, with all the unfairness surrounding the granting of a monopoly; but in the next part of the discussion we hear of the case of an industry which is of such a small dimension in the particular product under discussion that it does not give any scope whatever for any other business to interfere with it or produce that commodity.  If it is a small concern with, say, a production of only £2,000 or £3,000, will others be allowed to compete against that small industry so that it will be of no use to anybody, from the point of view of giving employment&mdash;or if it does give employment, it will be at such small, poor and hungry wages that it would not be worth while trying to tariff the industry into the country&mdash;or will that business be allowed to exist because it is a monopoly?  These are points which very often go astray in this House, and they are points which are very serious in practical business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> If the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to answer Deputy Dillon, I think he will have, from the crude way in which I have put the matter, the views of business-men in this connection.  It would be very dangerous, indeed, to suggest that, because there is a monopoly in a certain small business, which does not lend itself to the entering of others into competition with it, that concern should be put down by reason of letting loose, or attracting, or encouraging others to go in and destroy that business, and, incidentally, to destroy themselves.  This is a matter that has to be carefully watched and properly balanced as, otherwise, it will lead to chaos in trade and business in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Moore, the amount of duty considered necessary to limit importation of any class of goods and encourage their manufacture here at home is, of course, determined, having regard to all the considerations that naturally arise.  It is quite true that, in so far as in any industry the number of centres at which the production of goods will take place will be less than the number of ports and harbours through which, previously, importation took place, a greater amount of internal transportation will become necessary when the goods are produced here instead of being imported.  I think, however, that it is not unusual for traders to make a sort of general charge against the price of their commodities, designed to cover the cost of transportation to all centres.</P>
      <P>On that account, they put themselves into a position to charge a fixed price for their products in different areas. It may not be the same price in all areas, as sometimes a different practice is adopted.  Generally speaking, the amount of the tariff is determined with a view to securing that the whole of the market will be reserved for Saorstát producers, even though in particular localities and in certain harbour areas or remote districts that may not prove to be so.  Deputy Minch raised a very important point when dealing with the speech of Deputy Dillon.  You can rail against monopolies, and I take it that when Deputy Dillon does so, he is concerned more with whatever political propaganda he can make against the Government rather than putting forward a serious contention which the Dáil should take into account.  As Deputy Minch stated, there was an obvious contradiction in the Deputy's speech.  He denounced the idea of monopoly for this purpose and, at the same time, ridiculed the idea of the market being large enough to enable more than one firm to engage in the trade.</P>

That may happen, and is likely, in view of the fact that the total trade is worth £3,000.  Let us assume that there are seven grades of pepper.  The Minister stipulates that there will be no increase in price. The consumer has been paying 2d. an oz. for grade one pepper, and the monopolists, having got £3,000 worth of trade, proceed to offer grade five at a price which enables the retailer to sell it at 2d. an oz.  But what is the retailer to do when he is confronted with a tariff of 6d. per lb. except to take whatever pepper is offered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>To delete reference No. 4 and all relevant references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points in connection with this amendment.  I think the Minister should tell us something about the pipe-manufacturing trade in the country.  From reference No. 4 it would appear that the only thing we are able to do in the country is to stain and polish pipes, or when a hold 3-16ths of an inch in diameter is put through the stem, to enlarge it. We should like to know why a tariff of 37½ per cent. is put on manufactured <Col N="807" /> pipes, what employment is given in the country at the present time on pipe-making, and what employment is likely to be given when this increased tariff is imposed.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Special Provisions&rdquo; are the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1919 shall apply to the duty mentioned at this reference number.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what the effect of that provision is, because the reference to Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1919 does not clear up the situation in any way, as far as I can find out at any rate.  Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1919 makes provision for a preference on goods consigned from, grown, produced or manufactured in the British Empire under the Second Schedule of the Act. There is nothing, however, about pipes in the Second Schedule of the Act. There is a reference to articles that were chargeable with the new import duty by Section 12 of the Finance Act of 1915.  When we refer to the Finance Act of 1915, we find that the only articles dealt with are motor cars, musical instruments, clocks and cinematograph films, but there is nothing at all with regard to pipes.  I should like to ask the Minister, if this provision is made operative by having some kind of connection with the Act of 1919, what exactly is the connection with the Finance Act of 1919 that would make it operative?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will refer to paragraph 3 in the Resolution he will see that the necessary provision is made to ensure that Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1919 will apply in this case.  The effect in this case is to institute a preferential rate of two-thirds of the full rate for goods that are produced in Great Britain or any of the Dominions.  The duty has been in operation for some years on pipes which at importation were valued at 1/6 or more.  The effect of this reference is merely to reduce the price limit and to make pipes, which are valued at 1/3 or more at importation, subject to the duty because pipes of <Col N="808" /> that value are now being manufactured here.</P>
      <P>The sole effect, therefore, of the change is to bring the duty which has applied for some years to pipes over 1/6 in value into operation in respect of pipes over 1/3 in value.  It is true that the complete manufacture of pipes in the Saorstát has declined for some time past.  There have been certain changes in the pipe manufacturing business, and by specialisation in the production of the bowls in an unfinished state from the raw material certain districts on the Continent have, more or less, secured complete control of that business.  Most, if not all, pipe manufacturers in Great Britain and in this country do not completely manufacture the bowl in the pipe.  They adapt it, shape it and finish it, and otherwise prepare the pipe for use.</P>
      <P>There are, in fact, 50 or 60 people employed in the pipe manufacturing industry here, and some increase in the number may result from the imposition of this duty.  The increase may not be very great, having regard to the fact that a duty is already in existence upon a very large range of the products produced.  The employment in the pipe manufacturing industry has, in fact, declined over the past decade or so.  One effect of the duty may be to arrest a further decline.  That decline, of course, has been occasioned by a change in the habits of smokers. Pipe smoking has lost its popularity as compared with the cigarette.  There is still a very large variety of pipes manufactured here, and it is desired that, so far as it is possible to do so, employment should be given in their manufacture.  The pipes produced here are of good quality and are available at a reasonable price.  There is no reason why this assistance should not be given to the industry.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether the tariff, as operated in its old form, has had the effect of stopping the importation of pipes, and particularly those of the cheaper varieties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The tariff has been more or less effective on the pipes to which it applies.  The value of the pipes not subject to duty imported is about £9,000 per year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This change in the tariff has not been made because of any increased competition which the industry here is experiencing.  It is due to the fact that the manufacturers have now embarked on a new line of production&mdash;of cheaper pipes than they produced heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that pipes costing approximately 1/3 retail at about 2/- or below that, so that we may expect that wooden pipes costing about 2/- will still be freely available and that, if they are not, the Minister will put an enquiry as to whether a tariff of this kind is being used to get more than the producers are entitled to get?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now bringing the duty down to apply to pipes valued at 1/3.  We may assume that the reason he has done that is because he finds that the pipes costing between 1/3 and 1/6 which were coming in can be manufactured here.  I take it that these pipes were selling at about 2/-?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Again, the effect of this reference is not to impose a new duty, but to alter, to some extent, an existing duty. There has been a duty on watch straps. The duty was 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, but it did not apply to watch straps imported when attached to watches. <Col N="810" /> It only applied to watch straps when imported separately.  The effect of the reference is to impose a minimum duty and make the duties apply to watch straps when imported attached to watches.  The manufacture of watch straps is being done by a couple of firms in the country.  As a very large proportion of the straps imported come in attached to watches, there is no reason why the duty should not apply to these straps because they can be manufactured here quite satisfactorily. A full range of varieties, both in respect of design and prices, is being so manufactured.  The duty, therefore has been extended to cover these straps, while a 6d. minimum rate is being imposed because it is considered desirable to support the duty by such a provision.  It has been our experience that upon articles which are themselves of small value an <i>ad valorem</i> rate, no matter how high, is usually not effective.  We think that in the case of such articles the only effective form of protection that can be given is by a specific rate.</P>

      <P>This, in a sense, is a package tax.  This material, carbontetra-chloride, is a chemical that is used in the manufacture of fire extinguishers, and is generally imported in small containers.  The packing of the commodity is now carried on in the Saorstát.  A certain amount of direct employment is afforded thereby.  In addition, there is not inconsiderable indirect employment in the manufacture of the necessary containers and packing materials.  The Saorstát packed commodity is available at prices which are fully competitive with the prices of imported material, and the effect of this duty is to ensure that the importation of this material in small containers, ready packed, will be discouraged so that the packing of it here will be promoted.</P>

      <P>The containers to which the Minister refers are, I think, of glass.  I would like to know if he is now referring to the foam extinguishers. These, when struck on the floor, project a foam over a conflagration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a duty on fire extinguishers.  It is only a duty on the material that goes into the fire extinguishers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is designed to get the material which goes into fire extinguishers put into a container which is enclosed inside the case of the fire extinguisher.  So far as I am aware, the procedure is that you strike a knob. The knob moves an object inside of the fire extinguisher, which breaks this package.  The contents then escape <Col N="812" /> into the fire extinguisher and it bubbles out with foam over the conflagration. These fire extinguishers, unless properly made, are likely to explode and do a good deal of damage. I do not know how the containers are sealed, but I imagine that they are sealed by annealing the neck of a very fragile glass container.  The carbontetra-chloride is contained in this glass flask, the neck of which is sealed by annealing.  The safety of the fire extinguisher depends on that annealing being properly done.  This is my submission to the Minister, because I am not speaking with first-hand knowledge I suggest to the Minister that expert advice should be sought as to whether adequate guarantees can be given that this work will be done properly, and in a manner which the manufacturers of the fire extinguishers will certify as adequate to maintain the efficiency of the extinguishers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This work is, in fact, being done here now.  There are fire extinguishers being produced here. I understand that some of these extinguishers have proven very satisfactory and are in general use.  We are not proposing merely to have this material packed here.  Fire extinguishers are being produced here at present and, I understand, are giving general satisfaction. The Deputy can be assured that the technical end of this industry is in safe hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that assurance is comprehensive, my difficulty does not arise.  Let me put this case: I have, say, 12 Minimax fire extinguishers. They have to be refilled from time to time with tetra-chloride.  A man goes round to do that.  If properly packed, all is well.  If it leaks the extinguisher may explode or, when it comes to be used, the tetra-chloride may escape and the fire extinguisher be useless.  If all the firms which have fire extinguishers in use here say that it is quite easy to have them refilled here, then the technical objection falls to the ground. I suggest to the Minister that an inquiry be made as to whether people who have fire extinguishers in use here are satisfied that refills can be supplied here.</P>

      <P>This reference imposes a duty of 50 per cent. on bells made of metal and not less than nine inches in diameter, measured externally at the mouth, and also on certain component parts of bells such as tongues, clappers, staples and so forth.  The manufacture of church bells in the Saorstát is an old established industry. There is, however, only one firm engaged in the production of these bells at present&mdash;a firm in Dublin.  The industry is a very highly skilled one, in which all male labour is employed. The Saorstát firm to which I have referred enjoyed for a number of years a very appreciable export trade.  The imposition of duties by various countries upon their products has adversely affected that export trade. Furthermore, there has been some evidence that foreign manufacturers have on occasion obtained contracts for the erection of bells in churches and institutions in the Saorstát.  It has been found difficult to ascertain precisely the value of these contracts but an estimate, prepared by the firm concerned, shows that church bells to the value of about £1,000 a year have been imported.  It is a small industry and the effect of the duty may be more to preserve existing employment in it than to promote an increase.  Having regard to the nature of the industry, the amount of skill required in it and the fact that it was at one time a very important industry in the Saorstát, one would not like to see it disappear.  I think <Col N="814" /> that it is desirable, therefore, that this duty should be imposed, so that the industry may be preserved to some extent.  Having regard to the possibility that some classes of bells which the firm in question could not make may be caught by the duty, we have inserted a licensing provision, so that no difficulty will arise on that account.  The intention is that the duty shall apply only to whatever classes of bells the firm concerned are in a position to supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Astonishingly enough.  I find myself in the extraordinary position of agreeing with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the imposition of this duty.  I think that it is the kind of duty for which a very strong case can be made.  It is designed to preserve a craft which might otherwise perish, a craft which, in time, may develop a very valuable market abroad of a purely luxury character.  There is no danger whatever that this tariff will have serious repercussions on people who cannot afford the price.  There is no question of the poor buying bells of this character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may arise in another way.  The reaction of this tariff on the section of the community least able to bear these burdens will be very limited.  An extraordinarily attractive element in the proposal is that it does contain the possibility of reviving and maintaining a craft which may have considerable possibilities as regards an export market.  Skilled craftsmanship is one thing of which we have as fine natural resources as any country in the world.  In the exercise of it, we can compete with any country in the world.  A tariff of this kind should commend itself to this House and I congratulate the Minister on its imposition.  I think it is a most prudent departure and I regret that it was not brought to the attention of the House earlier so that all sides might join in conferring the protection we are now conferring on what I regard as a very desirable craft.</P>

      <P>There is a duty at present of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on ladders and component parts made wholly or mainly of wood.  In spite of that duty, however, the import of ladders during 1935 was not inconsiderable, amounting in value to over £2,000.  In fact, the employment given in the ladder-producing industry decreased between September, 1935, and March, 1936.  It is difficult to understand why that should be so.  The ladders produced in the Saorstát are, I think, generally agreed to be of satisfactory quality, and they are available at reasonable prices.  Nevertheless, the home firms are finding some difficulty in making headway in face of competition from ladders which are imported, apparently, at very low prices&mdash;prices which, it is contended, cannot be economic.  In those circumstances it was considered desirable to support the <i>ad valorem</i> duty in operation by the imposition of a specific duty which, in this case, takes the form of a duty variable according to the length of the ladder.  The duty is 3/- per rung in the case of extension ladders, and 1/6 per rung in the case of other ladders.  The imposition of this additional duty has been undertaken upon satisfactory assurances from the firms engaged in this business that the price of their products will not be altered as a consequence.  It is not an unimportant industry.  Considerable employment is given in the production of these goods, and it is desirable that the whole of the production should be retained here if possible.  I think that it is possible to do that without any ill effects on the users of these goods, because a comparison between the prices at which they are sold here and the prices at which corresponding goods are sold in Great Britain by firms producing them there shows that there is no difference which is detrimental to the interests of the users of these goods here.  I, therefore, recommend that the <Col N="816" /> variation in duty which is proposed here should be made, that is, that the existing duty of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> should be supported by this specific duty to which I have referred.  In the case of certain classes of ladders there will, of course, be no alteration of duty at all.  It is only in respect of ladders of which large importations are taking place that the additional duty will come into operation and will, we hope, be operative to prevent that importation.</P>

      <P>Here is the difficulty: How is it possible for us to defend the imposition of a duty in excess of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on the manufacture of ladders?  There is no question of ladders being produced on mass production lines.  There is no consumption of ladders on mass production lines.  Admittedly, any firm with a large output will be able to manufacture ladders more economically than a firm with a comparatively small output, but we cannot draw the antithesis there might be between Henry Ford &amp; Co. in Detroit and an Irish motorcar manufacturing firm.  There is no question of mass production over their individual production.  There may be a difference between large and small outputs, but surely any legitimate difference that could exist between a large output and a small output could be met by a 50 per cent. tariff?  If it is not adequately covered by a 50 per cent. tariff, must there not be some shortcoming on the part of the people here who are making the ladders?  So far as I am aware, the extension ladders being made are excellent in quality, and, so far as I am aware, the ordinary ladders made here are excellent quality.  I have heard no complaint, but must there not be something wrong if we have to put a duty of 3/- per rung on an extension ladder in order to meet external competition?</P>

    <P>Can this House feel satisfied that, in the very vague observations which the Minister has made in reference to this heading, he has given any adequate <Col N="817" /> reason for increasing an already very heavy tariff?  I ask the House to understand what this means.  The tariff at present stands at 50 per cent. That means that a ladder which is available in Great Britain for 50/- is costing the consumer here 75/-, and the Irish manufacturers are saying &ldquo;We cannot produce a 50/- ladder in Ireland for 70/-.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it argued that everybody in Great Britain is selling ladders for less than cost, and, if they are selling ladders at less than cost, why are they doing it?  Is it because they love our lovely blue eyes?  Do they not know that, with the existing tariff policy of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, any attempt at dumping will be met by the unanimous support of this House for any tariff it is necessary to put on?  They know our Party stands for tariffs against dumping. They know that the Minister's Party stands for tariffs against anything, and there is nobody in this House who will raise his voice in defence of the dumper.  We have often said to the Minister:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Demonstrate to us that anyone is trying to sell stuff here at a price below the cost of production and we will assist you to put on any tariff you may think necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have often urged on the Minister that if he can demonstrate to us that a foreign Government is attempting to finance dumping here, with a view to making manufacture on reasonable terms impossible in this country, we are prepared to co-operate in meeting that subsidy with any tariff necessary. What ladder manufacturer in England is going to throw his merchandise away <Col N="818" /> for less than it costs him in an endeavour to get into a market which he knows will be closed to him the moment it becomes manifest that he is selling at less than the cost price?  I do not believe anybody who tells me at this juncture that any foreign manufacturer of ladders is selling them in this country at an uneconomic price, because he knows perfectly well that he will be throwing his money away. There is no question of his being able to capture this market by any such method.  That is what irritates me&mdash; that an attempt should be made to fob off this House with that kind of excuse. You are driven inevitably to the conclusion that the manufacturers of these ladders are invited to charge 70/- for a ladder here that would cost 50/- in Great Britain, and that is leaving them a difference of 5/- on a ladder between the price at which it could be imported and the price at which they are selling it.  They come to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and say: &ldquo;We cannot do it; we are being cut out by foreign competition,&rdquo; and we blandly announce that we are going to put 3/- a rung on ladders.  That can only mean that for the 50/- ladder of British production, our `merchants are going to ask 80/- or more.</P>
    <P>I say that is not meeting the responsibilities which these manufacturers should discharge to the community. We are prepared to give them protection; we are prepared to give them an advantage; and we are prepared to handicap foreign competition in order that they will get a fair crack of the whip; but they ought to exert themselves to produce the best that can be produced at a price as near the foreign price as is physically possible for them. I challenge any rational man to say to me that, on a 50/- ladder, we ought to give the Irish manufacturer a 30/- bonus, at the expense of the consumers. Very considerable damage is not going to be done to the community one way or the other, but it is the principle of the thing that is bad, and what I apprehend is, and I have said it here and elsewhere, that if that kind of argument is going to be made by Irish manufacturers.  Irish industry is going to become identified in the public mind of this country with profiteering. <Col N="819" /> I say that would be a great disaster and a grave libel on the majority of Irish industrialists here who have exerted themselves&mdash;in the boot trade, the confectionery trade, the furniture trade, the ready-made clothing trade, and a variety of other trades&mdash;to give the best value they can and have not sought to take the full advantage of the tariff, but, by their increased output, were able to bring prices well below the tariff level.  Activities of this kind are going to asperse the fair name of these industrialists, and I think that, both from the point of view of principle and of the industrialists' reputation in this country, tariffs of that kind should not be granted unless a more convincing case is made for them than the Minister has been able to make to-day.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, there is a certain speciality of extension ladder, for the manufacture of which there are no rights in this country. These are copper ladders, and when manufacturers or their agents are asked to supply this certain type of copper extension ladder, they have to be imported as they cannot be made here.  Probably that is the Minister's difficulty in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but if manufacturers here cannot get patent rights or licences to manufacture specific classes of goods, that cannot be avoided.  I am not basing any case for this tariff on that ground, although the manufacturers might.  My contention is that imports have been subsidised by the firms which have been previously supplying this market and which are anxious to continue doing so.</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to carry out a simple test for himself. He can get the prices of this stuff from the firms producing these ladders here, and he can get the price lists of the firms selling similar ladders in Great <Col N="820" /> Britain, and he can compare them.  If he finds that the ladders imported by a firm in Great Britain are being sold here at prices a little above the price at which they are being sold in Great Britain, even though a tariff of 50 per cent. duty has been paid on them, he will come to the conclusion that either the prices here are being cut or that the articles are being sold at too high a price in Great Britain. The last conclusion would not be reasonable.  I have no doubt that the firm which has had a monopoly of the ladder trade in this country is now fighting hard to put out of business new firms coming into this business and is trying to keep the market for itself.  In these circumstances, it is quite legitimate for a firm to reduce their prices in order to hold their trade, but in so far as the price at which the Irish made goods is sold is quite reasonable in comparison with the English price&mdash;that is the price at which they are sold in Great Britain&mdash;and when we have an assurance that the prices charged here will not be increased, I think we can afford to give them additional protection.</P>

If Deputy Minch is wrong I am very much surprised because he is usually well informed in what he says.

      <P>This imposes a duty on concrete mixers.  A few years ago a firm in Dublin commenced the manufacture of various appliances used in the building trade, such as concrete block-making machines, steel wheelbarrows, and so forth.  The firm made very satisfactory progress along these lines and has now embarked on the manufacture of concrete mixers.  The demand for concrete mixers in the Saorstát is fairly considerable and the article produced here, which is quite a satisfactory one, is sold at a very competitive price.  The manufacturers have given an assurance that the price will not be increased following the imposition of the duty.  The duty which is being imposed, 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, is the same rate of duty as was imposed on similar products, such as the concrete block-making machines to which I have referred. The type of concrete mixer made in the Saorstát is confined to that generally used by builders.  There is another type of concrete mixer which is used by road-making contractors.  It is the intention of the Saorstát firm to manufacture the latter type at a later date.  In the meantime, it will be necessary to permit the importation of the other type of mixer free of duty. That is the reason why the licensing provision set out in the fourth column is being inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like to put to the Minister.  I certainly am not opposing the firm referred to getting a measure of protection where they are going to manufacture a suitable article, but in paragraph (b) we have it set out:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...component parts (other than the engine) of any such apparatus as is mentioned in the foregoing paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I can quite understand that the Minister does not want to see the duty evaded by bringing in these machines in parts and then assembled here by somebody else; but there is another aspect of the matter that I would like to place before the House.  There are numbers of builders who have machines of another type, a somewhat similar type, and who bought them some years ago.  The wear and tear on these machines is considerable and the component parts, when they wear out, can really only be got from the manufacturers, who have the patterns and know the exact sizes and types of the machines.</P>
      <P>I think there is likely to be rather a hardship caused there and I am calling attention to it because this occurs in connection with other items, not exactly of a similar kind, but the same type of question arises.  For instance, when a manufacturer starts in the Saorstát and he sets out to make a particular article, it is rather hard that all the people who have machines, or anything else, of an old or a different type and who have to import parts for them will have to pay a 25 per cent. duty on those parts.  I do not suppose that the Minister will suggest that those component parts should be got from the Irish manufacturer, because the designs are exclusive, possibly in some cases they may be patented, and in this case where you are making dutiable small component parts coming in, you are really only adding to the cost of production in this country.</P>

      <P>Reference No. 13 imposes a new duty of 1/6 a gallon on cider and perry.  There are about 100,000 gallons of cider and perry imported per annum.  The manufacture of cider and perry has been undertaken here and some employment is being given therein, in addition to employment to coopers and carters and incidental employment of that kind. It is estimated that an increase in employment will take place following the imposition of the duty.  The cider made here is made from Saorstát grown apples and Saorstát sugar; it is generally 100 per cent. a Saorstát product.  On the basis of 100,000 gallons of cider and perry being produced here, it is estimated that some 700 tons <Col N="827" /> of apples will be required and about 900 cwts of sugar.  It is understood that there is a plentiful supply of apples around the town of Clonmel, where cider is being manufactured at the present time, and an extension of the industry there will be of considerable advantage to the agricultural community in the vicinity.  The price at which Irish cider is being sold compares very favourably indeed with the price of the imported commodity and consequently it has been decided to impose this duty, which is not a prohibitive duty, but which is sufficient to encourage the use of Irish cider.</P>

      <P>There is a tariff of 4d. a gallon.  It was imposed in 1916.  The Finance Act of 1916 imposed a tariff of 4d. a gallon on cider and perry.  That <Col N="828" /> was taken over when the Free State was established and it still operates both here and in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>With regard to protective tariffs on these beverages, we should remember that we are in a very vulnerable position.  Our exports of beverages and of liquor infinitely exceed our imports.  Any retaliatory measures that might be taken on the other side would mean an immediate prospect of a very grave crisis in this country. The duty on cider and perry will not make much difference anyway, in my opinion.  But it may result in the disappearance of the cider trade altogether. People who drink cider look for a particular brand, and those who look for Clonmel cider will continue to drink it.  I urge that the Minister should not start any competition in the imposition of duties on beverages, or provoke any retaliation, because he might find himself faced with interests in Great Britain as powerful as the interests in this country; and if these people in Great Britain were to get after his hide, he would have to run for cover very quickly.</P>

      <P>This reference imposes a duty on a specific list of articles made wholly or mainly of non-galvanised sheet metal, or of non-galvanised <Col N="829" /> tubular metal, or of a combination of non-galvanised sheet metal and non-galvanised tubular metal and their components.  There are a number of manufacturers in the Saorstát engaged in the production of tubular metal furniture. The imports of iron and steel, not liable to duty, in 1933 amounted to £11,700.  They increased in 1934 to £13,400, and they again increased in 1935 to £15,900.  The manufacture of this type of goods gives a considerable amount of employment, and the existing Saorstát manufacturers are capable of meeting all the estimated demands. Both in quality and in price, I think it can be said that the home-manufactured articles compare very favourably with the imported articles.</P>
      <P>There is, nevertheless, a need for protection because there would appear to me to be a marked tendency on the part of institutions, in which this class of furniture is used, to favour the imported article.  In any event the utilisation of this class of furniture is becoming more general, and it is desirable that its production should be encouraged here at home.  We have from Saorstát manufacturers an undertaking as to the regulation of their prices, which, I think, is quite satisfactory, and which, at the same time, enables the position of the industry to be kept under review.  The duty imposed is 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, which is the same duty that applies to furniture of other descriptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the list of surgical articles mentioned here, including sterilising cases, and sterilising drums.  I take it that surgical apparatus, such as surgical walking frames, and so on, are things prescribed in the practice of orthopaedic surgery.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware that in Great Britain alone there would be 30 or 40 manufacturers of these articles.  Many surgeons would prefer to obtain their supplies of these articles from England, others from New York, but all from some well-known makers who specialise in these things. Now before we put a 50 per cent. duty on orthopaedic appliances, we ought to ask ourselves whether the inconvenience and expense does not outweigh altogether any possibility of advantage accruing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> If any man sets up in Ireland to manufacture articles of this kind which are as good or better than those procurable in London, or Berlin or New York, not only will Irish orthopaedic surgeons patronise him, but he will receive patronage from all over the world.  If they are not as good as they should be in the eyes of the surgeon, no tariff will protect him.  Surgeons will be concerned to see that their patients get the very best class of appliance no matter at what cost.  I suggest that on no pretext should the Minister attempt to interfere by way of any restrictive duty put upon articles used in orthopaedic surgery. Articles of this nature should certainly be exempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Manufacturers here are making these appliances and they are making them as satisfactorily as any manufacturer elsewhere.  In any case we have a licensing provision, not because it would be necessary but because articles of a peculiar design may be sought for.  In ordinary circumstances that power would not be utilised as the full variety of design can, we think, be made available by Irish Free State manufacturers.</P>

      <P>This is what astonishes me.  The Minister will not take the opinion of the College of Science or the <Col N="831" /> College of Surgeons in regard to these implements for orthopaedic surgery.  I do not know whether the Minister knows the meaning of the word orthopaedic. I ask him will he consult experts and he says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That is what irritates me.  The monetary difference here may not mean a £10 note, but there may be all the difference between comfort and misery involved.  Some people have to wear surgical walking frames.  They may be used in connection with diseases of the spine or with hip disease.  I understand implements of this kind are used in cases of fracture.  I do not know, I am not an expert, and I am not asking the Minister to take my opinion; but let him see, at all events, that surgeons get the most efficient implements in the discharge of their duties.</P>
      <P>The poor who go to the free hospital will have to be content with appliances which the local authority will consent to purchase and these will be largely got under recommendations from Government Departments.  The Government Departments will refuse to pay a tariff and the poor will have to do with whatever is provided.</P>
      <P>To any person who ever wore an appliance of that kind or observed persons wearing them, the difference between something properly made for the particular case and the thing that is of a standardised pattern and approximately fits is the difference between comfort and recurrent and perpetual misery.  It means the difference between a reasonably happy life and a life of absolutely unendurable misery.  I put it to the Minister that he should not take my word for it or anybody else's, but should ask for expert opinion from the College of Physicians or the College of Surgeons or from any body of surgeons he pleases to call together, and I am satisfied he will get a fair opinion from any such body.</P>

      <P>It is a business depending almost exclusively on craftsmen.  I do not compare the skill of Berlin with the skill of London.  I say that there are appliances made in Berlin of this kind which you cannot get in London and appliances made in New York which you cannot get in Berlin.  It is a question of individual craftsmen being able to produce them.  The Minister thinks it is easy to get a licence from his Department to import. It is not.  It is a very complicated and tedious operation to get a licence if you have not got the machinery established in your place of business for getting it.  It may be easy for a merchant who is getting them every week and knows how to go about it, but for an individual to get a licence of that character it may take days or weeks.  It involves delay, in any event, in clearing the thing out of the Customs.  If it is going to do no good and going to serve no useful purpose, why must you put blisters of this kind on sections of the community who are already suffering? That is the kind of bureaucratic outrage that irritates me beyond words.  The sufferings of an individual count for nothing in front of the bureaucratic machine.  It is the sufferings of these individuals that make all the difference between a tolerable life and the intolerable servitude that bureaucracy tries to thrust upon the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the case made by Deputy Dillon. These surgical appliances may, in some instances, be better than others.  No matter how well they may be produced here, it may be that just some little neatness, some particular patent, or some particular padding would make, as Deputy Dillon points out, all the <Col N="833" /> difference between comfort and some pain.  The Minister said that Irish manufacturers can produce them as well as anybody else.  That is admitted.  There are good eye specialists in Ireland as well as in other places in Europe, but that does not count.  The person who is suffering is entitled to obtain whatever method there is of easing the pain or even what he might consider would ease the pain.  In connection with these surgical appliances in particular, I think the Minister should not put people to the trouble of applying for a licence and waiting for two or three weeks, or even three months, and then getting a letter saying &ldquo;I am informed that eminently suitable appliances of this character are manufactured in the Saorstát.&rdquo;  I hold that neither the Minister nor anybody in his Department is an authority on that and that the medical profession or the surgical profession should be the judges in the matter. I ask the Minister not to insist on this, but to adopt the suggestion of Deputy Dillon and have a consultation with some members of the College of Surgeons who would know all about these things.  I have seen people suffering with these walking frames and such things.  Some of them are very crude; <Col N="834" /> on the other hand, some of them are very neat and the pain is very slight. I have seen, and I am sure the Minister has seen, very crude appliances upon children of the poor in Dublin. But you will see very neat and well-fitting appliances on the children of the well-to-do.  The children of the poor should be able to have as good appliances as the others.</P>

      <P>While we have not got any satisfactory information from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on any of the tariffs which have been proposed to us up to the present, I think that before he puts a tariff of 50 per cent. on artificial flies for fishing, and fishing hooks with gut attached, he ought to give some indication as to what is the object of this tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly have done so if the Deputy had allowed me to speak first.  The object of the tariff is to secure that those fishing flies and hooks will be manufactured in the Saorstát.  There is a number of firms engaged in the industry already, mainly in Cork, but to some extent also in Dublin.  The value of the imports of those goods, which have been subject to a 15 per cent. tariff since 1932, amounts to approximately £6,000.  Perhaps it is not correct to say that the value of those goods imported is £6,000; the value of the fishing tackle imported is about £6,000, but it is not possible to differentiate between the imports of those goods and other classes of fishing tackle.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is not an important industry.  There are about 20 people employed in it at the present time.  That employment can be increased.  I think most anglers will agree that Irish flies and hooks are quite satisfactory, and that there is no reason why there should be any importation. We have inserted a licensing provision so as to ensure that there will be no temporary difficulty about getting supplies while production is being increased, but I think it is probable that the existing firms are quite capable of supplying all the requirements of the country or the requirements of visitors to this country.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware that there is a very wide variety of artificial flies, particularly for trout-fishing, and unless there is a big order for artificial flies for the next general election to catch some votes, I cannot see what use this tariff will be.  First of all, you find in connection with this amendment here that the wealthier type of fisherman escapes because the power of the Revenue Commissioners is curtailed by the question of value.  For instance, it says here in the Schedule: &ldquo;Artificial flies suitable, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, for use in fishing and of a value not exceeding 20/- per gross&rdquo;&mdash;I hope I am not reading it wrongly.  Well, throughout the country there are many country people of the artisan class to-day who find not only healthy amusement, but who can, in a sense, augment their incomes where free trout-fishing is available, and these people undoubtedly will find great difficulty in getting the particular type of fly they use.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that there will be no increase in the price, and I hope he is right, but even if there is no increase in price, these people will still be faced with the difficulty to which I have referred, because, at the present time, according to the fly libraries, the scope and variety of artificial flies is so wide that even the most subtle trout can be tempted by a particular fly.  I have no experience, of course, of the manufacture of these things here, but it seems to me that the manufacturers will need at least to keep up with the varieties in the present-day fly libraries if the fishermen are going to get a fair chance.  My belief is that there will be, undoubtedly, a lot of unnecessary delay and inconvenience.  I do not know who advises the Revenue Commissioners as to what is a suitable fly.  I suppose it is dealt with by officials, but undoubtedly there will be trouble and inconvenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the objections to this duty, or in fact any duty, on fishing <Col N="838" /> flies is that, if you want to bring in some flies, say, from Great Britain, you must get them in by parcel post, because you cannot use the letter post in connection with articles that are dutiable.  That, in itself, will be an inconvenience.  I observe that salmon flies are excluded because they usually cost more than 20/- per gross. Frankly, I thought it was 20/- a dozen until I looked at it more closely.  Is it proposed in this Schedule to charge 50 per cent. duty on trout flies which cost 1/8 a dozen and 15 per cent. on flies which cost more than 1/8 per dozen? If that is the case, I do not think this tariff will have any effect at all.  Most of the artificial trout flies imported would cost more than 1/8 a dozen, and surely the administrative difficulty of handling a tariff which imposes 50 per cent. on trout flies which cost less than 1/8 a dozen, and 15 per cent. on trout flies costing more than 1/8 a dozen, is going to be very great.  It is going to be absolutely impossible to administer it because it is obviously cheaper to charge 1/9 a dozen for the trout flies, and thus get the advantage of the 15 per cent. rate, than to charge 1/8 and be subject to the 50 per cent. rate. Has that aspect of the matter presented itself to the Minister's mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to address his mind to this problem.  Trout flies, normally, will cost between 1/- and 1/8.  Let us suppose that the average price is 1/6. That plus 50 per cent. is 2/3, but 1/9 plus 15 per cent. is only 2/-, and therefore it is better from the importer's point of view to pay 1/9 to the British fly manufacturer, and thereby be subject to only 15 per cent., than to pay 1/6 and be subject to the 50 per cent. It would be cheaper to pay the British manufacturer 1/9 for flies than it would be to pay 1/6; so that the net result of the tariff will be that people here will pay the British manufacturers so much more for their flies than they paid previously.  That is the only effect it will have, and surely that is little short of imbecile.  I put it to the Minister that a sensible gesture in this matter would be to provide that all artificial flies would be free of duty, because no revenue will be derived, and no increase in production will be available to the makers of flies in this country since a man who is in the habit of fishing with a certain type of fly will get it no matter where it is produced, unless the Minister were to put on a tariff of 5/- per fly or something of that kind.  I strongly urge the Minister not to legislate a tariff which, on the face of it, is ineffective and absurd.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how does he propose to deal with the question of flies brought in by tourists for fishing?  It seems to <Col N="840" /> me that the Minister might very easily find that the cure was worse than the disease, because if we get a name here for annoying tourists about a whole lot of things, such as the value of the flies they have about their persons, and so on, the Minister might very easily find that this, instead of being a revenue-producing tariff, was quite the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In every case where there is a limit of value beyond which or below which the duty does not apply, there is always the possibility that goods that are in or about the border line will be invoiced incorrectly and so escape the duty.  In so far, however, as it is not desired to apply this duty to articles valued on importation at more than 20/- a gross, that limitation has been imposed.  If the Deputy urges that this should be applied to all flies, I shall consider it, but I do not think it is necessary to do that, particularly as the firms think that this will give them the protection they require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that this imposition of a tariff of 50 per cent. will create any new industry or any great demand for Irish tied flies?  He must be aware that most Irish anglers buy their flies locally, and that a number of them make these flies.  As a matter of fact I engaged in that little pastime for a number of years.  A number of visiting tourists and sportsmen come here for the fishing in the Irish lakes and rivers, and many of them will bring their own salmon flies, which are more expensive than the ordinary trout-fly. It would be difficult to expect revenue officials to assess the value of these flies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no question <Col N="842" /> of assessing the value of flies brought in by tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that gets rid of the question raised by Deputy Dillon. Let us come to a question which concerns anglers in this country.  Anglers here very rarely procure salmon or trout flies made outside the country. There are some very eminent firms across the Channel, who make a particular class of flies, particularly salmon flies, which are very expensive. Irish firms also make these flies, but it has been my experience over a long number of years, that salmon and trout-flies are always bought locally.  There is a certain tradition about tying flies in certain areas. I regard this tax as really provocative and I do not think it is going to do any good for people who the flies.  A couple of years ago I was invited by people in the industry, some of whom reside in Dublin, to discuss this matter and after a long conversation they were satisfied eventually that if a duty was imposed on imported flies it would not be of much benefit.  I pointed out to them that the trade in imported flies was almost negligible, for the reason that flies were tied here in certain areas by people who had a tradition for that work as well as local knowledge.  I also want to know why fishing hooks with gut attached are included in this duty.  These are used by people who fish for trout or salmon with bait.  In fishing for salmon powerful hooks are used but the modern method is to use a steel wire instead of gut.  Ordinary fishing hooks with gut attached are usually sold for something like 1/- a dozen, and the better class for 1/6 a dozen.  These are usually used by bait anglers, most of whom are working-class people, who cannot afford to spend much money on fishing tackle.  There is a fair demand for fishing hooks with gut attached, but the demand does not warrant a tax of 50 per cent.  The Minister must be aware that we do not manufacture fishing hooks here, and that the gut comes here in hanks because we do not make it.  I feel that it is unwise to tax these items and I do not see that any good purpose will be served by the Minister pressing this proposal.  I ask him to <Col N="843" /> reconsider that portion of the Schedule for the reasons I mentioned, that there is not a huge demand for these articles, and that the tax on fishing hooks and gut would not yield any revenue worth talking of, while it might be provocative. Notwithstanding the assurance the Minister gave, it might be the means of warning off anglers from coming to this country.  I think the amount secured from the tariff and the amount of labour given would be infinitesimal.  The Minister must know that two or three experts could in an ordinary eight-hour day tie as many flies as would satisfy the requirements of the biggest establishment.  I believe the yield from this duty would be very small, and the trouble involved very great.  Notwithstanding his assurance some visiting tourists might be alarmed if they were told there was a tariff on flies.  Therefore, I urge him to reconsider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the points raised by the Deputy, and I can assure him that firms here are satisfied that there is an appreciable importation of these goods, which could be made here satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have a talk with some of these people.  I do not want to decry native workmen or native manufacturers, but we do not manufacture gut or hooks, and, as far as flies are concerned, certain flies tied by firms across the Channel have a world-wide reputation.  I do not suggest that we have not a reputation for flies tied here.  It is not a case of competition, but the leaning a man may have to get goods from certain firms. I do not want to advertise any firms with a world-wide reputation for the strength of their gut, the length of their cast, or the material they put into their flies, but I could mention several flies that are commonly used on Irish lakes.  The Minister must be aware that some of the material for these flies is very difficult to get.  It may be true that some of the firms enjoy what I might call a monopoly of feathers, and that resort is had to dyeing these feathers, but there is not doubt that <Col N="844" /> some of the firms have a world-wide reputation for the quality of their goods.  As one who has had considerable experience, I find, without mentioning the name of any firm, that I have had a number of flies for a second season without their colours fading, because of their natural feather.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, and to have a further interview with the gentleman who instructed him that this tax was necessary.</P>

      <P>This Resolution proposes a duty of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on parchment (including vellum) having matter printed thereon and imported in bulk quantities. There is at present a Customs duty of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on printed paper matter produced by the use of movable type.  That duty does not apply to the type of document with which this Resolution deals.  Our large printing establishments here print on parchment, and in addition, I understand, a firm at Naas has installed special machinery for the printing of legal documents.  Though these facilities exist here, it is, nevertheless, a fact that there are a large number of people who use a considerable quantity of legal stationery of the type covered by this Resolution and are in the habit of sending their printing work outside the country.  It is not possible for us to get any precise information as to the value of the trade, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce considers that the duty applicable to matter printed <Col N="847" /> on paper should be extended to matter printed on parchment.</P>

      <P>This is a protective tariff.  It imposes a duty of 6d. per square yard on certain classes of sheets or slabs made wholly or mainly of fibre as described here in the Resolution. If the Deputy will turn over the page, he will see that they are described as those which have not been varnished, painted or polished before importation and are designed, constructed and suitable for use in building. Compositions made of plaster of Paris imported in sheets or slabs are liable to duty under the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 4) Act, 1932, at the rate of 9d., with a preferential rate of 6d., per square yard.  This duty was imposed to encourage the manufacture of these articles in the Saorstát and all the requirements are now supplied from home sources and a substantial amount of employment is afforded in their manufacture. Recently, a new industry for the manufacture of plaster board, a special type of plaster slab, has been established in Dublin.  Plaster used in the manufacture of this plaster board is not produced in the Saorstát.  Slabs of the description referred to in this Resolution can be substituted for plaster of paris slabs and the purpose of the Resolution is to encourage the use of the home manufactured article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has stated all the facts in connection with this.  He is quite right in saying that there is a native industry for plaster slabs, and these, in certain measure, compete with these products, but I think there is a good deal more to be said about it.  The plaster slabs made in this country are produced at a reasonable price and the material in them is excellent, but these slabs which are imported&mdash;I suppose you would really call them emulsified wood fibre&mdash;are used where speed is an essential or where a house has to be dried more quickly than would be the case by leaving it to dry by air.  There is much less water used in the process of manufacture of these slabs and certain builders find it necessary to use this material.  I think this duty of 6d. a yard would work out somewhere about 40 per cent., but it is quite <Col N="851" /> absurd for the Minister to suggest that they are in competition with the plaster slabs in that they are two entirely alternative processes of manufacture.</P>
      <P>For some years, there was a difficulty in getting plastering work completed and these sheets were put in by carpenters and gave considerable employment to labourers, a class of labour very much in need of employment at present.  I do not mean that they put them up, but they had the handling of them the whole way along.  These sheets are afterwards skimmed by a plasterer, and I suggest that if you take the labour content of the two processes, you will find that the fibre slab has slightly more labour in it than the local plaster slabs.  I suggest that the Minister has completely overlooked the case in which a job has to be done in a hurry or in which a building has to be dry in a certain period, and that, instead of this being a protective duty, it is really a revenue producing tariff, because these goods will have to be used for certain work.  In that way, the Minister is only increasing the cost of certain types of building and I ask him to reconsider this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out again that we are in the difficult position of being asked to vote a tariff without any information even attempted on the matters which we consider vital.  Any information we have got has been got mainly from Deputy Dockrell, and not from the Minister, who at the moment is deputising for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is an extraordinary conception of Ministerial duty to the House.  I think it would have been much more satisfactory if there had been an adjournment when the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to withdraw, and some other business taken on, so that we would have a Minister who would at least make an attempt to deal with the important questions raised in all these tariff matters.  We got no information, although it was explicitly asked for, on the question as to what was the <i>ad valorem</i> equivalent of the particular duty proposed here, or whether it was <Col N="852" /> possible to calculate it.  We got no information as to the amount of goods now imported which are expected to be kept out.  We got no information on which we might be able to base any conclusion as to the increased cost of these articles to the public, especially in connection with building, and we got not the slightest information as to whether there will be any additional employment, the type of employment, or even an estimate of the expected increase in employment that is supposed to follow the imposition of the tariff.</P>
      <P>It was not easy to hear the Minister when he was reading out the information he pretended to supply to the House, but there was a portion in which, so far as I could follow it, he pointed out that, in the Finance Act of 1932, a duty was put on plaster of Paris constructions and that that had been successful.  The next statement I heard was that there was a new industry started and it was intended to help that industry, so that these new slabs could be substituted for the plaster of Paris.  I do not know if I heard the Minister aright in that matter?</P>

I could not possibly follow what he was saying, but I distinctly heard the words &ldquo;substituted for plaster of Paris slabs.&rdquo;  Is it to be in competition merely with the imported plaster of Paris or is it to be in competition with the articles made from plaster of Paris in the industry established in 1932?  As I say, it was difficult to follow such information as was given, and we are left without any information on the essential points so far as this tariff is concerned.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete reference No. 18 and all relevant references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>Reference No. 18 in the schedule proposes to change the rate of duty on safety razor blades and unsharpened blanks for safety razor blades from 15 per cent. with a preference duty of 10 per cent. imposed under the Finance Act of 1932, the effective rate of duty under that Act being more 10 per cent. than 15 per cent.  The reference in the Schedule now proposes to raise that duty to 75 per cent. after, say, four years of operation of the industry in the country under the 10 and 15 per cent. tariffs.  I would like to hear from the Minister what is the position with regard to the industry, how many people are employed in it and what has happened that necessitates the raising of the duty on these razor blades from 10 or 15 to 75 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm to consider reference No. 19 at the same time, because the two duties more or less hang together.  The existing duty of 5/- per gross on safety razor blades was imposed when a concern at Enniscorthy in Wexford commenced the manufacture of these blades by what I may describe as hand-work methods.  In the process of their manufacture they employed from 70 to 80 people, but they touched only a comparatively small part of the total market available for these goods. Subsequently another concern started at Carlow to manufacture blades by automatic machine methods.  Ordinarily I would not be disposed to oppose the introduction of mechanical methods of production in any industry, but in this particular case there <Col N="855" /> appeared to be no advantage to be secured by doing so, and in fact there would be obvious disadvantages in respect of employment.  The blades produced by the automatic process were not sold any cheaper than the blades produced by the hand-work process but the employment given was very small in comparison with the employment that was being given in the hand-work process and that might be given if the blades produced at Carlow were also produced by the same method.</P>
      <P>That situation persisted for some time.  It was, however, noted at the end of last year that the total production of both factories was by no means equal to the requirements of the country and, despite the duty, which was not a very high duty, the importation of razor blades was still very considerable, amounting last year to the sum of £35,000 in value.  I was, however, somewhat reluctant to consider the increase of the duty because the raising of the duty might, I felt, result in the further development of the automatic process of production here with consequent loss of employment despite an increase in the total output.  Subsequently, I felt it was desirable that we should get to the stage when we would be supplying our own requirements in these goods and, after some discussion with each of the firms concerned, an arrangement was made under which the output of the automatic process was, by agreement, limited to a certain quantity of blades, and the question of extending production by each concern was further considered and to ensure that that would take place it was decided to increase the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty is being increased from 5/- to 12/- per gross.  It is also being extended to cover the blanks referred to in reference No. 18.  These were subject to duty heretofore, but were admitted free under licence.  Now, the manufacture of these blanks is being undertaken from the steel strip which is defined in reference No. 19.  We are putting a duty on that steel strip in order to discourage the further extension of the industry by the automatic <Col N="856" /> process to which I have referred. The steel strip will be admitted free of duty to the concerns engaged in the industry and to any other concern which engages in the industry in the same way, that is, by adopting the method of working which gives a comparatively considerable amount of employment as against the automatic process.  There is, I think, no question as to the quality of the blades produced here.  They are quite satisfactory and the prices are equally satisfactory. They are, in fact, quite low, and one of the concerns has already been successful in securing orders for export, and in fact certain quantities of razor blades produced here have been exported during the last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Enniscorthy firm. The imported blades are all sold at a higher price than the blades produced here, which are retailed, I understand, at 1d. or 2d. per blade.  The position that will result after the enactment of this Resolution is that the safety razor blades will be manufactured in Enniscorthy and Carlow&mdash;at Carlow partly by the automatic and partly by the hand-work process&mdash;and we trust that the production of these two firms, or any other firm that may engage in the industry, will equal the full requirements of the country, and thus eliminate the item of £35,000 which still remains on our import list.  The manufacture of the blanks, which has already been done at Carlow and has been undertaken at Enniscorthy also, will have to be undertaken by any other firm that comes into the business. There will be a duty on the steel strip which, however, will be admitted free of that duty under licence to the two firms I have mentioned, or to any other concern that engages in this business by the hand-work method.  By that system we hope to promote the maximum amount of employment, to get the full requirements of the country produced, and have these requirements met at prices which are as satisfactory as the existing prices charged by these firms.</P>

      <P>I did not understand that.  The purpose is with the object of controlling two things, namely, to prevent a firm setting up any new process of manufacture by an automatic process, and to see that the Carlow firm keeps to its agreement. I think this is the first time that we heard of this particular principle of preventing modern methods of production introduced by the Department.  It is the first intimation that we have had from the Government Benches of this departure on their part.  It is an entirely new principle, and is against the general policy of the Government. The Minister will admit that he started off by admitting that.</P>

      <P>It means that you want to have less boundaries set up against lesser firms.  What applies here applies in 90 per cent. of the cases where you have a big firm set up against others with less effective machinery.  In every case, you probably would have more labour given by the older method.  The Minister, up to the present, has not attempted to state what he is doing here.  I suggest that this policy requires a remodelling of the Government's whole tariff policy, unless the Minister can show some particular reason in this case for objecting to the use of modern methods.  I do not say it is not a good policy, but it is, undoubtedly, in conflict with what has been done up to the present.  Modern methods do lead, all over the world, generally speaking, to smaller employment.  You have fewer people employed as a result of the introduction of modern machinery, but this is the only occasion that I can recall, where this principle was laid down by the Minister.  In none of these operations up to the present has he been guided by this headline of policy, and it does seem to me to require an altering of his whole policy in this regard.  Another point is he told us that the greater firms employ fewer workers per unit of output.</P>

      <P>The Minister acknowledges this contradiction out of which he cannot get.  Undoubtedly, if there is any lesson to be drawn from development in other branches where there is sufficient output&mdash;and that is the meaning of the tariffs&mdash;the result should be that there would be a much higher output in that particular type of factory and, consequently, a cheaper production of the article.  But we have the extraordinary spectacle here of a firm setting up with a small market and obviously not able to produce under modern conditions&mdash;I mean economically produce under modern conditions&mdash;because, if so, they should be able to produce a much cheaper article with modern machinery.  They were not able to do that, because the market is too small; and they are being run out of the market.</P>

I am allowing for a lot of things&mdash;possibly the price will be 6d.  Again the Minister assumes that the home blades will not go up to that price.  Even though they are not working commercially satisfactorily, a greater factory, working with modern machinery, does not seem to fulfil modern requirements.  If the Minister examines this particular case in all its bearings, I think he will find it throws considerable light upon his whole tariff policy, and that is the reason why I ask for very much greater consideration from that point of view in this connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>To delete reference No. 19 and all relevant references thereto in columns, 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us a certain amount of very extraordinary and interesting information on amendment No. 18.  He told us that the purpose of putting 10/- per lb. on untempered steel strip imported for the purpose of manufacturing safety razor blades was to prevent the manufacture of safety razor blades by automatic method beyond the quantity that can be manufactured by the automatic machinery that existed in the country at the present time.  We have just had the members of the Labour Party voting for a tariff of 75 per cent. on safety razor blades.  The circumstances are that for the last four years there has been a tariff of 15 per cent. with a preference rate of 10 per cent. on those blades, and a factory has existed and given employment at Enniscorthy and at Carlow.  Even if the Enniscorthy factory were competed against by the factory at Carlow manufacturing by automatic processes, the factory as far as we can hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not suffered in any way in its employment or in its output.  The factory at Carlow was able to charge prices for its automatically-produced blades that were as high as the prices charged by the factory producing by hand production methods.  The users of safety razor blades are going to pay&mdash;the Minister need not persuade us they are not&mdash;the difference in increased cost between a 15 per cent. and a 75 per cent. tariff.  Whether or not the Minister was right in saying that £35,000 worth of safety razor blades was imported annually into the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said they were imported last year in spite of the tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister stands over that figure it gives us some indication as to the increased cost that is going to be paid by the users of safety razor blades under a 75 per cent. tariff.  The interesting thing about the No. 19 proposal is that we have had very serious disagreements between the employees and employers in some very important industries throughout the country on the question of the introduction of labour-saving machinery. As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, one of the Minister's recent great activities has been the introduction here of a very big and modern foundry, which is going to prejudice very seriously the employment given in quite a large number of small old-established foundries throughout the <Col N="865" /> country.  It will prejudice them both in their employment and in the security of the capital that is put into those industries.  But the first magnificent gesture of the Minister in this matter of dealing with labour-saving machinery is in regard to the safety razor blade industry. I do not think the Minister should let pass the occasion of his putting before the House a proposal of this particular kind without indicating to us why this proposal is made in regard to the safety razor blade industry&mdash;an industry in which one would expect that the greatest possible use would be made of automatic machinery.</P>

I am asking whether the Minister, arising out of the difficulties he has experienced in some other industries where workers have been making complaints about labour-saving devices, has anything to say to the House in regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussion on the duty at No. 18 I explained the circumstances which led to the introduction of this duty.  I just rise now to defend my general principles.  I am in favour of the machine; I am in favour of the labour-saving device when it means reduced cost.  I believe that if it does mean reduced cost it will in the long run mean increased employment as a <Col N="866" /> general rule.  It has not infrequently happened in certain industries that mechanisation was proceeded with to an uneconomic extent.  I believe it has happened in this industry.  It happened in another industry in Dublin which prospered when it was working by hand methods or semi-mechanical methods and collapsed when 100 per cent. mechanical production methods were introduced.  In any event, I am dealing with this particular case on its merits.  Our experience has shown that the hand-work method of production is just as efficient, having regard to the price of the product, as the automatic machine method.  Under these circumstances I am in favour of the hand-work method, because it means, relatively, about five times the amount of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points that the Minister has not yet made clear in this connection and I trust he will do so now.  I gather that in the Carlow factory at present the machinery is not employed to the full capacity there.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that cannot be said, then they are not capturing the market because they cannot produce more&mdash;because they have reached the limit of production with their plant &mdash;and therefore the ground for a tariff collapses so far as they are concerned and we can leave them out of it.  I should like to know if the Minister is serious when he says that he is not in a position to say whether one of the two firms for which he claims a tariff is not working to its full capacity.  He is not in a position to state whether that is so or not.  I gather that that is the position.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the factory as it stands.  It is either producing to its full capacity or it is not.  The Minister first told me that he did not know whether or not it was producing to its full capacity.  I suggest that, for a Minister introducing a tariff, that is an extraordinary attitude for him to assume.  Then he told me that the factory could produce considerably more than it is producing at present.  When I pointed out that it followed, therefore, that it was not producing to its full capacity at present, he said that that did not follow because, apparently, what the Minister had in mind was an enlarged factory. I am speaking, however, of the present factory and, as far as it is concerned, there is no excuse for the increase in the tariff because, according to the Minister, they are not producing to their full capacity&mdash;or is that his contention? Which line is the Minister taking?  Is it his line that they are producing to their full capacity or is it his line that they are not producing to their full capacity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good! That is the information I was denied a few moments ago, and denied with a certain amount of indignation when I drew an obvious conclusion.  That being so, the Minister must recognise that he has no premise on which to base his argument as to the failure of mechanisation there, because the machinery, according to his statement of a minute ago, is not being worked to the full.  There is no justification for a conclusion to the failure of mechanisation or of the mechanical process. I hold, therefore, that this is not an exceptional case.  I am not arguing in favour of that particular process&mdash; of the substitution of machinery for hand labour&mdash;but I say that this is not exceptional, and the Minister's argument does not show that it is exceptional.  On the contrary, if it shows anything, you have here a factory that, the Minister says, owing to the fact that the market was not sufficiently protected, is now working up to its full capacity.  It is not working up to its full capacity.  We should assume that, if it were working to its full capacity, it should produce cheaper.  If that does not follow from the premises before us, I confess that I do not know what does follow. Therefore, I say, we are not dealing with an exceptional case here, and that is what I want to indicate to the Minister.  You are giving special treatment, but the argument that is employed applies to any other number of industries as well, and, in a tariff policy that the Minister has now been sponsoring for a number of years, it is rather late in the day to wake up to that particular argument in favour of the number of things that have been done by the Minister recently.</P>
      <P>There is another matter on which, perhaps, the Minister could give us information.  I gathered from what he stated that there is about £35,000 worth of blades coming into the country at present, and that the amount manufactured here is a very small proportion indeed.</P>

What additional employment does he expect will be given?  You do not get it by dividing the amount produced here at present by such-and-such a figure and then multiplying it, but has the Minister any idea of the amount of additional employment that will be afforded.  I think the Minister mentioned 90 or 100 people in the Enniscorthy factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a similarity, but they do not hang together. They are not brought forward as three parts of the one proposition, as either of them could have been proposed separately.  No. 20 deals with advertising cards, price cards, show cards and similar articles made wholly or mainly of cardboard.  There is a considerable market for these counter show cards in the Saorstát, and it is a business that is capable of being extended very greatly.  I am not in a position to give the precise figures of the imports of these articles, but it is believed the market is valued at about £35,000 per annum.  The production of these lithographed show cards is very skilled work, and the wages paid to the employees often range as high as £8 a week for the skilled artist, and £5 or £6 for the lithographic printers. In fact, about 60 per cent. of the total cost of production is represented by labour.  It is a type of industry which, in my opinion, should receive every encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that labour represented 50 per cent. or 60 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty per cent.  The production of these show cards is taking place here, and it is anticipated that at the end of three or four months after the duty is imposed, it should be possible to supply the full requirements of the market from home sources.  We have attached a licensing provision, because it may be necessary to grant the privilege of free importation in certain cases where requirements cannot be met from home sources for a period <Col N="871" /> after the imposition of the tariff. Apart from the desire to meet the difficulties of firms during that period, there should be no necessity for utilising that licensing provision except in very exceptional circumstances.  The duty proposed is 50 per cent., and it is considered that that duty should be effective in securing that orders will be diverted from external to internal sources.  There may be still for certain firms trading both in Great Britain and here, which advertise on a large scale, some advantage in having all their advertising material produced in bulk and imported despite the duty.  On the whole, I think we will be able to get a far larger part of the business done here if the duty is imposed.  It is a business we should encourage, because of the extent to which it is carried on, and the extent to which it is likely to increase in the future, as well as the nature of the employment afforded.  We have satisfied ourselves, and have received assurances, that the duty will not involve any increase in the prices charged by Saorstát firms for this work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that I was with the Minister until the last, few words.  It is a pity he made that statement. I gather that this duty will apply to firms of various kinds that sell articles in this country, and that when these articles are sent over, show cards will have to be sent also. The Minister thinks that in such cases, with bulk production, that these firms may probably pay the duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be.  The Minister's earlier statement indicated that 60 per cent. of the money went on wages, and that to a certain extent had a counter action on the statement that bulk production would be of advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where I cannot reconcile that portion of the statement with the opening <Col N="872" /> portion.  I gather that it is mainly home manufacturers will have to pay this duty, as the others may determine to do so.  Those that will mainly come under the tariff are home manufacturers or shopkeepers who use show cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an open question as far as the Minister is concerned. The one thing certain is that home manufacturers will have to come under this tariff if they want to send out show-cards with their goods.  Here is a case where, according to the Minister, labour represents 60 per cent. of the work involved.  In that case I admit, apart from the element of mass production, this is not the same as the other cases.  There is no reason why this country should not be able to compete fairly well at a reasonable price with the imported article.  Why, then, is a duty of 50 per cent. necessary? After all the Minister has done, or is alleged to have done, for industry, manufacturers might at least show a little of their patriotism by buying an article equally good, even if there was no tariff on it.  Apparently the strong tariffites need this duty.</P>

      <P>These are the people we are told will not make full use of tariffs, and will not put up prices to the full extent of the tariffs.  Surely the obvious thing is that every business man makes full use of the market, whether it is free or protected, as long as there is free competition.  It is impossible to believe that full use will not be made of this 50 per cent. tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal here is to put a duty of 50 per cent. on printed paper which is pasted on or firmly adhering to cardboard, such printed matter being printed by the use of movable type.  In the Finance Act of 1932 there was a duty of 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> and a preference duty of 10 per cent. on matter printed on paper and imported in bulk quantities. In 1933 that duty was increased to 50 per cent. in respect of matter wholly or mainly produced by means of movable type.  These duties did not apply, however, to matter printed on paper which at the time of importation is pasted on, or otherwise firmly adhering to any other article or substance. At the time the duty was imposed it was considered advisable to insert that provision so as to ensure that the duty would not be charged on cartons which had to be imported with printed labels attached, the labels having been first forwarded from the Saorstát for that purpose.  The necessity for the exemption no longer exists, owing to the development in the Saorstát of the manufacture of cardboard boxes and cartons, which are now subject to duty when imported empty.  As a result of the exemption of the printed matter referred to from the scope of the existing duty upon printed paper, a number of anomalies have arisen.  For instance, importers of printed pictures who have the prints mounted before importation can obtain them free, whereas traders here who desire to give some measure of employment by having the prints mounted in the Saorstát are forced to pay duty on them if they are unmounted at the time of importation. It is considered desirable to regularise the situation by imposing this 50 per cent. duty, which is the same as that on paper printed by means of movable type on the class of goods defined in the second column. Perhaps I have not made the position clear.</P>

What is the native production expected to be and what employment will it give?  Why should a tariff of 50 per cent. be <Col N="876" /> necessary in order to set up such an industry?</P>

The duty is higher than would be required, therefore, for the purpose of affording protection were it not for the fact that in this industry the profits are fairly considerable and, in any event, slight variations in the prices of the commodities would not affect their sale to any appreciable extent.  There is reason to believe that a lower rate of duty would be circumvented or would be inadequate to secure the market for the firm starting here, at any rate <Col N="877" /> in its initial stages.  I accordingly recommend that this rate of duty be imposed.  The arrangement with the firm embraces this price guarantee. If that price guarantee should be departed from then the further maintenance of protection for the industry will have to be considered. I have no reason to believe that the firm will not be able to proceed with their plans upon the basis on which they have been formulated and that a not unimportant industry will be established in the town where a new concern of this kind will be of considerable benefit in easing the unemployment situation.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the Minister proceeds by a regular formula when imposing tariffs of this kind.  He imposes a tariff of 50 per cent. to set up a new industry, and says he has a guarantee that the price of the products will not be increased, just as he did in the case of the razor-blade industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the reason that the tariff has had to be raised from 15 per cent. to 75 per cent.?  It is the Minister's general formula that a <Col N="878" /> tariff of 50 per cent. is required to enable a new industry to be started, and that the prices of its products will not be higher.  Yet the prices are higher.  The only change that ever takes place in the case of a tariff here is that the Minister comes into the House at a later stage and says that he wants a higher tariff&mdash;generally an increase from 33½ to 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>There has been an emergency duty upon these goods of British manufacture since 1932, and that duty is being maintained, but this 75 per cent. duty upon goods of this description of any origin has been in operation since 8th November, 1935. It was imposed then by Emergency Order, and it is now being made a permanent duty in this Resolution; but it has been in operation since last November, although in fact it has not been charged, because licences have been issued freely to all applicants for free importation of these goods.  A factory for the manufacture of these wire nails and screws is being constructed at Limerick.  I understand that building operations are about to commence in the near future, but it will be some months before the factory is in production. It is a large scale enterprise, involving very considerable capital investment, and consequently it will be some time after building is commenced before the factory will be completed. In the meantime, of course, all requirements are being met by the issue of licences for the duty-free importation of whatever quantities are required.</P>
      <P>The duty was imposed by an Emergency Order last November, merely to prevent forestalling of the duty following the public issue of the prospectus of the company which is proposing to engage in this business.  It was felt that the issue of the prospectus might induce people to stock up in anticipation of the duty being imposed, and consequently it was considered necessary to move by Emergency Order. That Emergency Order has now been revoked by an Order made on the day following the Budget, and it is this duty which is now in operation, but it is a duty of the same amount.  The other duty referred to in the fourth column is an emergency duty on goods of British origin which has operated since 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the bulk of the imports of these goods come from duty-free sources, to which the emergency duty does not apply. They come mainly from Belgium, I <Col N="885" /> understand, and on such goods the duty is 75 per cent.  On British goods it is 75 per cent., plus 10 per cent. emergency duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got it clear now that we may discuss this matter on the basis that the duty will be 75 per cent.  The Minister asks the House to pass a duty of 75 per cent. on all these articles which are in use in every house in the country, rural and urban, and the only thing he says with regard to it is that a new industry is going to be established in Limerick. The House is entitled to hear from the Minister what are the facts with regard to the use and consumption and prices of these articles in the country, and what are the conditions under which they will be produced in the country which make it necessary for him to demand from this House authority for a 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty in order that the industry may be set up here.</P>

      <P>The factory which has been established is, I understand, likely to be as well equipped and organised as any factory of its kind anywhere, and able to produce these goods in a thoroughly efficient manner, but Deputies are, I am sure, aware that the production of these goods in other countries is very largely controlled by combines. I think that, as far as Great Britain is concerned, there is really only one firm in the business, and, in these circumstances, the ordinary rate of duty might not be effective to protect the new enterprise started here.  In any event, the amount of the duty can be determined in relation to the probable policy of the firms which are at present supplying the market.  So far as the prices of the goods are concerned, in cases of this kind, these have got to be controlled by a definite understanding with the firm concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that certain Deputies have committed themselves to the theory that the price of any tariffed commodity produced here will be increased by the full amount, or almost full amount, of the tariff.  That has not proved to be so in practice, but where it is probable that not more than one, two or a limited number of producers will be engaged in any industry in this country behind a tariff, we have to rely on <Col N="886" /> definite understandings as to the prices to be charged in order to protect the consumers.  That is what will apply in this case; in other words, we say to this particular firm: &ldquo;We have assurances from you as to the price you are going to charge.  So long as these assurances are observed and these prices operate, so long will the protection we consider necessary be afforded to you; but if you depart from these assurances, and if, in fact, the prices you charge are higher than those which you contracted for, without justification, then the removal of the protection will have to be seriously considered, or at any rate a definite reduction of the duty, according to the extent to which prices have been increased.&rdquo;  That is always the practice, and the inevitable practice in respect of any industry where the extent of internal competition is not likely to be sufficient to enable prices to be kept down.</P>
    <P>Of course, in this industry, although there is only one firm proposing to engage in it at present, there is no legal restriction upon any firm engaging in it, but, having regard to the nature of the industry and the heavy capital investment involved in it, it is not likely that there will at any stage be any considerable number of firms engaging in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>The quality of nails and staples is very important, and if the factory gives an undertaking that the quality of nails and screws, and staples in particular, is up to standard, I think the price should be very little above the price we are paying at present for the imported article.  We are prepared to give every opportunity to the new factory, but at a price which is in fair competition with the price of the imported article.  Nails, screws and staples are very much used in every house in the country and very often a poor quality is supplied to the user. Sometimes staples are supplied that are practically useless.  Staples especially are things that should be of a good <Col N="887" /> standard, and the same can be said of screws.  Supplying that sort of article is hitting the people very hard.  On looking at these goods they appear all right, but on using them one finds that they are almost useless.  I hope the goods that will be made under the protection now being given by this tariff will be up to the mark, and that the prices will compare favourably with the quality of the goods.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Holohan that the complaint he is making can only apply at present to the foreign produced nails, screws and staples.  There is nothing else used at the moment, for up to the present none of these things have been made here. The Deputy may be quite satisfied that the screws, the nails and staples that are used up to now are foreign made articles, and if they are bad there is no need to be blaming Irish manufacture. I for one would support any tariff on any article that is not produced here if that article could be produced here and give employment to our own people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest against this tariff of 75 per cent. in the matter of this industry.  I am aware that the industry is to be established in Limerick, but if it were established on my own farm I would object to this tariff of 75 per cent. as unnecessary. All of us are anxious to help Irish industry, but when it comes to saying that an Irish industry wants protection to the extent of 75 per cent., then any one who has any regard for the purchasing power of the people must be opposed to it.  The Minister has made a statement that the 75 per cent. extra would never be charged, but our experience on this matter is different. Personally I am not at all sure that the great bulk of the 75 per cent. will not be charged.  I know another Irish industry which got a tariff to protect it.  I do not wish to mention any names in this House, but I can give the name to the Minister in confidence.  In the case of that industry, assurances were given to us that the product would be sold at the same price as it is sold in England.  That assurance has not been carried out, and we have no guarantee that the same thing will not occur in the case of this factory in Limerick. I assume from the names of the people at the head of this firm that it will be a well-conducted industry, but I must say that I am as opposed to giving a 75 per cent. protection to Irish goods produced in Limerick as I would be if they were produced in Cork, Dublin or anywhere else.  It should not be necessary to have this tariff of 75 per cent. If a tariff of 75 per cent. is necessary as a protective duty, then the industry is not worth being protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of things in the Minister's statement that are not quite clear.  Referring to the complaint made by Deputy Holohan, it is quite obvious now to anybody who has experience that all kinds of nails, screws and staples are coming in, some of them good&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And some of them very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and Deputy Corry's remark was quite irrelevant.  There are different qualities of these goods.  It is quite obvious <Col N="889" /> that there are good and bad screws coming in and the Deputy's remarks had no relevance at all to the matter we are debating or to the statement made by Deputy Holohan.  I gather for the first time, that in this particular Schedule control will be necessary because there is a monopoly.  But in many cases already the Minister has set up what are practical monopolies as far as this country is concerned. The Minister holds theoretically that other firms can start, but in practice it will be found, because of the concessions given to these people, that others cannot start.  Is there going to be continuous inspection as to the quality of the goods turned out or will the Minister wait until some person makes a complaint?  Or, on the other hand, if a person makes a complaint will that prove that the man who makes that complaint is a bad Irishman because forsooth he is complaining of the goods turned out by an Irish firm?  It occurs to me that that is the charge that will be made.  He will be challenged to say if the articles are good or bad.  If he says they are not good, then that is clear proof that he is a bad Irishman. In these matters it appears to me we are not relying on probity or quality or price or anything else, but on propaganda. That is altogether wrong. Let the firms stand on what they can produce, and let us not hear the sort of rubbish we have heard.  Do not let us have the rubbish preached that no Irish industry can produce any goods that are bad.  An excellent Irish industry can produce excellent goods but the suggestion that no Irish industry can produce bad goods or inferior goods is too ridiculous to be refuted.  But that is the line that is taken up in this House and elsewhere as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess I do not know what the Minister meant by the cryptic phrase that the duty was to be scaled down. I confess I was unable to grasp the meaning of that phrase.  I took down the words&mdash;that the rate of duty is to be scaled down to the extent that the price goes upwards from the agreed price.  That, I take it, is one of the operations contemplated by the Minister according to the statement he made.  I took down his words but I <Col N="890" /> do not exactly know what they mean. I would be glad if the Minister would take an opportunity of explaining the statement.  Supposing the Minister agrees that the goods are to be produced and sold here at 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. above the price at which they are sold in England, and let us suppose they are acually sold at 30 per cent. above that price, then I take it that you are to scale down your duty, and that off the 75 per cent. you are taking 20 per cent. or 25 per cent., as the case may be.  Is that the position? What does the statement made by the Minister mean&mdash;scaling down the duty according as the price goes beyond the price agreed on?  How will the price agreed on be determined or will it not change continuously?  Under the circumstances will there not be continuous interference on the part of the Minister with this industry?  And what holds true in this industry holds true in the other industries that he is now starting by this particular tariff policy.  Personally I was glad to hear that he had that objection to the combines or to the recommendations of the combines in this country whether the goods come in directly to the market or whether the firms come in and set up here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to convey was this&mdash;that a certain company on the understanding that the Government was prepared to recommend to the Dáil the imposition of a duty of this amount has invested a large sum of money&mdash;in this case £125,000&mdash;in the establishment of a factory for the production of these goods.  We have recommended a certain duty to the Dáil and we have done so on the basis of the proposals that have been submitted to us, proposals that in this case involve an undertaking that when the factory is in full production the prices of the commodities sold by that factory will not exceed by more than 10 per cent. the prices of commodities of comparable quality sold by British firms in Great Britain.  That is the understanding with the company.  If that understanding is departed from, if the prices charged, say, go 20 per cent. above the prices of comparable qualities in Great Britain, then, any moral obligation there might be upon the <Col N="891" /> Government to retain the protection given to that firm ceases to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

In these circumstances we might remove the duty altogether or we might say: &ldquo;Your undertaking given to us was that your price was only to be 10 per cent. above the British prices; your protection now will be only 10 per cent.&rdquo;  In any event we are free to reconsider our position and to take whatever steps we consider best to safeguard the interests of the consuming public.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to mention the name here.  In this particular case the Government imposed a tariff of 40 per cent. on the goods which this firm is producing.  I have seen two samples of the goods produced under this tariff of 40 per cent.  The price charged by the firm producing the home-made article is such that the home-made article is sold at 9d. and the imported one can be sold at 9½d.  This article is sold by the pound.  In the imported article there are nine yards to the pound, but there are only seven yards to the pound in the article manufactured here.  Surely there is more than 10 per cent. being made as a profit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, 10 per cent. over the price in Great Britain?  We have at least here, where we have a monopoly, an acknowledgment that the thing is not going to be cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter in relation to this.  The position is that we have agreed to recommend the imposition of the duty on that understanding, but we are not necessarily accepting a price 10 per cent. above the British price as reasonable.  If circumstances should arise in which it would appear that undue profits were being made, there is nothing to prevent the operation of the machinery under the Control of Prices Act to deal with that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much interested in the question of undue profits as I am in relation to what the consumer has to pay. Whether certain things are due to the size of the market for which he is catering, efficient management or undue profits, does not matter from the point that I am urging.  I am looking at it from the point of view of the consumer.  I understand that here we are contemplating an increase. I gather the 10 per cent. is not fixed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why the Minister should say that it may be regarded as a maximum?  In <Col N="893" /> this particular instance he has induced people to invest a sum of £125,000 towards the establishment of an industry, and in the circumstances one may assume that he will be inclined to look leniently on the quality of the goods they produce, and one has the feeling that he might reconsider the question in relation to the 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to deal with articles such as these that are in common use and when one begins to examine the matter closely, quite a lot of important considerations arise.  The Minister said that no matter what tariff is put on it will not mean an increased price.  In my opinion in 99 per cent. of the cases where tariffs were put on articles it has worked out that way.  This evening it was emphasised in relation to other things that we are going to get the same service at the same price.  If that is so, it does not matter about the percentage of the tariff&mdash;if we are going to get articles at the same price.  Deputy Bennett said he considered 75 per cent. was too high.  If it meant that we were going to use an article at 75 per cent. of an increased price it would be too high, but if, as the Minister has pointed out&mdash;he told us he had an assurance on the point&mdash;that we are going to get the same service in relation to these articles at the same price or at 10 per cent. over the British price, that is a different thing. One will not object very much if one pays 4d. or 6d. for nails.  But we must get to the serious side of this matter.  Subject to the Minister's correction, I do not know any item yet <Col N="894" /> where an inquiry has been made in that regard and the price has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps certain things come more under my notice than the notice of the average member of the Dáil, because practically every day in my place there is a comparison of prices&mdash;prices paid a mile away and prices paid at home&mdash;and it has never yet been pointed out to me where we stand on an equal footing in respect of any article on which there is a tariff.  I want the Minister to understand that I am with him if he gets the firm in question to do as he says. If they sell the different grades of stuff that we want and at the same price, quality for quality, we have no argument, and I would say that 75 per cent. would give them the whole home market.  I want to impress on the Minister that if we give these facilities to these firms that are operating we will have to go further and have the position carefully examined.  I could name several articles in regard to which we are not getting the promised service and when one draws attention to the fact they say, &ldquo;We do not ask you to buy it, but you cannot get anything else.&rdquo;</P>
