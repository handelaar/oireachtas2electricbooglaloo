      <P>All Irish citizens who were in Spain at the beginning of the civil war and with whom contact could be established were warned to leave that country as it would be impossible to afford them protection if the fighting became general.  Through the good offices of the British Naval and Consular Services, a number of our citizens were evacuated from Spain, and I am glad to have this opportunity of expressing publicly our appreciation and thanks for the work done on our behalf by those British services.  Any expenses incurred have been refunded <Col N="474" /> by the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  It is not possible at the moment to state the amount of the financial liability, as certain sums of money have still to be refunded by some of those repatriated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the long-continued fall in the population of the Free State, which began prior to 1851, was arrested in the year 1930; that an upward trend in population was established from that year; that this upward trend has been interfered with by some forces operating after the year 1932; that, as a result, a definite trend downward in the population subsequent to 1932 has been brought about; that the economic and social well-being of the Free State is thereby seriously prejudiced, and if he will state whether he will set up an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, with a view to examining the trend of population in the Irish Free State from 1926 to 1936; inquiring into the causes which have brought about the recent decline in the population, and reporting on these causes.</P>

      <P>The matter of relief grants for County Clare has already formed the subject of correspondence between the Department and the county council, and the position is as notified to the county council in the Department's letter of the 28th ultimo, that the money which is being made available by State grants in the current financial year, between Minor Relief Scheme, Road Improvement Scheme and Road Relief Scheme, amounts to £32,229, involving <Col N="477" /> a local contribution of £5,380, thus bringing the total expenditure to £37,609.  This money is for expenditure between now and the 31st March next, and is apart from any moneys which have been, or may be, made available for public health works in the county.

This rate, which applies to all advances made from the Local Loans Fund since the 1st October, 1934, was fixed so as to cover the cost of borrowing the money from the public and the expenses of the management of the Fund.

The normal rate of annuity for the repayment of advances made by the Land Commission for the improvement of estates (including the building or reconstruction of houses) is 4¾ per cent. per annum.

      <P>Owing to the events which must follow on the Vice-President's decision, I think it is right that I should take this opportunity of asking him whether he is aware that the Government was approached early this morning and informed that, owing to circumstances over which we had no control, we could not give the Courts of Justice Bill the attention it deserves if it were taken as the first item on the Order Paper.  In view of that, we asked early this morning if arrangements could be made to substitute some other business between 3.30 and 5.30 p.m.  That is the kind of application that is very infrequently made from the Opposition.  May I submit to the Vice-President that, if the Courts of Justice Bill does not get the discussion it deserves now, it will be due to the fact that the Government was not prepared to accommodate the Opposition to that modest extent?  In that connection, I may say that the House should bear in mind that the discussions on the earlier stages of the <Col N="493" /> Courts of Justice Bill were prolonged and very much drawn out.  The business of collating, of going over and calling to mind all that had passed, was no small task when it is remembered that there was no assistance available for the Opposition from permanent officials such as the Minister for Justice had at his disposal.  If we ask for one or two hours' postponement of the discussion on this Bill, it seems to me a very peculiar attitude for the Government to adopt to refuse it.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if I am correct in assuming, from what he said on the last day, that the assessment referred to in the section is to be made in respect of the current year?  Let me take an example.  The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee makes a demand for <i>x</i> pounds on the Dublin Corporation. The Corporation calculates how much that will be in the £ on the valuation for the year 1936-37.  The old practice, as I understood from what the Minister said on the last day, was that the assessment would be in respect of the valuation for 1937-38.  The assessments heretofore were based on the valuations existing in the year in which the assessments were made, and not on the year in which the money was going to be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on the last day, we have to issue a certificate from the Department of Education on or before the 15th January authorising a local vocational education committee <Col N="495" /> to make its demand on the local rating authority.  The figures which it is intended to go on will, in the case the Deputy mentions, be the figures for 1936-37, as the figures for 1937-38 will not be available until six weeks later. It is thought that by the procedure laid down in this amending Bill certain errors will be avoided, and that certain adjustments, which would have to be made otherwise, will become unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that an anomaly may arise if the assessment be made for the year 1936-37?  Take it that certain property has come in under valuation in the city.  Does it follow from this Bill that that property will be exempt from vocational education charges for next year?  Let us assume that there is a string of houses that were not on the valuation list for 1936-37 but that will be on the valuation list for 1937-38.  I cannot see how they can be assessed in respect of a vocational education charge if the assessment be made on the year previous.  Similarly with regard to property that may go out of commission during the year.  The valuation list is not static, and some of that property would normally fall to be assessed in order to provide the sum of money required.  Therefore, the Vocational Education Committee would be left short that sum, whatever it might be, because I am assuming that the Vocational Education Committee is only entitled to get the proceeds of the rate.  If, then, a considerable amount of property went out of commission they would be short that much money; on the other hand, where there is an expanding valuation they are not entitled to get the rate in respect of the property which has been only a year on the books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not, in fact, fix the rate which the local authority, at the request of the Vocational Education Committee, will levy. The position as regards that rate is that it is limited with regard to its minimum and to its maximum by the Vocational Education Act, 1930, so that within these limits the local authority have a certain discretion.  I <Col N="496" /> cannot see why, if the local authority strikes a rate for the year 1937-8 for other purposes upon houses which were not in the valuation list during the preceding year, they cannot do the same thing for vocational education. Our function is very limited in regard to this matter.  We simply have to see, as regards the limits laid down by the original Act, that local authorities are carrying out the duties which the Oireachtas cast upon them.  They have carried out those duties satisfactorily and we are not interfering with them in any way.  As I have said, if the local authority can strike a rate for other purposes upon new buildings and houses which have come in, I cannot see why they cannot do the same thing in connection with vocational education.</P>
      <P>As regards the details of the actual rating, I regret that I cannot give the Deputy close and detailed information, as that is really a matter for the Local Government Department.  But my information is that, in fact, there is no appreciable change.  For some years to come there may be a slight increase in the amount of the State grants but, except for that, we are acting on the figures of the preceding year; in fact there is no considerable change of financial importance, at any rate.  I am not versed in the intricacies of rating but I would say from the small knowledge I have that, if new buildings and houses come in for rating for ordinary purposes in a particular financial year, they should come in for rating for vocational education purposes also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know what is the purpose of the section.  The section says that they are to take the valuation of the previous year.  If that be taken, surely these houses are excluded. In connection with the rate being struck, I expect that the Minister is anxious that these houses should not escape.  I want to know if they are going to escape because, if I interpret the section correctly, it can have no other meaning than to let them out. If the local authority is circumscribed by this section to assessing the rate for vocational education on the valuation for last year does it not follow that new houses will not come in?  Perhaps <Col N="497" /> the Minister would give us some other explanation than merely the six weeks from 15th January to 1st March, because the six weeks do not appear to me to be of much moment.</P>
      <P>The rate is not struck in the normal course, I think, until after the 1st April&mdash;that is the usual period.  The estimates are considered prior to that. The valuation lists are then examined to see how each sum of money required for a particular service for which a special rate must be struck will fall to be assessed in respect of the valuation on which that particular rate is to be charged.  If taking the valuation of the previous year is included in the section, I cannot see the purpose of it except to exclude from assessment buildings or property which are not included in that valuation.  Perhaps if the Minister is not in a position to give us information now about it he will look into the point and see whether or not that was intended.  If that were not intended, and if it should be in the section, will steps be taken to ensure that property which is on the valuation list will be assessable when it arises in the new year, and was not on the old list?</P>

      <P>There were, of course, a certain number of reasons indicated by the Minister on the last day as to why he should introduce this section.  He mentioned the type of person who might be disqualified.  He said: &ldquo;These disqualifications, as Deputies know, refer to infancy, alienage, receipt of union relief, conviction for crime, contractual relationship, and bankruptcy.&rdquo;  So far as most of these are concerned, I can understand that on a body like a vocational education committee they might not be suitable persons, but as regards those who are in contractual relationship with, say, the parent body, if I might use that phrase, the council or corporation, is there really any adequate reason why people of that kind, whose services may be very useful, should be debarred from serving on these particular committees?  Why should men of that particular class, whose business or office experience might be very useful, be kept off a committee of this kind?  They themselves may be in contractual relation, not with the committee, but with the corporation or council.  Am I right in assuming that contractual relationship with the council or the corporation, as the case may be, will henceforth act as a bar to people of that kind serving on these committees?  Personally I doubt whether it is worth while introducing a section of that kind unless the Minister, from his experience, can say that he is convinced that it is necessary.  I put it to him that, merely for the sake of uniformity, it would be a mistake to follow what is done in other circumstances.</P>
      <P>That is one point, but the more important matter I should like to stress is the case of those who are existing members of a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people have been serving on committees of this kind and they have a great deal of experience of the working of these committees. Why should it not be possible for the Minister to make an exception at least in favour of those who have experience of this kind and whose experience would be useful to the committee?  If he is determined on pressing this bar to contractual relations with the parent body, he should, <Col N="499" /> at least, favourably consider the making of an exception in favour of those members of these committees who have been doing useful public work without criticism and without giving rise to any scandal or hint of scandal. It would be a gracious and a useful act if the Minister would make an exception in favour of those members of existing committees who have been giving a great deal of their time to this sort of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless my memory serves me badly, an instruction was issued some years ago by the Department of Education to local authorities that, when appointing vocational education committees, they should consider the claims of experienced tradesmen, people with industrial connections and members of the professions.  We were advised in setting up committees to include people of that kind because of the peculiar nature of the work of the committees.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, you may have on these committees people who have had contractual relations with the county councils or with the committees.  These people are likely to be the most useful members of the committees because of the nature of vocational education. The Minister, in passing a Bill of this kind, should be careful that he does not cut out the very best members of vocational education committees.  I do not know whether the Minister has given much consideration to this section or not, but that danger is present.  If it was wise to include in the membership of these committees, when first established, engineers, builders, manufacturers and tradesmen, we should be careful that we do not cut them out now, because they may have established contractual relations with the bodies concerned, and so injure what was the main purpose of vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this question of the contractual relations existing between a member of a body of this character and his continued membership of the body.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of all the implications of applying the Local Government Order, 1898, to these vocational <Col N="500" /> education committees.  So far as I am aware, the position is extremely obscure and, perhaps, the Minister would take this opportunity of authoritatively elucidating it.  Suppose a man is a member of a subsidiary committee of a county council and is, at the same time, a director of a limited liability company and that that limited liability company has established contractual relations with the county council, out of which it derives a fluctuating profit.  Suppose, at the same time, the remuneration of the director of the limited liability company does not fluctuate with the profits of the company.  Does this order operate to disqualify that director?  The present situation is that there is no authoritative decision.  The matter was once tried but, in that case, it was established that the remuneration of the official of the company in question fluctuated with the profits made upon the contract.  It appeared from the decision that the court took the view that that was the vital element, and, accordingly, found that the officer was not eligible for continued membership of the public body.  Although not expressly stated, it could be implied from the terms of the judgment that if the officer of the company had been able to satisfy the court that his remuneration was not affected adversely or otherwise by the existence of the contract, he would not be debarred from being a member of the public body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the penalties for transgressing this order are substantial.  Quite apart from the substantial nature of the penalties, it is not surprising that men in responsible positions in the mercantile life of the country do not wish to be publicly convicted of having broken the law, even in so technical a particular as this is.  The duty devolves upon the Minister if he proposes to extend the application of the existing law, to tell us exactly what position he proposes to create.  Can a director of a limited liability company become and remain a member of a vocational education committee if his company is in contractual relationship with the county council or the committee?  If he can, will the fact that that director's fee fluctuates with the profits from the contract operate to <Col N="501" /> disqualify him from continued membership? These are two categorical questions, and I cannot imagine the Minister proceeding with the Bill unless and until he can fully explain to us what the results will be in the contingency I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have put down an amendment on that point. He has spoken of a particular case which has been before the courts. This section merely applies to vocational education committees what is already the law in regard to public bodies generally and I do not think the Deputy is acting reasonably in asking me to interpret the law for him. If he is really interested in the point, he should raise the whole question. In that event, we should have an opportunity of learning all the circumstances of the case he has in mind and we should probably be able to learn from those in a position to advise us what the legal implications were.  As I said on Second Reading, this section has become necessary because of an oversight in the original Bill.  It was clearly intended that the disqualifications referred to in the schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, should apply to the Vocational Education Act, 1930. With the experience we have had in the Department of Education since that Act was passed, we are satisfied that, for purely administrative reasons and to help towards the smooth working of the system of vocational education, the amendments contained in this Bill should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across cases in which a question of contractual relationship between a member of the committee and the committee itself has arisen.  It was then we discovered that we were not on a par with local authorities generally and it was considered necessary to introduce the present amendment. I presume that when, if this Bill becomes law, the vocational education committees are put on the same footing as local authorities generally, that members of committees who are disqualified and who may feel aggrieved will have the remedy of the courts open to them and they can argue their cases there.  I presume, in <Col N="502" /> view of the fact that the Order has been in operation with regard to local authorities generally for nearly 40 years, that there must be a well-recognised procedure and well-recognised lines of policy with regard to it. I could not possibly at this stage, even if I disappoint the Deputy, answer the question.  Even if I had the legal advisers of the Department to advise me, they can only give an opinion on a matter which obviously must be finally decided in the courts.  If it is then found that there is a weakness in the schedule in regard to this matter of qualifications, presumably it can be amended.  I can quite see that a very large number of cases might come up for argument in the courts as to whether a contractual relationship existed, or whether the amount of profit the individual received was sufficient, and so on; whether, in fact, there was any contractual relationship. I suggest that these matters can all be decided in the same way as they have been decided since 1898 in regard to local authorities generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this case, not from the point of view of the courts, but from the point of view of the legislature.  What we have to consider here is the law that we are to put before the courts.  I agree that it is then for the courts to decide what the law means&mdash;I am well aware of that&mdash;but is it advisable to pass this particular law?  I asked the Minister whether he was going on principle of uniformity, because this had been done in connection with other bodies&mdash;I will not say similar bodies, because I am not aware there are similar bodies. The principal reason on which the Minister relied is that there is a lacuna, as he said, in the original Act. Is that any reason for not letting the original Act, if it has worked satisfactorily, to continue working satisfactorily? He said, as a kind of buttressing-up of that argument, that the experience of the Department was in favour of this and he gave as an instance a case that came under his notice.  He instanced where there was a contractual relationship between a committee and a member of that committee. <Col N="503" /> The Minister will remember that the particular case within the general case was a different one, namely, where there is a contractual relationship between a man and a council, a county council or a corporation.</P>
      <P>Why should that act as a bar to that man being a member of such a body, which is technically only a sub-committee, and perhaps not even a sub-committee of that county council or corporation? The members of the vocational committee are not by any means restricted to members of the county council or a corporation.  It is not a sub-committee of the county council or the corporation in that sense.  What danger is there, or what harm can there be to public policy, to public decency, in a man, a member of the vocational committee, having contractual relations with an entirely different body, only some of whose members coincide?  The Minister ought to consider that point seriously.  What I fear is that he is throwing away a certain amount of experience unnecessarily; he is putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of getting a certain type of person whom the local people may consider to be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I think that when he thinks over it the Minister will agree that what he suggests as a remedy is not really a remedy, namely, that we should legislate and, if a person has a grievance, he should go to the courts to find out what we mean.  I put it to the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Education, that it would be better to disqualify from membership as few people as possible, especially as they may have contractual relations, not with the committee, but with the parent body, the county council or the corporation.  In any case, I do not see why the Minister would not favourably consider the introduction of an amendment to meet that case, or at least to meet the case of a person who is already a member of a committee, and has been a member for a number of years, and is now struck off, not because he entered into contractual relations with the committee, but because he is in some kind of contractual relationship with the parent body, which is an entirely different body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> I am surprised the Minister does not meet a mild suggestion of that kind in a reasonable manner.  The demand is not great.  It is in the interests of the committee and the smooth working of the committee that he should accede to a demand of that kind.  There is one point upon which I should like information. Can scholarships be given by the committee to those who attend the instruction given by the committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise what he is doing? Under the last two lines of the section he is allowing a person who gets a money benefit from the committee to be a member of that committee and a member of it for a sometimes very controversial purpose, the granting of scholarships, while he will exclude from the membership a man whose contractual relations have nothing to do with the committee.  I suggest that between now and the Report Stage the Minister should give favourable consideration to the argument I have put forward and consider the introduction of an amendment along the general or even the restricted lines I have suggested.  It does not seem to me to be consistent, to put it no higher, to allow a man to be a member of a committee that may give him a scholarship, but debar a man from being a member who has no relations contractually with the committee.  If the Minister wants uniformity, I suggest he is looking for it in the wrong direction.  It would not be fair to him to say that he has attempted to put forward a case for this disqualification, apart from the case he referred to, which is not quite germane to the case I am making, namely, a contractual relationship between a member of the committee and the committee.</P>
      <P>What is the experience of the Department that convinces him that it is necessary to do this, beyond the fact that some other committees, which I suggest are differently situated from vocational education committees, are subject to similar disqualifications?</P>

      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can argue that there is something <Col N="505" /> special in the case of vocational education committees which distinguishes their case from agricultural committees, let us say.  Obviously, in connection with agricultural committees, farmers who may be members are liable to have contractual relationships of the kind the Deputy has referred to&mdash;bonuses, premiums and all that kind of thing from the local committee.</P>

If it is the position under the law as it stands that the members of committees who have contractual relationships with the primary bodies should be excluded from membership, then I think either the existing law should be changed or we should make this uniform to that extent.  No case has really been made by Deputies to show that the existing law should be changed.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Deputy that the only kind of contractual relationship that, generally speaking, will arise is the question of the building of schools.  That is the type of case that has come under my notice, and in that case it seems to me that, whether the contractor be a member of the committee or a member of the county council, it is better that he should not be a contractor as well as being a member of either body.  If he is to be a building contractor, I do not think he should be a member of either of those bodies.  It really only applies to the case of building contractors. <Col N="506" /> I do not know that any other kind of contractual relationship might exist and it is in that connection it came under my notice.  If the Deputies think that the law in general in this matter should be amended or changed they should raise the question generally, I suggest, with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have anything further to add except to say that, as the Deputies themselves possibly know, the section will apply to only a very small number of members.  In any case, we want to have our position straightened out.  We want to know where we stand.  It would apply only to a very small number of members, if any, and there is no proof whatever that there is any foundation for the suggestion that excellent members of the vocational education committees who happen to be business men will be excluded from giving their services on these committees.  They will simply have to bear the same disabilities as they would if they were members of other committees or local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the only matter that has come before him as likely to be affected in this way is the question of building. He must be very blind both to the extent of the industrial development which his Government is boasting of as going on in the country, on the one hand, and to the type of technical education we really want to get in the country.  I want to ask the Minister if, say, a director of the Westport Thread Factory would be entitled to sit on the Vocational Education Committee in County Mayo, because I take it that, as well as other committees in the country, the Vocational Education Committee in County Mayo gives some instruction in dressmaking and others of these arts to the girls of County Mayo, and will no doubt use the Westport thread.  I think I have seen some discussion going on in connection with a mill in Donegal, where application has been made to have certain technical classes for the instruction of mill workers in connection with the development to take place in connection with that mill.  If one of the directors or proprietors of that mill is <Col N="507" /> a member of the Donegal Vocational Education Committee, will the flour milled in that mill be excluded entirely from any chance of being used in the cookery classes in the County Donegal?</P>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to get clear on some of these questions before he insists in putting this suggestion through.  The Minister seems to see no difference between vocational education committee and other local government bodies on the administrative side.  I think it has been brought to his notice already that when these vocational education committees were set up, the representatives of local authorities were urged to scour their districts to get the most representative industrialists and commercial people to sit on them and to give the benefit of their practical experience in the manufacturing business and in commerce to the committees directing vocational education there.  I think we ought to hear from the Minister whether any facts have been brought to his notice that would dictate that this restriction should be imposed on persons engaged in commerce and industry.  If the Minister were able to say that any irregularities of any kind or that any dangers by allowing people to sit on vocational education committees who might have contractual obligations with the committees had been brought to his notice, there might be some case for asking this House to agree to exclude definitely from being in a position to give any advice with regard to vocational education people in commerce and manufacturing who might in any way have contractual obligations with the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems strange, too, that the Minister should insist so much on pressing this matter, a matter that not only has been never pressed before, but was deliberately left unattended to, I suggest, at a time when the Local Government Department is slackening on the question of disqualification generally. Deputies have got into their hands in the past few days the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1936, in which provision is expressly made by Section 4 that if a person is elected a <Col N="508" /> member of a local authority and if no proceedings, by way of election petition or in the nature or in lieu of <i>quo warranto</i>, are raised to question the validity of such a person, within one year after the date on which he has been declared elected, the disqualification of such person, if such exists, shall be completely void.  So that here we have the Local Government Department contemplating the existence of persons on local authorities at present who may not be qualified, for one reason or another, to sit on such bodies, and making provision, which is proposed to be retrospective in its action as well as affecting future cases, that where 12 months pass and no objection is raised to a person who sits, though unqualified, on a local authority, he shall be regarded as qualified.  If the Minister were able to show that there was any danger with regard to the future by having persons connected with vocational education committees likely to have contractual obligations with their committee, we would expect him to give as much consideration to persons who are sitting on vocational education committees at the moment, and who had given, with a perfect statutory right to do so, good service to these committees in advising them with regard to vocational education in the past.  We would expect that consideration would be given to these members and that they would be treated with as much consideration as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health now proposes to treat people who are not qualified or who may not be qualified in the strict letter of the law to sit on local bodies of which they are members at the present moment, so as to allow them to continue to sit as members of such bodies simply because twelve months have passed without anybody having raised an objection.</P>
    <P>The whole attitude of the Minister seems to be very illogical.  There seems to be a blind groping for uniformity in a matter in which I suggest there is no uniformity.  If vocational education is going to be directed on lines which are closer to real, necessary industrial work, then we cannot afford to exclude anybody who is likely to be selected by <Col N="509" /> a local authority as a person best suited to advise them in the conduct of vocational education.  After all, the Minister has the safeguard that nobody will be selected to sit on these committees unless he is approved by persons in a very representative position in the country.</P>

      <P>It is strange how rapidly Ministers, when they come up from the country, forget the surroundings in which they lived before they left the country.  The Minister for Education is familiar with rural Ireland, but he says that in extending this Order to apply to vocational education committees it will not apply to anybody but building contractors.  Suppose a vocational education committee builds a school, say, in Abbeyleix, and there is in Abbeyleix a shop which is in the possession of a limited liability company, and the chairman of that company is a member of the county council.  Is it the Minister's intention that the chairman of that company should be disqualified from sitting on the county council, if the vocational education teacher turns into that shop on her way to school in the morning and buys a handful of pencils, because if this Bill passes that will be the law?  Is it his intention that, even if the purchase is made without the knowledge of the chairman of the board of directors and without any ulterior motive on anybody's part, the purchase of six pencils in that shop, on behalf of the vocational education committee&mdash;that is, if the teacher makes the purchase on behalf of the committee and the committee pays the bill&mdash;should disqualify the chairman of that board of directors from sitting, not only on the committee itself, but on the county council as well?  Of course, when Deputies hear that, they can scarcely believe their ears, and the Minister's contribution to their enlightenment is to say: &ldquo;I do not know what the effect of it will be.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is charged with the welfare of children and, doubtless, in the course of his duty he has reviewed suitable pastimes for the infant standards. He might also in his own infancy have gone to a Christmas party and seen the hostess there draw a donkey on a blackboard.  The children <Col N="510" /> would then be presented with pins and pieces of paper in the shape of a tail.  Each guest would be blindfolded and invited to put the tail on the donkey, as nearly as he could. When the tail had been put on, he could take the cloth off his eyes and see how near he came to putting it on the right place.  This House is now asked to engage in a legislative game of putting the tail on the donkey, blindfolded.  We do not know what the effect of this section is.  The Minister does not know and yet we are asked to apply it to vocational education committees at the present time.  The Minister speaks as if this question were sprung upon him. Doubtless he has consulted the Department of Local Government and Public Health before bringing in this Bill. The Department of Local Government and Public Health are fully informed of this dilemma.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health are familiar with the test case to which I have referred and with the uncertainty of the decision that came from the bench on that occasion. Surely it is rational to ask the Minister, if he proposes to extend this regulation to these committees, to tell the House what it means.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should confine himself to the matter before the House, which is the extension, to vocational education committees, of a clause in an Act of 1898 referring to local bodies.  The general interpretation of that or any other Act is not a matter for the Minister, nor does the question arise that there may be flaws in such Acts.  That can be decided elsewhere.  If its amendment is sought, it can be sought on the appropriate occasion from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The question now is whether or not it is advisable to apply this section to certain local bodies.  To that, if I may say so, Deputy O'Sullivan spoke and put up points which were quite in order.  But the amendment of the clause of the 1898 Act or its interpretation, upon which there seems to be a doubt in the courts, cannot be solved here now by the Minister for Education.  It is not in <Col N="511" /> order to ask him to solve these doubts or interpret the Act except in so far as it applies to the Vocational Education Bill before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I now repeat the question and I submit to you, Sir, that it is a perfectly orderly query.  I now require the Minister to tell the House, in the event of our applying Article 12 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, to vocational education committees, what effect that will have. I think the House is entitled to ask that question before they proceed to enact that section of this Bill.  If the Minister is not in a position to tell us what effect it will have, I want to know why.  I submit, with great respect, that that inquiry is a relevant inquiry on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I object most strenuously to the Minister strolling in here and asking the House to enact legislation the meaning of which he protests he does not know.  I submit respectfully that before he asks this House to legislate by reference, he should either be in a position to give us a very clear and explicit definition of what that legislation by reference is going to mean, or else he ought to come in to legislate <i>de novo</i> and set out <i>in extenso</i> his intentions in regard to vocational education committees.  It is none of my choosing that the Minister should legislate by reference.  It is quite open to the Minister to legislate <i>de novo</i> in regard to the contractual relationships of members of vocational education committees.  He does not do that.  He elects to harp back to previous Acts and he does not know what the effect will be on committees in this country. I put it to the Minister that he should not ask us to legislate blindfold.  I think the Minister should tell us whether he does not agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that there is a <Col N="512" /> fundamental difference between vocational education committees operating in this country and such bodies as boards of health whose relations are admittedly very much closer to the parent body, the county council.</P>
      <P>To my mind, while the primary issue raised by Deputy O'Sullivan is of paramount importance, there is a secondary issue which I now raise.  In the event of the Minister disregarding Deputy O'Sullivan's representation, and determining to bring the position of the vocational education committee into line with that of the board of health, surely the duty devolves on him to tell us what effect that is going to have on the committees.  He says now he is not in a position to tell us; he does not know.  I say he has no right to come before this House and ask us to legislate, when he himself does not know the meaning of the legislation which he is sponsoring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, would be well advised, before he passes this particular section, to inquire into its effect.  It has been the practice of his Department for almost a quarter of a century to be anxious that builders should act on those vocational committees.  The reason why he and his Department were so anxious to get builders to act on vocational education committees in all areas was because the builders employed a large number of the juveniles attending the different classes in building instruction, and it was to the interest of the builders to attend and see that the education was properly carried on.  I might say, on the other hand, that the trades have always taken an active interest in it.  Both sides, therefore, see that the boys are properly educated.  If, say, a builder who is on the sub-committee happens to be, as is commonly the case, a director of a brick company, and if that brick company happens to be supplying bricks to the local authorities, does that disqualify this man who is taking an active interest in technical education?  As the Minister knows, builders and their society take a special interest in those classes, and in many cases give prizes to the pupils.  I am afraid that in this amending Bill, instead of doing his <Col N="513" /> Department any good or doing educational work any good, the Minister is putting them at a serious disadvantage. I am aware that he does not desire that educational work should suffer in any way through this Act, and I would urge on him that before he takes any step to press this amending legislation he should inquire into its reactions in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that the Minister cannot make any distinction between vocational education committees and local authorities, such as boards of health, agricultural committees, and so on.  After all, boards of health and those other local authorities are simply administering certain Acts as laid down.  Vocational education committees are on quite a different plane altogether.  They have a very varied and progressive programme.  They are advised, of course, that they can go in certain directions; in fact, in any direction as far as education is concerned. To that end they were advised in the beginning, as I pointed out a while ago, to ensure that outside members elected to vocational education committees were people belonging to trades or professions, or generally connected with industrial activities, so that they would be useful in helping to direct vocational education along proper lines.  It is an extraordinary thing that the Minister cannot see the difference.  He says that in that respect there is no difference between the members of the vocational education committee and the members of an agricultural committee. As far as the members of an agricultural committee are concerned, they are very rarely contracting parties at all.  In the case of the vocational education committees the Minister says it could only affect, say, the building of schools.  That is not so; that is only just number one.  There is the furnishing of schools; there is the supplying of school requisites, heating, lighting, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister apparently does not at all realise the far-reaching effect that this is going to have upon certain members of vocational education committees. For instance, according to a <Col N="514" /> case decided and on record, this is what would happen, say, in Roscommon. We have a certain industrialist in Roscommon who has started the manufacture of, amongst other things, rainwater goods.  We thought he was a most desirable member of the vocational education committee because he gave employment and because he wanted people trained in a particular way.  If a contractor for a school buys rainwater goods from this man, this man goes off the committee straight away or he will be penalised according to the law; he cannot supply a contractor.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks it is advisable to have that state of affairs with regard to vocational education, I suppose we cannot help it, but we are endeavouring to point out to the Minister that there is a distinct difference between vocational education committees and other committees.  We want to have on those committees people who have experience in industry, but who will from time to time possibly become contracting parties either to the county council or some other local authorities.  As Deputy Good has pointed out, I think the Minister ought to consider very seriously the far-reaching effects of the application of that clause in that uniform way.  There is no comparison between the committees which he tries to show the House are analogous.  The vocational education committee is different.  The Minister ought, first and foremost, to realise that, and to realise that the people who are the most useful members are people who are in the ordinary way having contractual relations with local authorities of various kinds.</P>

      <P>There are a few remarks in the last statement made by the Minister which rather alarm me in regard to whether or not full consideration has been given to this matter.  Was I right in understanding the Minister to say that very few, if any, cases might arise under this?</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister, on consideration, cannot stand over that statement.  Mention has been made here by Deputy Good, <Col N="515" /> Deputy Brennan and others about the position of builders.  Let me point out that it is not if a builder enters into a contract with the committee that he is disqualified, but he is disqualified if he enters into a contract with the local body.  Is there at the moment any builder of importance, when building is one of the principal industries of the State, who has not in some way or other contractual relations with a local body?  Take the building of houses under local supervision; take the building of cottages.  All those builders are disqualified right through the country, not because they are contractors to the committee but because they are contractors to the parent body.  Any person who is in any kind of employee relationship to the county council or the corporation is disqualified.  It is not merely the case raised by Deputy Brennan as regards the manufacturer of rainproof goods; no matter what the goods are, if those people supply not the committee but the local body&mdash;the county council or the corporation&mdash;they are disqualified.  At the present time how many industrialists of standing are there in the country, whether they are builders or anybody else, who are not in contractual relationship with the parent body&mdash;the corporation or county council?  Why, for the sake of mere uniformity&mdash;because that is really the only argument brought forward and now appears to be the only leg on which the Minister is standing&mdash;you are going to disqualify people, and the most useful people, wholesale, is a thing that passes my comprehension. If there had been a provision in the original Act disqualifying them, I could understand the Minister bringing in an amending provision wiping out the disqualification in his anxiety to allow them to be on the committees; but when the original Act was fortunate enough to have this oversight, why he, as Minister for Education, in order apparently to satisfy some hankering for uniformity on the part of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, should disqualify these people, is, I candidly confess, beyond my comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the experience of his Department in this matter and he quoted one case&mdash;I think the <Col N="516" /> only case&mdash;of a person building a school for a vocational committee.  In his next speech, however, he practically indicated that he thought that this would have no effect in practice. It is obvious that it will have a tremendous effect in practice and that it will have an evil effect on the working of the vocational education committees. In view of what has been said both from these benches and from the Independent Benches, I think the Minister ought to consider this whole matter between now and the Report Stage. It is of much wider scope than the Minister or the Department has thought up to the present, judging by the case made by the Minister.  This means that you are going to disqualify any industrialist from being a member of a vocational education committee. It is not merely builders who will be disqualified, but any industrialist, although, at the moment, when the Government boasts of so many people being taken into employment, that employment is in the building trade chiefly, and this means that you are going to disqualify all of these people because, with modern building, I doubt if there is any builder of any prominence, or even any small builder, who is not in some contractual relations with local bodies.  With the assistance that is given to building by local bodies and with the way in which local bodies themselves take on building, how will you find in any district builders who are not in contractual relations with the councils?  I do not think you can, and, after all, builders are given only as an example.  What applies to builders will apply all round: and why should you dispense with the people who are already on?  There is the general case that I have already stated, and there is the narrow case within that very general case, and I would ask the Minister, purely in the interests of the vocational education committees, to undertake to reconsider this whole matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not think we are getting any wiser as the discussion proceeds, Sir.  The position is that under this section we are applying to vocational education committees what is the law with regard to local authorities <Col N="517" /> in general; that is to say, that a person shall be disqualified from being a member of a vocational education committee if</P>
      <P>&ldquo;he is concerned by himself or his partner in any bargain or contract entered into with the council, board or commissioners, or participates by himself or his partner in the profit of any such bargain or contract or of any work done under the authority of the council, or board, or commissioners, and for the purpose of this provision, any bargain or contract with a county council in respect of any public work in a district shall be deemed to be also a bargain or contract with the council of that district.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I am not in a position, Sir, to interpret the law, and I am not going to try to interpret it.  The position which Deputies have sought to argue may arise with regard to vocational education committees' members may arise and possibly has arisen in connection with members of other local authorities.  If Deputy Good, who has an amount of experience of vocational education committees and who has been himself a very active and energetic member, thinks that there is any point really in this thing, I would suggest to him to put down an amendment for the Report Stage.</P>

I say that he ought to complete that sentence, and I say that we are doing it completely contrary to what was the attitude and the recommendation in the formation of vocational education committees in the past, and we are doing it without any examination as to what effect this may have on the <Col N="518" /> vocational committees that already exist.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that we are not getting any wiser. How can we?  The Minister has not given the slightest assistance to the House.  I am sorry to have to say that.  I never asked the Minister to interpret an Act of Parliament.  I asked him to consider the legislation that is going through the Committee Stage here to-day and to consider the effect that that legislation will have on these committees.  That is all I asked the Minister to do.  It is no good to point out what the effects are&mdash;that a man, because he enters into contractual obligations with a council, is disqualified. The Minister proves that by reading out something; but that is my contention.  All I ask is that the Minister should consider that this is going to have the effect of disqualifying a large number of people who are at present qualified to sit on these bodies, and I hold that they are a class of people that we certainly should have every desire to see on these committees. I remember when the Bill was going through, the desire was expressed that businessmen, industrialists, builders and various people of that kind should be on committees of this kind.  Now, we are going to disqualify them and, possibly, to disqualify them wholesale.  The Minister's answer to that is that that is precisely what the Bill means.  Well, it is precisely because the Bill means that that we object to it.  As I say, I am sorry about the attitude the Minister has taken.  It seems to be most unreasonable, and I say that this will damage the committees.  Apparently, however, uniformity means more than that.</P>

    <P>I undertook to put before the House the result of consultations with the Bar and the judiciary.  I consulted the Bar, and I think they are in favour of an amendment on the lines suggested by Deputy Costello that the Court of Criminal Appeal should be constituted of three High Court <Col N="521" /> judges.  I took the opinion of the judges, and they were practically unanimous about the constitution of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The judges said that nothing had been brought to their notice to show that there was any fault to be found with the constitution of the court as it is. They pointed out that nothing was brought to their notice by any member of the legal profession, and, on the whole.  I think it is better to leave the position as it is, the Court consisting of one Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges.</P>

      <P>Was the Minister adverting to things of which that is the effect?  Has the Minister considered the question of appeals from the Criminal Appeal Court to the Supreme Court?  An appeal from the Criminal Appeal Court is on the certificate of the Criminal Appeal Court itself, and I pointed out at various stages of the Bill that that particular kind of appeal, depending on the certificate of the court from which the appeal was taken, was objectionable in principle. While I cannot say so with any degree of accuracy, I think the Minister undertook to look into that matter.  I also think that the Bar Council was anxious that appeals should be by way of application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court itself on questions involving very big principles from the Court of Criminal Appeal and should not be dependent on the certificate of the court from which the appeal was taken, but on the decision of the Supreme Court.  Procedure should be devised by which there should be liberty to appeal, and subsequently, if the court thought it a case fit to prosecute in the Supreme Court, or one raising an important point of law, the Supreme Court could give liberty to appeal.  I do not know if the Minister considered that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct as to what the view of the Bar Council was, but the view of the judges was that the question of giving a certificate for a further appeal was one that the court that had already heard the appeal was more competent to judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest possible respect for the views of the judges, and in anything I say I do not in any way animadvert on their judgment, but I adhere to the stand we took on the question of the certificate, that it is not right in principle that a court from which an appeal is sought to be taken should itself be the judge of what is and what is not a proper case for a higher tribunal.  I am perfectly certain that in every case requiring an application for a certificate, either in the Criminal Appeal Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court, they have always exercised their authority <i>bona fide</i> and have never refused a genuine case.  But we think and we pressed the point on the Minister that it is wrong in principle that such a state of affairs should exist.  We think the Supreme Court, before whom the appeal will be subsequently heard, should, by way of preliminary hearing, have an opportunity of determining whether or not an appeal involving considerations of public policy, or general considerations of law, or raising important principles, have the opportunity of hearing and determining that before the appeal came on. While I have the greatest respect for the opinion of the judges, I think they ought not to be allowed to have full sway, and that the opinion of the Bar Council, of the Bar generally, and of those on this side of the House, should be heard, that a substitute for the certificate which exists at present should be by way of allowing an application to the Supreme Court.  I would like to know if the Minister has any views, other than the fact that the judiciary have expressed their views. While the views of the judiciary are entitled to the greatest possible respect and weight, I think other views might equally be taken into consideration on this particular aspect of the case.</P>

      <P>The judges' point is that it would mean reading all the evidence before the court could decide. If you had to go to the Supreme Court before they would be in a position to deal with it, they suggest that they should know all the relevant facts.  It appears to me that that would be a double hearing before the Supreme Court.  Having considered these aspects, and not having heard any complaints, I am inclined to leave the matter as it is.  I may say that it is probable this is not the last Courts of Justice Bill, and if a case can be made of some miscarriage of justice arising, it might have some bearing then.</P>

      <P>I understood that your suggestion was that if a miscarriage of justice could be made out for an amendment of the law the matter might be further considered in some later Courts of Justice Bill.  I do not wish to press the matter further.  It is one in which we feel that the principle should be left to the appellant tribunal.  We think that as the intention under this Bill is to make the Supreme Court consist of more judges than is the case at present, it therefore gives a very good tribunal to hear important points arising in connection with the administration of the criminal law.  As the Minister cannot see his way to adopt the suggestion, I will not press it.</P>

      <P>To delete Section 12 dealing with appeals under the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act.  Some objection was taken on the Committee Stage. I do not think the Courts of Justice Bill is the appropriate place for this section.

      <P>I think far from having any objection he agreed to it.  Having agreed and inserted it in the Bill I want to know at this stage why it is being put out now.  I am not convinced by the Minister's suggestion that because a commission is sitting legislation will eventuate from the report of that commission.  Everybody knows that commissions sit frequently <i>in sxcula sxculorum</i>, and that legislation resulting from majority reports, or from minority reports for that matter, takes a very long time to eventuate. Now, there is no doubt whatever that an appeal to the law officer under the Industrial and Commercial Property Act is, in itself, a bad principle, and the sooner that it is done away with the better.  I cannot see that there is any substance in the Minister's suggestion that the place to deal with this matter is not in a Courts of Justice Bill.  I think it is.  I think it is the appropriate place to deal with it.  In this Bill we are dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court and of the Supreme Court.  If a thing has any reference to patent law or industrial property, we think that the right conferred upon the Attorney-General, <Col N="525" /> and if I may express my own personal opinion, the burden which was imposed on the Attorney-General under the Industrial and Commercial Property Act of 1927, is one that should be removed at the earliest possible moment.  That is why we object to this section being taken out of this Bill.  It was put in on an earlier stage, and why not let it stay in?  What is the objection to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a similar amendment to this on the Committee Stage and I withdrew it on representations made by Deputy Costello.  I said I would further consider it.  I am informed that no cases have arisen since, and not for some time, that this section would be required to deal with. If a number of cases had arisen, perhaps there would be some case for it, but very few cases at any time did arise, and none has arisen since the Bill was last before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One has arisen in the last six or eight months.  One actually was heard by the present Mr. Justice Maguire when he was Attorney-General. It took days and days to hear.  I regard that as a very grave burden on the Attorney-General.  I regard it as the sort of burden that should not be imposed on the Attorney-General who, not merely has to hear those appeals, but has to advise the Controller of the Patent Office in reference to matters arising in his Department. The Attorney-General has also to advise the various Ministers and the Executive Council in reference to matters arising on the 1927 Act.  That is sufficiently burdensome without placing it in the power of some person who, instead of going to the High Court, can impose this duty on the Attorney-General of having to sit for days and days hearing this particular class of evidence, and then, if he thinks fit, can bring the case to the High Court.  I think the Minister should leave the section in.  It is in the Bill now, inserted by him at our instance and request.  Why it should be deleted at the present moment I fail to see.</P>

      <P>I know it was at the <Col N="526" /> instance of the late Attorney-General that this section was put in.  What I feel about the matter is this: several proposals have been made from time to time to include in this Courts of Justice Bill various matters which I think are not relevant to a Courts of Justice Bill at all.  I think the Deputy will concede that this is a matter which should be dealt with in another Bill resulting from the report of the commission already referred to; that it is in that Bill it should be included and not in this one.  I am attempting to relieve lawyers from the trouble of searching in places that they least expected to find the law dealing with a particular matter.  I suggest that, except in a case where a lawyer is familiar with it, a Courts of Justice Bill is the last place a lawyer would look for a matter of this sort.</P>

      <P>Now that the section is in the Bill, I think it might as well stay in.  The consideration urged by the Minister is one that might have more weight if it were put forward six months ago, but now that this section has appeared in several prints of the Bill, I think it would be just as well to leave it in.  Lawyers dealing with a Courts of Justice Bill will know it better than any other statute, and if this section is allowed to remain in then, when dealing with questions relating to industrial and commercial property, they will not have any trouble in finding out that the jurisdiction of the Attorney-General in reference to patent law is taken away from <Col N="527" /> him by this Bill: I do not think there is any substance in the Minister's proposal. I think that, having extracted from the Attorney-General of the time his acceptance of the principle involved in this amendment, it ought not to be withdrawn now, and be allowed to wait over pending the report of the commission to which the Minister has referred.  That commission may sit for a very long time.  It may take a long time to prepare its report.  When it has reported a long time will be occupied by the various Departments in considering its report, and God only knows when a Bill will result dealing with industrial and commercial property. In the meantime, a reform has been accepted in principle, and the Minister, I think, should give effect to it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister's last argument has any validity whatever.  Even supposing the commission is near the time when it will be considering its final report, <Col N="528" /> everybody knows that, even when the commission has finished its labours, it will be months and months before the various Departments will have had an opportunity of considering that report. It will be years before the Executive Council considers it, and it will probably be decades before the Bill comes before the Dáil.  After long efforts on our part this section was put into the Bill with the concurrence of the Minister and the then Attorney-General.  It has been in print for months, and now the House is asked to delete it merely because a commission is going to report and some legislation may eventuate from the report of that commission. The reform that the amendment proposes to carry out is one that, I think, should not be delayed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 7, Section 13 (2), after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the remittal or transfer of actions under that section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an action shall not be remitted or transferred under the said section if the High Court is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, and notwithstanding that such action could have been commenced in the Circuit Court, it was reasonable that such action should have been commenced in the High Court;</P>
      <P>(b)&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and in line 8, to delete the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the said&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the decision in the Hosie v. Lawless case.  I undertook in the Committee Stage to try and get something, if I might so put it, to make it difficult to transfer a case from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  That is the intention in any case&mdash;to reverse the position in Hosie v. Lawless.  We have tried to get as suitable words as we could, and, as far as the phrasing of the amendment is concerned, it goes as far as we can to try to meet that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has put-down this amendment.  It is an eminently satisfactory alteration. I have considered the proposed wording, and, while a number of alternative drafts could be put forward, I think that this one gives the greatest promise of the largest number of cases to the lawyers.  We shall have a grand time construing this section, and I welcome it with open arms.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that a case stated by the Circuit Court judge will go direct to the Supreme Court and will thus cut out the High Court on a question of law.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 10, Section 24 (1), after the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;unless such judge is of opinion that such question of law is not of sufficient importance to justify such reference&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to give discretion to the Circuit Court judge to refuse to state a case where he considers the case is frivolous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather uneasy about this amendment.  It gives a certain discretion to the judge who has just decided a case to say whether or not it is sufficiently important for a <Col N="531" /> case stated.  However, I shall not raise any objection.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendment was agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12 to delete Section 24 (2), lines 11 to 13 inclusive.&mdash;(Minister for Justice).</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 (Deputy Keyes) not moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, to add at the end of Section 33 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Part of this Act, where a question of law has been referred under this Act by a judge of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court by way of case stated and has been determined by the Supreme Court, no appeal shall lie from the judgment or order, or any part of the judgment or order, of the Circuit Court for the purposes of which such question of law was so referred.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with a rather remote possibility.  It was felt, when the matter was being examined, that litigants having agreed to have a question of law submitted by the Circuit Court judge to the Supreme Court for decision, the defeated party might, subsequent to the decision of the Supreme Court, take the case to the High Court by way of ordinary appeal. We think it is desirable to provide against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister think that desirable?  A very difficult question of law may be involved and it may be eminently desirable to obtain an expeditious decision from the Supreme Court on that point of law. The issues of fact have subsequently to be determined.  These issues may be as important to the litigants as the point of law and I am not at all satisfied that they should not have a right of appeal on the facts.  It is only on the facts that the appeal will be effective, <Col N="532" /> because the High Court will be bound by the decision of the Supreme Court on the point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will not the parties themselves have agreed on the facts in presenting the case stated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Take as an example the case from which I came to-day in the Supreme Court.  The facts were not gone into at all.  The whole point was as to the construction of a certain section.  In a case of that kind, the facts would subsequently have to be determined as between the parties. Before you enter into the facts it may be necessary to have a decision on the construction of a statute.  That decision having been given, the facts would be considered having regard to the law as laid down by the Supreme Court.  I am not at all in favour of this new system but when it is determined that there should be a full rehearing by way of appeal on the facts, I am not sure that that appeal on fact should not also be allowed in this case. The two matters may be in separate watertight compartments.  The appeal on fact would not complicate the matter because when the case would come before the High Court judge on appeal, he would have the law laid down for him by the Supreme Court and he would merely have to address his mind to the issue of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly keen on this amendment, either. What was represented to me when dealing with this particular section was that litigants had an alternative method and that, having agreed on the facts and the case stated having been decided by the Supreme Court, there was a remote possibility that a litigant would take an appeal to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman, perhaps I could be informed whether it would be possible to restrict the right of appeal to grounds other than the point of law determined by the Supreme Court on the case stated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will have to leave these matters more or less in the hands of the judge.  He would get agreement on the facts before submitting <Col N="533" /> the case to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a shred of interest in this case but, under Section 24, all the parties consent to is to refer to the Supreme Court &ldquo;any question of law arising in such matter.&rdquo;  A point of law may emerge which is entirely divorced from and apart from the facts but it may be a point of law on which it would be eminently desirable to seek a decision from the Supreme Court.  Having got that decision, the residue of the case could be proceeded with, having regard to the law as laid down by the Supreme Court.  It would be for the Circuit Court judge to determine how that law should be applied to the facts.  On that question, I think there should be a right of appeal to the High Court&mdash;that is, as to how the law, as found by the Supreme Court on the case stated, should be applied to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so stated. The wording is &ldquo;any question of law arising in such matter.&rdquo;  A question of law may arise in a matter which is pending.  The point of law may be the construction of a section of a statute.  That point might be referred by consent to the Supreme Court in the course of the administration of an estate.  The law having been settled, the matter would be continued in the Circuit Court.  If the Minister's amendment is inserted, it may raise serious complications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 50 and 51, Section 36 (4), to delete the words &ldquo;The Minister for Justice shall by order made after consultation with&rdquo;, and in line 52 to delete the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;shall jointly determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court shall determine jointly in respect of each half-yearly sittings of the High Court on Circuit the number of judges who will travel and sit, and so on.  It is purely a matter of arrangement. Deputy McGilligan moved an amendment in this connection on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 25, Section 40 (3), after the word &ldquo;stated&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;and, in particular, may so adjourn such pronouncement to Dublin and there pronounce his said judgment or order at any time after such determination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Costello raised this point on the Committee Stage.  The object of this amendment is to enable the appeal judge, when he is referring a question of law arising in an appeal to the Supreme Court by way of case stated, to adjourn the pronouncement of his judgment.  It would not mean that he would have to go back to where he heard the case and give his judgment there; he can give his decision in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, before Section 49, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 72 of the Principal Act, the Executive Council may, if and whenever they think proper so to do, permit a justice of the District Court <Col N="535" /> who is assigned to a district which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use and who possesses such knowledge of the Irish language as enables him to dispense with the assistance of an interpreter when evidence is given in that language to continue in office for so long (but not exceeding in any case five years) after he has reached the age of retirement applicable to him by virtue of the said Section 72, and the Executive Council are satisfied that such justice is not suffering from any physical or mental ill-health or disability which would render him unfit to discharge efficiently the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>Amongst the amendments submitted on the Committee Stage was one put in by Deputy MacFadden, the object being to extend the retiring age of a district justice to 70 years in the Gaeltacht areas.  Where these Irish-speaking justices are operating in an Irish-speaking district and are able to conduct the business without the assistance of an interpreter, and where they are physically and mentally fit, it is proposed that they can be continued for a further period not exceeding five years from the retiring age of 65 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this is the proper time to raise a point arising on Section 49, or whether it would be more desirable to wait until the Bill has been reported to the House.  However, it is a small point and perhaps the Minister will consider it.  The section deals with the pension rights of district justices, and it allows district justices who have, prior to their appointment as district justices, occupied certain public positions, to reckon the period of their occupancy of such positions for the purpose of their pensions.  There are one or two of these men&mdash;I am not sure whether there is only the one man&mdash;who occupied a position for 12 months or a couple of years as a legal officer in the Army.  There was certainly one man who occupied such a position.  He was subsequently appointed a commissioner in connection with the Winding-up Commission.  I think, in justice to him, his service as a legal officer in the <Col N="536" /> Army should be reckoned for the purpose of a pension.  It is a matter of considerable importance to him, having regard to the age when he was appointed a district justice.</P>
      <P>A number of concessions have been made by the Minister, and perhaps he would go a step further and give favourable consideration to this particular case.  I do not think it would involve the Exchequer in any great amount, if anything at all eventually, and I think, in justice to the individual, the Minister might see his way to grant this request.  I did not put down an amendment; I thought it more advisable to mention the matter in this way to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give any undertaking along these lines. There is more than my Department concerned in this matter.  We have to a considerable extent improved the position of district justices, as the Deputy will observe from the sections in this Bill.  We have improved their pension rights.  We have taken them out of the position where they were regarded as civil servants, taken them out of the control of the Superannuation Acts.  I have already indicated the improvement in pensions to which they are entitled under the provisions of this Bill.  I have pointed out the alternative proposals giving them an opportunity to opt and retain their old pension rights.  Even then they would get 10 per cent. of an increase.  The great body of the district justices are quite satisfied with that, but as happens in the case of almost every Bill, there will be some people who become district justices late and, while they may fare better than they would have fared ordinarily, they do not fare comparatively as well as the others.  That has been the subject of communications between the Departments and in that connection we have gone as far as we can, and we have set out our proposals in the Bill.  I do not think I can make any promise to the Deputy arising out of the case he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate that the Minister has gone very far to meet our proposals in the way of bettering the position of district justices.  I had <Col N="537" /> intended to express my gratification in connection with the proposals set out in the Bill at a suitable opportunity. The opportunity having arisen now, I would like to say that I think the Minister has dealt very fairly with district justices on the whole, as fairly as I could expect a Minister of the present Government to deal with them, and that is saying a lot.  The district justices have been comparatively well treated under this Bill, and the Minister has met us very fairly indeed. There is only one man affected by this. The general position is that if a man occupies a position in the public service, on being appointed to another position in the public service he is entitled to reckon his previous service. This man served in the Army and I think it only proper that he should be entitled to add his period of service in the defence forces to his period of service as a district justice.  It will involve very little expense on the Exchequer and it may mean a lot of difference to this man.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17, which may be taken together:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, Section 50 (4), (b), to delete in line 43 the brackets and letter &ldquo;(i)&rdquo; and also to delete lines 45 and 50 and substitute for those lines the words &ldquo;decide that such conduct amounts to misbehaviour in office or that it amounts to misconduct and (in either case) that such justice is, on account of such conduct, unfit to continue to hold his office&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In page 20 to delete Section 50 (5).</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 7, Section 50 (6), (b), to delete the words &ldquo;grave misconduct&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;either misbehaviour in office or misconduct&rdquo;, and in line 11 to delete the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;misbehaviour in office or misconduct, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of these amendments is to delete from Section 50 all references to the censuring of district justices.

      <P>In page 21, to delete Section 50 (8). This amendment has somewhat the same effect.  It relates to what was regarded as an objectionable proposal, to inquire into the personal circumstances of the district justice.  I explained what was behind that, what was suggested by some district justices as to the difficulty they had in dealing with cases in certain areas where they had married, and so on.  Representations were made to us and, having considered the matter, we have decided to delete that particular provision.</P>

      <P>In page 21, before Section 51 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever an assistant justice of the District Court appointed (whether before or after the passing of this Act) under Section 13 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928 (No. 15 of 1928), has or shall have completed five years' service as such assistant justice, the salary of £800 per annum which he is entitled, under sub-section (4) of the said Section 13, to receive shall become and be increased, as on and from the 1st day of April, 1936, or such completion (whichever is the later) to £900 per annum.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever any such assistant justice as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section shall have completed ten years' service as such assistant justice, the increased salary of £900 per annum which he is entitled, by virtue of the said foregoing sub-section, to receive shall become and be further increased to nine hundred and fifty pounds per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  All salary payable to an assistant <Col N="539" /> justice by virtue of this section shall be charged on and payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for an increase of salaries of assistant justices of the District Court.  There are three assistant district justices and their salaries, as fixed by previous Acts, are £800 per year.  Under this section they are immediately getting an increase to £900 and after another five years they will be increased to £950. This amendment provides that it shall have retrospective effect from 1st April last, the beginning of the financial year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 23, before Section 55, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever an order is made by the District Court binding a person to the peace or to good behaviour or to both the peace and good behaviour and requiring him to enter into a recognisance in that behalf, such person may, at any time within one month after he has entered into such recognisance in accordance with such order, and on giving seven days' notice to the officer of the Gárda Síochána in charge of the district in which such person resides, apply in a summary manner to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose circuit the courthouse in which such <Col N="540" /> order was made is situate to be released from the obligations imposed on him by such order and such recognisance respectively, and on the hearing of such application such judge may, if he so thinks proper, release such person from such obligations or modify in such manner as such judge thinks proper all or any of such obligations, and may make such release or modification either absolutely or subject to conditions and, in particular, subject to such person entering in the District Court into a new recognisance in lieu of such first-mentioned recognisance.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the right of appeal in cases of binding to the peace.  Representations were made on Committee Stage and I indicated at the time that I agreed with them.  I do not know whether, as drafted, it meets the Deputies opposite, but I think it is as far as we can go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me as a very peculiar provision.  I think it does go some way to meet the objections we raised, but it provides that if a district justice makes a person enter into recognisances to be of the peace, that person has to remain tied by these recognisances pending the appeal, although it subsequently transpires that the district justice ought never to have made him suffer that indignity. I cannot see the point of that.  In an ordinary case of appeal, if a man is sent to jail, he has not to go to jail pending the appeal.  Why should he enter into recognisances to be of the peace pending his appeal?  It may be that he might not find it convenient to get people to go bail for him, as the saying is, to enter into recognisances for him.  They may be his own in £200 and two sureties of £500 each, and he might not be able to get them, and pending the appeal, what is he to do?  It may be an appeal in respect of which the Circuit judge may say that there ought never to have been an order made binding him to enter into recognisances.  As it stands, it seems a very peculiar provision going entirely contrary to the tendency of our Courts of Justice Acts recently to <Col N="541" /> enable an appeal in every case of a criminal matter to be had from the district justice.  I do not know what is behind this particular form of drafting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <P>There is this behind it, that binding to the peace has an instantaneous effect.  That is the advantage of its immediate operation as it is.  I indicated, the Deputy will remember, on the Committee Stage that it was on these lines I could only go.  I discussed it with the then Attorney-General, and apparently the people who have to prosecute think it is of some advantage that binding to the peace should have this instantaneous effect.  I do not think it is going to leave a slur on a man that a conviction may leave, and if, when litigating some other matter, they are being cross-examined as to this binding to the peace, they are in the position of being able to say that they are having that reviewed by the Circuit Court judge.  Under this amendment, they can appear summarily before the Circuit Court judge with a view to having it removed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 25, before Section 64, in Part V to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever in criminal proceedings depositions are taken before a justice of the District Court it shall not be lawful to print or publish in any newspaper, periodical or other publication a report summary or other description of the evidence given by any person appearing in such proceedings during the taking of such depositions and any person who acts in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is introduced with a view to preserving that impartiality right through that ought to be associated with our trials.  There is a feeling <Col N="542" /> in the minds of a very wide section of the community that absolute justice is not done because of the publication of evidence at the stage of the taking of depositions before the district justice.  For obvious reasons, the defence at that stage does not put its cards on the table, and, from one hearing to the other, a pile of depositions is brought forward by the superintendent of the area in an effort to associate the accused with the particular offence.  Automatically and incidentally, there is being created a bias against the accused in the mind of the general public reading this welter of evidence, and nobody is putting evidence forward on his behalf. From that general public is eventually drawn the jury which tries the case, and it is suggested that if the evidence were to be taken without publication of the details, it would make for a fairer trial and the jury who, as I say, would be drawn from the general public, would approach the case with free and fresh minds and with the evidence both for and against before them.</P>
    <P>In certain cases at present, certain district justices use a questionable discretion in relation to the hearing of cases in the absence of publicity. Doubt has been expressed&mdash;I do not attempt to speak with confidence on these legal matters&mdash;as to whether district justices are warranted in doing so.  It is considered desirable to hear certain cases without publicity with a view to the preservation of public morality, and it would be equally good, in the interests of justice to the person concerned, that what is sought in this amendment should be given effect to and that depositions should be taken in the absence of publicity. When the case comes to be tried and the defence is ready to put its cards on the table, all the matters could be given full publicity.  I believe that it would make for the removal of what is felt by a good many people to be an inherent injustice that is being perpetuated in our code at present.</P>

      <P>I do not know that the present system has created any hardship or resulted in any injustice, but, as it is at present, a district justice <Col N="543" /> has power to exclude people from the court.  Under the Rules of Court, in all cases of proceedings for indictable offences, the place in which any justice shall sit for the preliminary investigation of any offence shall not be deemed an open court, and such justice may, in his discretion, order that no person save the person conducting the prosecution and the counsel or solicitor of the person charged shall have access to, or be, or remain in such place without the consent or permission of such justice. That is his discretion now.</P>

Under the present system, there is a welter of evidence creating animus against the charged person in the public mind, and the public will eventually be the jury.  I do not see what disadvantage there could possibly be in adopting this suggestion.  There would be quite sufficient publicity in the Press if the case were mentioned by name without publication of the details, and that is all that is being asked.  It would be no disadvantage to anybody, and it would certainly be an advantage to accused persons who may be innocent and who eventually may be proved innocent of the charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is no reason for it.  This is an amendment that has been introduced in a very incidental manner by the Minister.  Surely he realises that to put an official of the Executive upon the three rule-making committees is doing something that has never been done before?  In the Judicature Act, the Common Law Procedure Acts and all other Acts relating to judicial procedure, the courts have always been independent of the Executive. It has never been suggested that there is any ground for interfering with them in the control of their own procedure. It is not an incidental matter. It is an attack on the independence of the courts and, if it is to be justified, it should be justified on that basis.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 24, 28 and 29, under which it is proposed to have an officer of the Department of Justice sitting on each of the three rule-making committees go together.  I think it is also possibly connected with amendment No. 25 in which it is proposed to delete from Section 66 (3), paragraph (e).  I can quite understand that the Registrar of the Supreme Court, who under the section as it stands, is to be a member of the committee, would not wish to be a member of the committee.  Instead of being a member, he is to become secretary and possibly the Minister has some idea that if the Registrar of the court were no longer to be a member of the committee, he might be replaced by another official.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment for the reason that Lifford is not the centre for Donegal, and besides there is not suitable accommodation there.  Letterkenny is really the centre.  The litigants from a large area of Donegal who would be obliged to go to Lifford would actually have to pass through the town of Letterkenny.  The people of the north-west section of Donegal would actually have to pass through the town of Letterkenny on their way to Lifford, the distance from Letterkenny to Lifford being roughly 18 or 20 miles.  The distance from any part of Inishowen to Letterkenny is somewhat similar to the distance from any part of Inishowen to Lifford, and of South Donegal the same might be said.  For those reasons Letterkenny is really the centre, and would be far more convenient than Lifford for the people of Donegal.  Apart from the litigants I hold that it is a more convenient centre even for those engaged in the legal profession.  Besides, there is ample accommodation there.  It is a town with a population of upwards of 3,500.  It is the centre of education. The County Mental Hospital was constructed there for the reason that it is the centre for the county.  The <Col N="549" /> Hospitals Commission, which has recently been in the county in connection with the hospitalisation of Donegal, decided that their scheme would be for a major hospital, and the centre for that major hospital for Donegal was fixed at Letterkenny.  When that central hospital was completed the County Hospital in Lifford was to be closed, which, in itself, is proof that Lifford is not the centre for a court or for any other institution constructed on behalf of the County Donegal.  There is no accommodation in Lifford.  It is a small township.  There is no hotel, or nobody who caters for people in the way of lunches or teas.  I think those matters should be taken into consideration as a justification for this amendment to delete &ldquo;Lifford&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Letterkenny.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no very fixed ideas about this matter.  Apparently the County Council is proposing to transfer its offices from Lifford to Letterkenny.  There is a courthouse in Lifford where two courts were held in the time of the Assizes, but I understand it was in a very dilapidated condition.  There is at present a courthouse suitable for one court in the town of Letterkenny.  If the Donegal people want to have the court transferred to Letterkenny I have no objection, but they must bear in mind that they will have to erect a suitable courthouse at Letterkenny.  At present such a courthouse is not available for holding two courts.  From the other aspect of the matter I believe it is in some respects more suitable than Lifford.  That may be accounted for by the development of road transport. Formerly it was not so suitable owing to the railways.  I understand that that objection does not now obtain, but what the people will have to be clear about is that they will have to put up a proper courthouse at Letterkenny.</P>

      <P>I might mention that the question of reconstructing or repairing the Lifford courthouse was under consideration a few months ago by the Donegal County Council.  At the present time they have no accommodation in the courthouse for any court.  The District Court is the only court that is being held there.  All the courts have been held in Letterkenny, and the County Council left over consideration of the question of repairing the Lifford courthouse until after the Courts of Justice Bill had been passed. From the point of view of the people of Donegal, they know full well that they would have to expend money on the Lifford courthouse if Lifford were decided on, or, if Letterkenny is decided on, on the reconstruction of the courthouse there.  They know full well that the courthouse would have to be reconstructed even in Lifford.</P>

      <P>Possibly there was also a lack of clarity.  That was due, I think, to the fact that at one time it was contemplated to have another sentence or perhaps other <Col N="551" /> sentences in this amendment.  Consequently, if the House were agreeable, I would seek a transposition of some of the words.  I will read from the draft for the moment: &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 72 of the Principal Act the Executive Council may, if and whenever they think proper so to do, permit a justice of the District Court.&rdquo;  I propose putting in after that the words &ldquo;whom they are satisfied is not suffering from any physical or mental ill-health or disability which would render him unfit to discharge efficiently the duties of his office and&rdquo;&mdash;then resuming the present wording&mdash;&ldquo;who is assigned to a district which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use and who possesses such knowledge of the Irish language as enables him to dispense with the assistance of an interpreter when evidence is given in that language to continue in office for so long (but not exceeding in any case five years) after he has reached the age of retirement applicable to him by virtue of the said Section 72,&rdquo; putting a full stop after &ldquo;72&rdquo; and striking out the remainder of the draft.  I have substantially transposed the last three lines and placed them after the words &ldquo;District Court&rdquo;.</P>

It is the section which deals with the power of the Attorney-General to send forward for trial a case in connection with which the district justice had refused informations.  We were under the impression that that was going to be taken out.  I understood that that was what the Minister said.</P>

The late Attorney-General moved to amend by putting in a new phrase.  On that, a discussion was raised, and I certainly thought that the Minister approved of the whole clause being withdrawn, although the Attorney-General may not have.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question, Sir, on the Money Resolution. I am not in a position to debate <Col N="556" /> the finances of this measure, and the reports upon which this whole measure really is founded have not been given very wide publicity.  There has not been circulated to Deputies, as was done at the time the Shannon Bill was going through, a copy of the report of the experts who considered this matter and who brought the Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board together. It is rather a difficult matter for anybody to consider whether the finances of the scheme are sound or unsound until the views of the experts are before the House.  The House is supposed to pass some very considered view on that point but there is no information available.  This was to a certain extent dealt with by the Minister on his Second Reading speech.  But the reports have not been issued to the Deputies.  I do not know whether they are available in the Library.  How discuss this Bill without them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are very different from those of 1925 when the Government proceeded to get reports from experts and, as a Government, proceeded to carry out the Shannon works.  This Bill provides for what may be regarded as a normal operation in the Electricity Supply Board's activities.  The Electricity Supply Board got whatever advice was considered necessary.  I think the Dublin Corporation also consulted certain experts.  What report was made by those experts to the Dublin Corporation I do not know.  I have not seen the report.  But on that report the Dublin Corporation decided to enter into an agreement with the Electricity Supply Board.  That agreement is a Schedule to the Bill.  The Government, by this measure, is confirming the agreement that was entered into by both bodies; they are conferring upon the Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board the necessary statutory powers.  The Government has, of course, to be satisfied as to the soundness of any plans which involve capital expenditure to be undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board.  They are satisfied that the Electricity Supply Board should be given powers to enter into an agreement <Col N="557" /> with the Dublin Corporation to carry out these works, to have a reservoir constructed forthwith and to proceed with the development of the Liffey for power purposes when they think fit before 1950.  The situation is different from what existed when the Shannon scheme was first put into operation.  Then there was no Electricity Supply Board in existence.  At that time an experts' report was furnished to the Government; it was paid for out of the moneys supplied by the Oireachtas and presented to the Dáil before the legislation was introduced.  I do not think that we should require from the Electricity Supply Board a report in the form which would be necessary if it were to be presented to the Dáil in respect of each stage of its development.</P>
      <P>There is provided in this Bill the necessary capital to enable the Electricity Supply Board to instal additional steam plant which will have a total generating capacity in excess of the Liffey works.  In fact, for some time ahead, at least once every two years, new plant will have to be installed capable of producing as much electricity as the Liffey works at their fullest development.  That is now part of the normal work of the Electricity Supply Board.  The Electricity Supply Board in planning out that work gets from its own officers or from outside experts whatever advice is considered necessary. So far as the Government is concerned its task is to ensure that the plans are financially sound and that the whole progress of the Electricity Supply Board is in accordance with Government policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>The sum involved is £2,750,000 and of this we are told that £635,000 is allocated to the Liffey scheme.  We are told that the Electricity Supply Board in 1934 thought it necessary to call in consulting engineers, Professor Meyer Peter and Dr. Buchi.  These two experts reported to the Board and presumably the Minister for Industry and Commerce got from the Board these reports or a summary of them.  This House is supposed to sanction the expenditure of a large sum in relation to electricity on the <Col N="558" /> Liffey works.  Why?  The Electricity Supply Board thought fit not to accept what the Corporation people had from their advisers.  They retained these two people I have mentioned.  The Electricity Supply Board holds its authority from this House.  They report every year to this House.  The Minister asks for a credit of £2,750,000 for the Electricity Supply Board as far as the Liffey works are concerned. What would it cost to send a copy of these reports to each Deputy or to put one in the Library so that Deputies might read it before they are asked to discuss whether this large sum will be spent in this way or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not. They were made to a creature of the State&mdash;they were made to the Electricity Supply Board, a body set up by this House who got two experts, Professor Meyer Peter and Dr. Buchi. The layman in this House does not know much about these matters.  We are told that the Liffey is going to be developed in two stages.  Why?  Is there £150,000 or £250,000 to be saved by any development that way?  Is there more power to be got by having, as was done on the Shannon scheme, whatever amount of water was to be collected dropped in one place?  I know there is something technical at the back of this.  What it is we do not know.  We should be given an opportunity to find out if the reports were published.  I do not think it would be asking too much to say that the members of the House should have copies of those reports.  If there is any reluctance to have copies circulated to Deputies, the Board might be asked to submit a few copies and leave them in the Library.  Are we not entitled to that information before this measure is put through?  A sum of £635,000 is being spent.  Why is it that sum, and not a larger or lesser sum, and why is the development being done under two forms?  We had better get that information from the people who reported on it instead of having it second-hand from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I think the situation is different from <Col N="559" /> what it was when the Shannon Scheme was put through.  The Dáil has by legislative enactment given to that body control over matters relating to the generation and distribution of electricity.  That body has prepared these plans.  All we are doing now is authorising the advance of money to carry out certain works in the circumstances that now exist. We are merely approving of the proposals of that body.</P>

      <P>Indeed we do.  I was explaining to the Dáil that the Electricity Supply Board if it were merely concerned with its own business would not proceed with this development at the moment.  It is proceeding with this development because it has made an agreement with the Dublin Corporation to do so.  That agreement arose out of the special needs of the Dublin Corporation.  And in consideration of the fact that the Board is proceeding forthwith with the partial construction of the works, at least with works which on its own behalf, it would not construct for some time to come, certain payments are being made and certain arrangements entered into, and all we ask the Dáil is to confirm that agreement to provide the Electricity Supply Board with the capital sum required to finance its normal development for the next two years.  Approximately £600,000 out of £2,500,000 is all that is necessary to finance the works on the Liffey.  In the circumstances now existing, responsibility for the construction of the works, and the engineering plans associated with them, rests upon the Electricity Supply Board.  It is not now the position that existed in 1925, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is seeking to utilise State moneys for the purpose of constructing certain works and geting authority from the Dáil for these works.  In circumstances in which <Col N="560" /> the Electricity Supply Board is in active existence, it is unnecessary to adopt the same procedure as was adopted in connection with the Shannon works.</P>

      <P>If there are other matters on which they have got expert advice I think we should get the reports.  I do not think it is good enough on an expenditure of £2,750,000, with something over £500,000 for the Liffey to be told that the Electricity Supply Board got experts and that they reported.  What have they reported? Are there any reservations?  Was any other plan put to them?  Have they agreed that the development of these two falls is ideally the best in the circumstances, to deal partly with electricity and partly with generation? Is there any division of opinion? Would they have preferred another plan if matters went in the ordinary way?  Would there be cheaper development, if this was delayed?  What are the Board's powers because the Corporation have a certain need in regard <Col N="561" /> to a water supply for the city?  I think it is necessary that these questions should be answered, if there is to be any sort of an attempt to get an intelligent debate on the whole matter, and any attempt at all to get information for the country as to what is happening. I believe the analogy of 1925, even though circumstances have changed, is suitable.  The Minister told us that two experts, Dr. Buchi and Professor Meyer-Peter, were called in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Certain details are given of the area to be flooded, and the volume of the water stored.  Does the Minister think that it is not part of his duty to tell us why there are to be two power houses instead of one?  If he has given any time to it, will he say if this proposal is approved by the two experts? I think we are entitled to get that information, because it is the rational procedure for the House to get any information there is on the whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the arrangement under which the Electricity Supply Board is proceeding now with the construction of certain works on the Liffey, rather than wait until there was a need for such works on its own behalf, it does not involve any extra expenditure.  In fact, it is more economical than the construction of the whole works at one time would be, and, at the same time, meets the more urgent need of the Dublin Corporation in the matter of water supply.  So far <Col N="562" /> as the actual details of the works are concerned, I think we must at present place our reliance on the Electricity Supply Board, to ensure that these are sound from the engineering point of view.  I do not think it would be right or proper for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or his officials, to proceed to put their opinion upon the engineering point of view of these works above that of the Electricity Supply Board.  If the Minister and the Dáil have not confidence in the personnel of the Electricity Supply Board then there is an obligation to change them.  Having that confidence, a confidence which is at present justified, I think we must leave the matter in their hands.  The Board prepares the schemes, and when they involve additional capital expenditure, it is necessary to get my approval.  That approval is given in the ordinary course to schemes that appear to be economic and sound.  In principle there is very little difference between the Board proceeding to tackle the situation on the Liffey and the Board doing precisely the same thing at the Pigeon House. It is installing additional plant at the Pigeon House, and we can assume, I think rightly, that the various plans made in that connection were sound in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to assume that the plans made in connection with the Liffey are equally sound.  The plans which are being immediately proceeded with take into account the requirements of the Dublin Corporation. The Corporation have expert opinion as to how their needs will be satisfied in connection with these plans, and a large part of the total amount of work involved in the whole project will be done by the Corporation, at the expense of the Corporation. No provision is made for that in this Bill.  The report which the Corporation received from the experts is its own property and has not been furnished to me.  We are concerned, therefore, only to the extent to which the combined plans involve expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board and, in that connection, as I stated on the Second Reading, the Board would not be in a position to use <Col N="563" /> economically the power generated from the Liffey for some years to come.  But, on the face of the arrangements made, it can proceed forthwith with the partial construction of the reservoir, to be completed when it is considered sound to do so in its own best interests, and I am informing the House that that does not involve the Board in any additional expense. Rather the contrary, it involves an economy, and it was on that basis that, <Col N="564" /> I think, the Board undertook the arrangement.</P>

    <P>(a)  impound, hold up, divert, <Col N="566" /> take, and use the waters of the River Liffey above Ballymore Bridge and any river or stream tributary to, and any lake, pond, or canal on or connected with, the River Liffey above the said bridge; ...</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 9, after the word &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;Provided that the Board shall not at any time reduce the average flow of water in the River Liffey, during any week in the period from the 1st April to the 30th September, below such quantity as shall have been ascertained to be the average flow during such periods in the five years ending 1936.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In asking the Minister to accept this amendment I am under no illusion as to the importance of the City of Dublin having an adequate water supply.  The amendment really means that during the period of the year when normally the river would be low, it shall not be allowed to fall below the average supply.  Of course, the Minister may say that Dublin must have first call on the reservoir.  While I agree with that, I should like to point out that there is another reservoir at Roundwood, and surely by working the two together it can be managed that an adequate supply will always be left in the river for fish. We do not want, for instance, to find that all the fish in the river have been killed, and that by a slight manipulation that could have been avoided.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on that matter.  I should also like to ask him what would be the relative storage capacity normally of the Liffey basin and the reservoir in Roundwood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendment, I should say at the outset that our advice is that the works proposed to be constructed on the Liffey will not interfere with the fisheries.  In any event, the main purpose of the Bill, of course, is to confirm the agreement which has been made between the Electricity Supply Board and the Dublin Corporation, and one of the <Col N="567" /> items in that agreement provides for the discharge of water.  The arrangement in contemplation provides that where the low level of the reservoir falls below a particular point the Board will not permit to be discharged more than 1.5 cubic metres per second. That figure was fixed on the basis that it was ascertained that the minimum flow of the Liffey was 1.5 cubic metres per second.  What the Deputy is proposing in his amendment is to improve the position in respect to fisheries, because he is seeking to provide that the flow will always be maintained at the average, which would be an improvement, of course, upon present conditions, where exceptionally low water may prevail at some time.  We are providing that, in the worst of circumstances, the minimum flow would not be less than the minimum flow has been in dry seasons in the past.</P>
      <P>In any event, Section 16 of the Bill provides that there shall be consultation with the Minister for Fisheries and that whatever works he considers necessary for the purpose of preserving the fisheries shall be carried out. I give the Dáil the assurance that the power of acting in consultation with the Minister for Fisheries in that matter will be exercised in order to ensure that the damage done to fisheries, if any, will be kept to the minimum.  Of course, the primary consideration must be the efficiency of the works in order to ensure that they will be properly utilisable for the purpose of generating electricity and providing water to the city.  It is not anticipated that that will do any damage to the fisheries, and if such damage is feared, then the Minister for Fisheries will be able to step in for the purpose of suggesting the works that should be done to prevent the damage.  I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Fisheries is already taking a keen interest in that matter to ensure that this particular function will be discharged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister.  The Minister for Fisheries, with a pistol more or less put to his head, by saying: <Col N="568" />&ldquo;Do you wish the citizens of Dublin to be left without water?&rdquo; may have to agree to something that, as Minister for Fisheries, he would never think of agreeing to.  What I am really coming at is that the Liffey and Roundwood should be considered as one for the supply of water to Dublin, and that&mdash; I am now, I know, trespassing on dangerous ground by asking about the pipes&mdash;there should be proper supply pipes from both reservoirs, so that the Minister for Fisheries cannot be some morning confronted with a water shortage which could be avoided if there were proper and adequate pipes from Roundwood.  I ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the flow will be, at least, equal to the minimum flow in the past.  It is not unlikely that, as a result of the construction of the works, the general position as regards the flow of water in the Liffey will be improved.  Deputy Dockrell is probably influenced by reports he has heard here and outside as regards damage to the fisheries in the Shannon. The damage done to the fisheries in the Shannon has been very slight. With the new arrangement being made there, consequent on the enactment we passed last year, the Shannon fisheries will become a considerable national asset.  The nature of the works contemplated on the Liffey materially differs from those carried out on the Shannon.  In fact, a number of the tributaries of the Liffey enter the river below the point at which the reservoir will be constructed.  My general argument in relation to the Deputy's amendment is&mdash;(1) we are advised that no damage at all will be done to the fisheries; (2) if damage is considered by the Minister for Fisheries as likely to arise, to the extent that it is possible to do so, such works will be undertaken by the Board, or by a contractor acting under the Board, as will avoid the possibility of that damage occurring, subject as provided by Section 16, to the necessity of ensuring that the works will not be of such a nature as will be detrimental to the Liffey works or involve a substantial hindrance to their operation or a substantial increase in the cost of their <Col N="569" /> construction.  If it should happen that damage must unavoidably be done, the compensation provisions will come into operation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked what was the proposed capacity of the Liffey reservoir in relation to Roundwood.  It is necessary to bear in mind that the reservoir on the Liffey is being constructed for another purpose than the supply of water to the city.  The capacity of the Liffey reservoir will be from 15 to 20 times the capacity of Roundwood.  The amount of water that the Corporation may draw is, of course, limited&mdash; 20,000,000 gallons a day.</P>

      <P>If the catchment had half the capacity which it is proposed to have, the House would not be asked to supply the amount of money it is being asked to supply now.  That amount must bear a relation to the storage capacity of the catchment. Nevertheless, we are asked to supply this sum of money without knowing what the capacity is.  The Minister got a plan and investigated it.  He told us on the Money Resolution that it was not proper for him or his civil servants to put their judgment against that of the experts, but they exercised sufficient judgment to make up their minds whether the experts were right or not.  Section 7 follows almost line for line, with the necessary changes&mdash; putting in the word &ldquo;Board&rdquo; and providing for the change regarding the Liffey above Ballymore Bridge&mdash;the clauses in the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925.  There is one important addition. In 1925 it was thought that very wide powers should be taken in connection with the construction of the whole Shannon works.  The clause which corresponds with clause (d) in this section gave the Minister power to &ldquo;remove, or alter, repair, construct <Col N="571" /> and maintain such sluices,... and other works as may be necessary for or incidental to the doing of any of the things mentioned...&rdquo; It was, however, left open to anybody who thought the Minister was acting beyond his powers to go to the courts and challenge him.  That is now precluded by the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;as may in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; be necessary.</P>
      <P>There was no difficulty in carrying out the other works with the limitation on the people then working, that their action might be challenged in the courts.  That is all guarded against in the present Bill.  There is a reaction beyond that particular clause because when we come to (b) the Board is given power to enter on any lands or premises for the purposes of doing thereon all or any of the things which the Board is authorised by this sub-section to do.  One of the classes of things which they are authorised to do is covered by this clause as to what they deem necessary.  Finally, seeing that there is an enlargement in the earlier clause, there is, by repercussion, a corresponding enlargement in (i).</P>
      <P>The scheme of the Bill is that the Board is, so to speak, to do all this work itself but then by sub-section (3) the more practical side comes in.  It is recognised that the board will do this work through contractors and, when it enters into contracts for the execution of any of the works, it may confer on the contractors the right to do whatever it is authorised to do.  Does that transfer to the contractor the power to decide that something is necessary in his opinion?  Does the expression which covers the Board under (d) cover the contractor when the Board gives the contractor powers or will the contractor be limited by appeal from time to time to the courts when he is doing something governed by (d)?  Is the contractor to be subject to supervision by a court authority or may he also be protected by having transferred to him this power and by saying that, in his opinion, the work is necessary and therefore can be done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to ensure that the contractor will be <Col N="572" /> allowed to do only such things as are necessary in the opinion of the Board. I think that that is the obvious interpretation of sub-section (3).  It is clear that, in practice, the contractor would be carrying out a contract which he has made with the Electricity Supply Board to do certain things which the Electricity Supply Board has deemed to be necessary in connection with the carrying out of this project.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, therefore, to give the contractor these powers to enter upon lands and to give those other powers which the Electricity Supply Board will have conferred on them by this statute.</P>

      <P>Why should we, in any event, without regard to the experience arising out of the 1927 Act, create the possibility of the question being raised in the courts as to whether the construction or the alteration of dams, embankments, sluices and weirs is necessary for the carrying out of the work specified in the preceding paragraphs of the sub-section?  I think the commonsense thing to do is to set out in this Bill that the Board can do such things as may, in the opinion of the Board, be necessary for the purpose of carrying out any of the things mentioned in the earlier part of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference lies in the phrasing.  Here we have the phrase that the Board may construct embankments and other works which in their opinion it would be necessary for them to do for the purpose of carrying out the things mentioned in previous paragraphs.  I suggest that the phrasing should be that the Board are empowered to construct such embankments, etc., as may be necessary to carry out all the previous matters. The point is, will they be doing something <Col N="573" /> so outrageous and so clearly outside the previous matters that the court may say that these things are not necessary and they may hold the board off from doing that?  Why should not an independent judgment be given on that point?  The Minister says he does not want to give these people any more powers than are necessary to construct the works. They are only asked to run the gauntlet on this one point: Can they justify to an independent authority, for instance, a court, that what they propose to do is necessary?  Why should they be allowed to say: &ldquo;We think this is necessary, whether the court thinks so or not?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take a reasoned view of the circumstances and let us use the same illustration as the Deputy has used.  Is it more likely that the board will construct an embankment for the purpose of impounding the waters of the Liffey of so extraordinary a nature that the court will deem it to be unnecessary or that some person with a bee in his bonnet and a taste for litigation will go to the court for the purpose of getting a declaration that something which the board are quite reasonably doing is wholly unnecessary and so waste time and money endeavouring to delay the project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean with the court's permission&mdash;that the courts will lend themselves to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seeks to delete from the section words which are a safeguard for the Board in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But you say in the early part of the section that the board are entitled to divert the waters of the River Liffey above Ballymore Bridge and any river or stream tributary thereto.  There may be some question arising on any one of these phrases.  In all these matters there is a certain phraseology used and if people are in doubt about the interpretation, or if they have a bee in their bonnet, they should be in a position to go to the court and get any one of the phrases explained.  If the <Col N="574" /> Minister wants to safeguard the board and if he thinks there will be people with bees in their bonnets, he can put the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; everywhere.  He only does it when he comes to the incidental powers&mdash;something necessary or incidental to the doing of other things. It is only in paragraph (d) that he does it.  I suggest that that carries on down to (h) and (i), particularly (i), which is very wide.  It is the usual clause of the incidental type. It has to be grafted on to the enlargement of (d).  To that extent &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; will cover not merely whatever is incidental in (d), but whatever may be incidental under the more general clauses later.</P>
      <P>The Shannon works was a far bigger undertaking, and yet it was carried out without any obstruction.  No one thought fit with regard to the work that went on there of putting forward the plea that certain things were not necessary.  There was no difficulty, and that work ranged over four-and-a-half years.  The phrasing is already wide enough and why put down such things as &ldquo;which may be necessary for or incidental to&rdquo;?  Why extend it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thing is subject to this, that the Board are given these powers for the purpose of carrying out work under the scheduled agreement.  We cannot assume that the Board are going to do all sorts of unnecessary things simply because these powers are given to them.  They will only use the powers for the purpose of carrying out the Liffey undertaking under the obligations imposed upon them by the scheduled agreement.</P>

    <P>(2)  At any time after the passing of this Act and before conveyance or ascertainment of price or compensation, but subject to giving not less than one month's or, in the case of an occupied dwelling-house, three months' previous notice in writing to the occupier of the lands or premises or the owner of the easement or other property or right affected, the Board and every contractor authorised so to do by the Board may enter on and take possession of any lands or premises or exercise any right which the Board is authorised by this section to acquire compulsorily, or may terminate, restrict, or otherwise interfere with any easement or other property or right which the Board is authorised by this section compulsorily to terminate, restrict, or interfere with, or may divert, close, remove, or otherwise interfere with any road, way, bridge, water-way, or water-course which the Board is authorised by this section compulsorily to divert, close, remove, or interfere with.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Board under this section enters on and takes possession of any lands or exercises any right (as the case may be) before payment of the price or compensation, the Board shall pay to the occupier of the lands or owner of the easement or other right affected (as the case may be) interest on the amount of such price or compensation when fixed at the rate of four pounds per cent. per annum from the date of such entry or taking possession or the exercise of such right (as the case may be) until the date of the conveyance from such occupier or owner to the Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to increase the time of notice, because the farmers consider they are entitled <Col N="576" /> to several months' notice in advance with regard to what the Board are going to do with the land.  It seems to me that a longer notice than one month in the case of land, and at least three months in the case of a dwelling-house, should be given.  I do not want to press the Minister unduly over this matter.  I would be satisfied if I could get from him an assurance that a couple of months' notice will be given. Perhaps he will give me the assurance that reasonable notice will be given and that these people will not be turned out a month or even three months after they have been notified?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the amendment, even though I do not think it would be wise to insert it in the Bill.  Following representations along the lines submitted by the Deputy now, which were made by representatives of the County Wicklow and other persons interested&mdash;the persons likely to be affected by this section&mdash;I got in touch with the Electricity Supply Board and received an assurance from them that in the vast majority of cases they will be able to give even a year's notice of the intention to exercise their right of interference. Only in very few cases will shorter notice have to be given.  It is desirable to maintain their right to do that so that the work can be proceeded with expeditiously.  Even in respect of these cases it is to be borne in mind that the actual giving of the notice to secure right of entry on the land will not necessarily involve immediate interference.  Such work as the clearing of trees, the levelling of ditches and so on would have to be undertaken, in any event.  The Electricity Supply Board are in complete agreement with me that in each case the longest possible notice should be given.  They say that in the majority of cases the notice will not be less than twelve months.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to refer. I am not quite sure whether I am in order in raising them on this section. I understand that with regard to the Blessington sewerage, there will probably be an increased cost of about £1,800 due to this Liffey Bill.  If that be so, it is a terrible extra charge to put on a local area.  Can the Minister give us any idea of what will happen in that case and whether compensation will be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Wicklow Board of Health decided to have a sewerage system in Blessington, but when this Bill was initiated, the engineer to the Dublin Corporation made an order requesting the board of health to continue the system four miles further up the river, which as Deputy The O'Mahony has pointed out, would mean £1,800 extra on the board of health.  That is a very serious matter for the ratepayers of the area concerned. The septic tank erected was quite sufficient for the requirements of Blessington, but, on account of the acquiring of the Poulaphouca river, the Corporation engineer suggests that a separate tank must be put up near Poulaphouca bridge.  That involves a further four miles without any promise of compensation to the board of health.  We want some assurance from the Minister that if the board of health agees with the Dublin Corporation and extends the system four miles, some compensation will be provided for the extra cost incurred.  Otherwise, I do not see how they can proceed with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>They have already served the board of health engineer <Col N="578" /> with notice.  The plans which were approved by the board of health are now held up because the Corporation insists that the system must be extended four miles without any promise of compensation to the Wicklow Board of Health.  We want some assurance that if the board of health undertakes the additional work, the Corporation or some other body will compensate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheOMahony" hpid="The O'Mahony The O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Wherever as a result of the operation of this Act the supply of water hitherto enjoyed or available in respect of any lands or premises is no longer available or is available only to an inadequate extent and where no alternative supply of water is available, it shall be the duty of the Board to provide an alternative supply either from the reservoir or from such other reasonable source as may be necessary.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Board is of opinion that the cost of providing an alternative supply of water under this section would be uneconomic or for any other reason inexpedient, the Board may acquire permanently such lands or premises affected, either compulsorily or by agreement, as if such lands were required for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to safeguard <Col N="579" /> the interests of anyone who has at the moment an adequate water supply on his farm, but who, under this Bill, will lose the right of access to that water and whose farm will be left without any water at all.  That would create a very serious problem for anyone who found himself in that position because land, unless it is watered, becomes practically valueless. The whole idea of the amendment is to provide water to replace water which was previously available for land and which may no longer be available under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board, as advised by its experts, are of the opinion, judging from the surveys carried out and the contours of the land that will be affected, that there will, in fact, be no difficulty in providing an alternative supply of water for domestic and other purposes to the owners and occupiers of land whose existing supply may be interfered with by the Liffey works. If, however, it should not be possible to afford an alternative supply, compensation will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Bill.</P>

Section 10 is the section which empowers the Board, wherever anything arises for which the Board would have to pay compensation, such as the destruction of a water supply, to provide instead an alternative to that which has been destroyed, and it is <Col N="580" /> intended to do that in every case, of course.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

In fact, so far as it is possible to discover at present from surveys carried out, there will be no difficulty in supplying alternative water to any of the premises or lands likely to be affected, but we have to provide against that case that may arise.  In such a case, compensation will be payable, but all these factors would have to be taken into account in assessing the compensation. I think the Board, if they find that the amount of compensation due in fact equalled the value of the land, might adopt the device suggested by Deputy The O'Mahony and acquire the land.</P>

Would it be necessary for the board to have the power given by that section if a general power were given in the Bill?  Sub-section (5) says:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the board is of opinion that the payment of compensation for the flooding of, or other interference with, any land or premises under this section would be <Col N="583" /> uneconomic, or for any other reason inexpedient, the board may acquire permanently such lands or premises under this section either compulsorily or by agreement.&rdquo;</P>

If not, the only power they have under this Bill, whether they are acting in a compulsory way or by agreement, to acquire land is for the purpose of the Liffey undertaking or for the purposes of the scheduled agreement. They may come to a particular area of land and take part of it, or they may interfere with a man's property by destroying the water supply.  They approach that man, under Section 10, and say: &ldquo;We will give you another supply,&rdquo; and the man says: &ldquo;I do not want that.&rdquo; Deputy The O'Mahony proposes that where the provisions of an alternative supply would be considered uneconomic, the Board should have power to acquire the land.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever as a result of the acquisition of lands or premises for the purposes of this Act any person is deprived of employment, such person shall be entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>(2)  Such compensation shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, as if the person so deprived of employment had been an officer of a local authority under the said section of the said Act and as if the Board had been a local authority employing such person.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to safeguard anyone who may lose his or her employment by the operation of this scheme.  For instance, there are certain school teachers in that area and they might be very seriously affected by this Bill.

      <P>In the case of the Shannon scheme, it was suggested that we should pay compensation to persons who were engaged in stoking boilers where these boilers went out of use because electrical power was used instead.  Once you decide upon the principle of paying compensation, otherwise than for the destruction of property, there is no limit to where you may stop.  You will find that in some way almost any person in the country can claim to have been affected by the construction works.  Certainly that was the case in the Shannon scheme and no provision whatever was made in the Shannon Electricity Supply Act for the purposes of paying compensation in such cases.  We did to a slight extent depart from that principle when we introduced here in 1933, I think, a Bill to provide compensation for certain ex-employees of the Cork Tramway Company, but that, I think, was a very special case.  The measure was decided and accepted by the House as a very special measure to meet a very special case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is possible to embody in this Bill the principle which the Deputy has enshrined in his amendment.  It has never been done in any similar Bill, and would involve widespread difficulties if adopted now. Construction of this dam at Poulaphouca and of the generating station there is in fact going to increase the opportunities of employment in the area for ordinary workers.  I do not think the fishermen at Ringsend will be affected in any way by the measure, <Col N="586" /> and in the case of school-teachers it is not clear that they will in fact be affected.  Of course it is possible to adduce individual cases of hardship resulting from any such scheme as this, but I think it would be unwise on the basis of such individual cases to adopt a principle which has not heretofore been adopted.  Similar cases arose in connection with the Shannon scheme, and were in fact debated here.  There was the case of the employees in a mill which was destroyed for the purposes of the Shannon scheme.  The owner of the mill got compensation, but those who were employed in the mill and lost that employment got no compensation. You had almost similar cases to that arising in other parts of the Shannon area, where the construction or operation of the Shannon scheme had resulted in loss of employment.</P>
    <P>We admitted in relation to the Shannon that there was a special case in connection with the fishermen who were employed there, because, of course, their circumstances were entirely different to those of ordinary workmen.  The ordinary workmen, say, in the Poulaphouca area, will continue to be available for employment; in fact their opportunities of employment will not be disimproved, and if they were compensated in the manner suggested by the Deputy they would, in fact, be in a more favourable position than similar workmen in adjacent areas.  In the case of the fishermen on the Shannon the opportunity of carrying on the only work they were skilled to do was taken away from them, and there was little or no possibility that they would ever again get a livelihood as fishermen.  Consequently, provision was made for them, but I submit that that was a special case, and not analagous to the case of the workers&mdash; who are, I think, almost entirely agricultural workers&mdash;who may become disemployed in consequence of the construction of this reservoir at Poulaphouca. In their case I do not think we can agree to provide a statutory right to compensation.  I think we would be able to ensure that they would get employment, although I cannot enter into any binding commitment in that respect but, in fact, there is <Col N="587" /> going to be a very large number of people employed in that area for many years to come, and the prospect of those people getting employment will, on that account, be considerably enhanced.  I think we can leave the matter at that.  I am prepared to discuss with the Minister for Education the position of the national teachers to whom the Deputy has referred, and I am sure that we can rely generally upon the co-operation of other Government Departments in reducing to a minimum any hardship that may arise in consequence of the construction of this reservoir.</P>

      <P>With regard to what the Minister has said, I quite realise that there will be a great deal of employment given in that area, but in framing this particular amendment I really had in mind people who may not be able to get employment; they may not be physically strong enough to do the work that would be required under this particular scheme, while they were able to perform the work which they were previously doing.  I was thinking also of the national school teachers to whom the Minister has referred.  However, I am quite satisfied with what the Minister has said, and I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <P>(a)  allowance shall be made on account of the acquisition being compulsory;</P>
    <P>(b)  in assessing the amount of compensation to be paid the basis of value shall be the amount which the land or premises, if sold in the open market by a willing seller, might have been expected to realise on an average during the years 1928-1930, together with an amount of 50 per cent. of such estimated purchase value as compensation for disturbance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheOMahony" hpid="The O'Mahony The O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendments is to make more definite what is to be the basis of compensation for those who are going to lose their property.  I have here the Official Report, and on the Second Stage of the Liffey Reservoir Bill the Minister, in summing up the debate, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I can assure Deputies who addressed themselves to the question of compensating those whose lands and houses are likely to be submerged by the proposed reservoir at Poulaphouca that the members of the Government are just as deeply concerned as they are with payment of compensation to these people.  We are anxious to ensure that no undue hardship will be occasioned to these people because of the inauguration of this scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, so far is all right, but later on he rather spoiled it, because he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think it is necessary, as one Deputy suggested, to take into account the variations that have arisen in recent years in the value of land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that by saying that, he does admit that there have been variations. The variations have been rather considerable.  The Minister then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The basis of compensation will be the present value of the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> It is on that basis that compensation will be fixed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hold very strongly that if compensation is fixed on the present value of land it is not a fair basis under the present circumstances.  As I said on the Second Reading, we all know that, if the present dispute between ourselves and our neighbour across the water were settled, the price of land would go up, and because this unhappy situation exists at the present time why should the people who are going to be deprived of their property be mulcted through this unfortunate dispute between this country and Great Britain?  I think we should get away from this period, and go back to a period when there was not this dispute.  That is what is really behind my amendment.  The Minister in his own speech on the Second Reading admitted that he wanted to see those people properly compensated, but, as I say, unfortunately, later on he definitely said that the basis of compensation must be the present value of land.  I say that is not fair, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter, and see whether on the Report Stage something could not be done to give some assurance that fair treatment would be given in the matter of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy The O'Mahony and I should like to point out to the Minister the case of labourers' cottages that may be submerged or acquired under this scheme.  If the board of health were only to receive the present value of these cottages, they would be unable to rebuild a new house of a similar type to the former cottages which were built 20 or 30 years ago.  Houses that were built for £100 or £120 about 30 years ago could not be built at the present value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Deputy's point that these houses have appreciated in value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister says that he is going to give the market value of to-day for a house that was <Col N="590" /> built 30 years ago.  I say that, if that is the case, we would be unable to build a new house for that price or to purchase land in that locality where land will be much dearer now.  Will the Minister guarantee to give the board of health the cost of providing these tenants with cottages, plus the repayment of the unpaid loan on the old houses?  That is only fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that the value of the cottages has appreciated and that the value of land has depreciated. The Deputy from Wicklow wants it both ways.  I will admit that, due to various causes, the value of land has varied from time to time, but I deny that everything has operated to depreciate the value.  Take, for instance, the reduction in the land annuities.  That must have had the effect of increasing the value of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that there may have been things in the last few years to prevent that reduction operating to its full effect, but in any event, in the last few years there have been events that operated both ways with regard to the value of land.  In any case, however, I think I can justify without question the payment of compensation for land acquired now on the basis of present value.  Surely, if we go to a man whose farm is required for the purpose of this scheme, and if we give him as the price of the land acquired an amount of money that will enable him to buy another farm of equal value, and if we are also compensating him in respect of the disturbance to which he has been subjected, he is getting sufficient compensation?  In any event, he gets, in addition to the value of the land, a sum in respect of the disturbance. I think that is a fair basis of compensation.  It is the basis which was embodied in the Shannon Acts and it operated, I think, in a manner which <Col N="591" /> gave reasonable satisfaction in respect of land acquired for the purposes of the Shannon scheme&mdash;a fact which is borne out by the figures which I gave here on the Second Reading, which showed that in over 90 per cent. of the cases there was, in fact, no reference to the arbitrator at all.  There was agreement between the persons, whose lands had been flooded or acquired, and the Electricity Supply Board, in that case, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as to the compensation that should be awarded.  I am quite certain too, that in the Poulaphouca area, when we come to acquire the lands there also, in the great majority, if not all of the cases, it will be possible to reach agreement as to the compensation to be paid&mdash;perhaps, after a test case has gone before the arbitrator&mdash;or, if that agreement cannot be secured, then we will arrange for the settlement of disputes on the basis of the Land Assessment of Compensation Act of 1919.  That Act provides for the payment of market value, plus allowance for disturbance, and I think that is reasonable.  The majority of the persons who are occupiers of agricultural land in that area will desire, I am sure, to continue in the occupation of agriculture, and they will be able to acquire other lands which will have the same value as the lands which they have lost.  I am sure that, in that connection, we will be able to enlist the co-operation of the Land Commission, and I hope to do that so that, not merely will these people get other farms of similar value and compensation for the disturbance, but that in their new areas they may have, perhaps, the same neighbours as they have in the areas in which they are now living. As regards the labourers' cottages, the board of health will get paid compensation upon the present value of these cottages.  Now, it is possible that the present value may be higher than the amount of money spent upon their construction 30 years ago.  I do not think it will, but if that should be so, they will get the amount of the present value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, the Minister has missed Deputy Everett's <Col N="592" /> point.  He has stated that, in so far as land is concerned, the amount of money given will enable a person whose lands have been taken to get a farm of equal value, but the point about the labourers' cottages is that, as the Minister said, the cottages have depreciated in value.  Naturally, they have.  My suggestion is that the Minister ought to give the board of health sufficient money to enable the man to be reinstated in a cottage. It is possible now, on the basis of present value, that the amount of money will not be half sufficient to enable a new cottage to be built.  It it not too bad to have the community suffer a small loss like this, but the Minister must remember that in recent months a Bill has been passed here, the Labourers' Bill, to enable tenants to take over their own cottages.  The compensation for these cottages may be at a reduced rate and that will mean that these people will suffer a severe hardship if the Minister does not give compensation sufficient to enable the board of health to reinstate these people. I think that the fact that they have bought recently will mean that they will suffer hardships in consequence of their cottages being taken from them.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a rather plausible case when answering Deputy The O'Mahony's point.  The main thing on which he relied was this that if there was depreciation in the value of land in Wicklow that that depreciation applies all round and that therefore if a man is deprived of his farm in Wicklow he gets sufficient compensation to buy a farm elsewhere, he gets a farm of equal value.  The point the Minister made was that if the land in Wicklow has gone down in value the land in Kildare has gone down too.  That is the Minister's argument.  But supposing a man with 40 acres in Wicklow lost 15 acres by the Liffey waterworks does not the Minister know that his argument will not apply in such a case?  That man wants to keep the 25 acres of land that is left to him. He wants to stay where he has always lived.  In a case such as that, and there would be numbers of such cases, I suggest it would not be fair compensation to give such a man the present value of the land that was taken from him.  I am sure the Minister will admit that whatever factors are operating at present causing the value of land to have a downward tendency&mdash;according to the Minister the tendency is upwards&mdash;at all events the value of land at the moment is not the value of land in normal circumstances. There are factors operating at present that will not be permanent.</P>

      <P>Taking it that the Minister was serious in his statement on the Second Reading that he was anxious to meet these cases I want to point out that the arguments he put up do not at all meet the instance I have given where a man has 15 acres taken out of a farm of 40 acres.  Such a man will not get adequate compensation under the Bill as it stands.  He will not get adequate compensation if you merely pay him on the present value of the land. No matter how the Minister may try to smile or jump the matter, I must say that it is not fair to the farmer if he is only paid what is the present value of the land.  He should be paid the normal value of the land.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not at the moment regard any year as normal.  I am anxious that the Minister should look at this from the point of view of the Legislature and not from the point of view of the Electricity Supply Board or the Department.  He should not look at it from the point of view of a very efficient Board or a strong Board.  I would ask him to step down and look at it rather in favour of the farmer whose land is going to be interfered with.  There is not such a very large sum involved.  I think the Minister would be very well advised if he would consider the principle contained in Deputy The O'Mahony's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  I agree with the Minister that the present value of <Col N="595" /> land that is being subsidised for the growing of beet and wheat may be the normal value.  But I ask the House to take the generous view that there are approximately 50 farmers involved. Now if the farmers whose lands are taken in Wicklow try to buy a similar farm elsewhere&mdash;say in Kildare or one of the adjoining counties&mdash;they will not get it at the present price of land in Wicklow.  There is no doubt about that.  They will not be able to buy a farm of equal value to their own farm in one of the adjoining counties. The Minister should make up his mind about that matter.  He has missed that point in the case of these 50 farmers in Wicklow.  Most of them will have to go to another county and buy farms of a different type there.  The Minister must remember that the present value of a farm in Wicklow is, undoubtedly, affected by the economic war.  That is because of the fact that in Wicklow they produce only sheep, pigs, cattle and poultry.  The farmers there are affected to the extent of at least 40 per cent.  For that reason, the Minister should draft an amendment to give to the farmers whose lands will be taken the present value of their land plus 33 to 40 per cent.  It is a very small sum. About 50 farmers are involved and these men are not going to get farms of equal value in the County Wicklow. They will have to go elsewhere to get the farms.  To get land similar to what they have they will have to go to Donegal, Mayo and Sligo.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree with me that they should be placed in the position where it would be possible for them from the compensation paid to get land of equal value.</P>

      <P>It will be a similar farm.  Take the case of a man with a farm running up into the mountains. There are 100 acres of mountain attached to it on which the farmer raises a lot of sheep and makes his living in that way.  He is not going to get that class of rough land in Kildare. He would not get that much land, and if he gets a farm in Kildare he will be forced to carry on a different class of farming on it.  The compensation that he will get under the Bill will not buy him in Kildare a farm of similar usefulness at all.  It is only in one of the western counties or in Donegal that he would get a farm like the one that is taken from him and he may not care to go to the West.  The Minister should act quite fairly by these farmers and at least 33 per cent. should be added in compensation to the value of their present holdings.</P>

      <P>There is one small point that I wish to bring to the notice of Deputies.  I wonder in how many cases of these 50 farmers will the whole farm be taken?  There will not be very many such.  In most cases part of the land will be left with them.  That will happen to a number of them. These cases make the argument for Deputy The O'Mahony's amendment still stronger.  It would be quite feasible where a man's whole farm has been taken to find him a similar farm but, where you take ten or 20 or 30 acres from him, what is left will be of very much less value to the farmer per acre than the value per acre when he had the whole farm.  I do not know how many farms will be taken over in their entirety.  The number where the land would be taken over, leaving part in the hands of the owner are the cases in which Deputy The O'Mahony is most interested.</P>

      <P>It is all very fine to say that these farmers will get alternative holdings.  Deputies should remember that these men have been brought up on these farms.  They have <Col N="597" /> lived on them all their lives and they know how the farms should be run. They probably make their land pay. When these people are taken out and put into a farm in another part of the country they will be new to the land and they probably will lose money for the first few years until they get into the way of working the land.  Take the case of a man who had 100 acres of turbary.  Such a man would agree at present that he had a gold mine. Look at the position in which you are placing him when you transfer him to another part of the country.  He would not be in the same advantageous position for his markets as he is where he now stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker.  It is not a question so much of finding another farm, say, in County Kildare, to replace the one from which a man has been moved.  I am supposing that a man has lost his whole farm and that if he goes to Kildare and gets land there he will get less than he had previously.  With the compensation he will buy the other farm, and he will have to farm on totally different lines from those that he or his father or grandfather carried on.  That is one of the biggest difficulties of the situation.  In arguing about the price of land, the Minister mentioned that under the Shannon scheme very few cases went to arbitration. That is quite true.  When prices were fixed for the Shannon scheme the price of land was very different from what it is now.</P>

We are both anxious to try to simplify matters.  I feel very strongly on this amendment.  As people are going to lose their holdings, I am not satisfied yet with what the Minister has said.  I would like to have further assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This State adopted the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and since then compensation in all cases where land was required for public purposes was assessed and paid for on the basis of that Act.  `It is on the basis of that Act compensation will be assessed and paid in the cases the House is now discussing.  I think it is a fair basis. The Act was framed in the full knowledge that from time to time the value of land would fluctuate, that factors would operate to depress or to enhance it.  It was felt that a fair basis, at any time, was to assess compensation on the value at that time; and consequently the valuer, when called upon, gave an award in the first instance on the present value of the land, on the basis of a willing sale, and then proceeded to add whatever additional amount of compensation should be given for disturbance or other reasons. That procedure was adopted in the Shannon scheme.  It may be that the actual value of land was higher then than it is now, but I want to emphasise that it was declining.  Deputies contend that it has declined.  I do not think it is declining now.  I think the value of land is fairly stable at the moment.  If the trend of agricultural prices is any guide, the value <Col N="599" /> of land should be increasing now. There was no suggestion in 1925 to go back to 1919 to determine the basis on which compensation was to be paid. The market value then prevailing was the basis of the amount of compensation awarded, an amount which would enable a holder to buy another holding of equal value.  That seems to be a fair basis.  I admit that a difficulty at once arises in the case of farmers, part of whose holdings are acquired.  In the case of land acquired for the Shannon scheme, the greatest difficulty arose in determining and settling the amount of compensation to be paid where a farm was being rendered uneconomic, or where a substantial portion had been taken and the part left was insufficient or was an uneconomic agricultural holding.  In such cases the valuer always made allowance for the fact.  I think it will give some assurance to those who may be apprehensive of possible developments at Poulaphouca that in all such cases in connection with the Shannon scheme it was possible to fix compensation by agreement and without reference to arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Leary's remark, allowance is also made by the valuer for the loss of turbary rights. All these factors can be brought into account and any considerations which the parties interested consider should have attention will have attention, both in the first instance, when the Electricity Supply Board's valuer is trying to secure a settlement by agreement, or, in the second instance, in default of agreement when the amount of compensation is being assessed by the arbitrator.  It is our desire, and I know it is the desire of the Electricity Supply Board, that the 50 or 60 farmers in this area will be dealt with fairly.  It is considered that they are being dealt with fairly when put in the position of acquiring property of equal value to that which they are losing, plus an allowance for the disturbance involved.  The Deputy can be reasonably satisfied that it has been the policy of the Electricity Supply Board in the past, and that it will be their policy in the future, to err if they err at all, on the side of generosity. <Col N="600" /> In any event, it would be unwise, in relation to these particular cases, to depart from the practice which has always operated, of quoting the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as the basis for compensation to be paid where land or premises are required for public purposes.  That, was done in very case up to the present.  It was never seriously contended that it operated unfairly in any general sense. On the contrary, it has operated fairly, and I think we will seek the same basis in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is a lot of sound reason in what the Minister says, I am in this difficulty, that certain circumstances that have transpired here reduced the value of land.  We cannot get away from that fact.  On the other hand, I see that the Minister naturally does not wish to admit that. His difficulty is evident.  He sees my difficulty in giving way to him there. I do not want to see the unfortunate people concerned suffering because of a dispute we may have with people on the other side of the water.  Why should they?  I realise the difficulty the Minister is in, and he realises the difficulty I am in when speaking for people who are not here to speak for themselves.  I cannot agree that the present time is a normal one.  If we were living under normal conditions, and if this dispute had not arisen, the position would be different.  If this unfortunate dispute was settled we would probably get back to normal times rapidly, and this matter would be worked under exactly the same arrangement as existed when the Shannon scheme was passing through. The same conditions do not apply to-day with regard to the value of land as when the Shannon scheme was brought in and compensation awarded. Much as I would like to be satisfied with what has been said, I cannot say that I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to the point already made, that farming in this particular area is somewhat different from what it is in other parts of the country.  The Minister realises, I am sure, that in the case <Col N="601" /> of the Shannon scheme farmers accustomed to working land in that area could easily transfer to another district.  It is not easy, however, for the men we are now considering to engage in another type of farming. Our case is not against the justice of the compensation basis.  Our case is that this land is being taken at a time when, owing to circumstances for which those farmers are not responsible, its value is at a low ebb.  Take two cases. One man who gets compensation for his farm and wants to buy another farm, will probably get the other farm cheaper.  He may be all right, but is allowance going to be made for the cost of the acquisition of the other farm?  He will be put to some expense in connection with the purchase of another farm.  If, on the other hand, a man desires to put whatever he gets for his other farm into some securities, he gets the rockbottom price, with securities at soaring prices.  He has no possible opportunity of investing his money to bring him in anything more than the amount of the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> That is our objection and I think there is some force in it.  If one says that, on a given day, a man must sell certain of his securities, no matter how the market stands, he can buy others and the only expense he has is the amount of the stamp duty.  If one assumes that he goes on the market for the type of farm he wants, one has to remember that his market is limited because it is only rarely that one sees these classes of holdings sold.  There is that disadvantage in acquiring land that will be suitable to him.  If, on the other hand, he is advanced in years and desires to invest his money, then he has to do so at a time when securities are at the highest price that, I suppose, they have ever stood at. These circumstances did not prevail at the time that this particular type of legislation, making this the basis of compensation, was framed, or at the time when land was being acquired for the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>The board of health will receive compensation, but the tenant will not receive any compensation from the board when he is deprived of the right he would be entitled to under the Act for the sale of cottages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that that is a matter for the board of health.  It is not good enough for the Deputy to say that this tenant has a cottage at 1/- per week, and that if the board of health builds a cottage now-a-days of a similar design it will have to be let at a rent of 2/10 per week, because the Board is getting towards the cost of building that new cottage the compensation which will be payable in respect of the old one and, consequently, the rent which the board of health can charge for the new cottage will be less than they ordinarily charge for a cottage of that design.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute therefor the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Liffey works shall, while in the possession and control of the Board, be subject only to 50 per cent. of such rates or assessments as may be leviable on the agricultural land comprised in the said works and shall be exempt from all other assessments for any other rates made by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to lessen what would be a hardship if Section 13 <Col N="609" /> remained as it is.  The income derived from the rates for this area will be lost and increased charges will fall not only on that area but on the county as well.  If my memory serves me, that area has already to bear a heavy burden in connection with the Poulaphouca tramway, which was discontinued. There is also a county charge for this tramway.  Any additional burden, whether imposed on that locality or on the county, will be very heavy, indeed.  This amendment makes a reasonably fair offer which, I think, might be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section, we are merely carrying forward a principle which has been accepted.  The Shannon works, as such, were exempted from local rates and, when the Electricity Supply Board was established, that freedom from rates was transferred to the Board.  Under the amending Act of 1930, exemption from local rates was granted in respect of all the property the Board used exclusively as a generating station or transmission system or part of a transmission system or as a distribution system or part of a distribution system.  The arguments then used in favour of exempting these properties of the Board from local rates apply with equal force to the generating station proposed to be constructed at Poulaphouca.  The system for supply of electricity is a national undertaking.  The Poulaphouca station will be an integral part of the national system and it would be anomalous if that part of the national electricity generating system were to be subject to local rates and the rest of it exempt.  From the point of view of the local authority, I think it can be stated that it is almost certain that the construction of the reservoir and station at Poulaphouca will result in the erection of new rateable property in that area and that, in the long run, the local authority is not likely to lose. There is another consideration&mdash;that there will be no reduction in the agricultural grant to the county.  The amount of relief that can be given to individual occupiers of agricultural land will, therefore, be increased though there will be no increase in <Col N="610" /> the aggregate amount of the agricultural grant.  Taking all these factors into account, and having regard to the fact that the principle has already been accepted and applied in respect of the remaining portion of the property of the Electricity Supply Board, I think that exemption from rates must be provided in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the honour to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil the Government has not given adequate attention to the problem of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward this motion for the approval of the House, I have no desire to strain unduly the case against the Government. I realise the immense difficulties of the question. I realise that those difficulties would have actually been increased and not diminished by the adoption of some of the suggestions that have been pressed upon the Government by certain Northern Nationalists and by certain supporters of their own.  I realise, <Col N="611" /> moreover, that a Government cannot be expected to go far in advance of public opinion, and that if it attempts to do so it can only fail and probably do more harm than good.  I realise that the task of abolishing Partition is by no means a task that can be accomplished by a Government alone. Individuals, organisations all through the country, have to take a part in it if it is to be successfully achieved. Therefore, I am not proposing, as I have said, to strain unduly the case against the Government.  But, on the 1st March, 1933, almost immediately after the last general election, we unanimously agreed in this House to the proposition that a reunion of the Irish nation, founded on goodwill, should be the primary object of Government policy and that every other constitutional issue should be subordinated thereto.  That was nearly four years ago.  Some time in the course of the next year we shall have another general election, and I think it is not unfair or unreasonable to inquire whether the Government have lived up either to the letter or to the spirit of that resolution which they accepted.</P>
    <P>Now, I hope that it is not necessary for me in this House to stress the evil of Partition.  Partition is, in my view, an evil, not only form our point of view, but from the point of view of all concerned, something that does harm to everybody that is affected by it. The President has told us that when he wants guidance on some issue of national importance he finds the best plan is to look into his heart.  I presume that that procedure is open to all the rest of us and, even though he may regard my heart as a some what denationalised and cosmopolitanised organ, I venture to look into it in connection with this matter, and, looking into it, I find this&mdash;that while I can and do forgive spoliation, oppression, religious persecution in the past, I can hardly reflect on Partition without a kind of rage, a rage that I have some difficulty in preventing from mastering my reason and my judgment.  If I did not think that I had so prevented it, naturally.  I <Col N="612" /> should not be taking the liberty of addressing the House, on this problem to-night.  But I think anyone is living in a fool's paradise who imagines that the people of this country will ever reconcile themselves to Partition or that good relations between the Irish Free State and Great Britain will ever be possible on the basis of Partition. And some of these admirers of the President across the water who are talking as if we could all kiss and be friends provided that a Republic for 26 Counties were set up in external association with the British Empire, are simply ignorant of the fundamentals of the situation.  Partition is vital to the whole question of our relations with Great Britain.  Not only is it an evil from our point of view; it is an evil from Great Britain's point of view, because it is obviously of the greatest value and importance to her to secure the friendship of the Free State if she possibly can.  Such friendship would be valuable in peace and perhaps even more valuable in case of war.  And it is not only an evil from the British point of view, but it is an evil from the Northern Ireland point of view, and not from the point of view of Northern Nationalists alone.  The spirit of bigotry and ascendancy is an accursed thing.  It degrades and demoralises not only the people who are the victims of it, but those who are actually exercising the ascendancy. I am not sure that in the long run and in the last analysis the case of those who are exercising the ascendancy is not the more pitiable of the two.  I hope, then, that I need say no more to emphasise the vital importance of this issue to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I may as well put my cards upon the table at once in case anyone should suppose I have some magic formula up my sleeve for resolving this question, and I may say immediately that in my view there is only one way of getting rid of Partition and that is to gain the goodwill of the Northern Unionists.  If that sounds like a truism, all I can say is that it is a truism which is neglected in 99 per cent. of the utterances made upon <Col N="613" /> this subject.  And if it sounds like telling a man the way to catch a bird is to put salt on its tail, I can only say that later on in my speech I hope to develop the point and to show that the gaining of the goodwill of the Northern Unionists is not necessarily an impossibility.</P>
    <P>Before I come to that, I want to deal with certain heresies which seem to me to be blocking the way and confusing the public mind.  One of these heresies is that it is impossible for anybody to do anything effective, that we must just let matters drift, that we must trust to justice being done in the long run automatically.  I find that theory expounded in a book otherwise brilliant and a book that I would like to see every member of this House reading and still more to see every member of the British Parliament reading, and that is Professor George O'Brien's new book called &ldquo;The Four Green Fields,&rdquo; which concerns itself with this very problem.  There is much that is true and wise and eloquent in that book, but I personally think that his conclusions are altogether too pessimistic, and that the notion that we should adopt a fatalistic attitude to this problem is a wrong notion, because if we leave the question alone I have the greatest fear that the general drift will not be towards the abolition of Partition but, on the contrary, away from it.</P>
    <P>The second heresy to which I am referring is that this is not primarily an Irish problem at all, that it is a problem of which the solution lies in the hands of Great Britain, and only of Great Britain, that the British Government could abolish Partition to-morrow if they wanted to and that nobody else can do anything about it.  That I regard as a most mischievous fallacy.  My view is that, supposing the British Government were to-morrow to withdraw British forces from Northern Ireland, to leave the Northern Unionists to depend upon their own resources, the Northern Unionists would defend themselves and defend the territory they occupy with the same embittered <Col N="614" /> resistance we see being exhibited at the present moment in Madrid.  But that is a contingency which it is hardly necessary to consider because no British Government could afford to do anything of the kind.  Any British Government that proposed to do such a thing would, in my view, lose the support of almost everybody in Great Britain.  It is one thing to say that the British created this problem.  They did.  If the British had never sent these people over here hundreds of years ago, the problem of partition would not exist.  It is another thing to think of these people now merely as invaders and intruders, and it is to shut one's eyes to the fundamental facts of human nature to suppose that, with us professing a desire for separation and the Northern Unionists professing devotion to the Crown and the Commonwealth, a British Government could take the course of handing the Northern Unionists over to us against their will.</P>
    <P>I think, however, it is important to consider to what extent, if any, the British people and the British Government could assist us in this matter.  It is sometimes said that a great deal would be accomplished if they would even stop subsidising the North.  The answer to that is, in the first place, that the Northerners would deny that they were being subsidised.  The financial arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland are not simple, and it is not easy to say whether in fact the North is being subsidised or not; but let us suppose that, by British action, the Northern Government was reduced to a state of financial collapse, what would be the consequence?  Is there any reason to suppose that the result of that would be the entry of the North into a united Ireland?  I suggest that quite the contrary would happen, that if for some reason of that nature the Northern Ireland Government were to break down, the result would be that the Northerners would go back, lock, stock and barrel to Westminster and Northern Ireland would simply become a part of England.  I think we should, therefore, put out of our minds that <Col N="615" /> anything useful to us can be expected from the British on these lines.</P>
    <P>It has been urged by Professor O'Brien that the impotence of the British in this matter is so complete that at no time during the whole of the Home Rule controversy were they really in a position to deliver the goods as regards Northern Ireland.  I believe that to be a misconception, and I speak not without some first-hand experience. From 1909 to 1914&mdash;in fact, from 1905 to 1914&mdash;I took a fairly active part in Home Rule propaganda in Great Britain.  I spoke in many debates on the subject, and I spoke on many platforms on the subject, and I was by no means under the impression then, and am by no means under the impression now, that, provided the fear of complete separation could have been got over, there would have been any reluctance on the part of the British electorate as a whole to compel Northern Ireland to accept a Dominion of Ireland, and to play their part in the Dominion of Ireland.  The cause of the difficulties that arose during that period was the House of Lords.  But for the ability of the House of Lords, under the Parliament Act, to hold up the Home Rule Bill for two years and but for, as it seems to me, the quite unwarranted timidity both of the Liberal Government and, to be frank, of the Irish Nationalist Party on the subject of applying any sort of coercion to the Northern Unionists, I believe that no such physical force movement could have been gathered together as was gathered together during those years and as proved so fatal to the interests of the Home Rule Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and with a great deal of truth, that the loyalty of which the Northern Unionists so often boast is a conditional loyalty and that on various occasions they have threatened, if something was done of which they disapproved, to discard that loyalty altogether, but I think that argument is to be received with certain reservations. In point of fact, Catholic Emancipation was passed in spite of such threats, the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland was accomplished in spite of such threats, and <Col N="616" /> Ulster &ldquo;loyalty,&rdquo; if that is the proper word for it, still continued.  I think we may draw the inference from those facts that the Ulstermen are not always prepared for quite such desperate deeds as they profess to be prepared for, and that if the passing of the Home Rule Bill into law could have been accomplished in the ordinary way, and within the ordinary time in which the passing of a measure of capital importance into law used to be accomplished under the British Parliament, the Bill could have been put into force without very much difficulty.  The reason I lay stress upon the proposition that the Northern Irish Unionists cannot be guaranteed always to have matters their own way is this&mdash;that I do think, given the necessary conditions, the British Government and the British people could exercise a great deal of what I might call moral compulsion on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>At present they are treated by most of the British politicians and by the British popular Press as heroes. They are constantly being patted on the back and praised for their loyalty, and we can hardly blame them for being willing to accept these assurances at their face value.  At the very moment when they were compiling what the late Lord Asquith called &ldquo;a grammar of anarchy,&rdquo; when they were threatening every sort of treason and rebellion in connection with the Home Rule Bill, they were being assured by men of light and leading in England, by the most prominent front-rank politicians, that they were noble patriots showing a spirit of devotion and attachment to the Crown and Empire.  Who can be surprised if, under these circumstances, their die-hard attitude was persisted in?  But it is not at all so clear that if the gilt came off the gingerbread and if they ceased to be regarded as heroes in Great Britain, if they began even to be regarded as unreasonable in Great Britain, if they found themselves meeting with a chilly reception in exalted circles&mdash;it is, I say, far from clear that in these circumstances their resistance to any sort of accommodation would be as embittered as it has been in other circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> I suggest then, Sir, that while Great Britain has not got the power to solve this problem for us, it has the power to give us some assistance in the matter if we make that assistance possible by establishing the preliminary conditions necessary for it to take effect.  But, substantially, this question of curing the evil of Partition is our own job and nobody else's job.  If we are to undertake it, the first essential is that we shall be in earnest about it, that we shall really want the reunion of Ireland on a voluntary basis, and not want it in the sense of somebody who has bought a sweep ticket and, having bought that ticket, thinks that his part is done and that he need only sit back and wait for Fortune to smile upon him.  We have got to do something more than merely express a wish to see Partition ended. Our desire has got to be an efficient desire.  He who wills the end must also will the means.  What I want to ask the House to consider is whether we have really faced the facts in that respect, whether we have realised what is involved in the reunion of Ireland, whether we want the reunion of Ireland on that basis, taking with it all that is logically involved in it, and whether we are prepared to do what is necessary in order to work towards that unity.  If we are not, it is idle to say that we are in favour of abolishing Partition; we are simply Partitionists ourselves although we are concealing the fact from ourselves.</P>
    <P>We often complain, Sir, and with justice, that British statesmen have shown a lack of vision in their dealings with this country.  Are we quite sure that that reproach does not apply to us in relation to our dealings with the Northern Unionists?  Does not the reproach of lack of vision mean that the statesman you are reproaching has failed to put himself in the place of those whom he desires to conciliate, has failed to try and see difficulties as they see them, has failed to make allowances for the sentiments that he must know them to possess?  There has been an occasion in history when real progress was made in establishing co-operation between Northern Protestants and the rest of the population <Col N="618" /> of this island, and that was during the period when Wolfe Tone was founding the society of United Irishmen. It is worth considering for a minute just what Tone did.  Tone made friends with, and gained the confidence of, the most enlightened, the most broadminded, the most tolerant men he could find in Northern Ireland.  He engaged them in a fight against a corrupt ascendancy, a fight for the liberties of Parliament and the realities of democracy, and he met with unexampled success in eliminating the prejudices that had hitherto prevented the two stocks that inhabited this island from co-operating with each other and that success was interrupted by what?  It was interrupted by the outbreak of war between France and England.  The first result of that outbreak of war was that those who wished to change the established régime in any way came to be suspected of treason and disloyalty, and in their fear of France and in their eagerness to support their own country in time of war, many men slipped back into acquiesence, at any rate, with the <i>status quo</i>, whereas others, Wolfe Tone among them, slipped forward into open rebellion. Those occurrences broke up, for good and all, the co-operation that had been established.</P>
    <P>If we are to win the Northern Unionists to-day, it will not be by fussing after them, with the futility and lack of dignity that a certain number of British politicians and publicists are fussing after us.  We have really got to win their confidence.  We have got to turn their thoughts away from the worse things that now occupy them towards the better things that might occupy them.  We have got to enlist them, just as Tone did, in a fight against something that is worth fighting.  We have got to enlist them in a fight against poverty, in a fight against class hatred, in a fight against racial hatred, in a fight against war, in a fight against all the evil things that afflict humanity. In other words, Sir, the way to gain the goodwill of the Northern Unionists is, first of all, to gain the goodwill of the best among them, the broadest-minded <Col N="619" /> among them, all those who are most free from race hatred, and those who realise the evil, as many in the North do realise the evil, of the ascendancy spirit, who realise that it is a deplorable state of things that a third of their own population should be despised and hated by the other two-thirds, and constantly in an attitude of revolt against the State.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is at all impossible, if we take the right measures, if we cultivate the right frame of mind, to gain the confidence of the best among the Northern Unionists, and, having gained their confidence, to give them a chance to extend their influence in the North and to win over others, until in the end we have the confidence of the bulk of the Northern Unionists.</P>
    <P>But, Sir, if we are going to embark upon that task, there are certain obstacles that have first to be removed. Now on this matter I ask Deputies to reason things out for themselves.  I ask them to believe that I am not trying to force upon them ready-made notions; that I do not approach this matter as one eager to shove, for example, Imperialism down their throats on the excuse of getting rid of Partition.  I ask them to judge what I am saying on its merits; to try to exercise the vision that I have suggested is necessary if this problem is to be solved; to try and look at things through the eyes of a reasonable Northern Unionist, of a man who does dislike race hatred, but who wishes to be reassured about our outlook and about our intention.  I imagine that if the President was having an interview with such a reasonable Northern Unionist, and if he asked this Northern Unionist why he objected to coming into a union with us, our friend from the North might say: &ldquo;Well now, Mr. President, first of all we Northerners are generally credited with being materialists, so I suppose you will permit me to deal with economic questions at the start.  We are concerned for the future of our shipbuilding industry, and for the future of our linen industry. Just what do you propose with regard to them?  In the event of your <Col N="620" /> separating from the British Commonwealth, have you any market to offer us for either one or the other?  If not, how are you proposing to find employment for the many thousands of people who depend upon those industries? Again, as regards our agriculture, have you any alternative to the British market to offer us in regard to our agriculture?&rdquo; I hope, when the President comes to reply to this Motion, he will indicate what reassurance he is in a position to offer to Northern Unionists about such matters as these.</P>
    <P>There are, no doubt, some other economic difficulties.  We have created certain small industries and certain not so small industries&mdash;here in Southern Ireland, which might perhaps be imperilled by competition from the North if the boundary were to be suddenly removed.  I personally do not believe that any such obstacle as that could be a fatal obstacle.  A way could always be found to do equity as between any industries in our own present area and industries in the Northern area that might conceivably compete with them, but I do think that if we are in earnest about this question of Partition we should bear matters like these in mind; that when we are setting up new enterprises in the Irish Free State we ought to consider whether similar enterprises exist in the North; and we ought on the whole, to prefer setting up industries that would not suffer by competition from the North if Partition were to be abolished.</P>
    <P>Turning from economic matters, about which it is not necessary to say very much because their importance is so obvious, let us think of other substantial obstacles that stand in the way.  The first that immediately suggests itself is republicanism. I cannot help feeling all the sadder about republicanism being an obstacle because I honestly think that republicanism is a sham.  I do not say that with any desire to be offensive; I cannot see how you can make it out to be anything except a sham.  A republic for 32 counties is obviously impossible.  A republic for 26 counties is possible, but the Government have not the smallest <Col N="621" /> intention of declaring it and of facing its economic consequences, and so far as I know practically nobody wants it.  The two people in Ireland, I think, who come nearest to wanting it are Professor Tierney and myself, because we think that the moral effect might be so good as to make up for the immediate economic effects.  The only other sort of possible republic is a 26 counties republic within the Empire if such a thing is conceivable, and so far as I can see, that kind of republic would satisfy no republican feeling in this country.  So far as there is any republican feeling in this country it is based on the idea that the British Empire is immoral, and that we ought not to be tangled up with it in any way, and especially not in its foreign policy or in its wars, and I cannot conceive of any meaning for a republic within the British Empire unless it is a republic that is going to be tangled up in British foreign policy and in British wars. Therefore, as I say, republicanism seems to me to be a sham, and I feel all the sadder that the profession of republicanism&mdash;for it seems to me to be nothing more&mdash;should be there to constitute an obstacle, as it does, to union with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have often said before in this House, and I think it worth repeating again, that the mere presence in office in the Irish Free State of a non-republican Government is not enough; that as long as there is any substantial Party professing republicanism in this country, whether in power or out of power, we cannot make any real headway towards gaining the goodwill of the North.  Therefore, I am not interested in this as a question of turning anybody out of office or anybody else into office.  I am interested in it as a matter of what public opinion in the country is, and our task is to lead public opinion in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The next obstacle is the obstacle of Gaelicisation.  I have always had the greatest reluctance to talk about the Irish language, and for this reason&mdash;that I think no part of the national movement during the last quarter of a century has evoked more unselfish idealism than has the revival <Col N="622" /> of the Irish language, and I have the greatest respect for the men who have made it a labour of love to learn the Irish language, and to seek to revive whatever may be revived of Gaelic culture.  Therefore, although I believe Gaelicisation to be a profound mistake, I speak about it with the same reluctance as I would speak if I were attacking a man's religion, but I am obliged to speak about it in connection with Partition because there is no shutting our eyes to the fact that the Northern Unionists will not have the Irish language rammed down their throats and they will not come into a union with us if compulsory Irish is to be forced upon them or if they are to be barred from every sort of advancement by reason of their lack of the Irish language.  Now, I am in favour of gaining every scrap of culture that we can gain from the Irish language.  I am in favour of gathering everything that can be gathered in the way of Irish folklore. I am in favour of enriching our civilisation on that side of it, but I am not in favour of making the Gaelic side monopolise our civilisation.  I believe that that plan is founded on a complete misconception.  I believe that the man who argues for a Gaelic Ireland is arguing against an Irish Ireland.  I know that the notion of Gaelicising the whole of Ireland would have been detestable&mdash;was detestable&mdash; to Daniel O'Connell; would have been detestable to Wolfe Tone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, by inference. By inference, you find a great deal against it, because a man who was so wrapt up in the revival of the Irish nation as Wolfe Tone was, and who sacrificed so much for that ideal, would hardly have refrained from devoting any <Col N="623" /> energy at all to Gaelicising the country unless he had deliberately rejected the idea of Gaelicising the country.  The whole of his dealings with the Northern Protestants and with the more reasonable members of the Ascendancy are completely inconsistent with the idea of Gaelicising the country. Equally, I believe that that idea would have been abhorrent to Parnell.  In any case, however, even apart from the authority of such men as these, it seems to me to stand out that Gaelicisation and the abolition of Partition are inconsistent ideas.  Can we really not adjust our notions of reviving Irish civilisation, so far as it can be revived&mdash;can we not adjust those notions in such a way as to make them consistent with the campaign for the unity of Ireland?  I think we can, and I am supported in that idea by the testimony of several friends of mine who are among the best Irish scholars in this country, and I speak about this matter with less trepidation than I otherwise should because of my knowledge that my opinions are shared by several of the best Irish scholars in this country who happen to be my friends.  It is quite possible to get whatever is of value out of the Irish language without using the Irish language in such a way as to narrow our whole outlook and impoverish our whole civilisation.  We have made, in my opinion, the English language our native tongue.  It has become for us an instrument of incalculable value for impressing our ideas on the whole world.  I believe in the vitality and the energy of the Irish genius.  I believe in its power of expansion.  I believe in its power of affecting others, and I believe the English language is a most precious instrument for enabling us to do it.  I cannot agree that the epic cycles of Cuchullain and Fionn Machumall can ever be any substitute for the riches of literature that you find, say, in the ancient classics or in the English language or the French language.  I believe that we are asking too much of the Irish language&mdash;more than it is fair to ask of it.  The popular argument of the moment is that we can use it as a protection against the assault of undesirable <Col N="624" /> foreign ideas &mdash; of Communist ideas, for example.  Now, Heaven help us if we have to cower behind the barrier of a language in order to resist the inroad of Communism, or any other &ldquo;ism.&rdquo; Communism took its birth in Germany and it spread into Russia in spite of the Russian language. It spread into China in spite of the Chinese language.  It spread into Mexico and Spain in spite of the Spanish language, and if we did not take other methods to make the soil of this country unfruitful for Communism, it would spread here in spite of the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I regret that I cannot quote any particular speech, but I should be surprised if there are not many Deputies in this House who can recollect seeing speeches reported in the papers where it was urged that an extra argument of great power had been found for making Irish the spoken and the written tongue in this country, and that that was to preserve us against the danger of Communism and other pagan ideas from foreign countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat, Sir, that I have absolutely no hostility to the Gaelic revival.  On the contrary, I have the greatest admiration for those who devoted their labours to it and for those who devoted so much self-sacrificing idealism to it, but I do insist that if we are serious about this question of Partition, we must examine just how far we can afford to go in the matter of Gaelicisation.  I do suggest that, in proceeding upon the lines that many of the enthusiasts wish to proceed, we are not only setting out on a road that must end in the impoverishment of our own education and of our own minds, but that we are also setting up a quite unnecessary barrier to reunion with the North.  What, then, is the <Col N="625" /> fundamental character of this problem of reunion?  I suggest that, fundamentally, it is a racial problem.  It has been suggested that there is no great difference of race between the North and the South, and I have no objection to admitting that, if you took a member of the Northern Ireland Parliament and took a specimen of his blood and analysed it for racial strains, you might find that the result differed very little from an analysis of the blood of a member of this House.</P>
    <P>That is not the point, however.  The racial problem must be considered to exist where one section of the community feels itself to be distinct from the rest, where it has a different historical bias, a different outlook, different loyalties, different traditions, and it is, of course, exacerbated when you have a difference of religion that keeps alive the difference of racial feeling.  I have always held that this problem is not a religious problem, it is a racial problem and we ought to overcome racial feelings of that kind by ceasing to be racial ourselves.  In other words, not to be wedded to a narrow uniformity, but to be willing to harbour the idea of an Ireland rich in diversities; not to be shocked at the notion&mdash;as some people would be shocked at the notion&mdash;that if Partition were to be abolished to-morrow we would have 45 new members of the Dáil from Northern Ireland and 30 of them would be from what has hitherto been known as the Ascendancy Party and would be devoted supporters of the connection with Great Britain.  They would be different from us in their outlook on many subjects; if we were going to have them here in order to trample on them and to insult them we would be far better without them.  There is not the slightest advantage in having a solid and embittered minority in our community.  If we really care about Partition, we should want to have these people here in spite of and even because of their differences from ourselves and we should delight in seeing the State enriched by that difference in racial outlook and character.</P>
    <P>The argument that one puts forward <Col N="626" /> in this matter is extremely similar to what one was used in putting forward years ago to the British about Home Rule.  One used to ask, has not the British Empire got that width that it can harbour any differences?  May not the Irish nation develop on Irish lines?  Is the British Empire so poor and so intolerant a thing that it cannot tolerate that sort of diversity?  And I put forward that sort of argument here and now to the people who are putting barriers in the march of this nation.  I claim that the people who are really putting barriers in the march of this nation are the people who follow policies that are inconsistent with a union with the North; people who cannot bear the idea of taking the Northern Unionists in on equal terms and creating an Ireland one and indivisible that has as much room for their ideas as it has for our ideas.</P>
    <P>I have said, and I do most sincerely believe that if this problem is going to be solved other parts of the community besides the Government must take their share in solving it.  I think it is for the Government to give a lead.  I think that putting the Government's record at its very best it cannot be said that it has given any sort of lead during the past four years in directing and moulding public opinion towards the abolition of Partition. But others must do their share as well as the Government.  I noticed the other day that the President addressed a body of the old I.R.A.  It appears to me that on this matter the old I.R.A. could do a great deal.  I decline to believe that the old I.R.A. are fairly represented by the utterances of their principal spokesmen.  Although I did not support the Sinn Féin movement and do not believe that the Sinn Féin movement was, on balance, of benefit to this country, even so I cannot imagine the old I.R.A. to be as selfish, tyrannical and greedy as would appear from the utterances of some of their principal spokesmen.  The President lately suggested that they should turn their efforts towards the learning of the Irish language and the spreading of the Irish language.  I <Col N="627" /> think that was trying them rather high.  After all, the Irish language is a very difficult language to learn.  I think my suggestion is a better one. It is something they can do more easily and something that would be of greater value&mdash;that is that they should devote themselves to spreading the principles of toleration and goodwill throughout the country, and that they should try not to antagonise Northern Unionists, but to make friends with them and to win their confidence.</P>
    <P>We cannot overcome the barrier of Partition if we allow ourselves to be pessimistic about it.  Realists we must be but faint-hearted, no, and I honestly believe that there is no reason to be faint-hearted.  Greater difficulties than this have been overcome by other nations in the past and these difficulties can be overcome by us.  It is necessary that if we are to overcome them we should have an abundance of faith, hope and charity &mdash;the sort of faith that moves mountains, the sort of hope that never degenerates either into despair or presumption and the sort of charity that is embodied in the least regarded of Christian commandments &mdash;&ldquo;Little children, love one another.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Although many months have passed since the motion was put on the Order Paper, I think that the present is, perhaps, a more opportune time to discuss it than last spring.  The present Session of the Dáil will, in all probability, be called upon to make the most important decisions since the establishment of the Irish Free State in regard to the future of Ireland.  The decision which we may make here later this Session will decide, certainly for our time, and probably for generations, whether the unity of Ireland can be brought about in a reasonable time, or whether Partition may last for all time. It is, therefore, of importance that Deputies and those they represent should consider the position of the Dáil and of the Government of the Irish Free State towards the people and the Government of Northern Ireland.  The Partition of this country <Col N="628" /> began in hostility, and there is great danger of its being continued, after the disappearance of hostility, because of indifference, or more likely negligence.  I wish to draw the attention of the Government to the need for keeping this problem always before them, not merely when they deal specifically with it, but when they deal with any other problem in regard to the Irish Free State.  I think this House and the people it represents are unanimous in one thing, and perhaps in one thing only, and that is the desire to have the Partition of Ireland ended as soon as possible.  I am sure there is no Deputy who would think of offering an opinion to the contrary, or who could even point to one whom he represents who would express a contrary opinion.  I think that is the unanimous opinion of the people and of the Parliament of the Irish Free State.  While it is not easy to speak with confidence, I think there are many people in Northern Ireland who, while they do not express that opinion openly, deep down in their hearts wish to see Partition ended, people who look with hope for such an attitude on the part of the Irish Free State as would induce them to join their fortunes in Ireland as a whole.  It is not easy to speak with confidence as to how far that feeling exists in Northern Ireland, but I believe it is more than is realised.  In reading the report of the proceedings of the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, one was struck by the fact that the two main objects of that Party, as far as one could judge from the outside, were the unity of Ireland and the independence of Ireland.  These are aims in which I think most of us, probably all of us, join, though we may have some slightly different views as to their meaning.  There are obstacles to unity, but there are few, if any, obstacles to independence, though we might not all agree as to what is meant by the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo;; whether it means independence in fact and in reality, or something in name.  In dealing with these two demands, which were put forward by members of his Party, the President pledged himself and his Government to do everything in their power to solve them.  One member of his Party, Mr. MacDevitt, from County <Col N="629" /> Donegal, remarked that it was going to be more difficult to achieve the country's unity than its independence. I suggest that the independence of Ireland can never be achieved without unity being first achieved; and that the nominal independence of a part of this country, prior to the establishment of unity, would render unity impossible for the future.  I wish to press upon the House and on the Government that of the two aims unity is by far the more important.  I do not want to get into a controversy on that.  Many people believe that we have at present independence in all or almost all essentials.  The independence of a fragment of the country is something to be looked upon with horror by good Irishmen, as making permanent Partition inevitable.  The President made many wise remarks during the course of the debate.  He stated that Partition could not be abolished by unilateral action, that the abolition of Partition must be by bilateral action.  I do not think that the President went on to ask who was the second party to bilateral action.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot spoke of the position of Great Britain towards this country.  I should like to confine myself to consideration of the affairs of the people in Ireland because I believe that if this country desired to end Partition and to establish unity, no English statesman, no English politician, and probably no Englishman would raise a voice against the two parts of the country joining as one nation.  In my view, the second party to be considered in this question is Northern Ireland.  I do not think the President or many of his followers would suggest that unity could be brought about at present by force. Therefore, it must be brought about, if at all, by consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of one fact which is very often overlooked, and that is that the Irish Free State is Ireland, that Ireland is the Irish Free State, that it does not consist of 26 counties but of 32 counties. Nothing in our legislation has altered the clause which forms part of our Constitution and of the Treaty with the United Kingdom, that Ireland shall be known as the Irish Free <Col N="630" /> State.  It is true that later legislation limited the powers of the Government of the Irish Free State to certain areas, and that the powers of this Parliament are not at present exercisable in certain excluded areas, but that exclusion does not take away from the fact that Ireland is the Irish Free State, and is so identified as a geographical area.  While the powers of this Parliament are not exercisable in the other area, that is a conditional and provisional arrangement, and should not be looked upon, as it is often looked upon in legislation passed in this House, in debate, in conversation and in the Press, as if it established two countries.  If the Boundary Commission had reported, the boundary to be established would not have been between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, but &ldquo;between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have no power in the excluded area, but when the Government and the President speak for Ireland they should consider the opinions of the inhabitants of that other area as a guide for their policy, as far as they can, and, to the same extent as they consider the opinions of the minority of the people under this Government. When the leader of a Party becomes head of a Government he is responsible to speak for all sections, and is no longer merely the leader of a Party.  I believe the President has frequently recognised that he is responsible, not merely to those whose votes put him into the position he occupies, but to all the citizens.  I have no doubt the President does consider the wishes of the minority in any national policy, but I suggest to him that he and the members of his Government have a responsibility not only to his own supporters in the South, as well as to those who did not join in sending them into their present positions, but that they have a responsibility also to those who by this unfortunate provision of the Constitution are not at present authorised to take any part in returning members to this Parliament.  They have, and the President particularly, a moral responsibility in any national policy to consider those not represented here as <Col N="631" /> part of the entire population of Ireland.  Deputy MacDermot spoke of the President consulting his own heart. One can always consult one's own heart as to what a national policy would be.  The only hope for the abolition of Partition is consent and if there is consent there must be conciliation, there must be persuasion, there must even be compromise.  We should not be shy of that word &ldquo;compromise.&rdquo; None of us can expect to get everything in this world even in matters of principle, and no business could be carried on for a week without compromise.  Speaking many years ago, the President said that if a man drove a cow to the fair he did not expect to get the full price he would ask.  I suggest that he should keep that in mind when dealing with this question, and, though he cannot be expected to go the whole way with minorities, he should at any rate be ready to meet them part of the way, and follow the good advice he gave the country 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>When we consider the Government of this State, and the conduct of this State since its establishment about 15 years ago, we may ask ourselves what has the State done to attract Northern Ireland to join with us, and ask ourselves, on the other hand, what has the State done to deter Northern Ireland from joining with us.  In one great respect the State has made a great achievement, which should, and I am sure does, attract the people of Northern Ireland.  The Government and people of the Irish Free State, quite regardless of party, have shown their capacity to give every citizen fair play and equality in the eyes of the State.  The leaders of the minority churches have recognised that frankly and repeatedly.  They have recognised not only the fairness of the successive Governments here, but their generosity particularly in the matter of education. This was not I believe a mere matter of set policy with either the present Government or its predecessors. I think it was something far better: It was the natural expression of the attitude of the people of the country towards minorities; it was the natural expression of tolerance which <Col N="632" /> is characteristic of the people of Ireland.  The atmosphere created and the attitude maintained during those years have allayed many apprehensions which I believe were honestly felt by members of the minority in the South of Ireland, and while not sharing those apprehensions myself, I believe that they were honestly felt.  I believe, too, that they have diminished and are diminishing the apprehensions felt in Northern Ireland.  That is, I say, a very great achievement by this State, and one that it has every right to be proud of.</P>
    <P>In other matters the State has not been so fortunate in its attitude towards Northern Ireland.  Deputy MacDermot has dwelt at some length on these matters, and, therefore, I do not intend to take up the time of the House in emphasising the matters already referred to by him.  After what he has said it is not necessary that I should say much by way of drawing attention to them because the facts are clear and the argument is obvious. It is quite clear that the attitude of Northern Ireland in the main, and until recently almost unanimously, was different from the attitude of many in the South as regards the future relations of Ireland to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  When I say until recently in Northern Ireland, I am thinking of the fact that while the former minority in Northern Ireland was always Nationalist in outlook it was not definitely, at any rate until recently, declaredly Republican.  It has taken that tendency lately, and personally I deplore it.  There is no need to emphasise it.  We know that Northern Ireland looks, for reasons to which Deputy MacDermot has referred, to the Commonwealth as the political system in which it wishes to play its part.  Kin, sentiment, various loyalties, and commercial interests play their part in that.  I do not suggest that anybody in Northern Ireland has smaller views of the political independence of the country than anybody in the South, for, however they may differ in opinions, most people of Northern Ireland are sturdy in maintaining their personal independence. Because of their outlook towards the Commonwealth, however, they are <Col N="633" /> deterred by an attitude with which they do not sympathise, in that the outlook of our Government seems to them to be one of a life outside that Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Again, our economic policy here, expressed in the so-called self-sufficiency, is one which is not likely to attract the hard-headed business men of Northern Ireland, and most of the people there are hard-headed, whether business men or farmers.  Self-sufficiency is not likely to attract them. Through it they see the loss of their over-seas market for their manufactures as well as for the sale of their agricultural produce.  Other changes have been made here in recent times which I think also roused apprehensions in Northern Ireland.  To anyone there who contemplated a union with the South, the abolition of the Second Chamber here, I think, caused a revulsion in Northern Ireland.  They felt, wrongly probably&mdash;many here at any rate will say wrongly, and I do not wish to quarrel with them&mdash;that it suggested an approach to something like a dictatorship.  I am not suggesting that in reality that is so, but that is the idea it created in their minds, and where you wish to attract people you have to consider not only the facts but what they may think to be the facts.</P>
    <P>It would be a fair retort for members of the Government to make to Deputy MacDermot and myself, and to others who speak on this motion, to ask what steps we suggest they should take to put an end to Partition. Like Deputy MacDermot, I have no advice to offer the Government as to taking any precise steps, but what I do plead with them is to maintain an attitude which will be attractive rather than repellent to Northern Ireland: to consider the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland as having an effect in guiding their policy in a particular direction rather than in driving them in the opposite direction. I do not believe that unity can come at once.  Neither the times nor the tempers of the people are ripe for it, but I think what is of all importance to the future of the country, North and South, is that the road to unity should not be blocked or closed.  It <Col N="634" /> can only be kept open by maintaining an atmosphere which will be attractive and friendly to Northern Ireland and by bearing that in mind on every matter on which the Government has to decide.</P>
    <P>I would say to the President in conclusion that even when he does not agree with certain views put to him that these views are entitled to respect and that even prejudices, however gross these prejudices may appear to be, are entitled to consideration.  I do not suggest that he should subordinate what he believed to be the policy of the majority of the country, North or South, to what he believed to be the opinion of the minority, but I do suggest that in framing a policy for the country he should give due weight to the views and even the prejudices of those in the North.  The Government have it in their power to make it possible for unity to be restored.  They also have it in their power to destroy all hope of unity in our time or probably for generations.</P>

      <P>Before the President replies to this debate I want to say one or two things in connection with the motion on the paper moved by Deputy MacDermot.  Candidly, I am disappointed with the speech of the mover of the motion, because if we take the phraseology of the motion itself, it seems to me that the mover, Deputy MacDermot, more or less strayed off the path into the history of Partition, though he did eventually, near the end, come to one or two suggestions as to how it might be undone. The motion reads: &ldquo;That in the opinion of the Dáil the Government has not given adequate attention to the problem of Partition.&rdquo;  I do not think Deputy MacDermot devoted as much of his speech as he might have to that particular matter.  I want to say, too, that he took some rather peculiar episodes in the history of Northern Ireland in order to try and vindicate some of the arguments that he adduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to follow Deputy MacDermot, I am afraid I would have to cut very severely across some of his arguments.  He went back to the days of Wolfe Tone and then talked about <Col N="635" /> O'Connell and about Parnell.  He talked about these people as if the men of these days were linked up with this big problem of Partition.  Before I go any further I should like to say that there is no Deputy in this House, indeed there is nobody in Ireland I should say, who recognises or appreciates more than I do the importance of this big matter of Partition and its remedy.  There is nobody who would be more sorry to do or say anything that would make the final solution of this problem, which is really the crux of Irish politics, any more difficult or in any way harder.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot talked about his interest in the Home Rule movement and he waved aside the argument which many people have been using, that this was a British-manufactured problem.  He said it was not.  He said that we alone have the solution of Partition in our hands.  I deny that.  I believe that this is a British manufactured problem.  I believe that the opposition to the unity of this country is inspired by and comes from one place, and one place alone, and that is the headquarters of the British Government.  If Deputy MacDermot had been in this country in 1914, when the big crisis was on with regard to Home Rule and the talk of Partition was most intense&mdash;this may perhaps convert Deputy MacDermot from the idea that we alone can solve this problem&mdash;he could have read in the Press at that time a letter from Mr. Lloyd George to the late Lord Carson. I distinctly remember that letter and so does anybody who was interested in Irish politics at the time.  The letter stated: &ldquo;We must see to it that, whether Ulster wills it or not, Ulster must never be allowed to merge with the rest of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reading the motion itself, I never thought that the Deputy in moving it would have taken this line of argument.  I may not be able to lay my hands on that letter but I will try, and I will submit it to Deputy MacDermot for his satisfaction.  That <Col N="636" /> letter was written and sent by Mr. Lloyd George to the late Lord Carson, and I remember it very distinctly because of the postscript attached to it: &ldquo;Show this letter to Craig.&rdquo; That was the British contribution to the unity of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot tells us to-night that we alone can and must solve this problem.  I am afraid not.  In 1912, when Partition was first mooted, it was only to be applicable to four counties. In 1914, just before the outbreak of the big war&mdash;Deputy MacDermot did not refer to it or to the Buckingham Palace Conference&mdash;it was increased from four to six counties.  Because of the Party to which Deputy MacDermot then belonged, I assume he will have a vivid recollection of the fatal conference in St. Mary's Hall, Belfast, in 1916, when at a rigged convention a majority was got in order that it might appear to the world that the majority of the people in Northern Ireland acquiesced in the crime of Partition. Then we come to 1921.  We all know that the Treaty itself had something to do with the present position.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to say anything by way of recrimination, but I do say that, just as there is no question in Ireland to-day about which there is so much unanimity of opinion, there is no question, or hardly ever has been a question in Irish politics, about which there has been so much bungling and so much mismanagement as the question of the partition of our country. Then we come from 1921 to more recent times.  We had in 1925&mdash;this is not recrimination&mdash;the Ultimate Financial Settlement and six of our counties handed over, in so far as it was possible that they might be handed over, to the British for all time.  To come to more recent days even, we have had speeches delivered in the English House of Commons&mdash;and Deputy MacDermot avoided referring to this&mdash;in connection with the economic war, saying that the big political question of Partition must be considered before there could be any settlement even of this matter of economics at all.  Then Deputy MacDermot tells the House that we alone are capable of a solution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> I have often wondered how it is that the proposition is always put up to the people who have thought on national lines, who still think on national lines, who still believe that this country is worth something, that there must be a compromise, and a compromise always coming from them. I do not think that there ever was a people who went further in the line of fair play and tolerance than the native Irish.  I am speaking now with the utmost conviction, and I say that at no period, as far as I know, was anybody persecuted on account of race or religion by them.  I never knew of that and I hope that will always be the case.  I hope things will always go on in that way, because I, for one, would hate that that should ever occur in this country.  Nevertheless, it is always that section of the community, the old Gaelic section, if you like, the native Irish section, if you like, who are asked to go with hat in hand to make offers of compromise.  In order to satisfy what?  Judging from the speeches that you hear delivered in this House, one would think that there was nothing in the Six Counties area but one homogeneous unit, called Unionism.  That is not the case at all. Eliminate the City of Belfast out of <Col N="638" /> the reckoning, and the entire hinterland of that city is fifty-fifty as regards population.</P>
    <P>When you come down to more detail, I wonder does Deputy MacDermot, when talking about compromise and the rest, recognise that in the City of Belfast itself there are as many, and half as many again, people of nationalist opinion as the whole population of the City of Cork in the portion of that city which is called West Belfast?  The people there have a national outlook; they have national aspirations and always had.  Then we are told that the people of Southern Ireland must come along in a spirit of compromise, that they must forget all the old historic landmarks, that they must forget national fights in the past, that they must sacrifice everything, and go hat in hand to people who boast openly in their Parliament that it is a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people, and put a hallmark of sectarianism on what should be a fair and just Legislature.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Thursday, November 19th, at 3 p.m.</P>

      <P>The information at my disposal as to the rates of wages and hours of work in various centres in the country is not sufficiently definite to enable me to provide a specific reply to this question.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the rates of wages and, prior to the coming into operation of the Conditions of Employment Act, hours of work of building labourers and general unskilled town labourers varied considerably even in the same town.</P>
