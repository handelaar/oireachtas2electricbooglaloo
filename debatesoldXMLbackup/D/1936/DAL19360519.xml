      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) on what conditions contractors for medicines and drugs are placed on the prescribed list for supplies to local authorities; (2) whether any preference is given (a) to Irish-owned firms as against non-Irish owned firms and (b) firms manufacturing in the Saorstát as against firms importing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Official contractors whose prices are lowest are appointed for the supply of medicines and drugs to local authorities, provided the quality of their goods is up to the required standard, and provided I am satisfied that they are competent to fulfil satisfactorily the requirements of the local authorities as regards promptness of delivery and general service.</P>
      <P>Careful consideration is given to the matters referred to in the second part of the question when the list of official contractors is being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the contractor who got on to the list employs only approximately 30 people, while another manufacturing firm in the city employs 100 people? Can the Minister say that a trade union rate of wage is paid by the firm which obtained the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Deputy asked these questions when <Col N="602" /> the board of assistance, over which he presides, last year refused to accept the official contractor, and took instead this firm to which he now refers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to confirm that statement by letter to me, if he so desires.  This year, quite the contrary happened, and the firm I refer to was given the contract by the board of assistance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state why Miss Bridget Corcoran, Belderrigbeg, Ballina, County Mayo (membership number 210861), who is incapacitated from work by illness, is not being paid disablement benefit by the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the society that Miss Bridget Corcoran was paid benefit for the period 27th October, 1934, to the 20th April, 1935, amounting to £15 12s., but was suspended from the latter date as, in the opinion of the society, she had made false representation as to her alleged <Col N="603" /> insurable employment, and had been irregularly admitted to membership of the society.</P>
      <P>The society has reported the circumstances of the case to the Gárda Síochána with a view to initiating proceedings under Section 69 (1) of the National Insurance Act, 1911.  The local State solicitor has informed the society that the matter is at present before the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>On 5th December last instructions were issued by the Commissioner to the effect that members of the force who are serving in the all-Irish divisions should henceforth speak Irish only in the courts. The use of English, which is mentioned in the last part of the question, took place before the issue of the instructions referred to above. I should add that, according to the information furnished to me, Irish is the vernacular of the officer to whom the question relates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) (for Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information reached the local office of my Department <Col N="604" /> which necessitated the investigation of Mr. Patrick White's application for unemployment assistance.  When the necessarily protracted inquiries which followed were completed, it was found that the applicant had been representing himself as unemployed and drawing unemployment assistance whilst he was in employment, and therefore not entitled to payment.  It then became necessary to disallow the payment wrongfully obtained by the applicant, and to deduct the amount from any assistance to which he subsequently became entitled.  The necessary adjustment has now been made, and Mr. White will at an early date receive payment of any assistance to which he has become entitled, less the amount already wrongfully received by him.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the weekly rate of unemployment assistance to which the applicant is entitled, provided he satisfies the statutory conditions for the receipt of assistance, and is free from statutory disqualification, is 7/- per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to furnish precise particulars as to the revenue derived from the Customs duties on cotton textiles in the financial year ended 31st March, 1936, as the expression &ldquo;cotton textiles&rdquo; covers a very wide range including yarns, thread, piece goods, made-up goods and articles of personal clothing and wearing apparel, and the Customs regulations do not, except in a few cases, require the yarns of which made-up goods and apparel are composed to be specified on Customs entries.  The total revenue derived from cotton textiles during the last financial year, so far as can be ascertained, was £45,704.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say what is the approximate distance these men would require to travel to and from their work?  That is an important consideration in view of the statement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The distance would vary very considerably.  It is within my knowledge that a very considerable number of those who did not attend for work live in a townland the whole of which by road is less than three miles away.  There were cases where schemes of this kind were carried through and certain townlands were specified in which the area of recruiting may be four or five miles to the townland where the work was carried out; very often there were cases where men in some parts of those townlands <Col N="608" /> might be six miles distant from the work.  Our experience has been that it is difficult and unfair to limit too strictly the area of recruitment because we always have experience of men who desire to go to work from distances considerably longer than we specify at the employment exchanges.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance told the House that Deputy Mulcahy criticised the Budget and that his personal appearance, antecedents and habits were such and such; that Deputy Dillon criticised the Budget and that his personal habits, antecedents and appearance were such and such.  We were going on to hear of Deputy O'Higgins' personal appearance and habits, but we stopped at his antecedents.  Why we should stop there, having entered on the discussion at all, we were not told by the Minister for Finance.  Why we should not hear from him something about the Budget and something about the condition of the people upon whom this Budget burden must rest, is more than I can understand.  The Minister for Finance before his Budget speech last year sat down amongst the Irish Wholesale Clothier and Cap Manufacturers' Association and explained to them that the economic policy of Fianna Fáil had now been put into operation, and could not be changed for generations, and that in the following year they would revert to a normal Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister having assisted his Party to put their new economic policy into operation, having announced 12 months ago that that had been done and that nothing could be changed for a generation, having promised that we would get to the period of normal Budgets again in 12 months after last year and having told us in the House that the normal Budget he was talking about would be the Budget for this year, what the House is now asked to do, after four years of Fianna Fáil budgeting, Fianna Fáil administration and Fianna Fáil building up of the resources of the country, is to discuss, for the first time in the history of the Fianna Fáil Government, a normal Budget.  The normal Budget the Minister puts before us anticipates getting in, through tax and non-tax <Col N="612" /> revenue, by the end of the current financial year, £30,199,500.  The first Budget that the Minister for Finance put before us in the spring of 1932 was characterised as an emergency Budget and that emergency Budget planned to make up for the ravages that the Free State Government had brought about over a period of ten years.  It made provision for an expenditure of £2,000,000 for the relief of unemployment and, in order to do that, it set out not only to squeeze income-tax payers, but to raid the Hospital Fund, and the first raid on the fund was carried out under the heading of an emergency Budget.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the emergency Budget that was put before the House in the early part of 1932 contained provisions of such a nature that it took out of the people's pockets £4,695,081 more than had been taken out of their pockets in the year before.  How much of this is the first Fianna Fáil normal Budget going to leave in the people's pockets?  Not a halfpenny of it.  Not only is the first normal Budget of Fianna Fáil expected to bring into the Treasury the £4,695,081 which their emergency Budget, their first Budget, brought into their Treasury, but it is going to bring £200,565 more.  What we are discussing is the fact that Fianna Fáil's first normal Budget is going to extract from the people's pockets more than £200,000 beyond what their emergency Budget took in the year 1932-33.  That Budget took more than £4,500,000 out of the people's pockets beyond what was taken the year before.  That is what we have got after four years.</P>
    <P>From the financial side it is interesting to see what has been happening during the four years.  It is necessary to have a look at what has been happening during those four years to the people who have had to bear the increasing cost of government as well as the increasing cost of carrying on their business, rearing and educating their families and providing for the future. This extraordinary first normal Budget seeks to get more out of the people than the emergency Budget of 1932. It is placed before the people after a period of four years during which the Government have had to spend, from <Col N="613" /> moneys that reached them as tax and non-tax revenue, an average of £5,333,000 every year more than the previous Government did on the average for the four years that preceded the coming into office of Fianna Fáil. That is not all.  There was another sum of £2,000,000 which, previous to the coming into office of the Fianna Fáil Government, was raised from the people and spent in the payment of external debt.  As well as the £5,333,000, the Minister for Finance has had that additional £2,000,000 to spend.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is rather nebulous about the amount of money that has been raised by borrowing, we nevertheless have the position that in large block letters over the page of the Government organ in May, 1934, the people were told that the Minister for Finance had reduced the national debt between 1932 and 1934 by £5,460,000. The Minister told the House the other night that the total increase in debt as against 1932 was £5,837,000.  That would mean that during the last two years the cumulative effect of Fianna Fáil policy was that the Government had put on the backs of the people an increased debt of £11,250,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister very indignantly challenged the statement made from this side of the House in the earlier stages of the discussion that that was so.  I asked him to tell us, if he challenged that figure, what figure he did put as increased national debt on the people within the last two years.  Surely the Minister for Finance should know where he stands, and he who speaks so much of the delicate things that injure the credit of this country should at least, in an endeavour to save the country's credit, be able to state simply and explicitly the amount by which the national debt has increased every year.  His own Government organ, in some of the biggest letters they could find in their printing boxes, told the people two years ago that the Fianna Fáil Government had reduced their debt by £5,000,000 odd, and they were told quite as explicitly this year the amount by which the general national debt had been increased since 1932.  The net effect, in the simplest possible way, of the Minister's statement <Col N="614" /> is that he has increased the national debt by £11,250,000 within the last two years.</P>
    <P>We have to take that into consideration when we are reviewing the position generally.  We have to take into consideration the position in which local bodies find themselves.  While the Government have collected into their revenue all this money and are spending it, the county councils alone, not to speak of what the position is with regard to urban authorities for whom we cannot get the particulars so very well, had to impose upon the ratepayers who supported the county council administration nearly £500,000 last year more than they had to bear before Fianna Fáil came into office. So that down on top of the additional taxation for central purposes the farmer ratepayers of the country had put upon them in March, 1936, £470,000 more than they had to pay at the end of 1931.  At the end of March last, on the eve of this normal Budget, which differed from the emergency Budget only by reason of the fact that it is going to cost the people £200,000 more, the farmers of the country, who are going to bear a certain portion at least of this tremendous Budget burden, find themselves owing a very unaccustomed amount of a very unaccustomed kind.</P>
    <P>The farmers on the 31st March this year owed the county councils £976,000. It was the third year in which the farmers found themselves owing the local bodies, whose maintenance they were responsible for, the unaccustomed amount of practically £1,000,000.  The farmers of the country found themselves owing the Land Commission, again, the unaccustomed amount of £1,299,501.  The Minister has been explaining, and his colleagues have been explaining, both in the matter of rates and land annuities, that the position is very much improved in the country.  The position is that it is found that at the end of the year these moneys are owing by the farmers for no other reason than that they are not able to pay them to the Land Commission or to the local bodies, and they found themselves owing the Land Commission on the 31st March, 1936, practically £1,000,000 more than before, in <Col N="615" /> spite of the position of advantage in the matter of the land annuities payment to the Land Commission.  The farmers are able to struggle along, making an attempt to pay this, but leaving hanging over them that other addition, small compared to what happened in the last couple of years.  But the farmers are not reducing the enormous outstanding debts hanging over their heads to the Land Commission and to the local bodies.</P>
    <P>So that we face our normal Budget with the unaccustomed debt of more than £2,000,000 owed by the farmers to the local bodies and the Land Commission. It is stabilised, if it is not actually increasing, at something over £2,000,000.  We have them paying £500,000 more rates than before, and we have the enormous amount of money being looked for now which is £200,000 more than the Minister looked for when he came into office in 1932 and presented the House with a bill which proved to be £4,000,000 more than any Government ever got before.  It was more than the previous year's Budget, and it was higher than ever before except in 1923. There is an interesting thing, too, when we compare the normal Budget with the emergency Budget.  The emergency Budget of 1932 naturally shocked everybody, but so many things have happened since that the country is a bit numb, and we do not hear as much criticism of the present Budget as of the first of the Minister's Budgets, although it is a worse one.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence had to go to Navan in September, 1932, to explain to his followers what was being done.  He pointed out, as reported in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> of 3rd September, 1932, &ldquo;that every action of the Government since they took office showed that they were alive to the low standard of living imposed on the farmers and workers, and that when they had to raise taxes they imposed them on the people best able to bear them, such as people paying supertax and income-tax.&rdquo;  But the emergency Budget of 1932 fell upon the backs of the poor and not upon the backs of the rich.  As already pointed out, after a year or two the Finance Minister and <Col N="616" /> his followers were told that these enormous burdens would slip inevitably on to the backs of the ordinary people in the country and would weigh particularly heavy on the backs of the poorer people of the country.  When we were discussing this matter here last year, so strong became the position as to the necessity of having to face facts, that we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance getting up in the House and, forgetting all the things that had been said in respect of the Budget, saying: &ldquo;Why should not the working men pay?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have this year a normal Budget, but when we look at this normal Budget and compare it with the first Fianna Fáil emergency Budget we find this difference only, that, instead of giving us the policy under which the rich are to pay, all these burdens are now falling upon the backs of the poor.  The Minister and his colleagues have so bedevilled the situation politically and economically that they think they will be able to continue to fool the poor man.  It remains to be seen what case the promoters of Fianna Fáil and the Minister and his followers are going to make in the country for this Budget and the burden that the Budget imposes upon the community.  At any rate, what we are concerned with at the moment is this: Realising that this normal Budget is £2,000,000 more than the burden that was placed upon the people by the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1932, and that they have been driven thus hard, it becomes clear that the burden is so much out of proportion that the people cannot possibly bear it and that some of the taxation will have to come out of other sources.  We have, of course, hidden taxation on the poor in respect of bread, bacon and a number of other articles like that.</P>
    <P>Having looked at what the normal Budget is, then we are concerned with discussing to some extent the people who will have to pay these.  They are the people who derive their income from agriculture, on the one hand, and from ordinary industrial or commercial occupations on the other.  We are told from time to time that one of the things Fianna Fáil is doing is providing for a bigger population.  The estimated <Col N="617" /> figures published by the Registrar-General's office indicate that since June, 1932, the population has increased by 65,000 or 70,000 people.  In a country where the population has increased by 65,000 or 70,000, and where a vigorous attempt, by means of subsidies and assistance of all kinds, has been made by the Government to develop tillage, on the ground that tillage would give employment to a greater number of agricultural workers, we look at the position this year to see to what extent the people are finding employment in greater numbers in the agricultural industry. We find that last year there had been a big increase in subsidy crops; 142,600 acres more of wheat had been grown than in 1931, and 52,276 acres more of beet than in 1931, with very huge subsidies both directly and now shifted indirectly on to the consumers of flour, bread and sugar.  We look to see to what extent employment has improved in the agricultural industry and we find that, in spite of all these subsidies and increased acreage of crops, there were 617 less permanent agricultural labourers employed in June, 1935, than in June, 1931.  That is, that men who look to find employment permanently in agriculture could not find employment there and that subsidised tillage, no doubt with the other circumstances that surrounded it, provided employment for 617 less permanent people.  That meant that 617 less men could look to raise families with labour in agriculture as the basis for keeping up their families. There was an increase in temporary agricultural labour to the extent of 2,496.  But the Minister can take it that 2,400 temporary labourers practically cancels out more than 600 of a reduction in permanent labourers and that four years of Fianna Fáil subsidised tillage has left permanent agricultural employment in a worse position than it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce for that.  The Minister for Local Government calls a man who <Col N="618" /> gets employment for nine months in the year a permanent agricultural worker.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce accepts that definition.  But if the Minister for Local Government, who gives special relief out of rates towards the employment of permanent men in agriculture, calls a man who gets nine months' employment in agriculture a permanent labourer, I should like to hear Deputy Moore hazard some guess as to what a temporary labourer is.  If a temporary labourer is a man who works three months in the year, then there was no increase in paid employment in agriculture in 1935, after four years of Fianna Fáil's great revolutionary policy.</P>
      <P>What is the position with regard to wages?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that agricultural wages are down by 3/- per week.  The Minister will not tell us the number of agricultural labourers upon which he bases that estimate, because the figures which the Minister quotes as the absolute wages for agricultural labourers, and to which he refers the reduction of 3/-, are very different from the figures quoted by various bodies and public men throughout the country as indicating the level to which agricultural wages have fallen. But, if we take the Minister's figure of 3/- a week fall in wages, then the agricultural labourers wages' pool has fallen by more than £800,000 on his figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you go outside the Minister's figures you have to go to the figures of the Labour Party, on the one hand, which show a very much bigger decline in agricultural wages than the Minister for Industry and Commerce gives; or you have to go, as pointed out before, to people like the rent collectors who reported to the Minister for Local Government's Commissioner in Tipperary, or to the County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford which would be regarded as the premier tillage county, and must be the county which has the greatest income from subsidies to tillage crops. There is not a Deputy who does not know that that body met month after month in the beginning of last year, <Col N="619" /> and that at one of their monthly meetings they besought the Government to extend the free beef scheme to agricultural workers in Wexford, because the married agricultural labourers in Wexford were, they said, only getting 8/- per week.  That was not a political body.  It was the County Committee of Agriculture set up by a Fianna Fáil county council and composed of representative men and women engaged in agriculture in the premier tillage county.  At their meeting in the second month, when they saw no hope of the free beef scheme being extended to labourers in County Wexford, they demanded that a Government subsidy should be given to these labourers, and they advocated that the amount of that subsidy should be 6/- per week in order to raise their wages to 14/-.</P>
    <P>Deputies are also aware that the rent collectors in Tipperary, where the local body was superseded by a Commissioner by order of the Minister for Local Government, reported to the Commissioner that they were unable to collect the cottage rents.  They reported that there were various classes of people in the cottages who could not pay.  Some were agricultural labourers who were only paid 8/- per week, and could not pay rent out of that.  Some were agricultural labourers who lost their employment and were living on home assistance or unemployment assistance, and for that reason could not pay their rent.  If we only accept the Minister's figure of 3/- for argument, we see that even with that there is a reduction of permanent agricultural labour.  For the temporary man and the permanent man there is a loss, on the Minister's figure alone, of more than £800,000 out of the wages pool.  Those people who go closer down to the homes of the agricultural labourers in the country, like the rent collectors and like the members of the various county agricultural committees, find that the individual situation is very much worse.  I will leave it to Deputies on the far side to estimate what they think the real fall in agricultural labourers' wages is. On the eve of the Fianna Fáil normal Budget we find the permanent agricultural labour rates in the country and <Col N="620" /> the wages pool very substantially reduced, and those who are in closer touch with the homes of the people find a very much worse situation.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the main industry of the country, our live stock and live-stock products, how does agriculture stand on the eve of the first Fianna Fáil normal Budget?  Again we have the figures given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They are published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of March, 1936.  He gives us there figures showing the prices obtained at fairs for various classes of cattle by various farmers who had cattle to sell at fairs.  We are accustomed to comparing the position between 1931 and 1935.  We can compare them most easily and most effectively by simply saying that on their exports, that is as between the Irish farmers and their external market, they lost on live stock and live-stock produce £14,000,000 in 1935 that they earned in 1931.  The external market for the Irish farmer was two-thirds of what his internal market was.  The external price governed his internal price, so that the Irish farmer, by levelling down of prices here to what he was able to get in his external market, lost substantially more in 1935 than he did in 1931, because he lost a very substantial amount of money on the prices that he could get in his internal market as well.</P>
    <P>How does the Irish farmer stand in respect of the year 1936-7, when his country is faced with a normal Budget which is going to take more out of his pocket and out of the pockets of the townspeople than did the emergency Budget of 1932-3?  How does he stand as a subject for bearing the burden of that Budget?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us.  In 1932 when the farmer was called upon to pay £4,600,000 more to upkeep the Government, he got £12 13s. 9d. for his two to three years old store cattle.  He is not facing a normal Budget as distinct from an emergency one.  He is going to pay more out of his pocket than he did for the emergency one, and during the year in which he was preparing to face that Budget instead of getting £12 13s. 9d. for his two to <Col N="621" /> three years old store cattle he got £6 17s. 9d., and instead of getting £14 5s. for his three-years-old store cattle he got £7 18s. 3d.  The normal Budget, therefore, in so far as it is being fitted as a burden to the back of the farmer, is being fitted as a burden to a back that is in that position.  In regard to fat cattle, he got £6 less for his fat cattle in 1935 than he got when he started out to bear the Minister's emergency Budget.  In 1932 the farmers got 121/- per cwt. for their creamery butter.  That is down by 14/- now, when the same farmer is facing the normal Budget which is going to cost him more.  He got 4.6d. for his milk in 1932; he got 4.3d. last year.  He got 8/9 for his eggs; he is now getting only 8/5.</P>
    <P>He is facing a normal Budget as against an emergency Budget, and the only thing in regard to which he is at par is his chickens.  I should like the Minister for Finance or any of his colleagues to go and talk to a farmer's wife and say: &ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce was telling me that you are getting as much for your chickens now as you got in 1932.&rdquo;  I do not think there is a man on the far side who has the nerve to go and talk to a farmer's wife and tell her a thing like that at the moment.  That is the position in regard to the farmer.  I think sufficient has been said to indicate that the farmer and the farm labourer are to-day poor subjects for the bearing of any kind of burden in the way of taxation.  Before we leave the farmers, let us see what the President thought of their position in February, 1932.  As reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 18th February, the President said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The overhead charges of the farmers are too heavy for them, and must be lightened.  One of the heaviest of those charges is the burden of local rates.  We propose to derate agricultural holdings.  They were derated in Britain and in the Six Counties.  Two of the £3,000,000 unjustly taken from us every year in the land annuities will suffice for this derating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at Ballyfad, Gorey&mdash;one hears <Col N="622" /> of things happening at Ballyfadsios, and that would be the right place to make a statement like this to-day&mdash; said in September, 1931:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers and agricultural labourers had to carry the country on their backs, and they had to maintain the expense of an extravagant Government which cost something like £30,000,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have travelled a long distance from that; if experience could train the farmer's back in the bearing of the burden he certainly has got it.  What the Minister and his colleagues have to face is the position of the agricultural industry.  One leg of this Budget, resting on the agricultural industry, is resting in a very unstable way, and the sooner the Minister makes up his mind that it cannot continue the better for every class of people in the country. The other leg of the Budget is resting on the workers in the towns and the people who pay income-tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister rather challenged the <i>bona fides</i> of Deputy McGilligan when he pointed out that this country was less able to bear income-tax to-day than it was.  I should like the Minister to address himself on that subject to the fact that, in the year 1930-31, income-tax was 3/- in the £, and brought in £4,193,000.  Last year, the Minister will admit that income-tax was 50 per cent. again of that, 4/6 in the £.  Does the Minister admit that he got 50 per cent. more in income-tax, even if he takes the big screw which he put on the income-tax people and the taxation in respect of income-tax which he put on people's houses?  The Minister's own figures will show him that the income-tax payers of 1931 are not able to support the burden he puts on them to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister on the subject. Having heard the Minister on the one point I put to him&mdash;what is the net sum of increase in the National Debt in the last two years?&mdash;the next thing I should like to see is a real examination by him of his income-tax returns, with a view to showing that the things he objects to in Deputy McGilligan's statement are wrong.  At any rate, I would welcome a demonstration by him that the people who pay income-tax are in a better position to support the State to-day than they were in 1931, because, goodness knows, we want their help badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have shown the position of agriculture on one side.  I want now to put a few points as to the position on the industrial side.  On our industrial side, we are suffering from a substantial depreciation in the average wages earned in some of our principal industries; we are suffering from a substantial reduction in the amount of manufactured goods for which we had a market previously; and we are suffering very much from the failure of the brilliant imagination of Fianna Fáil propagandists in 1932 to materialise. I suppose that if there were any particular direction in which substantially increased employment <Col N="624" /> ought to have developed here, it would be in the grain milling industry. The famous Fianna Fáil advertisement promised us 14,069 additional persons in the grain milling industry.  Four hundred and eighty-one have been added, but for such people as have been added to industry, the general effect of the situation over the whole industrial position, as disclosed by the census of production, shows a very substantial decrease in the average amount of wages.</P>
    <P>The average wages paid in the malting industry in 1934, the last year for which we have census of production figures, showed a decline of £24 a year over 1931.  That is not an isolated figure, because the 1933 figures show that the average wages in the malting industry were down by £23 10s. per annum per wage earned.  In the sugar confectionery industry the fall in the average wages for 1933 and 1934 as compared with 1931 was, respectively, £5 and £7.  In the tobacco industry the decrease in annual wages was £6 13s. in 1933 and £5 16s. in 1934.  In the brick manufacturing industry wages in 1933 were down by £17 13s., and in 1934 by £9 18s.  In the furniture industry wages were down by £2 per annum per worker in 1933, and by £4 in 1934.  In the metals industry, excluding engineering, they were down by £10 18s. in 1933, and by £8 8s. in 1934.  In the engineering and implements trades they were down by £18 9s. in 1933, and by £27 8s. in 1934. In the clothing industry they were down by £5 8s. in 1933, but recovered somewhat in 1934, being then down only £1 7s.  In the boot and shoe industry the average annual wage in 1933 was £19 5s. less than it was in 1931, and it had increased in 1934 to £20 10s. below the 1931 figure.  In the fertilisers industry they were down by £14 5s. in 1933, and by £24 5s. in 1934. In 1933 there was a rise in the wages paid in the printing industry of £3 16s., but in 1934 the average wage in that industry had decreased by £6 10s. per year.</P>
    <P>The industries covered by the census of production figures are the cream of our industrial production, and these are the figures of the Minister for <Col N="625" /> Industry and Commerce, showing the position to which the industrial side of Fianna Fáil development is being reduced.</P>

It is into the home of the individual worker, who has a home and a family to support, that the tax collector goes to collect his taxes off his linoleum, off his wallpaper, off his rice pudding and off the various things to which the Minister transfers taxation in order to get the poor man in, in the year 1935 and in the current Budget. I am not hiding the fact that there has been increased employment as a result of tariffs and quotas.  There has been.</P>

      <P>The Minister will find the records of the previous Government, in so far as road workers are concerned, in the annual report of the Department of Local Government, but let him not ride away on any red herring.  The facts are that in some of the principal industries which form the cream of our industrial production here, the effect of Government policy has been substantially to reduce, as between 1931 and 1933 and 1934, the actual amount coming in wages into the average worker's home.  As I say, that is the home into which the invisible tax and the hidden taxes on bread and the hidden taxes on butter and the hidden taxes on bacon have gone as well as the visible taxes that studded to such an alarming extent the whole of the Finance Act and the Budget statement of last year and those of this year, and that as far as the Finance Bill and the Budget statement are concerned might as well be in the hidden position we are wont to see them in.  They were put on last year and they flow on to such an extent that this Budget is going to bring the Minister £200,000 more than the Budget which was an emergency Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of anything else that would not obscure the situation that I am putting to Deputies.  Briefly the position is that four years after the Fianna Fáil Government has had £5,303,000 taken directly out of the people's pockets and put into their Treasury £2,000,000 more of the money that came into their Treasury is expended here instead of being expended on the payment of external debt in the way in which it was expended before.  We are borrowing to a point that, as we can read in the Government's <Col N="627" /> daily press, has reached £11,250,000 between March, 1934, and March, 1936.  There is the shifting of the hidden taxation to support their wheat policy, their beet policy and their bacon policy&mdash;the shifting of that hidden taxation to the people.  After four years of that we reach the normal bill.  And the normal bill is being handed out to the Irish farmer, to the Irish income-tax payer and to the Irish worker, and if he looks at it he will find that it is £200,000 more than the bill which was an emergency bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance says that the people who pay income-tax are in a better position now than in 1931, though he is not able to tell us, nor is the Minister for Finance able to tell us, what our trading balance is, because for two years they have been scratching their heads to find out what they can risk saying is our income from investments in foreign countries and what are the outgoings to foreign countries from their investments here. That is a matter about which we used to have information, but for the last two years it is being cloaked down. The only thing we can get is a statement from the Minister for Finance that those of us who say that the income-tax payers cannot pay do not know what they are talking about. The condition of the farmers is that they are getting half prices for their live stock&mdash;half of what they got in the year in which they had to meet the emergency Budget; and that our workers with substantially reduced wages have already had their homes nearly skinned by the tax collector.  It is not sufficient for the Minister for Finance to come in here with a long description of his excellent Budget.  A Budget of the kind that he introduced here wants some foundation.  This country showed that it had a foundation upon which even a high cost of government might be supported here. But the level to which he and his colleagues have raised the cost of government is a level of such kind that the foundation does not exist here to support it.  It must be obvious to the Minister and his colleagues that it is perfectly true what Deputy Dillon says and what the Government press rants <Col N="628" /> so much in indignation about, that he and his colleagues are living here from hand to mouth and imposing a burden of taxation on people absolutely stung as they are by people going on with the antics of government.  The people are held silent by the machinery in the hands of the Government.  There is not a person in the commercial life or in the manufacturing life of the country who is prepared to say what he wishes to say about the situation. One has only to remember what the Chairman of the Irish Manufacturers' Federation said the other day about the Budget to realise the state of mind to which even intelligent people upon whom we do and must depend for the control and development of the manufacturing industry in this country have been brought.  One has there a sample of what an intelligent person of that calibre can say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, some of them are making enormous profits, but they know as well as Deputy McGilligan or any other Deputy must know that it is a question of making large profits that will not return.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is so well able to get after the income-tax people.  I can tell the Minister why some of his revenue is so much down.  You have only to examine what the President of the Irish Manufacturers' Federation said about the Minister's Budget to see how deliberately tongue-tied even intelligent people are in this country. I warn the Federation of Irish Manufacturers that they cannot do their work here except on ground that will be prepared for them by a prosperous agricultural industry, and it seems to me a blow at Irish industry and a neglect of their own most intimate interests that anybody speaking for the <Col N="629" /> Federation of Irish Manufacturers to-day must speak of the Minister's Budget as a normal Budget without reverting in some way or another&mdash;and the more directly the better&mdash;to the condition to which the Minister and his policy have reduced agriculture here.</P>
      <P>There is not a person in commercial life or in a manufacturing industry living here who, if he has any interest in his industry in a personal way, would dare say what he thinks of what is going on in regard to Fianna Fáil policy or Fianna Fáil budgeting here; but unless they come out and stand shoulder to shoulder, unless they speak with a combined voice from a position where the individual cannot be got at, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers have no more cheerful road in front of them than have the Irish farmers, and it is scarcely necessary for me to emphasise that the Irish farmer has a very miserable road in front of him if the policy that is being pursued by this Government is going to continue. This Budget is worse than the emergency Budget, and it is coming at a time when the economic position of the people is getting worse.  The sooner the Minister for Finance and his followers or colleagues, who know what the situation is, face the facts, the better.  I will conclude with this statement, that normal Budgets of this kind are not going to do the country any good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this discussion very little reference has been made to the different types of policy that have been pursued in this country during the last few years.  When the Minister introduced his first Budget he imposed a sum of something like £4,000,000 in additional taxation.  There was announced at the time a change in the tariff policy of the country.  New tariffs were imposed.  We followed the policy, which had been tried in most other countries and found unsuccessful, of initiating a big change in the fiscal policy with no advertence whatever to the dangers that were inherent in that policy.  What has, perhaps, reacted more than anything else against the success of a tariff policy in practically all countries is that it has imposed an undue burden on the backs of the rate-payers, <Col N="630" /> has increased the cost of living, has added to the cost of production and has left the finished article in consequence much dearer to consumers. After an examination and trial, if I might say so, of that policy, quite a number of countries have discovered that tariffs of themselves are not what was originally thought to be a successful method of improving industrial expansion.  Quite a number of countries have now come to the conclusion that along that line, at any rate, there is not much hope for dealing with and endeavouring to cure the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In the previous Administration, when a tariff policy was introduced it had every prospect of success because, coincident with its introduction there was a reduction in taxation.  Not only that, but special efforts were made to enable the agricultural industry to meet whatever extra costs might be entailed by reason of the tariff policy, and so, in the year 1924-25, a very big sum of money was voted in relief of the rates on agricultural land.  The tariff policy of this Government, however, was faced with very unusual circumstances in connection with the prices available for agricultural products. Not alone did we, in common with the rest of the world, feel the effects of low prices for agricultural products, but the tariff conflict with Great Britain produced a very much worse state of affairs here.  We are now approaching the fifth year of that tariff conflict, and that it has been serious nobody questions; in fact, members of different Parties, however they may differ on other subjects, are agreed that the farming industry here is in a serious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that those who support Government policy in the country, from the first Minister of the State down to the most junior Parliamentary Secretary, always stress the importance of the great advantages that the farming community have derived from the particular reliefs that have been afforded in connection with flour, sugar, tillage and so on.  When we come to examine what the effect of these reliefs to the agricultural community have been, we find a very different state of affairs.  The Minister <Col N="631" /> for Agriculture, in a broadcast on Saturday night, submitted that if we were to criticise the taxation that had been imposed and added to that taxation the costs that the people have had to bear in connection with the increased price over the world price of flour, sugar, the butter levy, meat taxes, bacon levies or taxes, whatever we may like to call them, that we would be bound to take into account the cost of living as reflected in this year and the cost of living as reflected in the average price published for the year 1932.  It was an ingenious defence, but it will not bear examination. It has this weakness, that one can take the average of the year 1935 to suit an argument, but cannot take the figures for 1935 and apportion them to the argument.</P>
    <P>In all these matters, particularly in finance matters, we must distinguish between argument and facts.  The facts in this instance are quite simple. In a publication called the <i>Quarterly Statistical Bulletin,</i> issued in April, 1936, we get these figures: cost of living in respect of food items for February, 136; May, 132; August, 140, and November, 150.  One is perfectly entitled from the point of view of argument to take the average, but are you entitled on the facts to do that?  In May of last year the Minister introduced a Budget here in which he imposed additional taxation to the extent of almost £1,200,000.  Naturally that extra taxation is not reflected either in the February figure or in the May figure, which was as low as 132. Some indication of it is noticeable in August, where the price of food items has advanced to 140, and in November, where it has gone up to 150.  The comparable figure that the Minister should have taken, if he has to take an average, and it would not make a lot of difference, is the figure for August, November and February of the following year.  The average might have worked out the same&mdash; there would have been only five points difference&mdash;but it would be a more honest, a more intelligent figure, and one more in accordance with the facts. We find that the figure is 145, as <Col N="632" /> against 147 in 1931&mdash;speaking from recollection.  Let us examine that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the figure for 1931 is also an average figure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the other figure if the Minister gives it.  In fact, I will give any figure the Minister wishes.  Let us make this examination. While that figure of 147 stood for the year 1931, let me ask what was the average price farmers got for their produce?  I am dealing with the food items only which the Minister for Agriculture specially introduced himself. I am taking it that that is his argument.  The Minister understands the difference between the two.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Now we will settle that point.  Presumably it will be conceded that most of the food cost arises from consumption of food produced in this country.  What is consumed of food imported is an item that is negligible.  I shall concede any percentage asked for.  But making up the ordinary total of food consumption of the working classes in this country, whom this figure vitally affects, most of the items consumed, outside tea, are of Irish production.  The average price obtained by farmers for £100 worth of agricultural produce, taking that as the price in 1913, was £110 in 1931.  The farmer got £10 more for the same quantity and quality in 1931 than he got in 1913.  What did he get last year?  He got £83.  Would it not be reasonable to expect, having regard to that enormous reduction, that there would be some corresponding reduction in the cost of food items in this country?  The figure according to that principle should be 109 instead of 145 which the Minister announced.  It should be 109 as against the 145 charged.  What has happened in the circumstances?  What has happened is this: that while the farmers have not got their fair portion of the cost, the <Col N="633" /> people had to pay it.  How did that occur?  Very simply.  The expedients devised and put into operation have not had the effect they were supposed to have, or that they were designed to have, or that the House and the country was led to believe that they would have.</P>
      <P>Take one item alone with which the Minister dealt at length in the course of his speech.  He talked of the taxation derived by the State from sugar. He pointed out that it was less in revenue than it was four or five years ago.  We are prepared to accept that. What we object to is that the ordinary consumer in this country is paying 1d. per lb. more and the State is getting less, so that in consequence the whole scheme is lobsided.  That scheme cost over £15,000,000, over £16 a ton, and gives employment, yet the farmers have not derived 20 per cent. of that cost, because they are only getting £800,000 out of it.  Where are the profits going?  That is really the thing to consider.  If the country is spending all this money and the farmers are only getting £800,000 out of it, plus the employment that is given, is it not an extremely costly experiment and is it not bound to have its effect upon the purchasing power of our community? So that we have a whole list of items in connection with the changed fiscal and financial policy pursued in this country for the last four or five years to be considered.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for the fiscal and financial policy in force in this country at the present moment.  I pointed out, at the very beginning, at the very initiation of these high tariffs and high taxes, that the result, now apparent, would happen.  That was not an act of prophecy on my part.  It was one of the things experienced in other countries. It is showing in the economics of America at the present moment and amongst financiers in Europe, and it is being discussed in Geneva, where efforts are being made to solve the problem that we have over here, above every other problem, namely, the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> Let us take one or two casual looks at what has transpired during the last few years in connection with this cost-of-living business.  Take the four years starting with 1928 and going on to 1929 and 1930 and 1931.  Subtract from all items that enter into the cost of living the cost of food items.  In 1928 there were only six points allocated in respect of that item; in the following year it was seven points, the following year, 1930, it was 11 points and in the last year, 1931, it was 13 points&mdash;a total of 37 points in four years.  Now, take the following four years and what do you find?  You find a sum total of over 70 points.  What is the meaning of that? Quite simple.  The figures are almost double.  The other items show that&mdash; items other than the cost of food&mdash;such as apparel, normal expenses, such as theatres, a very small quantity of drink, tobacco and so on.  In the four years from 1928 to 1931 it has risen from 31 to 70.  That is the effect of the extra taxes and the extra tariffs.  Do you think it likely that you are going to see a prosperous development with increasing cost arising out of your taxation and tariff policy?  It may happen; everybody hopes it will be perfect, but the facts do not bear that out.  Making allowance that half the agricultural produce of this country is exported, is it not apparent from figures presenting a difference of from £110 in 1931 down to £83 last year in agricultural produce generally that there is much less purchasing power than there would be if prices of agricultural produce bore a better relation to world prices than they do at the present moment?</P>
    <P>In order to help to get that £83 for what the farmer got £100 in 1913, what extra costs have been added on to the ordinary consumer?  I have mentioned sugar, which cost £1,000,000 more; wheat probably cost £1,200,000, or 8/- per sack on 3,000,000 sacks; the butter levy was £600,000; in respect of the meat tax £285,000 was paid last year; and in respect of bacon £241,000; borough and urban councils have been taxed to the extent of £196,000; the extra cost of unemployment insurance over and above that of four years ago is £190,000; making in all figure <Col N="635" /> which was borne by the taxpaying and consuming public last year of £3,712,000.  Add to that the difference between the Minister's estimate of receipts on the basis of the level of taxation then in force.  Four years ago the tax and non-tax revenue was £23,310,000 and this year it is £30,091,000.  The difference between these sums, which, according to the Minister's estimate, is new taxation, is £6,750,000 which, added to the £3,000,000 odd I have mentioned, makes £10,000,000.  In order to strengthen that case, to bring about the £83 for the agricultural produce for which £100 was got pre-war, £1,000,000 has been spent upon sugar, £1,000,000 has been spent upon wheat, £600,000 of the butter levy has been spent, and so on with bacon and meat.  Is it not a costly transaction? It has not succeeded in restoring the farmers even to a normal position and when farmers get £83 for what they got £100 for pre-war, we expect a development and expansion in the industries of this country.</P>
    <P>By reason of the non-success of the agricultural policy pursued for the last few years, we have to spend £1,500,000 on unemployment assistance.  What is the cost of administering it?  The cost of administering that fund, together with the Unemployment Insurance Fund, is something over £500,000.  The cost of administering unemployment insurance four years ago was £90,000, so that the new fund cost nearly £500,000 to disburse amongst the people whom it is intended to help. Every £3 that they get is costing £1 to distribute.  Is it not a costly service?</P>
    <P>Going on to examine the Budget from the point of view of the bulk money required we find it is up by £700,000 on last year, and that notwithstanding the fact that bounties are down by £500,000, that the service of the sinking fund and interest is down according to the printed table by £427,000, making almost £1,000,000 between the two, the exact figure being £952,000.  Notwithstanding that relief, as compared with last year, the sum is up by £700,000.  If we were paying the same bounties as last year and the <Col N="636" /> same amount had to be met out of the sinking fund and interest, expenditure would be up by £1,700,000, and that at a time when farmers are getting £17 per £100 less than they got in 1913.</P>
    <P>Then, as the law stands at present, we are liable to have supplementary Budgets at any time that the Executive Council in their wisdom decide. We can have during the whole year, in any month of the year, or on any night, impositions upon new articles or increased or altered tariffs, according as their wisdom directs.  That is an innovation which it would be well to dispense with at the earliest opportunity. It has been availed of almost regularly during the last four years. It is only about 18 months ago since there was imposed an extra Customs duty and an extra Excise duty on sugar&mdash;one in October of one year and the other in the February of the following year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the manner in which the Minister deducts almost £1,000,000 for overestimation, we ought to have got to the point now after four years' experience of having a lesser sum than that fixed for overestimation.  It is quite true that during the course of the last few years that particular shot on the part of the Minister has been exact.  But the fact that he has been right in it does not justify the practice. It gives too much power to the Executive Council.  It is open to them to spend the whole of a given Estimate and to starve other Estimates as they please.  The responsibility of Parliament in voting public moneys is one over which Parliament should exercise a stricter control in connection with the discretion allowed to Minister in that way.</P>
    <P>The Budgets for the last four years have had an advantage over the Budgets of the preceding years.  Up to 1932 there was included in the Supply Services each year a sum of £2,000,000, which was paid to Great Britain. The Government have not paid that sum during the last four years.  In consequence of that, any comparisons made with the Budgets up to four years ago should have an allowance in respect of that matter.  It makes the case for the increase in taxation of <Col N="637" /> over £6,750,000 still worse, because the true figure should be £8,750,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister prides himself upon the revenue he derived last year.  Everybody is pleased to know that the revenue is keeping up.  But in that connection it might be better if we gave the whole of the circumstances of every case.  Let us take one source of revenue upon which the Minister prided himself&mdash;the beer tax.  He said it had exceeded, not only the Estimate but the receipts as far back as 1931.  If he adds to that the spirit duties he will find that he is down on the year 1931-32 by something like £130,000.  Beer and spirits are usually calculated together.  Although the revenue in respect of the duty on beer may have been up last year as compared with four years ago, those two sources of revenue when taken together are down by something like £130,000.</P>
    <P>Going back over a period of years one notices a contraction in the amount available from these two sources. Some years ago, when the suggestion was put forward that a reduction might be made in the duties charged, it was pointed out, I think by the Leader of the Opposition at that time, that he would oppose that on the ground that if any relief in taxation were to be afforded it should be in respect of food items.  The facts are that, owing to the contraction in revenue from these two items in the last few years, articles of food or other articles have had to be taxed.  The Minister might well reconsider his decision on that point&mdash;whether he decides upon it, or some other member of the Ministry, or the Executive Council, I do not know.</P>
    <P>A falling revenue is a dangerous thing, and that particular revenue has fallen by over 50 per cent. within the last 12 years.  Last year's Budget was unbalanced to the extent of something like £40,000.  It is not a large sum, that is to say if the £40,000 represents a true figure and is related to all the circumstances of the case.  But that is not so.  In the last two or three years we have undertaken a very extensive housing programme.  We have shouldered a responsibility, as far as the State is concerned, for a very big percentage of the money that is being <Col N="638" /> borrowed by local authorities.  The liability for our portion of that money will extend, I suppose, over the next 20 or 30 years.  We shall in that case leave a rather costly inheritance to our successors.  If I recollect the Minister's figures correctly, he mentioned two sums, one of £1,500,000 and the other of £2,400,000.  I do not know whether he had intended to add those two figures together to represent the dead-weight liability in respect of the State's contribution to the housing loans, but if there is a dead-weight debt, that is, a debt the entire interest and sinking fund charges of which will fall upon the people of this country for the next 20 or 30 years, it seems to me that we cannot call the Budget balanced by postponing the payment of that sum over that period.</P>
    <P>If it solved the housing question it might possibly be justified in the special circumstances of the case, but one has to consider that the cities still have slum problems which will cost vast sums of money to deal with.  I am taking the case which is nearest at hand, that of the City of Dublin, where some 15,000 families have yet to be provided for and only 5,000 have been provided for.  We are then looking forward to a considerable increase in the dead-weight liability of the State to the extent of the service of the interest and sinking fund of that £3,900,000.  Our contribution, to my mind, would require to be more than merely the year's service of the debt. It is one of those debts that should be wiped out within a given number of years.  A case may be made for doing it in five years.  A case might well perhaps be made for doing it in ten years, but anything over and above that period would appear to require some justification other than we can read from the Minister's speech.  The sum is not much; the interest on £4,000,000 at 5 per cent. is only £200,000; the sinking fund charges, even over 20 years, would be another £200,000, but, taking into account the fact that the dead-weight debt has gone up by £6,000,000, that problem is still there to be solved, and in addition to that problem there is the problem of unemployment.  We might have gone a little further towards <Col N="639" /> meeting it, and not be handing it on to our successors to solve.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal in connection with the relief of unemployment is much more attractive in its first presentation than it really is.  He is giving £135,000 towards the £2,500,000 fund, and proposes to borrow £250,000. There again the same question arises. Is this likely to be an endemic problem? If it is, then that £250,000 should have been provided out of revenue.  If, on the other hand, it is hoped to see a very considerable inroad made upon the numbers of those unemployed, it might be justifiable to borrow it, but certainly not on a 20 or 30-year loan, and to that extent I think the Minister was not wise in borrowing to the extent of £250,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy means that an asset will be created when the work is over, the question we have to consider is whether it is a State asset and whether it is value for the money. If it is, that is another question.  We did not get sufficient information from the Minister to be able to pronounce upon the value of the asset that would be created.  If one takes the £825,000 that is to be put up by the local authorities in connection with this work, presumably that means drainage, water supply or something of that sort.  I assume that the local authorities will not be called upon to bear the entire cost, and that we will meet portion of it.  Whatever asset is created in that case is not an asset from the point of view of the State; it is an asset for the local authority&mdash;an asset to this extent, that it provides for a local necessity&mdash;but no money can be derived by the State in respect of that, except in one direction, the improved health of the people, and whatever advantage can be got out of employing men in productive work rather than paying them unemployment insurance.  In that case, unless the Minister has more information at his disposal than be gave the House, the borrowing of £250,000 could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was rather unfortunate that the <Col N="640" /> Minister gave terms of reference to a committee with a view to reducing the claim on the Unemployment Fund to a minimum.  The Minister has probably had experience&mdash;and his colleagues on the Executive Council also&mdash;during the last three or four years of how dangerous some of their observations were on political matters in the years antecedent to their coming into power. If a great many of those statements had to be remade they would be couched in different language.  At the moment this country is governed democratically; it has that appearance about it.  The Minister will have observed that his friends&mdash;in fact, I might almost have said his colleagues a couple of years ago&mdash;in the Labour Party have recently taken a rather critical view of Government policy.  I was expecting them to seize the opportunity of showing the villainy that is behind the Ministry in giving such terms of reference to a committee&mdash; that it was with a view to saving the State the cost of this service that the committee was set up, rather than to solve the unemployment problem.  The Minister was honest in putting the terms of reference before us.  They were not drawn up in a statesmanlike fashion.  I am quite sure that at the back of the Minister's mind there was an idea that it would be easily possible to solve unemployment. He will remember what his leader said to the people somewhere down in Carrick-on-Suir, when it was pointed out by the outgoing Ministry that Field-Marshal von Hindenburg, President Hoover, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and all his predecessors, the Prime Minister of France and all his predecessors, and of Czecho-Slovakia and all the other countries, including I suppose, the Emperor of Abyssinia, had not solved unemployment, although they had the opportunities just as much as we had. The people were told that that was all bunk, and not to be deceived by Mr. Cosgrave in those pronouncements.</P>
    <P>Those terms of reference simply vindicate the outgoing Administration in respect of unemployment.  In the first place, we had nothing approaching the same numbers of unemployed four years ago.  In the second place, <Col N="641" /> whatever employment was afforded during that period was afforded in stable and continuous employment, in industries on a low tariff scale, in respect of which it was unlikely, if not almost inconceivable, that any public agitation would take place for their removal.  What is the situation now? The Minister's colleague&mdash;now his political opponent&mdash;is repeatedly giving expression to the view that tariffs are not a cure for unemployment.  I suppose the Minister will scarcely believe me when I tell him I am an ardent believer in tariffs properly applied, but I view with grave apprehension an imposition of tariffs which will make them unpopular, which will make them difficult to justify and which will create an opinion against them outside.  In that connection, if we take the views of those who designate themselves as giving expression to the Labour view, on the one hand, in criticism of such tariffs&mdash;and we could&mdash;and, on the other hand, the views of agricultural labourers, whose wages have diminished in the last two or three years by as much as 3/- per week, and those engaged in the agricultural industry, who have seen the price of agricultural produce fall, since 1932, from £110, for a given lot of agricultural produce, to £83&mdash;does not all that point to the necessity of the Government taking heed of the situation in regard to the tariff policy? Does it not show that it is all the more necessary that an effort should be made to reduce national expenditure, where possible?  Does it not show that every effort should be made to cut costs, wherever possible?  The most glaring example is that which I have already given&mdash;in connection with unemployment assistance&mdash;where, even with the inroad the Minister expects to make on this fund next year of £500,000, the administrative costs, probably, will not be reduced.  Accordingly, all these items are mounting up, and will make it more difficult for the consumer, the Government, the taxpayer, and for democracy itself, and eventually may lead to an upheaval of the kind that no sensible person wants.</P>
    <P>There are many things that we have to do.  The first is to restore the agricultural <Col N="642" /> position.  The second is to find remunerative employment for the unemployed.  The third is to solve the housing problem at a cost that will not bear too heavily on the taxpayers of the community.  The fourth is to find an avenue for the exploitation and expansion of our trade.  This Budget does not do that.  The Minister would be well advised, during the Recess, if he has not time to do so now, to look into every possible source of public expenditure in order to see in what way they can be reduced. To start off, I suggest that he should begin on the main item of public expenditure that, I am sure he knows as well as I do, does not reach the place for which it was intended.  I refer to the bounties.  I suggest that he should start on these with a view to seeing if it is possible to restore the agricultural situation to what it once was.</P>

      <P>This is a disappointing Budget.  It does not give any relief to the workingman.  The taking of a farthing a pound off sugar on the 1st of next August will be no relief to the workingman or the agricultural labourer.  As members of this House know, the agricultural labourer, very often, is not in a position to buy more than half a pound of sugar at a time, and sometimes not as much, and everybody in this House knows that there is no such thing as a farthing to be got in the country, as a rule.  Let us take the question of flour.  I see the Minister laughing.  The Minister may laugh, but flour in the Saorstát to-day is 8d. dearer than in Northern Ireland, and that is all due to the policy of the Government.  That is not a wholesome situation for the workingman. Up to some time ago, the farmer was in the front-line trenches in this economic war, but to-day the agricultural labourer and the country shopkeeper are in the front-line trenches. Certain tariffs were put on to keep the economic war going, but I think it is time for the Government to see daylight and for the Minister for Finance to come to some agreement with the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;even though the President boasts about the firing of the first shot in this economic war&mdash; whereby the farmer should not be <Col N="643" /> asked to bear all these burdens. Whether it is done by bounty or otherwise, unless some arrangement can be come to by which relief can be given to the farmers, this country will be down and out in a short time.</P>
      <P>We are told all about the new industries that have been set up in the country.  I am glad to hear of any of them being set up, and I am only too happy to give them my support, but we must all remember that, in order to keep this country going, the agricultural industry must be prosperous; and it will never be prosperous as long as the present Government keep to their present policy.  Take the case of a pig-producer.  The produce of the pig that goes to the home factory is taxed 5/-, and that is very little encouragement to a farmer or agricultural labourer to keep pigs.  As a matter of fact, in the constituency I represent, 95 per cent. of the butter produced is by hand-labour, and the Government sees its way to put a tax of 3d. per pound on that butter.  That is poor consolation for a poor unfortunate farmer's wife, after churning her milk and cream and making her butter.  It is poor consolation for that unfortunate woman, after all her labour, to have to pay the Government 3d. per lb.  We used to hear a lot of talk about Home Rule&mdash; and, by the way, Deputy Donnelly can take his hand away from his mouth. I do not mind the Deputy telling me that I am a liar, but I hope the Minister will not commit himself in this connection.  After all, the Minister does not know a whole lot about the world.  He is only a drawingroom farmer.  The Minister knows as much about farming as I know about making watches.  As an illustration of the state of the country at the moment, let us take what has been the result of the 1933 Land Act.  Here is a letter that I got from a farmer's wife in the County Wexford.</P>

      <P>Dear Mr. Keating,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When you glean the facts from this letter you will probably think it far-fetched.  But believe me it is absolutely true.  I think it is up to me to air some of the bullying that well-intentioned people have to bear who are trying (and paying) to pay their way.  Some days ago, about noon, a good-looking car stopped at the hall door, two well-dressed gentlemen (as I thought) got out and rapped.  I sent my daughter to speak to them.  She is my dairymaid. We thought they were the men about the warble fly.  Looking out at the door to see if I knew them, I saw them push in beyond my daughter and walk into my sitting-room. My daughter came back to me quite flurried, and asked me if I would go to those men as she could not understand their attitude.  I went up to them and found them sitting as though they were old friends, one at each side of the room; neither of them made any move when I came in, but asked me abruptly and in a most aggressive manner if this was James Davis' place, Walshestown.  I said &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;  One of them immediately said: &lsquo;It's not, it's ours.&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;You must be joking, do I know you?&rsquo; One of them answered: &lsquo;No, but you won't be long.&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;Please talk straight and not in riddles.&rsquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we have come to take over this place, and you're to quit.&rsquo; I asked when.  One of them said: &lsquo;Now.&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;Let us reason.  There must be some way out of this.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;There's none; we are sent here from the inspector, Castlemorris House&mdash; 70 miles&mdash;to take over this place as there is money due, and we are doing so&mdash;if one of us goes out, the other stays&mdash;vice versa.&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;If I (just for argument sake) got some one or two to put out, what would happen?&rsquo; They answered: &lsquo;We can call on a lorry load of soldiers to put you out.&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;That's no use.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I then suggested they would let me know what the bill was, and, lo and behind, they fished out some papers and the amount of money was £13 2s. 10d. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if we get into your car and you bring me to the bank I think they won't refuse me that.&rsquo; But no, they would not budge.  I then asked if they would be afraid to face their boss, whoever he was, if they got a little money?  No, they were to take over all, and nothing else would do; those were their orders.  I asked them to call in the evening and see Mr. Davis.  They said they would be here all right.  I said: &lsquo;Call back.&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;No, they were staying on.&rsquo; However, after an hour and a quarter they condescended to take £5 (all the money we could scrape up), the balance to be sent on by Saturday.  They gave me some curious receipts, as you will see by enclosed.  Please think about this and see if it's O.K.  It doesn't seem to me to be right.

      <P>Deputy Donnelly can laugh but he will only have a thirty-first cousin a farmer.  When Fianna Fáil went to the country in 1932-33, they told the farmers that everything would be beautiful; that there would be better and alternative markets; that everything would be O.K.  They also told the farm labourers that they would have better wages.  They went so far as to say that the country would be so prosperous that they would have to send to England and to America to bring the exiles home. It is nearly time for the Government to look around the corner and to do something for the depressed people.  I happened to be going along the road in the spring of 1935 when I saw two horses that were drawing a seed-sower seized, although the farmer was trying at the time to get in his crop.  In <Col N="646" /> the old Land League days, when we were fighting the British, if that happened there would be a queer amount of talk about it.  There was a lot of talk about that incident, but it had no effect.</P>
      <P>The sooner the Government has commonsense and gives the people a chance to live in their own country the better it will be for everyone.  We were told that the British market was gone for ever.  If it was not for the demand for Irish cattle in Great Britain to-day farmers would be in a worse position.  But for the tariff of £4 5s. a head that has been imposed on Irish cattle farmers would be making as good prices as I remember, barring the Great War prices.  Whatever Government is in power they should grasp at every opportunity to relieve the position in which the people find themselves. If farmers are not prosperous no one in this country is prosperous. It is deplorable to think of the condition of the agricultural community and of poor people who are not getting a square meal in the day.  Labourers working for farmers may be fed, but when they go home to their wives and children the position is deplorable.  It is time for the Labour Party to see that the workers get a fair crack of the whip and get, at least, a reasonable living in their own land.  One is called a West Britisher or a foreigner for fighting for what he considers to be the rights of this country.  I was not a West Britisher in the 'eighties, when I was following the sound constitutional members we had then in Parliament, Parnell, Redmond and others.  To-day when we have a native Government they are persecuting the Irish people.  It is about time to end the present condition of things.</P>

      <P>Judging by the reception which the Budget has received from organs of the Press largely concerned with ensuring that the interests of the well-to-do classes are adequately catered for, and no new imposts made on them, this is a good Budget, and the Minister for Finance will probably congratulate himself on the fact that he is now probably on better terms than ever before with the <i>Irish Times.</i> The editor thinks him a much more <Col N="647" /> ingenious Minister for Finance than he ever dreamt of in 1932, and, of course, it is obvious from recent issues of that paper, and recent comments in the editorials, that the <i>Irish Times</i> regards the present Minister as an absolutely ideal Minister for Finance, from the standpoint of the people it represents. Reading the Budget in the light of views expressed by such organs of public opinion one gets the impression that so far as that section of the community is concerned they see in this Budget something which treats it with as much tenderness as it is possible to treat it having regard to the fact that taxes must be paid.  The Minister for Finance finds consolation in the fact that this, of course, is a conservative Budget, because it has undoubtedly to take its place amongst the most conservative Budgets produced by Ministers of any country in any generation. The one striking feature about the Budget is that it maintains and very definitely consolidates the swing to the right which was noticeable in the Minister's Budget speech of last year.  In 1934 the Minister reduced the tax upon tea.  In 1934 he also reduced income-tax, but in 1935 he put back the tax on tea, but did not put back the tax on income at the former rate, so that between 1934 and 1935, weighing up the possibilities, as to what section should bear the burden, the Minister exercised a choice between income-tax payers and consumers of tea.  Consumers of tea had to pay the burden while income-tax payers were allowed to get away with the reduction which the Minister had given the previous year.  In this Budget we find that the tax upon tea is maintained, while the tax upon income is continued at the former rate, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Finance has not this year the excuse he gave last year for not raising the income-tax level and exempting other commodities from taxation, namely that the British rates were now down to a maximum of 4/6 in the £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These tendencies convince anyone who cares to study the facts revealed in the Minister's recent Budgets that the whole tendency in recent Budgets of the present Minister for <Col N="648" /> Finance has been a very definite swing to the right, a very definite attempt to demonstrate to certain sections of the community that they have nothing to fear from a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and that, so far as he is concerned, the taxes will not be imposed on the basis of the shoulders broadest to bear them but on a basis which will distribute the burdens just as heavily on the poor as on the wealthy.  This year that outlook on the part of the Minister for Finance is not only continued but, as I say, consolidated, and all the plaudits with which the Minister has been received in certain Press organs make it abundantly clear that that section of the community regards itself as having been treated with exceptional leniency by the Minister for Finance.  The <i>Irish Times</i> of last week was so enraptured that it could scarcely refrain from drawing a very decided distinction between the Minister and the President of the Executive Council.  It said last week that the Minister for Finance had behaved in financial matters, particularly, of course, towards the section which it represented, in such a way that he had done much to repair the mischief caused by the provocative policy of the President of the Executive Council&mdash; all indicating, of course, that the present Minister for Finance, in the viewpoint of those who are responsible for the production of that organ, is a Minister for Finance who fulfils their requirements possibly more adequately in respect of taxation than any previous Minister for Finance has done in this country.</P>
    <P>In the Budget we are told for the first time by the spokesman of the Government that unemployment is a problem that is going to be with us from year to year.  It seems to me that a statement of that kind, if it is intended to represent the viewpoint of the Government, is a definite expression of inability to solve the problem of unemployment in the circumstances existing in this country. In other days we had much more cheery declarations on the subject of unemployment.  At one time the President told us that there was no reason why unemployment should exist <Col N="649" /> here.  Later we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce declaring that he had a plan which was going to absorb 85,000 unemployed persons. His only problem then was whether it would be possible to secure that number of unemployed workers within the country or whether persons might have to be brought home from exile. The Minister for Defence, speaking in or about the same period, said that probably they should be glad there were so many persons unemployed in the country as they would be available for the work that would be obtainable when this new and rather unique plan was put into operation.  Now we have from the Minister for Finance a declaration, the first declaration of the kind during the past four years, that unemployment as a problem is going to be with us from year to year.  If the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance means anything, it is a definite indication that, so far as the Executive Council are concerned, they now appear to have abandoned their original ambition to cure unemployment as it exists in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is necessary that we should have here the unemployment problem that apparently the Minister for Finance indicates is going to remain with us from year to year. In any case, we should know from the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he now subscribes to the view that unemployment is going to remain with us in the dimensions envisaged by the Minister for Finance in the course of his Budget speech.  But, even if we are to have that admission from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we ought to know what has driven the Executive Council to this despairing outlook on the subject of unemployment.  We ought to know on what grounds they base this conclusion and we ought to know why, and precisely for what reasons, the Government which once said that there was no reason why unemployment should exist here, and which once thought that there would be difficulty in getting men to do all the tasks to be performed, have now been driven to the recognition that unemployment as a problem is something that is going to be with us from year to year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Deputy Cosgrave in the course of his statement said that the Labour Party had expressed the view that tariffs alone would not cure unemployment. I think that is such a statement of a primary economic fact as hardly to be challenged by anybody.  Tariffs alone will not cure unemployment here any more than tariffs alone have cured unemployment in other countries throughout the world.  But the original plan was not based merely on the imposition of tariffs.  There was to be a vast scheme of national reconstruction, not merely of industry and agriculture, but a vast scheme of planning generally, a vast scheme of national reconstruction on such a scale as to absorb into productive employment large numbers of persons who were then unemployed.  Instead of that grandiose plan, instead of these optimistic declarations that the unemployment problem would be solved through the medium of that plan, we have now the cold douche of reality, as seen by the Minister for Finance, thrown on that plan and on these schemes.  We have now to content ourselves with a situation where unemployment is to be with us from year to year.  Bearing that in mind, the Minister apparently proposes to set about the task of doing something to relieve the unemployment problem which we are going to have with us from year to year.  Prior to the recent Employment Period Order being made operative in respect of small farmers with a valuation of over £4, there were registered at the unemployment exchanges, satisfying the rigid test of unemployment imposed under the Unemployment Assistance Act, no less than 145,000 persons.  They were not, of course, persons in the main who registered previously for employment at the unemployment exchanges, but at all events they were persons able and willing to work, genuinely anxious to obtain work and satisfying the rigorous test imposed under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    <P>That is the unemployment problem with which the country is faced to-day, and that is the problem that it must be the task of this Government to face up to.  That is the unemployment <Col N="651" /> problem that calls out for a solution, the problem that the Minister for Finance must direct his efforts to if we are going, in respect of that large mass of humanity, to try to give them a higher destiny in this life than merely trekking to employment exchanges for the miserable pittances which they receive under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  What does the Executive Council propose to do in the matter of the provision of work for that huge army of unemployed men?  When you contemplate that vast number of unemployed persons in the vicinity of 145,000, and when you take into consideration their wives and the children who are dependent on them, you get a sum total of misery and destitution which surely demonstrates that we have an unemployed State within the State itself.  That is the problem which the Executive Council must address itself to.</P>
    <P>This Budget is intended to indicate, in some measure, what the proposals are in that respect.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, announced that a sum of £2,500,000 will be available for public works. One would think that this £2,500,000 was to be made available by the State in the form of new money, apart altogether from any other provision which is being made in the Estimates or in this Budget, or apart altogether from the provisions which would be made inevitably during the year by local authorities in furtherance of local schemes of public health works. But when we come to ask how the £2,500,000 for public works is to be raised, we find that the Road Fund is to be asked to contribute £100,000, and that local authorities will be asked to raise £875,000.  There is already in the Estimates provision for £500,000 in respect of relief schemes, and unemployment assistance.  Under this scheme the public works will be reduced by £550,000.  Therefore, we find that out of the total of £2,500,000 these four items alone make over £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>The amount of money which the Executive Council propose to make available to deal with this unemployment problem is £500,000, and even <Col N="652" /> some of that money is to be made available in the form of a loan, a quite undesirable proceeding from my point of view, particularly when one is dealing with an unemployment problem which is not a temporary problem but which is now a permanent problem in the viewpoint of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The State is going to ask the local authorities and the Road Fund to contribute, approximately, £1,000,000 to this £2,500,000 work fund.  It is going to save £500,000 under unemployment assistance, it is going to utilise the £500,000 provided in the Estimates for relief schemes, and to put in another £500,000 itself.  That is the sum total of the provision which is to be made during the year for the relief of the unemployment problem.  Now that it is admitted to be a problem which is not going to disappear in the easy way that it was at first thought of, I think that such provision for the relief of unemployment is inadequate.  I think that it will be quite impossible to save, through the medium of unemployment assistance, the gigantic sum of £500,000, approximately one-third of the total sum of money made available for unemployment assistance, merely by the creation of a work fund through the means of raising the money that I have just indicated.  It seems to me that the Executive Council are hoping altogether for too much from the good effects which are likely to flow from the creation of this work fund financing itself.  The local authorities are to be asked to contribute approximately £1,000,000 out of the £2,500,000.  The rest of the money has already been voted, or has been got by means of raids, and the additional sum made available by the Government is not of such a kind as to justify the very extravagant claims which have been made for the beneficial effects which are likely to follow from the provision of this work fund.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Executive Council really want to face up to their responsibility in respect of unemployment, and if they want to make an effective impression on that problem, the magnitude of which it is impossible to-day to under-estimate, then there must be <Col N="653" /> much greater courage and foresight displayed in tackling the problem than are envisaged in this year's Budget. Apparently the Minister for Finance is not going to go quickly.  He confessed in his Budget statement that he was opposed to and abhorred Fascism, State Socialism and Totalitarianism. He declared his abhorrence of these economic theses, and went on to record himself as one who believed in the soundness of private enterprise as the sole basis of our prosperity in the past and apparently the sole basis of our inspiration in the future.  I wonder whether Deputy Cooney believes in that doctrine, whether he believes that it is on private enterprise, on unrestrained <i>laissez faire</i> private enterprise, that the future prosperity of this country is going to be based.  The Minister now tells us that, so far as he is concerned as the person responsible for the raising of the money, he believes that the future prosperity of this country is going to be based on private enterprise.  His policy apparently is: let the individual with the money plan our industrial and our agricultural development; let the nation's prosperity be related to the willingness of persons to invest money in industry, and let the sole temptation to develop our industries, to plan our industrial and agricultural development, be based on such schemes of development, related, as they must be, to the consideration by those who are investing their money in them to the return which they are likely to get for the money invested.  The sole basis of our industrial and agricultural development, our whole planning for the nation as conceived by the Minister for Finance, is that private enterprise is going to be asked by an appeal to its avarice to develop our industries and our agriculture, and generally to plan the economic and national life of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks that prosperity is going to flow from a scheme of development of that nature.  If private enterprise is the wonderful thing that the Minister for Finance tells us it is, if it is going to supply that prosperity and the inspiration for the future that the Minister for Finance believes, will he tell us why we have had, under <Col N="654" /> private enterprises in an uncontrolled form, the appalling unemployment, poverty and destitution which the State has had to grapple with by means of special ameliorative Acts of Parliament?  Because these evils are the legacies of the private enterprise which the Minister for Finance, apparently, thinks so highly of to-day.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we are to have development in the future solely by private enterprise.  There is to be no utilisation of the State's resources to plan our industrial and agricultural development. The appeal is to be to the private individual to invest his money and to the advocates of private enterprise to get on with the job of developing industry and agriculture, hoping that the return which they are likely to get will be of a kind to induce them to invest.  The whole tariff policy during the past two years has had a decided turn in the same direction. There has been a disposition to allow private enterprise in the field of industrial development to extract, through the medium of tariffs, profits which they are not justified in exacting, especially at a time when the nation subjects itself to certain hardships and inconveniences to assist in the development of industry.  We have to-day, as a result of hundreds of years of alien misrule, a neglected and relatively undeveloped country, the industrial possibilities of which have, so far, been barely scratched.  Obviously, if we are to get astride of the development which has taken place in other countries, we cannot start here by the same process and proceed at the same rate as other countries undertook their industrial development.  Starting very much behind other countries, we must learn by their mistakes.  We must profit by their experience and we must do something to take a short-cut towards that stage of industrial development which other countries have already reached.  The Minister for Finance wants us to take a slow road, a sluggish road, a road which is not marked by prosperity for the people, but which is often marked by prosperity for those who exploited the people's needs.  That is the road the Minister for Finance will have <Col N="655" /> us travel towards a certain stage of industrial development. With our agricultural and industrial possibilities undeveloped in many spheres, we must, if we are to advance, utilise the full power of the State in the form of its capacity to create credit, to impose tariffs and restrictions and to organise the machinery for the exploitation of our industrial possibilities.  If we are not going to take that road, if we are not going to utilise the creative power of industrial development for our people, if, instead, we are going to rely on the puny efforts of private enterprise, then I rather think that our industrial development is much further off than the Minister for Industry and Commerce in these Olympian moments of his would have us believe.  In the present complex condition of life and industry, when the utilisation of our country's resources is imperative, if we are going to ensure to the people the necessaries of civilised life, if we are going to provide our people with employment by creating wealth for the nation, we should be willing to utilise any and every form of organisation which is capable of creating more wealth for the nation and which is capable of exploiting for the nation the undeveloped resources which have not been and, obviously, will not be exploited by private enterprise alone.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister for Finance looks like a retracing of its footsteps by the Government, from the standpoint of its large-scale scheme of national development.  The despairing language used by the Minister, the apparent recognition by him that unemployment is to be always with us, and his advocacy of private enterprise to provide the motive power for industrial and agricultural expansion, seem to me to betoken less radical thought so far as national planning is concerned than I ever heard uttered by a Fianna Fáil spokesman in the past or ever heard in any Fianna Fáil Budget in the past.  This Budget, from the standpoint of the approach to the big problem of unemployment, from the standpoint of the way in which it distributes the burdens is a clear indication <Col N="656" /> that the Government&mdash;if the Minister for Finance speaks for them&mdash; has now become timid and timorous and now bids fair, with one or two more Budgets of this kind, to stand side by side with the last Government, so that few will recognise them unless they read their early utterances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke of tariffs and was disposed to chide the Labour Party in respect of the views it has expressed on that question.  I believe that the imposition of tariffs is necessary if you are going to protect your industries from the competition which they experience from other countries&mdash; competition often based on unfair conditions of labour in these countries, often based on years and years of scientific progress in these countries, and often based on the utilisation of enormous capital resources, capable of not merely selling an article more cheaply than we can produce it, but even capable of preventing us from selling an article here at the actual price at which we could produce it.  If we are to have any industrial development, and if this country is not going to be a permanent Emerald Isle, the greenness of which everybody can admire, even if he is hungry, we must ensure that tariffs as one of the agencies for protecting industries are utilised to enable our industries to compete with those highly capitalised institutions which exist in other countries.  As I said before, tariffs alone will not cure unemployment. The mere production here of all the things we need will not produce the prosperity some people imagine it will. The United States are capable of supplying all their own home requirements in about seven months but that fact has not ensured prosperity for the American worker.  We still have the amazing spectacle of from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 unemployed in that country. The mere imposition of tariffs and the mere production of all that we need will not give this country any greater measure of prosperity than the same steps gave other countries. Tariffs, quotas and restrictions, without the support of a planned national life, will not give this country a prosperity that some people fondly imagine they will.  My view is that <Col N="657" /> the mere imposition of tariffs, without a planned national economy, will give this country not the prosperity which some people think but such a measure of disillusionment as has already overtaken many other countries which formerly thought upon the same lines.</P>
    <P>Here we have in this country a relatively undeveloped State.  It must be the task of the Government, acting on behalf of the whole community, to ensure that the resources of the State are exploited with the utmost expedition in the most thoroughgoing way, and in a manner which is capable of using the creative genius and craft and brawn of our people so as to create new sources of wealth for the nation, and, at the same time, to provide employment for the unemployed people of the nation.  If we had waited for private enterprise to develop the Shannon scheme, many generations of Irishmen and women would have passed on.  The State there realised that private enterprise could not be depended upon to develop the Shannon scheme, and that gigantic engineering feat, with the national advantages which have flowed from it, was undertaken by the State, because of the recognition that private enterprise was incapable or unwilling to undertake the task.</P>
    <P>If the State undertakes a scheme of that kind, or finds it necessary to undertake a scheme of that kind, various other schemes, no less important in the life of the nation, must also be undertaken by the State and exploited by the State.  It is only by the utilisation of that and every other form of creating wealth for the nation and employment for its people that it is possible for us to foresee the day when our people will have that measure of reasonable prosperity which civilisation in 1936 makes possible for each and every one of us, if we only have the capacity to organise and distribute the resources of the country on some greater basis of equity than exists to-day.</P>

I suggest it was never easier to produce goods than it is to-day, that the enormous increase in the world's productivity has released new forces of wealth creation and there is available to-day for the people an abundance formerly undreamt of and an abundance inconceivable 100 or 50 years ago.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I do suggest to Deputy MacDermot that, in a world choked with goods, in a world in which the machines fill the granaries and store-houses at a greater pace than ever before, in a world in which there is a plenitude formerly undreamt of, it ought not to be beyond the wit of man to devise, in relation to the special problems in each country, the distribution of those goods and services in such a way as to ensure that everybody will share in that national heritage of productivity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true, because of a variety of circumstances, not the least prominent of which is the apparent unwillingness on the part of large masses of the people to realise that they are living to-day in an era when poverty is an absurdity and when there is such production of goods available as to render that poverty an absolute crime against bountiful Providence. We are living to-day, not in an era of scarcity.  We are living in an era of prosperity, of abundance, and the apparent unwillingness of large masses of the people to realise that they have left scarcity, and are now in an era of abundance, makes the <Col N="659" /> task of those who want to create that new social order the more difficult. However, that is a matter which I do not mind debating with Deputy MacDermot elsewhere, if he thinks there is sufficient public interest in a scheme of that kind.</P>

      <P>The remarks which I have just made in reply to Deputy MacDermot's interjection might as appropriately be applied to the Minister for Finance.  He still thinks we are living in an era of scarcity, in an era of difficulty, in an era when it is not possible to give to the people the abundance which is theirs, if only that abundance were organised and distributed on some equitable basis to those who are clamouring for the commodities they are unable to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this Budget is a conservative Budget.  One family in the British House of Commons has a long tradition of providing Chancellors of the Exchequer and these were regarded as the highwater mark of conservative thought in the matter of how to tax people.  I suggest that when that family peruses the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance and reads those declarations of his on economic thought, they will have no hesitation in realising that their supremacy in the world of conservative Budgets is being seriously challenged by the Minister for Finance in the Irish Free State.  I think it is a conservative Budget.  I think it does not display any of the radical, or even revolutionary, thought which the Minister for Finance at one time indulged in and I hope, for the sake of the future development of the country, for the sake of the prosperity of unemployed persons, the line of thought underlying this Budget will not be persisted in as the Government's sole hope in the matter of industrial development, in the matter of the prosperity of our people, and in the matter of giving to the community those essentials of a civilised existence, food, clothing and shelter.  I cannot see that many of the unemployed will get them under the work <Col N="660" /> provisions of this Budget, and I hope that a realisation of the puny efforts which are made here, and of the unworkability of the scheme as envisaged by the Minister for Finance, will induce the Government to take their courage in their hands, to get rid of the conservatism of which this Budget reeks and to realise that, in a changing world, where the seeming economic insanity of yesterday becomes the sanity of to-day, they must display more courage in dealing with the vast problems which must be dealt with in this country, particularly after generations of alien neglect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that those of us who have been waiting for the past week to hear the attitude of the Labour Party on the Budget must have been rather disappointed by Deputy Norton's speech. I listened to a speech on the radio by a Labour representative which was certainly more concise than Deputy Norton's, but, in regard to both of them, I do not think we are anything the wiser in our effort to secure illumination as to how these vast problems to which Deputy Norton vaguely refers are going to be tackled and how they can be tackled more effectively and more speedily than under the schemes which the present Government has put forward.  I sometimes almost imagine that, in the lack of enthusiasm which the Labour Party displays towards these Budgets, which I think we can all admit make very substantial provision indeed for social services and for relief of the poor, they have at the back of their minds the feeling that the Government are perhaps doing a little more than they should, but that, lest there be any fear that the Government should be tempted in any way to cut down these services, it would be unwise to praise them warmly for what they have done.  Nevertheless, at the risk of eulogising the Minister for Finance or the Government in an extravagant manner for the work that has been done in regard to improved social services under the present Government, I think the House would have been entitled to some appreciative remarks from the Leader of the Labour Party in regard to this matter. <Col N="661" /> It seems rather strange that when the annual accounts are being made up and the very substantial sum of £3,600,000 is being provided for social services in excess of what was provided some years ago, the Leader of the Labour Party does not think it worth while to refer to that matter. In fact his speech is strangely lacking in any reference to the question of social services.</P>
      <P>I think that there were certain definite and well-marked features about the Budget, and perhaps it would not be too much to deduce from the lack of attention these features have got from the Leader of the Labour Party, that the country considers they are satisfactory features of the annual statement.  In the first place, there is an abolition of the restrictions and of the organisation that had to be set up to deal with the special difficulties in the cattle trade and to endeavour to deal in a drastic manner&mdash;even though that machinery was rather difficult to administer&mdash;with the cattle position.  It must be a relief to the country, and I am quite sure that it is, to find that we are abolishing these restrictions to a very large extent.  One of the reasons why we have been able to do that is because there has been an improvement in the cattle trade and valuable recuperation has been thereby given to the agricultural community.  Then, although the Minister for Finance has been able to grant substantial remissions in taxation in the shape of a reduction in the sugar duty and otherwise, and also an increase in the marriage allowances accorded to income-tax payers, I think it is a matter for congratulation, and it must be a matter of surprise to a great many critics, that at the same moment that the Minister for Finance has been able to hand out these concessions to the income-tax payers he has also been able to set up an Unemployment Fund.  Deputies will understand that I need not refer to the abolition of the coal duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand Deputies saying that the Employment Fund is not in itself going to abolish unemployment in this country.  I can understand Deputies asking how exactly are the Government going to <Col N="662" /> spend this money, or is it quite certain they are going to spend it in the best way.  Would it not be better to improve the social services than to spend large sums of money on public works when we know in regard to some of these very big works where a great deal of technical provision has to be made, that only a very small portion of the money goes to labour? It has been found in regard to big schemes of an engineering character which might be undertaken, and which would run into millions of pounds, that not more than 40 per cent. of the money would go to the provision of labour.  The rest of the expenditure would go to the provision of machinery, to payments to technical experts, and so on.  In any case, the big fact is that a good deal less than half the money would be spent in the actual payments to labourers.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed, therefore, from the Labour Benches an analysis of that question&mdash;whether it might not be better to spend more money in social services, improving unemployment assistance and so on rather than embark on a public works scheme which everybody who has studied the question knows has various disadvantages. I have referred to one of them &mdash;the fact that the labour content in highly technical and highly organised undertakings is small.  There are other disadvantages, too, namely, that you may not be able to organise and carry out these works where they are most required&mdash;for example, along the Western seaboard, where there is a great increase in our population at the present time, and where we would be very anxious to give special facilities and to make special provision.  It is almost impossible to devise schemes which will give employment over a long time to large bodies of men, which at the same time will give an economic return to the country and which are not works which would have to be undertaken in the ordinary way. Naturally we do not wish to provide money for the local authorities for works which would have to be undertaken in the ordinary way.  If we are going to make a special effort to deal with the unemployment problem we have to try to see that the additional <Col N="663" /> schemes which we will provide are schemes of the kind which would not be undertaken in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>These are the questions that are facing the Government, and we know that in many countries there are differences of opinion on these matters.  For example, in Great Britain they seem many years ago to have definitely turned down the idea of endeavouring to reduce unemployment by very substantial public works. Of course at the present time they are dealing with works of another character and spending vast sums of money. But we know that in Great Britain there has been a definite conclusion come to that State works are not the way to deal with the problem.  In other countries we have movements which suggest that the aim is not the reduction of unemployment, but the provision of an increased income for the consumer to see that he will be able to purchase: that the effort to deal with the economic problem from the point of view of providing employment is not going to succeed and that the proper way is to tackle it from the angle of the consumer. I would be very glad to hear the views of the Labour Party and to hear what their policy is in regard to that matter.  They have not put forward any policy.  I think that the language of the Leader of the Labour Party certainly displayed a lack of vision and imagination in regard to the unemployment problem.  He referred to it as an &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; problem, and he spoke of the &ldquo;despairing language&rdquo; in which the Minister for Finance referred to it.  I am not aware that the Minister for Finance referred to the unemployment question in despairing language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government came into office they have not shirked the unemployment figures.  They have gone out of their way to permit persons who would not be normally classed as unemployed&mdash;in the sense that they were seeking for work&mdash;to become registered.  We know, and it has been reiterated sufficiently in this House, <Col N="664" /> that the great majority of the persons who are registered as unemployed are either land-holders or the sons of land-holders. It may surprise those who criticise the Government, because of the size and the magnitude of the figures in the register of unemployment, as they were some months ago, that 66 per cent. of those who were registered as such were living in rural areas and in addition to living in rural areas were scheduled as having means. The means that they have may be small.  We all know what the conditions are in the congested districts and along the Western seaboard, but the fact is that they are in a somewhat different category to the person we consider as an unemployed person in a town or city.  If we take the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter, and I think it is a perfectly sensible and commonsense attitude, what is the kernel of this problem?  The kernel of it is that you have about 40,000 that you can describe as being really unemployed and looking for work and if we could put, as he says, these 40,000 into employment, if we did not completely solve the unemployment problem we would at least have broken the backbone of it.  In fact, if the Government, by the provisions it has made during the present year, can reach a figure in the neighbourhood of 20,000 extra persons being put into employment during the coming season, I have no doubt whatever it will mean that we have reached about half the persons who really form the kernel of this question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has frequently referred to the Government's lack of imagination, lack of constructive policy and so on, although he has been told there are many Government Departments that are working at full pressure and it would only mean employing extra staffs, staffs that in fact are not always easy to obtain, because you want, in matters connected with public works, to have men of technical competence and experience.  For example, the Deputy has frequently told the House and the country that our schools are in a shocking condition, and are worse than in any other country in Europe. I challenge that statement.  I say that there is no foundation whatever <Col N="665" /> for it.  Our schools can compare favourably with the schools in any other part of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pluming myself on the fact that I have told the representatives of the managers that if they want more help for the building of schools they can have it, and they have told me that they do not want any more help.  Our organisation in the Board of Works is doing its utmost to carry out the programme of expending £200,000 a year on the building of national schools.  The figure before the present Government came into office was something in the neighbourhood of £100,000.  It is forgotten that in connection with that matter, which I may take as an example, you have a great number of preliminaries in the acquisition of land, the vesting, and the preparation of plans, and so on. Sometimes the preliminaries before the work can be put in hands take up to two years, even with the best goodwill on both sides.  If there is any neglect it may take a longer time. <Col N="666" /> I have taken the question of the schools as an example of the uninformed criticism that is heard in relation to the Government's efforts, and as an example also of the fact that, in regard to our organisation for the building of schools, we have done the most we can do under present circumstances. The same applies to other matters.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken made no reference to the housing problem and the efforts the Government have made to deal with it.  If he were challenged on the question, he would have to admit that we have made a very good show indeed, and have a policy that compares favourably with the policies in other countries. As the Minister pointed out in his Budget statement, out of a total loan of about £4,000,000 that has been made from the Local Loans Fund for slum clearances, it is estimated that at least 65 or 66 per cent. of £3,500,000 of that sum will have to be borne by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the Exchequer asset to which the Minister was referring in his earlier statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of speaking; I am not here to be cross-examined by him.  The total State contribution to housing is estimated to be £5,370,000 and in addition to that, in connection with loans made by the Dublin Corporation and so on, the State has an additional liability the capital value of which is estimated at £1,570,000.  Why should not the leader of the Labour Party give credit where credit is due and say that if there is any deficiency in that matter it certainly is not on the Government's part; it certainly is not because of any lack of goodwill on our part to make available the greatest provision we can and the necessary organisation.  Very often, as in the case of the school buildings to which I have referred, there are matters outside the control of the Government that prevent us going ahead with building as quickly as we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy finds fault with the figure of £2,500,000 of which the State <Col N="667" /> is putting up £1,675,000 for this Employment Fund, I will point to the fact that the Land Commission and the Forestry Department are working at a rate never known before in this country.  The Land Commission are dividing land and carrying on activities at about three times the rate made in our predecessors' time.  The same applies to the afforestation branch. We are spending £1,500,000 this year on the acquisition and division of land, and over £600,000 of that is going to be spent on the improvement of estates, all going into rural areas. In connection with afforestation, about £142,000 will be spent on actual cultural operations.  All that money is going into rural areas.  The Deputy finds fault with the Minister for assuming that on that basis of £2,500,000 he is going to save £500,000 by way of unemployment assistance.  Is it not perfectly reasonable and legitimate for the Minister for Finance to take a figure that is agreed upon among economists and treasuries, that at least 20 per cent. of the expenditure will be saved in unemployment assistance? I think there can be no question whatever but that if, as we hope, the full £2,500,000 will be spent during the coming year, the Exchequer will certainly benefit to the extent of £500,000 saved on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the ratepayers will pay £800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the ratepayers will pay £800,000 I would like to point out that the ratepayers are getting very substantial sums in support of local services.  They are getting very substantial assistance in regard to housing, in regard to public health works and any proposal the public authorities, generally speaking, put up for consideration which would tend to reduce unemployment and would be regarded as a beneficial work is carefully considered and we give assistance. We are only asking the local authorities to give the same measure of assistance in regard to this special Employment Fund as we ask them to give on other works.  If the Deputy takes up the attitude that the Government should simply hand out the whole <Col N="668" /> of the money for local benefit and not ask for any local contribution, I must submit on the other hand, that we are fully entitled to ask local authorities to put up a substantial local contribution. Apart from that, I submit that it is their duty to see that the money is spent economically and that it is not spent foolishly and that we get a good return for it.  It is the duty of local authorities to take a definite, active interest in these matters and to see that any schemes that are undertaken are proper reproductive schemes.  I repeat that we are fully entitled to ask them to put up a substantial local contribution.</P>
      <P>Besides, the value of this money spent in the local areas certainly benefits business.  We have heard business men say constantly that when substantial programmes of work are put into operation it is for the good of trade.  It sets the wheels of business going and in turn induces enterprise. That creates a feeling of optimism and an upper trend at a time when it is particularly necessary, and at a season when there might not be very much activity in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Deputy's idea.  Deputy Norton, also dealt at great length with the fact that tariffs will not cure unemployment. I am not aware that the present Government said tariffs would cure unemployment.  What the Government said is that, so far as they can, in the interests of keeping Irish money at home, which hitherto had gone abroad to support the purchase of foreign manufactured goods, we are prepared, whenever any reasonable case is made by a manufacturer or entrepreneur, who is prepared to produce articles in this country, and sell them at a reasonable price and of good quality, to grant him protection <Col N="669" /> in the Irish market. In respect to the vast bulk of articles protected in this country&mdash;boots for instance&mdash;there is sufficient competition, in the home market, as between one manufacturer and another to ensure that the price is kept at a reasonable figure.  It has been demonstrated that in the case of some of these articles so manufactured and protected the manufacturers have been as efficient as in any country in the world.</P>
      <P>The Government has adopted the policy of providing protection for Irish industry and has made it a foremost plank in their programme.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has certainly not shown himself backward in accepting suggestions as to what can be done in that direction.  When one reads, if Deputies ever do read, the list of imports into this country, and compares the figures as to the value of these goods now as compared with four or five years ago, one will be astonished at the number and range of commodities we are producing at home at the present time.  It certainly is not the policy of the Government to allow industrialists to profiteer at the expense of the community, or to allow persons who receive protection from the State to give poor value or to try to enforce unfair conditions of labour upon their employees.  We have shown that is not our policy.  We have introduced legislation, and will introduce further legislation, to ensure that our policy will be carried into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also had qualms about private enterprise.  We have had one example of State enterprise, on a large scale, in this country, in connection with the Electricity Supply Board.  If the Deputy can derive consolation from the way that enterprise is working out to show that State enterprise is a more economic and valuable method, from the point of view of labour, then I must say I have not the same opinion.  I believe that in a country which, as the Deputy stressed, is somewhat lacking in industry, and where there is not any great industrial tradition we have to proceed with the assistance of other people in the beginning. We have, unfortunately, to proceed <Col N="670" /> with the assistance of foreigners in many instances.  But the time will come when the need for foreigners will be eliminated, when our own young men will be sufficiently trained and equipped, and have sufficient experience, to enable them to fill every position in the Irish industrial field.  I think that private enterprise, as instanced by some of the big enterprise in the City of Dublin has not shown itself to be deficient in any way so far as their treatment of their employees or their social attitude is concerned.  On the contrary I think they are perhaps in front of manufacturers elsewhere.  I think that, on the whole, they have a broader outlook, and what is more that they do their business efficiently.  In the case of the State, undoubtedly State socialisation would be an advantage so far as putting a very large number of people into employment as officials in the administration and control of industries is concerned; but, personally, I, at any rate, would think that before we attempted any experiments in that connection we should be absolutely satisfied that it is for the benefit of the community, and for the benefit of the whole community.  If the Government are satisfied, at any time, that in regard to any particular industry it is essential that there should be State control, and that it is in the best interests of the community that there should be that control, they will not hesitate to set up some special organisation such as that in connection with electricity or sugar to see that the State has direct control over the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred also to the fact that we were taxing the consumer in this Budget.  I am sorry to say he did not refer to the question of the cost of living which we often read about in the daily newspapers. We know that there used to be a great cry against our protection policy, and that the general policy of the Government was forcing up the cost of living.  If the cost of living is sometimes forced up as in circumstances such as at present, perhaps in order to benefit the agricultural community, it is because certain <Col N="671" /> steps have to be taken that result in an increased price to the consumer. If we are satisfied that the agricultural producer is not getting sufficient return, and if by taking such steps, as in the case of the creamery industry, where we give the farmer an enhanced price for his produce, and if the increased cost is not going into the hands of the middleman but is going substantially and so far as is reasonable, into the pockets of the farmer, then the Government would feel fully justified&mdash;I think it would be their policy, where they were satisfied that the agricultural industry demanded it, even at the expense of a rise in the cost of living, to do that.  But in spite of what has been done in regard to the butter industry and to the numerous articles of agriculture and industry that had been protected, and in regard to the supplies of which we have to depend upon our own resources, it is certainly most satisfactory that in regard to the period 1931 to 1935 there has been an actual reduction in the cost of food during the present year as compared with the year 1931.  In regard to the cost of living generally, including all the items in the cost-of-living index, there has also been a reduction as between February, 1931, and February, 1936.</P>
    <P>That shows that in spite of the great efforts the Government have made to retain the home market for the home producer, we are in the very satisfactory position that, according to the cost-of-living figure, we are better off than in 1931, and, at the same time, we are keeping very many million pounds in this country which we are formerly sending out to foreign manufacturers, and thousands upon thousands of our own people employed.  The fact that we are doing that has been no doubt responsible for the extraordinary buoyancy and resilience in the revenue.  The Minister for Finance actually had to admit that even his most competent and expert advisers were surprised that, after an increase in taxation had been added to certain commodities there was still an increase in <Col N="672" /> consumption.  There must be a very general and very substantial improvement in the people's economic condition when the consumption of articles, in regard to which it was well known up to the present that even a slight increase in price reduced the consumption, has not been reduced, but has actually been increased.  If Deputies opposite can show that that is the result in some way of the wretched economic condition that they tell us the country and the people have been reduced to, then I hope we shall listen to them patiently.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken referred to income tax.  The Minister for Finance is the person responsible for the national finance and for seeing that we shall be able to pay for all these social services, for this employment fund which has been set up, and for all the other multifarious and increased activities that are going on under the Government.  I should have thought it would not be necessary to suggest, if there was a way in which substantial moneys could be got, even by increased taxation, that the Minister would be slow, if he found it necessary, to avail himself of it.  The Deputy talked a great deal about the income tax.  Income tax in this country compares very favourably, as far as the burden on the taxpayer is concerned, with the income tax across the water, the wealthiest country, I suppose, except one, possibly the wealthiest in the world.  I would remind the Deputy that there is a point beyond which if you continue to increase taxation you will certainly and inevitably have a decreased yield.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister found himself in the satisfactory position that he actually got in substantially more income tax and surtax than he had bargained for.  His Budget Estimate was £5,005,000, but the actual yield was £5,208,000 as compared with £4,868,000 in the preceding year. There was an increase of £340,000 in the income tax, an increase in the corporation profits tax and also an increase in estate duties.  There is no proof whatever that, if income tax were to be further increased this year, <Col N="673" /> this very satisfactory position of an increasing return would continue.  It is quite possible, I think, if not probable, that quite the opposite would result, and that if the Minister found it necessary to increase income tax this year he would not be faced with the pleasant prospect of a still increasing return from income tax during the coming year.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy refers to the tax upon consumers, I have simply to remind him, as he has often before been reminded in this House, that since only a small proportion of our people are sufficiently wealthy to pay income-tax, surtax, excess profits duty, and so on, it stands to reason that our whole requirements in finance cannot be got from these sources, and that we have to tax the consumer.  The consumer is taxed in every other country as well as here.  If it is stated that he is mulcted too severely, I say that the consumer, if we mean the poor person in the country who has to pay taxation on sugar, tea and tobacco, has to put up with that by reason of the fact that portion of the money that is necessary for the social services which are being provided for his benefit has to be obtained from these sources, because it cannot be obtained elsewhere.  Last year there was an actual reduction in the amount which the Minister expected to receive from tea.  Instead of getting the amount he estimated for he got something slightly less.</P>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House by repeating to some extent what I have said about the social services and showing that as against the taxation on consumers' goods, which the consuming public have to pay, they are getting very substantial benefits indeed, benefits that are at least as good as, if not better than, the consumer are getting in other countries comparable to this.  I think that it is quite absurd, and scarcely demands reference, that the Leader of the Labour Party should say that the Minister for Finance brought in this Budget to please his opponents, and that he should quote the remarks in some organ of Irish opinion complimenting the Minister on the Budget.  It simply shows that there are very intelligent people writing for that newspaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Last year, and on other occasions, when it has been absolutely necessary to put on taxation, he has done it and the Government have supported him.  He has had to face the country on that question, as he faced it last year.  On that occasion he was able to explain that you could not derive all the income you required from income-tax, that you had to go to other sources.

      <P>I think we have reason to congratulate ourselves this year that we have been able to continue and intensify the activities commenced during the past three years.  We have been able to carry them on at a high pitch of activity during the present <Col N="675" /> year.  We have been able to make allowance for entirely new services of considerable magnitude.  We have been able to set up this employment fund, and at the same time we have been able to give substantial remissions in taxation.  I do not think that the representatives of Labour need be discouraged.  I think they should be very well pleased indeed at the fact that the Minister, instead of giving possibly further remissions in taxation, has put very substantial sums aside to provide for the relief of unemployment. He has had a committee working for a long period&mdash;nearly two years, I think&mdash;examining most carefully what schemes there are that can be undertaken profitably by the Government, that will give a good return to the nation, and will also give a good return in providing employment.  This year he is going to undertake a very substantial programme that has been suggested and recommended by the committee.  Whether the programme, as I said in the beginning, is sufficient, or whether it is in every detail the right programme, may be argued, but at any rate credit must be given to the Minister for having made a very substantial beginning upon a policy which, if it can be continued during succeeding years, will certainly mean that the resources of the State will be thrown into this battle against unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very substantial sums will be provided for State works, and therefore we will be combating the evil in two ways.  We will be providing social services on a very big scale, and to an extent that I think compares very favourably with what is being done in other countries, and that certainly is the maximum we can do according to our resources.  We are also starting on this public works programme, and if the Labour Party wishes to encourage the Minister and encourage the Government, I suggest that their efforts would be better directed to an examination of those schemes, to seeing whether they are the best schemes that can be provided, and whether from the labour point of view they can give the best return.  I do not think, a Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, <Col N="676" /> that it is necessary to deal with any further points.</P>

The Minister for Education congratulated himself that, although heavy tariffs had been imposed, the cost-of-living figure had not risen materially since Fianna Fáil came into office.  I want to direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to this matter.  The cost-of-living figure consists of the price of foodstuffs, agricultural produce, and certain other commodities.</P>

      <P>I cannot make the Minister speak.  The cost-of-living figure in 1931 was 160.  In February, 1936, it was 159.  It has remained stationary and consists of the price of foodstuffs, the price of clothing, and certain other items.  The cost of agricultural produce, as set out in page eight of the quarterly statistical bulletin of the Currency Commission, issued in April, 1936, was 110 in 1931.  To-day it is 83. The cost of agricultural produce has fallen by 37 points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Section 2, to add at the end of subsection (1) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(d) any person who had been cutting and selling turf before the first day of December, 1935.&mdash;(John M. O'Sullivan).</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 1, Sir, I do not know whether the Minister has made any reply to the argument put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan on this subject.  Deputy O'Sullivan made a claim that this section was going to interfere seriously with the income of a large number of people whose domestic economy was based on the fact that they cut and sold turf in certain quantities and that, in many cases, a very considerable quantity of the turf cut by these people was sold in their own neighbourhood through the year, and particularly in their local towns.  The proposal in the section would mean that that trade is going to be cut away from ordinary turf cutters.  Any person who buys coal in any small town in an appointed area is going to be forced to buy a certain quantity of approved turf.  The approved turf will be turf that has been bought from one of the co-operative societies.  The Minister has not, as far as I know, made any attempt to show how a turf cutter who has had that particular type of income is going to retain it.  It was pointed out to the Minister that co-operative societies have not in any way shown themselves to be an improvement in respect to the turf industry. In five counties, Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry, where they had half the total of the co-operative societies, two-thirds of the total distribution of sacks, and in which up to December 31st last £37,924 were spent on relief works in improving access to the bogs, the result of the work of half the societies, with two-thirds of the sacks and more than one-third of the <Col N="680" /> money, was a reduction in the quantity of turf cut in the last year of which we have information by 242,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out to the Minister that while he is not able to give the quantity of turf cut in 1934, he has provided figures to show that the carriage of turf by the railway companies and on the canals decreased in 1935, and that the purchase of turf by public offices in the City of Dublin, which was by far the greater part of the purchases from co-operative societies, and through the board, had fallen compared to 1934, and that it had fallen in 1934 as against 1933.  The Ministerial Press has indicated that this Bill is introduced to make compulsory a scheme which had proved highly successful when tried in a voluntary way.  I should like to hear from the Minister what type of success it had shown.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to secure that the ordinary turf cutter who earned a living, either whole or in part, by cutting and selling turf will not be excluded by the passage of Section 2 in its present form. I pointed out that the section in the form in which it now is would endeavour to collar all the selling of turf for co-operative societies; that the outstanding manifestation in these counties where these societies had been developed had been a very big falling off in the amount of turf drawn from the bogs.</P>

      <P>I submit that I am in order, and that argument would be futile if it hid the fact that the section we propose to amend sought to gather all that local sale of turf in an appointed area, into the hands of co-operative societies, and that the work of these societies in the past, in the areas in which they exist, had been marked by a falling off in the cutting of turf.  That is the simple background. The important thing in the amendment is that we seek to secure to the ordinary turf cutter the income and the work he had in the past.  We have heard nothing on the subject from the Minister, and we are anxious to hear why he cuts out from the profitable work of cutting and selling of turf, people who made it part of their livelihood in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see in this House at the moment Deputy Victory, Deputy Jordan and Deputy Hugh Doherty, three Fianna Fáil Deputies from turf-cutting areas, to whom I put this question: do they approve of a proposal which will prevent small farmers in their constituencies from selling such turf as they are in a position to save on the bogs annexed to their holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 2, as usual enshrined under subterfuge, because we are told that all that section is designed to do is to make certain persons an &ldquo;approved source.&rdquo;  The argument is that it is not designed to stop anyone selling turf.  Everyone realises that if you make certain restricted bodies an &ldquo;approved source&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill, in the specified area, all turf must be and will be bought from them.  A great many people will buy coal who require it, and who do not want turf. Under the terms of the Bill they will be forced to buy turf and they will either have to bury it or to burn it. If they do not burn it themselves they will dispose of it to neighbours, who <Col N="682" /> will dispose of it at whatever price they can get to order to have it taken out of yards and kitchens.  That will operate to prevent the casual vendor, who goes through the streets of a town with a crib of turf, and waits for someone to come up and ask the price, and buy it. Deputy Victory spoke on the Second Reading and on the Money Resolution, and being, as he is, an experienced man in the light of rural Ireland, he said turf was a side-line to the agricultural community.  The Deputy was perfectly right.  It is a side line, and it may make all the difference between living on the verge of starvation, or in a modest degree of prosperity, for a man who has a poor holding and a fair bit of turbary attached to it, if he could send one or two of the boys to save turf in the summer for sale on the streets.  Does Deputy Victory want to stop that man from having that source of income?  If he does not, he must vote for an amendment which schedules that man as an &ldquo;approved source.&rdquo; That is all the amendment is designed to do, to ensure that the very persons Deputy Victory referred to when speaking on the Money Resolution, will be allowed to continue selling turf as they sold it in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever consider the question of having briquettes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What reaction has the question of briquettes on this?  By Section 2 we are asked to give the Minister the right to prohibit anyone selling turf for the purposes of this Bill unless he is an &ldquo;approved source.&rdquo; Sales of turf by an ordinary farmer will not fulfil the requirements of purchasers of coal.  We are asking that farmers of the type described by Deputy Victory will be put in the same position as co-operative societies, as the board or a limited company dealing in briquettes.  Surely that is a reasonable proposal.  If what Deputy Victory said on the Money Resolution was true, I have no hesitation in saying that this is a very necessary precaution to take. Surely Deputy Jordan and Deputy Hugh Doherty will tell us in respect of Loughrea and Dunloe whether they are in favour of putting a small farmer with <Col N="683" /> a bit of turbary who sells turf in towns off the streets.  If they are not in favour of that, will they explain why they refuse to support this amendment, which does not seek to put such a farmer into any preferential position, does seek to exempt him from the provisions of this Bill, but merely seeks to provide that this Bill will not be used to deprive him of a livelihood upon which he has depended in the past and upon which he must depend in future if he is to be spared from real hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Minister's Bill and the Minister can make provision for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's Bill and it is the duty of the Minister to safeguard the interest of the community from every point of view. Suppose he does not make provision for the inspection of that turf, I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind that, in connection with the co-operative society, the briquette company and the board, the Minister purports to guarantee the quality of the turf. In the case of the farmer for whom Deputy Victory replied and with whom Deputy Jordan and Deputy Hugh Doherty are familiar, no such guarantee exists.  That man brings his cart of turf into the town, and stands upon the hazard, seeking a price for his turf from persons who are there to examine it and to judge the condition and the quality of the turf.  They make an offer to the vendor proportionate to the quality of the turf which he has to offer.  These Deputies will confirm me when I say that you will very frequently see two carts of turf on the streets, one a cart of &ldquo;spaddagh&rdquo; and the other a cart of stone turf.  The horse cart of stone turf would command 2/- or 2/6 more than a horse cart of &ldquo;spaddagh.&rdquo; But the Minister does not purport to guarantee the quality of that turf. There is no necessity for his intervention. All the amendment seeks to provide <Col N="684" /> is that if a person brings a certificate from one of these vendors of turf, from whom he has purchased his requirements to a coal retailer, and says: &ldquo;I have bought the quantity of turf required by the Minister's order, to balance the quantity of coal I now require and in evidence of that purchase I produce the certificate of that person,&rdquo; that will be sufficient evidence to entitle him to purchase the quantity of coal which he requires from the retailer of coal, he having purchased the required quantity of turf already from the vendor of turf on the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to me not as an amendment to amend the section but an amendment asking for a new Bill.  It is perfectly obvious, if the principle of the Bill is accepted, that the amendment as proposed could not be accepted.  The amendment hits at the very root of the Bill.  It hits at standardisation.  It could not be reconciled with the proposal to guarantee the quality of the turf or to standardise the quality of the turf that is sold to the public.  Might I remind Deputy Dillon in connection with another article of Irish produce that he and his colleagues have in the past couple of years shown their impatience with the Minister for Agriculture for not bringing about, more rapidly, collective marketing?  They know what individual marketing has done in the case of butter, particularly in the matter of exports.  Do they want to create that same problem now in connection with turf, the marketing of which is in its beginnings, so to speak? Do they want to create a position where there will be eternal bickering and quarrelling about the standard of turf that is for sale, one person getting turf that is guaranteed to him and another getting turf that is not guaranteed but that is simply offered to him without anything further than the judgment of the producer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He need not take it if he does not want to.  He can pass on to another cart of turf or go to the coal retailer for his turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy will admit that there will be a gain through getting collective marketing, through <Col N="685" /> getting these small producers of turf into an association or society where their turf can be inspected and where the quality can be guaranteed?  If the whole principle of the Bill is going to have any effect, it will depend largely on that provision.  I do not think that the amendment is intended very seriously. I am surprised that Deputies opposite have not gone all out for what looks to me a much bigger flaw in this section, that is, the omission to make people like coal merchants, for instance, approved sources for turf.  It seems to me that an immense case could be made for making country coal merchants, particularly a country coal merchant who has a bog of his own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought he would not, because Deputy Moore's arguments, if they are accepted by the Minister, undoubtedly reveal a purpose on the part of the Minister that has not been revealed up to the present&mdash; that he is going to use this Bill to compel these individual turf cutters and individual suppliers of turf to come under his scheme so as to have their turf inspected.  That is the very first hint we got of that.  I was under the impression that the Minister had no such intention, but Deputy Moore says it is the very principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>To guarantee the quality to be provided by a turf-cutter who sells his turf quite voluntarily? There is no compulsion on anybody to buy turf from him.  I wish the Deputy would get that quite clear and the Minister too.  As I said upon the last day, my purpose is to secure that individual turf-cutters who come into a country town to sell, as they have done up to the present, turf, by the rail to inhabitants of the town will not be interfered with.  This is not <Col N="686" /> going to cut across the principle of the Bill.  All I want is that if a town inhabitant says: &ldquo;I shall buy my turf, as I have always bought it, from John Doody, and I want that turf to be taken into account in fixing the amount I am bound to take when I buy my coal&rdquo; his wishes will be respected. He is bound to buy so much turf, and that being so, if he is compelled to buy it from an approved source, then he must cut down the amount of turf that he has been accustomed to buy from the said John Doody.  It is to prevent that happening that this amendment is moved, and for no other purpose.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the quality of the turf.  If I am dissatisfied with the quality of the turf offered by the private individual, I can go to the coal merchant and I can take my quota of turf from him.  This turf, the Minister assures us, is guaranteed by the co-operative societies.  If I have any doubts as to the quality of the turf offered by the person from whom I have been getting it all my life, I have that course open to me.  There is no necessity for inspection of the turf that I, as an ordinary citizen, voluntarily buy. It is quite obvious from Deputy Moore's statement, if we take that as representing the mind of the Government, that a much more ambitious scheme is in prospect than the Minister gave us any idea of, that we are going to have turf standardised for everybody just as butter is standardised, though whether it is for an export trade or not was not made quite clear to me.  I understood that was one of the purposes so far as butter was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I object to is this: if this Bill is going to be seriously operated in the turf-cutting districts, in those districts that are at present turf-consuming districts, it will inevitably interfere with the particular man who depends on that to some extent for making his little farm help him to eke out an existence.  It will interfere with his trade, undoubtedly.  The Minister, I think, made it clear that large scale production and mechanisation was the purpose in view.  He gave us an example of what is being done in Russia in this particular respect.  I am <Col N="687" /> not saying that the example was not apropos.  It is quite relevant to the policy of the Minister, but I suggest that exactly the same argument could be applied to farming in general; that you could cut out small-scale individual farming on exactly the same ground, because large-scale production is more economic and more productive, and gives better scope for mechanisation.  In the very country which the Minister adduced as an example, these are the arguments and these are the reasons that have been operative in wiping out small farming, and substituting for it large-scale production with the help of mechanisation.  You are doing exactly the same thing here as regards turf.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister in almost two consecutive sentences can say, on the one hand, that you are not interfering with the trade of an individual, and then say that his market is going to be interfered with.  Of course, his market is going to be interfered with if this Bill is to be operated.  It is only on one condition that his market will not be interfered with, and that is if the Bill is not going to be operated in the turf consuming districts. But, I confess to Deputy Moore and to the House that I have never yet got from the Minister any clear idea as to where the Bill is going to be operated.</P>

I suggest that you should not interfere with the individual in that way unless you can make a case for interfering, and I am sure that the Deputy will agree with me that a case has not been made.  The Minister certainly has not attempted to make a case.  I cannot exactly follow the Deputy in treating turf as if it were butter, though, as I have said, I should not be surprised at the <Col N="688" /> Government ending up by mixing the two.  You are undoubtedly, in this case, killing the trade of the individual. Why that should be necessary the Minister has not explained.  The quality of the turf to be produced or to be supplied by the other two sources does not arise.  That is a different question altogether.  Here is a case of voluntary purchase, where the buyer determines of his own free will.  You prevent him from doing so, and, to a certain extent, you interfere with the trade of the other man.  I did not understand the reference of Deputy Victory.  I thought I would have his support for this amendment because he was the Deputy who, as I said when speaking the last day, gave me the very good phrase that turf-cutting is a sideline with many farmers.  That is precisely the case that I am making.  I suggest that the Government are going to kill that side-line. How do briquettes meet the situation?  I am sure the Deputy does not suggest that all those individual small farmers should, instead of cutting turf in the ordinary way and selling it in the neighbouring town, devote their attention to turning out briquettes.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I thoroughly agree, and the Minister says that he agrees with me, that there is no prejudice against turf in the country, People will burn it where they have been accustomed to its use or where the construction of their houses is suitable for turf burning. I do not think there is any prejudice against turf, and there the Minister, I am glad to say, agrees with me.  What I want to ensure is that they will be allowed to buy turf in the place where they have always bought it and from the man who has always gone in for turf cutting as a sideline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy O'Sullivan really put forward this amendment for the purpose that he has stated.  I do not think that he is quite as simple as he represents <Col N="689" /> himself to be.  He knows quite well that if this amendment were carried the Bill would be completely inoperative, and I submit that is the reason why he has brought it before the House.  The passage of this amendment would mean that the Bill might as well be withdrawn.  It could not be worked.  If the principle of the Bill is that, in certain circumstances and in certain areas, people may be required to use turf, then to put in the provision that they can be released from that requirement by getting a certificate from some person who had cut and sold turf before the 1st December, 1935, the whole thing would be reduced to a position in which any attempt to operate the Bill would be a complete failure.  From a purely practical point of view, therefore, it is not possible to devise any scheme by which the individual turf producer can be brought within the definition of an approved source. That is not possible, and even if it were I question whether it would be desirable.  The practical difficulty of doing so is so considerable that the matter is not worth considering further.</P>
      <P>In any event, let us consider the question whether this Bill is going to have the bad effect on individual producers, which Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon represented.  May I say that I am gratified to see the representatives of the Party opposite showing this concern for the individual turf producers, because on occasions in the past when a proposal was brought before the House to increase the use of turf in the country as a fuel they were opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy O'Leary's contention that his heart does not bleed.  In any event, they are weeping crocodile tears, and they can do it quite efficiently, for the turf <Col N="690" /> producers.  They have put forward the turf producers, and are asking our sympathy for them merely for the purpose of defeating this measure which is designed to secure a much greater use of turf as a fuel, and a much greater development in the production of turf.  Their contention, however, is that we should not attempt to organise the production of turf on a large scale, because by doing so we might act detrimentally to the interests of a limited number of small turf producers in the country.  It is not a very sensible point of view.  It would be just as sensible to ask that we should shut down all the boot factories in the country and prohibit the import of new boots, because by doing so we would give a lot more work to the cobblers.  That is precisely the argument that they are using.  Their argument is: &ldquo;Look at all the work that would be going to the boot repairing shops if all the factories were closed down and if no new boots were allowed to be imported and sold.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Sullivan says that because here and there throughout the country there are individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because in certain parts of the country there are individuals not making a livelihood out of turf, but supplementing their livelihood from some other source by producing and selling turf, that we should on that account abandon everything else, make no attempt to increase the production of turf on an organised basis, and make no attempt to secure that turf of good quality is sold on a commercial scale.  It is a very sensible point of view&mdash;about as sensible a point of view as we have had from the Party opposite on any question.  The individual turf-producer, about whom Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon pretend to be concerned, will be affected by this Bill. I am not questioning that.  To some extent he will be affected, but it will be a very, very small extent.  To make the assertion, as Deputy Dillon does, that all the turf that is going to be sold will be sold by co-operative <Col N="691" /> societies, or to make the assertion, as Deputy Mulcahy does, that the turf-cutters are going to be shut off from their present profitable business in the sale of turf is just nonsense.  The people to whom these individual turf-cutters are selling turf at the present time are, in the main, people who use turf exclusively as their fuel, or who, in so far as they do not use turf exclusively, purchase coal only in quantities of 2 cwt. or less.  There are individuals of whom that is not so.  I admit that individual turf-producers are going to be affected to some extent, but, in the main, they will not be affected at all, There is nothing in this Bill which prevents them from selling turf, nor will they be affected in fact.  They will continue to sell turf to quite a considerable extent and, in so far as we are increasing the market for turf against the opposition of the Party opposite, we are giving them a much greater chance of securing profitable employment from the sale of turf.  We are not proposing to compel them to join co-operative societies, but I think it is likely that a large number of them will join co-operative societies.  I think that it would be good business for them to do so.  But there is nothing in this Bill to compel them to do that.  In some districts it might not be possible to get co-operative societies established, but, in the turf-using areas in which this business is mainly carried on, the organisation of co-operative societies will present little difficulty to the great majority of these people.  In so far as they are not in co-operative societies already, they will certainly be so organised in a short time after the Bill comes into operation.  In due course, as the production of turf is increased and the requirements in respect of the use of turf are enlarged, the operation of the Bill will, perhaps, obtrude more extensively into the sphere of activity of those individual turf-cutters; but that is likely to be some time ahead, and, by that time, everybody will appreciate the advisability of having these people properly organised and the sale and distribution of turf conducted on commercial lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> To reiterate, the Bill is designed to increase the market for turf.  It is necessary, therefore, that we should be in a position to exercise supervision over the turf sold in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  In relation to other commodities, Deputies opposite are continuously pressing upon the Government the view that it has a responsibility for safeguarding the quality of commodities which people are required to use, in consequence of protective tariffs or other measures. The same principle applies in relation to turf.  If we put people in the position that they must use turf, there is on the Government or on the organisations acting under the Government, a responsibility to ensure that good quality turf only is available and is available in sufficient quantities.  It is not possible to exercise supervision over the quality of the turf produced by a number of individuals throughout the country but we can very effectively control the quality of turf sold by co-operative societies or by the Board. That is why, apart from any other reason, it is necessary to have that provision in the Bill.  The individual turf-cutter will not be affected to any considerable extent.  To a limited extent, in some areas, he may be affected.  In so far, however, as individual turf-cutters in the main sell turf to people who use turf exclusively, or who use coal only in small quantities, their position will not be affected in the least.  In so far as the operation of the Bill will increase the market for turf, and increase the profit to be secured from the production of turf, these people are likely to be organised in co-operative societies before long, in which case they will be able to take full advantage of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I shall come to that.  The amount is what counts.  The Minister says there would be a practical difficulty of administration in meeting our view.  That is an extraordinary statement coming from a colleague of the Minister for Agriculture, who introduced the Butter Bill and pushed it through last year.  We had there the case of the individual producer. It was a much more difficult case than the present case and the Minister's proposals were more objectionable, from the point of view of individual producers all over the country than they would be in the present case. The Minister's colleague, notwithstanding all that was said to him, had no difficulty in providing for inspection and even for inspection of a rather objectionable type&mdash;going into people's houses and rooms.  When it suits the Minister for Industry and Commerce, administrative difficulties, which he does not explain to us, present themselves and form an insuperable obstacle.</P>

The Minister says that every proposal to increase the consumption of turf which was brought before this House was opposed by this Party.  Because the Minister comes in here and says that he intends to have greater production of turf, are we to be forced to believe that the methods he is adopting will lead to greater production?  He had plenty of opportunities on the Second Reading and on the Money Resolution to controvert the figures as regards the turf production which followed his previous schemes.  Does he think that because he prophesies that measures he introduces <Col N="694" /> will lead to greater production, we are to accept that without comment? Are we to do that in the light of the experience we have had of the Minister's proposals?  He spoke of measures brought in here to increase turf production.  Has he increased turf production?  Did he increase turf production in the County Kerry in the year 1935?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was less production of turf in that county. What are the Minister's figures to show that there is increased production?  All we know is that there has been a constant diminution in turf production, so far as we can judge.  The Minister says these figures prove nothing, but he has given us no figures that controvert them.  It is not a question of comparing 1934 with 1933, but a question of comparing 1934 with 1931.  Have the Minister's efforts been so successful that he thinks any opposition to this is high treason to Irish industry?  Surely he has adopted that attitude a little too often in this House.  It is his conception of government that because he comes in here and states a thing, it must be accepted, even though the figures supplied by himself seem to point to the opposite conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all respect to the Minister, I want to preserve the man to whom he <Col N="695" /> so contemptuously refers by analogy as the cobbler in this business.  I want to preserve the rights of the cobbler. We are first told that this Bill will have no effect on the individual and that the individual is not going to be affected to any extent by its provisions.  Then we are told that he is going to be affected to some extent.  On what does the Minister base his statement that in country towns where there are ranges in most of the houses, and where turf is also burned in the other rooms, there are very few people who buy turf and coal?  I wonder on what he bases a statement of that kind.  Has it any basis whatever?  The Minister is very free with statistics.  Was there any investigation made?  Of course, there was not.  This Bill was introduced without any advertence to the effect it was going to have on the particular class of men to whom I am referring. If the Minister had taken the hint dropped by Deputy Mrs. Concannon, it might have been better, so far as turf production is concerned, than the procedure he is now adopting&mdash;to see that there is proper provision for turf burning in the houses.  That, however, is a matter which I can discuss more appropriately on another section.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the individual turf-cutter, we are told, still having turf-cutting as a sideline.  Of course, you do not prohibit it.  As the Minister says himself, you only interfere with his market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed?  You are preventing people who bought from individual turf-cutters before from buying a certain amount now. Naturally, those people are not going to buy in two lots.  They are not going to buy a rail of turf from one man and buy turf from the coal merchant on the other hand.  They will buy it all in one lot if they can.  It will seriously interfere with such individuals, and I am surprised that there is not more advertence to this danger on the Government Benches.  You are undoubtedly interfering gravely with these individuals. They may be cobblers, but there is many a man in the country whose farm is so small that he finds it difficult <Col N="696" /> enough to live on the produce of the farm alone, and this sideline, as Deputy Victory would call it, even though it is a cobbling sideline, if I may use the happy phrase of the Minister, is most useful.  It enables a man to rise above the misery line and now the Fianna Fáil Party are going to deprive him of that advantage.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy O'Sullivan has dealt with the Minister's observation that this Party has opposed every proposal for the development of turf.  I remember Deputy Hugh Doherty, who has now faded out of the House, contesting an election in County Donegal with me in 1933, and I remember expounding my difficulty in fighting for my seat in County Donegal when Deputy Doherty was going around telling the people that he proposed to turn every bog in Donegal into a gold-mine.  They were going to produce more wealth than they had ever produced before. I remember saying on that occasion: &ldquo;This is a perfectly fraudulent promise, but it is just as good as those which Senator Connolly or any of the rest of them have made.&rdquo;  Who was right?  I was, and Deputy Doherty, depending on the infallible Minister for Industry and Commerce, was proved to be wrong, because, instead of turning bogs into gold-mines, the net result of Deputy Hugh Doherty's activities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy O'Sullivan, speaking for his constituency, told of what he knows in Kerry, and I now ask leave further to rebut the Minister's misapprehension from what I know of Donegal, and to point out that he fooled poor Deputy Doherty, that he deceived poor Deputy Brady, and that he made a fool also of Deputy Doherty of Innishowen.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and his complaint now is that he did not succeed in fooling <Col N="697" /> me.  I point out that I prognosticated that his activities would do damage, and, in fact, the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce reduced the production of turf in County Donegal, as between 1931 and 1934, by 64,352 tons.  In order to achieve that result, he spent thousands of pounds, and that is the extent to which he turned the bogs of County Donegal into gold mines.  We opposed folly, and we pointed out that promises made by the Minister, and extravagances embarked upon by him, would yield no valuable results.  That is our duty in this House, and I trust we shall continue to discharge it.</P>
      <P>The Minister says this Bill is going to have no effect, or very little effect on the independent vendors of turf. Deputy O'Sullivan has indicated certain reactions which it will have upon them.  Let me suggest another reaction which this Bill is going to have on the independent vendor of turf. Under the provisions of this Bill, a person who purchases more than two cwt. of coal must buy a certain proportion of turf to be fixed by the Minister. That means that certain individuals, who do not want turf, will have to buy it, and, having bought it, they must get rid of it because it will block their yards or wherever they store it.  They will naturally go to a neighbour who ordinarily burns turf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I do not want to contest your view of the relevance of what I was saying in that regard, but I say that Deputy Victory ought to tell us now if he stands for the amount of damage which the Minister admits this Bill is going to do to the small farmer who produces turf as a sideline.</P>

We have been trying to clear his mind, but the attempt seems hopeless.  He is now going to put the people whom he wants to serve in the ash can.  He is voting in the belief that he is doing them a benefit.  The pity is that the Deputy is being bamboozled by the Minister.  I ask him to apply his mind to this amendment. The Minister is here for the purpose of bamboozling and fooling Deputy Victory.

      <P>Deputy Morrissey who has been closely concerned with the turf industry in his neighbourhood discussed this question here.  He has told us about a merchant who had much experience of the turf industry in North Tipperary and who, in order to get the turf that would satisfy his customers, had to refuse to take turf from the co-operative societies and instead had to go to a turf-cutter in County Clare.  Here is a person in Tipperary interested in the development of the turf industry and he had to go outside Tipperary for turf.  He was forced to do it.  He had to pay 4/- a ton more to that individual turf-cutter who did not get the same facilities from the railway company in the transport of turf that the co-operative societies got.  He had to get the quality of turf that this individual turf-cutter had.  That individual turf-cutter lived in the County Clare and he paid him 4/- a ton more for his turf.  He had to do that because it was the only way in which he could get turf of the particular quality and in the particular condition that he wanted.  That particular turf-cutter was upholding the reputation of turf and holding the <Col N="700" /> market for turf where the co-operative societies in Clare, Galway and Tipperary were failing to do it.  He is now in effect in future going to be prevented from selling his turf in any area which the Minister wishes to make an appointed area.  We will come up against what the Minister means by an appointed area later on. I ask the Minister what purpose, in the interests of turf, either of its reputation as a fuel or its spread and use in the country, is going to be served by putting a man like that turf-cutter out of business?  What purpose is served by putting out of business a person who during the last 12 months or more was selling turf from the west of Clare to people in North Tipperary because the co-operative societies in North Tipperary cannot supply the turf that is wanted by the people there?</P>

      <P>If, in fact, people in an appointed area buy any quantity of coal over 2 cwt., they are going to be forced to go to an approved society for their turf.  Everybody in that area practically, except the co-operative societies, is going to be forced out of the turf business in so far as the Minister in operating this Bill can force them.  I ask the Minister what turf purpose is going to be served by putting out of business in appointed areas men who have shown they were able to carry on the industry successfully?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks made by Deputy Mulcahy show that he has practically no knowledge of the turf business.  He said that the compulsory part of the Bill is going to create a position by which turf buying will be done in certain areas by coal merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is all wrong.  In the countryside where turf <Col N="702" /> is available there are two-thirds of the population whose only purchases of coal are for threshing operations. There are big numbers of farmers who buy 15 tons of turf in the year.  They will buy a ¼ ton of coal for threshing and yet Deputy Mulcahy says that, because they buy a ¼ ton or a ½ ton of coal for threshing or for domestic purposes, they will have to buy a certain quantity of turf and that that will so limit the market for the individual turf producers that these turf producers will not be able to sell their produce.  That is the merest nonsense.  The individual turf producers will be in this position&mdash; that the average farmer who burns only turf can still buy from that individual.  In addition, I may point out that the small person who never buys more than 2 cwt. of coal is still free to buy it.  Of course, the person who buys only a limited quantity of coal, say half and half, possibly will be able to buy partly from that individual supplier. As a matter of fact, this Bill will probably extend the market for that individual seller, because the persons dependent on turf-cutting for a living will almost inevitably join the co-operative society.  They will be largely concerned with the supplies to coal merchants, and so on.  The small farmer with whom Deputy Dillon is so concerned, who merely sells his surplus of turf, will have a monopoly of the trade I am speaking about in so far as he can supply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought there might be something in this amendment until I heard the speeches delivered in connection with it, but I am now satisfied that there is no case whatever for the amendment. I believe that those who are dependent upon turf-cutting for a living will welcome the provision that will cause them to become members of co-operative societies.  I believe it will give them a certain market for their produce and it will tend to standardise the produce.  There will not be the bickering nor the disputes about quality that have prevailed heretofore. I am satisfied that the provision about co-operative societies as a means of administering the Act is a very useful one.  I think the Opposition would be <Col N="703" /> well advised not to persist in this line. So far as that part is concerned, they have not established their case; they have not made a case that the individual turf producer is going to be in the least bit affected by it.  On the contrary, it is very likely in my opinion, and it should be the general opinion, that his market will be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Mulcahy knows very little about the position of the producer of turf, and whatever Deputy Morrissey says about it is misleading to everybody.  So far as my experience of the individual producers is concerned, up to this stage the Government's scheme in connection with turf has vastly improved their position.  Prior to the setting up of the co-operative societies and the Turf Development Board, the producers and direct sellers in the bog areas in Kildare were in a very bad way.  They were going into the towns trying to sell turf and the towns were not able to absorb all the turf they were producing.  Then, with the extra drainage of the bogs, more turf was being produced.  The producers were in the position that there was a surplus there and they could not sell it.  As regards the purchasers of turf in the rural areas, the farmers used to go to the bogs and buy the turf there and they got that turf at whatever price they liked.  Sometimes the producers were glad to get 4/- and 5/- a ton for the turf.  When the Government's scheme started, the supporters of Deputy Dillon down the country did all they could to oppose it and keep it from working.  They were inspired by political motives, and they tried to organise the turf producers, and they told them that the Government's scheme would put them off the road altogether.  That was the type of campaign that was carried out. Deputy Belton went to Kildare to help that out.  The experience of the turf producers since is that all the surplus turf has been taken off the market through the Turf Development Board and their sales have been increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the bogs in Kildare, I believe those statistics are altogether wrong.  Anyone with the slightest <Col N="704" /> experience of the working of the bogs in Kildare must be aware they are wrong.  I can say that ten loads of turf now leave the bog for Dublin to the one that left five or six years ago.  The types of persons who buy turf from the producer in the local town usually would buy about 2 cwt. of coal.  Those persons will not be affected.  Then there is the other type of person, the farmer in the rural area, who never buys any coal.  Such a person will buy turf every year, 20 and perhaps 30 tons, in the bogs.  These people will have to give a better price now than they gave in former years before the turf scheme was made operative.  We have heard a lot about the people who opposed the turf scheme in the country areas in Kildare.  There were certain people in Kildare who became distributors of turf in a pretty extensive way.  They bought large quantities from the producers, but at a very bad price.</P>

      <P>They were more in the position of middlemen.  The Government scheme has taken those people off the necks of the producers, and the producers see that now.  I believe the effect of the amendment would be to make the scheme unworkable.  It looks as if the Opposition want to prevent the scheme working.  It is a pity Deputy Minch is not here.  He knows something about the turf industry, and I would be glad to hear him express his views.  He knows well that the turf producers in Kildare are in favour of this scheme.  As a matter of fact, the people who have talked most about it are the people who know nothing at all about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy, I also told him that in relation to turf no definite conclusion can be drawn from the figures for one year as compared with another, the production of turf in any year or any portion of a year being so dependent on climatic conditions that no reliable comparison could be made.  It so happened that 1934 was a bad year for production, and production started late in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister knows that neither he nor I is dependent on one year's statistics.  He has shown us that there was less turf taken from the bogs in 1933 than in 1931; less in 1934 than in 1933, and less carried by the transport companies in 1935 than in 1934.</P>

      <P>No, but ordinary sellers will be forced out of the business, and co-operative societies will take their place.  Deputy Harris tells us that living in Kildare, with the bog in front of him, the position is that there is room for tremendous development. But that has not been shown in any way that we can see.  So far as the Minister is concerned, he tells us that 1,600 tons more were taken from the bogs in Kildare in 1934 than in 1931.</P>

The Minister proposes that no householder in Kildare can get a quarter of a ton of coal without having to deal with the local approved society.  A man cannot get his coal unless he does that.  It is all very well for Deputy Moore to say that there are so many householders who use nothing but turf, and that the individual turf-cutter will do better than in the past.  I know that the Deputy, when he takes a certain amount of consolation from that remark, seems to take more consolation when he says that in any case the individual turf-cutter will be only delighted to be forced into the co-operative society.</P>

      <P>Yes, Because Deputy Harris professes to represent the conditions of these individual suppliers. But let us pass from Deputy Harris. He has spoken about the peculiar position in Kildare.  I am thinking of the people in the congested areas.  I am thinking of the people referred to by the Minister for Education, acting for the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the turf legislation was first brought in here.  We were told that this legislation was to assist these people whom Deputy Victory described as crushed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Victory told us these people were being crushed in the western areas. Do the conditions described by Deputy Harris correspond in any way with the conditions in the congested areas within, for instance, Deputy Jordan's knowledge?  Of course they do not. They bear no relation to the condition of farmers in the congested areas who burn turf and who have their own turbary. These people have turf as a side line and bring it in and sell it in the market to town dwellers.  These are the people we were thinking of when we put down this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's question is an extremely difficult one.  I asked that question of the people in Donegal, and Deputy Doherty was despatched by the Minister to say to the people that the Bill before the House meant that there was going to be more turf sold, more money spent and that the bogs would become invaluable.  I said the meaning is that the bogs will not be one bit more used than before, but that the Minister is going to create a horde of <Col N="708" /> officials.  Who was right, Deputy Doherty or myself?  If I am told in Donegal that the Minister says this Bill does not prevent anyone from selling turf, I have to say that is right. There is no provision to prevent people selling any turf, but the implications of this Bill will mean that people who now sell turf as a side line will no longer be able to sell it.  That will come to pass as sure as we are here if this amendment is not adopted.  It may not affect Kildare.  The peculiar circumstances that operate in Kildare are not known to me, but the conditions that operate in the congested areas are known to Deputy Doherty and to Deputy Jordan.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows nothing about the congested areas, and I implore him to keep silent about them. He would be as incongruous in a congested area as a white blackbird.  He does not know anything about the congested areas; we do not expect him to.  I suggest to Deputy Jordan that the picture I have drawn is the true picture.  We want to avoid these hardships and I believe this amendment is designed to do that, and unless the amendment is accepted grave hardships will prevail.</P>

      <P>Coming from a district where a good deal of turf is cut, I believe this is a reasonable amendment. If this amendment was accepted you would have competition from the turf producers.  If the amendment is not accepted, what will happen? A co-operative society is formed in the district, and it may turn out that the retailer has got to buy all his turf from the co-operative society. Down in the West of Ireland we have a terrible dread of co-operative societies.  We were not dealt with fairly in regard to them in the past. In the second place it is quite possible you may develop a bog that may not be worth it.  If you get a bad bog, such as Deputy O'Leary referred to in Kildare, and if a coal retailer has to buy from that society and to sell that turf over again, how can he do so when in the few homes where turf is used it must be the best black turf?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the turf which I saw burned in Leinster House last winter is standard quality, I can say that it is only like the waste in some of our bogs.  That is the objection I have to co-operative societies; that you will probably develop a bad bog and get some town dwellers, who have to buy from a coal retailer, to buy that bad turf, whereas the ordinary man coming in with his crib of surplus turf can sell it quite freely at present. Why not let the coal retailer go into the open market and buy the turf just as a corn merchant buys corn in the open market?  He will buy the best turf and he will get it at the lowest possible price.  The person who has to buy from him may be quite sure that he is going to get the best value that can be got for money.  There are districts where there may not be a sufficient number of people to join in a co-operative society.  The turbary was given to them years ago by the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board.  Every year they sold portion of their surplus turf to the ordinary farmers around and then brought in the rest into the smaller towns to dispose of it.  I think this is not fair to them.  What I am afraid of under the section is that you are putting a price on bad turf.  If the amendment were accepted, the people who have the good turf would always be sure of a price. The danger is that the people who had good turf for sale in the past will not now produce that good turf because, under the section they will only get the same price as the producer of the bad turf.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Brodrick with regard to the quality of the turf.  There should be some protection for the people with <Col N="710" /> regard to that.  As has been pointed out, there are a great many in the position of the people whom this amendment seeks to protect.  Nothing should be done to put these people in the position that they cannot sell their turf.  After all, this is not the first time that the Minister introduced a Bill interfering with the means of living of individuals.  Under the Road Traffic Act he handed over the control of traffic to the Great Southern Railways Company, but he made provision for the people who suffered as a result of that.  We want to see that the people concerned here will not suffer and have to come before the House demanding compensation for being deprived of their means of livelihood.</P>

      <Col N="713" /> Question put: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I would again draw the Minister's attention to the fact that under Section 13 he is going to compel coal retailers selling a certain quantity of coal to sell with it a certain quantity of turf in an area which is not an approved area, but he is not going to allow the coal merchant, who is going to sell that turf, to buy it wherever he pleases. He is not going to allow that merchant to choose the bog from which he will get the turf or the type of turf which he may want to get.  He is not going to allow the merchant to go into the open market for the purchase of turf. Instead of that, he forces the merchant to go to a type of society on the development of which the Minister has already spent a considerable amount of money, and which societies, at the end of last year, the Minister had succeeded in developing only to the extent of seven in Donegal, 32 in Kerry, five in Tipperary, 23 in Galway, and ten in Mayo, out of a total of 158.  Now a further development of societies like that is going to take place at the expense of the State as well as at considerable inconvenience and loss to the people who are engaged in the turf-cutting industry.  I think the Minister ought to explain, on this section, why he is deliberately endeavouring to prevent coal retailers buying their compulsory turf from whomever they want to buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that a coal retailer will be required to purchase from one co-operative society.  So long as he purchases from a source that is approved under the section, he satisfies the requirements of the Act; and, if there were any difference between the quality of turf produced by one society as against the quality of turf produced by another society, he is at liberty to purchase from whichever society he chooses. He will not be forced to take turf from any particular society&mdash;whether the turf supplied by a society is satisfactory or not.  In any event, however, it is necessary that there should be proper supervision over the turf sold. <Col N="714" /> If we are taking power to compel people to purchase turf, it is obvious that there must be adequate machinery to see that the turf is of the proper quality, and it is not possible to do that unless we can be sure that the turf is from an approved source&mdash;in other words, a source that will be subject to the supervision of the Turf Development Board.  The co-operative societies are being equipped with the necessary machinery for the proper production of turf and they are being provided with suitable storage facilities. The turf, when in store, will be inspected before being sold, and if it does not come up to the standard of quality required by the Turf Development Board, it will not be sold at all under the scheme.  Therefore, the coal merchants and others who are anxious to purchase turf, can be satisfied that, when they purchase turf from an approved source, they will be getting turf of a good quality.</P>
      <P>I think it is obvious that, if we did not have some such provision as this, there could be wide-spread evasions of the Act, and I think it is equally obvious that this is the only basis on which we could provide against such evasions.  In fixing the quota in any area, or in defining a particular area, it is necessary that we should have full knowledge of the quantity of turf that has been produced or that is likely to be produced in that area in a certain time&mdash;turf which will conform to the standard of quality which the Turf Development Board has set up.  On any other basis there could be many evasions of the Act, and, in fact, the Act could be made a dead-letter by various devices.</P>

      <P>Is it not plain that the only method of inspection is collective inspection?  Surely, an inspector could not be kept at a coal merchant's yard inspecting the turf coming in from day to day?  Would you not have this arising then&mdash;that, with each purchase of coal, there would be constant complaints as to the quality of the turf, if people chose to make those complaints&mdash;in other words, if the merchant were at liberty to purchase <Col N="716" /> the turf from any one of his scores of neighbours?  Where those who buy coal have to buy a certain amount of turf with it, the purchaser can complain at any time that, either rightly or wrongly, he is not getting a good quality of turf, and the State would have no defence to make against that.  I think they are making him a present of that complaint, and I cannot see how the proposal can be carried out.  I do submit, however, as I was saying a while ago, that it would be worth while considering whether a coal merchant could not himself become a producer of turf, provided, perhaps, that he produced a certain minimum quantity of turf. We are always complaining in this country that we have too many distributors. It is a constant criticism in this country that the tendency of our people is to engage in distribution instead of in production.  Well, here is an opportunity to encourage our people to engage in production and to encourage production on the part of people already engaged as merchants in the distributive trade.  For instance, there are already merchants in this country who own pieces of bog, and I think that it should be possible to have some provision in the Bill to make such people an approved source of supply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Obviously, if a coal merchant is producing, say, 500 or 5,000 tons in a certain period, it would be <Col N="717" /> an easy matter to inspect his turf, and I do think that it is a desirable thing to encourage production in that respect, provided that there is a certain minimum laid down.  It must be remembered that you might have such a circumstance arising as that, in an emergency, the Minister might have to schedule a certain area that had not been scheduled previously.  If there were no co-operative society in that area, then you would have the position that all the turf has to come from the Turf Board or from different co-operative societies.  At the same time, it might be possible that the merchant concerned would be in a position to start producing turf for himself&mdash;perhaps from his own bog.  I should like to hear the Minister's reason for omitting that type of person from the list of approved sources.  I think there is a very good case for including such people, provided that there is a certain minimum of production fixed.  If a person, in order to have his turf approved, has to pool it into the co-operative society, buy it back from a society, and then re-sell it, I think that is a rather cumbrous arrangement, and, to my own knowledge there are many coal merchants in that position. There are many coal merchants in the position that they own pieces of bog and, if there were the necessary provisions in this Bill, they would be encouraged to acquire a larger area of bog-land.  Unless we are to decide that private enterprise is altogether a bad thing, I think there is a good case to be made for including such persons as I have described among the approved sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore said that if coal merchants were to be permitted to buy from various sources, the quality of the turf might be poor, and in certain cases would not be uniform. Is it not obvious that if coal merchants are forced to sell turf with coal, and if they get a choice, they are going to get the best turf?  As a result, merchants with really tip-top turf are going to do better than their neighbours if they have poor turf.  It is in the interests of merchants to get the best turf.  It may be an answer that the Minister would refuse to let coal merchants buy from private individuals <Col N="718" /> because by so doing they might get superior quality to turf supplied by the Board.  It has to be remembered that certain qualities of turf are, on the average, better than what the Board supplies.  I do not come from a turf county, but I know good turf from bad turf.  I know that some of the turf I saw supplied by the Turf Board was bad turf, and that I could get a superior turf even in my own county.  If I was a coal merchant I should like to be permitted to get the best turf I could&mdash;to get turf of really A1 quality.  I would regard that as the best part of my business, because I would have an advantage over competitors if I could say that I was selling better turf than men in the next street.  This is an interference with good business, and as Deputy Moore says, there is the possibility of getting inferior turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Bennett that a turf society might produce bad turf, and that an individual producer might produce good turf, but the difference in the point of view he has contemplated is that the turf will be inspected at the source, and only the good turf approved for sale under the scheme. Deputy Bennett in that connection must bear in mind that there is going to be a fixed price, and that turf sold by co-operative societies to a coal merchant is going to be sold at a fixed price.  There is an obligation to ensure that the quality will be up to standard. We can do that in relation to co-operative societies, because the turf will be available for inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a fixed selling price to the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  That will vary with the cost of delivery in the different districts.  The price the consumer will pay will obviously be determined by certain considerations, and people are going to buy the cheapest article if they want it.  In practically every part of the country there is bound to be an alternative source of supply.  My objection to Deputy Moore's suggestion is the same as that to Deputy Mulcahy's proposal. There will be no effective means of <Col N="719" /> accounting for turf produced by merchants other than by an examination of merchants' books which would not be reliable.  No one could check a merchant's statement that he produced 500 tons or 1,000 tons of turf and sold it in acordance with the provisions of the Bill.  It is necessary to have a check on the returns of coal merchants, or otherwise a dishonest merchant might get an advantage over a competitor who conformed to the law. It is in the interests of the honest merchant who tries to carry out the obligation under this or any other statute, that this proper enforcement is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy mean in that regard?  We have had references made to the possibility of a horde of inspectors being appointed.  It will not be necessary to appoint a horde of inspectors.  In so far as we foresee development this year, or next year, of the provisions of this Bill, there will be no additional inspectors appointed.  It is true that to a large extent the Bill will be supervised by the Civic Guards in any area, but, apart from the appointment of a clerk to keep records, no additional inspector will be required for some time.  It is, of course, possible that an additional inspector will be needed at some stage when the scheme has developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not cleared up my difficulty, especially in view of the exposition he gave before.  I take it that there will be inspection at the source, and that the source is the bogs. Therefore, there will be inspection at the bogs.  To me that seems to indicate a considerable amount of inspection. The Minister can make gestures, but the fact remains that there is to be inspection at the source.  The Minister nodded when I said that that means inspection at the bogs&mdash;any quantity of bogs.  There are 32 co-operative societies <Col N="720" /> in my native county.  If there is going to be inspection on all the bogs, I do not know how many there will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister nodded when I said there would be inspection on the bogs.  Then there will be a considerable amount of inspection.  I confess to a difficulty in following the machinery of the Bill, and as to how the Minister intends to work it.  A great deal of the delay, I think, is due to the refusal of the Minister to give a picture of what is in his mind.  I gather that the only reason he is opposing the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy is that the check on the merchant will be the amount of turf he buys from an approved source.  If that is so, I confess that I misread the Bill.  The Minister spoke of evasion and assumes that certain merchants will try to evade the Bill. What is there to prevent a merchant buying turf from an approved source and selling coal to one man and turf to another man, and in that way disposing of his turf, if the check the Minister indicated is to be merely the quantity the merchant buys?  Is it not obvious that the purpose of the Bill can be evaded by having, so to speak, side by side coal merchants and turf merchants, selling coal and turf to consumers?  The Minister says that there are provisions in the Bill under which that would be against the law. Then he will want inspection elsewhere to see that the purchaser does not evade the law, or that the merchant in selling does not evade it. Control of the amount of turf a merchant buys is not the check that the Minister's suggests if people are determined to evade the law, unless there is an amount of inspection considerably greater than the Minister indicated.  In fact, you will have to have inspection at different times, both at the source and at the last stage in the sale to consumers.  The provisions in the Bill show that.  That being so, I cannot see what is the objection to allowing merchants to purchase turf where they wish, so long as they can show on inspection that they have purchased so much turf.  I <Col N="721" /> do not see how such men would be in a different position from the Minister's point of view from persons who purchase directly from the co-operative societies or the board.  As to the question about the standard of the turf, it will not be to the advantage of one coal merchant as against a rival coal merchant to sell &ldquo;compulsory turf,&rdquo; if I might use that phrase, of an inferior quality.</P>

      <P>Very often there is.  Again we do not know where it is going to be enforced.  There are 32 co-operative societies in Kerry alone.  I do not know the number of bogs they have but that will require inspection.  I wonder how many coal merchants are there? Not so many.  The Minister has given no indication of the amount of extra inspection that will be required. Again, I can only say that I see at the back of this a determination to keep out at all costs the ordinary turf-cutter and to permit large scale production at the expense of the small individual producer.  I suggest it is rather late in the day for Deputy Moore to appear as a defender of private enterprise in this matter.  I think the Minister's answer was quite as effective, or at least as effective, to Deputy Moore's arguments as it was to the case which we put forward. Even Deputy Moore's own distinction <Col N="722" /> between the merchant and the ordinary small producer shows that he also is bitten with the idea of big business, production on a grandiose scale.  Both the Minister and the Deputy are misled by the example of big production in Russia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on the Second Reading of the Bill that, at the beginning, at any rate, the only appointed areas will be the places where turf can be sold cheapest and where coal is dearest.  Generally speaking, that means the turf-producing areas, and perhaps only districts in those counties which come within that description.  A lot, of course, will depend on the volume of production.  It is impossible to state in advance, in the beginning of any year, what the volume of production in any area will be, because that will depend, not merely on the number of societies, but on weather conditions and on other factors.  But, having regard to the production anticipated this and the following year, it is not likely that there will be very many areas appointed.  In any event, it will be possible to confine the operation of the Bill to those areas where turf as a fuel can be regarded definitely as economic in so far as it will be cheaper weight for weight and calorie for calorie than turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister what his view is as to the relative value of turf and coal per calorie and per price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it varies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies very considerably.  There are people who burn turf.  They do so from choice because they like it, but they will not admit that, calorie for calorie, it is at all an economic proposition.  They burn it in their living rooms because they prefer it to coal, but they will tell you candidly that from the heating point of view it is not an economic proposition.  Will the Minister realise that he has not given us any real indication of the areas in which it is proposed to enforce this measure?  He speaks of the turf-producing areas. You may have an area in which there is a very big bog, and it may not be a turf-consuming area at all, in the sense <Col N="725" /> that it does not consume anything like the quantity of turf produced in that area.  You may have to go outside that area to dispose of the turf produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless the production is higher than it was last year. In 1935, all the turf produced was disposed of without any compulsion at all. It is because we anticipate a substantial increase in production that we contemplate using the powers in this Bill at all.  And even in that event a quite mild application of the provisions of the Bill will probably be sufficient to dispose of all the turf produced.  Consequently it will only be necessary to operate it in certain defined areas, and then to a limited extent only.  It is difficult to say to what extent the provisions of the Bill will be applied, or the size of the areas over which it will operate, in advance of some definite knowledge as to the quantity of turf that will be available to be disposed of.</P>

      <P>I did not like to interrupt the Minister on a point of order, but I was going to raise the point of order that he was talking against the principle of the Bill in the argument that he now puts forward. He has brought an excellent argument against this Bill.  &ldquo;He could easily have waited 12 months so far as compulsion is concerned; it is most unlikely that it will be used in the next 12 months, and if used at all then only in the smallest possible doses.&rdquo;  This is the Bill that there has been so much hurry about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with what the Minister said.  I am at a loss to know in what type of area he will enforce the Bill.  Take the case of a coal merchant in the City of Cork, <Col N="726" /> does he intend to enforce the measure there and will that coal merchant have to sell turf with coal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's first point, the reason why it is desired to have the Bill passed is for the purpose of encouraging the production of turf.  The provisions in the Bill may not be necessary immediately for the purpose of ensuring the disposal of all the turf produced, but, having regard to the experience gained in 1934, it is considered that the co-operative societies will engage more vigorously in the production of turf, and if so they are entitled to know that we are in a position to ensure that the turf so produced will be disposed of.  I do not think it will be necessary to operate the compulsory provisions of the Bill in an area like Cork City in the course of the coming year.  At some stage, we shall get to the point at which we shall be able to supply turf in all parts of the country but that will not be for some time to come. Increase in turf production is a slow business.  Under the best circumstances, it cannot be done readily.  If you take virgin bog, before you can produce a sod of turf from it, at least two years' preparatory work must be done.  For certain forms of production, even three years' preparatory work is necessary.  The Deputy will see that you cannot increase the supply of turf very rapidly.  Earlier in the discussion, a Deputy referred to the use of turf in an emergency.  The fact is that, if an emergency were to arise and our supplies of coal, due to any cause, were cut off, we could not deal with that emergency except to a limited extent by turning to turf because turf could not be produced sufficiently rapidly to enable that emergency to be met.  On the basis of the production we contemplate this year, it will, I think, be possible to dispose of all the turf merely by supplying, under the provisions of this Bill, certain limited areas which I have defined as turf-producing areas&mdash;the areas where turf is cheapest and coal is dearest. In these areas, there will, I think, be little difficulty in disposing of more turf than has been used in the past.  In any event, the sales arising <Col N="727" /> therefrom, plus the sales that will take place in the ordinary course in other areas without any compulsory powers, will enable us to dispose of the production contemplated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has vague views about a city like Cork. The Minister must have in mind some particular areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I was arguing against on my second amendment.  Notwithstanding all this talk, the Minister has shown that there is no necessity for the Bill at all.  Now, apparently, all the rosy promises held out are more or less vanishing.  The main reason the Minister gives for the Bill now is that he wants to give the turf producers a little more heart than resulted from his efforts in 1934.  That is the principal argument he brought forward for these compulsory powers. As a result of their previous attempt to increase turf production, to give a little heart to the turf producers the Minister wants these compulsory powers, which he does not think he will be called upon to exercise for some considerable time.  Again, we have this blowing hot and cold.  We do not know where we are or what the intentions of the Minister are. Propaganda is the main purpose of the Bill&mdash;propaganda directed not at the public this time but at the turf producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any objection to giving the turf producer encouragement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The turf producer's mind is to be turned towards increased production by the promise to apply compulsion to the rest of the community.  That is the principal argument used by the Minister.  The idea is not to get people to use turf but, by the powers now sought, to hold an umbrella over the turf producers and to erase the effects of the efforts of 1934.  I think the Minister might have mentioned about a dozen areas to which he proposed to apply these provisions.  The County Kerry, <Col N="728" /> which he has mentioned, is rather a large area.  Does he suggest that, calorie for calorie, turf is a cheaper fuel than coal in Killarney or Tralee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the view of the people there.  I am speaking of people who use turf.  Eighteen months ago I asked people there that question, though I did not use the Minister's phrase.  I referred to &ldquo;heating power.&rdquo;  They were all of the opinion there that, as a heating proposition, turf was not as good as coal. That is the opinion of people accustomed to using turf and coal, and who use turf whenever they can use it.  The Minister might give a list of 12 or 13 areas to which he intends to apply these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One essential factor is missing&mdash;the quantity of turf to be disposed of.  We shall not know that until later.  Assuming that we have the same increase as last year in the quantity produced, which I think is very likely, there will be certain limited areas in these counties in respect of which this scheme will be tried out during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the criticism levelled at the Bill generally is having some effect on the Minister. The people in the cities were becoming anxious lest the Bill should be applied to them, and the Minister now wants to make clear that he does not want to force it on Cork or Dublin.  He is going to select areas where turf is more generally used, and where the people produce turf.  The Bill is to be applied to Kerry or somewhere in the Gaeltacht where turf is already extensively and cheaply produced, and where the people are using turf.  The Minister, if he brings the Bill into operation at all, is going to try it out in one or two of these districts first.  But we do not know how far the area will extend.  It may extend to the great bulk of the countryside.  We may arrive at the point where the man who is producing turf sufficient for his own use will be affected.  If, occasionally, he would like the luxury of a coal fire, he may come <Col N="729" /> into town and buy four or five cwts. of coal.  But he will also have to buy turf.  So that he will be drawing turf instead of coal to Newcastle.  He has already as much turf as he needs at home.  If there were any logic in the Bill, one would think that the areas selected would not be the areas where turf is already cheap.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, for instance, may have sufficient turf for his own use down in Kerry.  If he buys a few cwt. of coal, he will also have to buy more turf.  He will, therefore, have more turf than he wants.  I think that that would be unjust.  I see no reason why the Minister should select first the areas where turf is already largely in use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening very attentively to what the Minister has said about the people of the different areas.  I understood the Minister to say that, if and when the production of turf increases, if the sales must be stimulated, certain areas will be appointed.  He has mentioned Cork City.  Let us take that as a typical case.  Is it the Minister's idea that when the sale of turf requires to be stimulated, he will make Cork City an appointed area and will stipulate that of every sale of coal over two cwt., ten per cent., or some such percentage, must be turf, and that in another area, which might possibly be better situated, according to the Minister's idea, for the production of turf and the stimulation of its sale, 20 per cent. will be specified?  That seems to suggest that the Minister had in mind that in certain portions of the country, which he will appoint from time to time, turf sales will be stimulated artificially, and other areas left alone.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to refer to a section to which we have not yet come, but I am afraid I shall have to read portion of Section 13:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a coal retailer sells and delivers, whether in or not in an <Col N="730" /> appointed area, to a purchaser who is not entitled to the benefit of exemption....</P>
    <P>Surely that contemplates that, where a person is not in an appointed area, he will have to take a certain percentage of turf?  I should like the Minister to explain how that is to be worked, having regard to what he has stated as to appointed areas being fixed from time to time and, presumably, different percentages of turf to be consumed in those areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be correct. There might be an area in which there is a considerable consumption of turf with a town in the middle of it in which there is a very small consumption of turf; but, generally speaking, it is correct to say that the appointed areas are the areas in which turf is produced and used to a considerable extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it is in precisely the type of country town I had in mind when discussing Section 2, the Minister intends to operate this Act.  I gather that is so from what he has said on this particular section.  So far as the Bill is to be operative then, it is in the small country towns it is going to be operative, and the people who are going to be hit are precisely the people I mention, <Col N="731" /> who are accustomed to bringing their turf there.  You will get very little extra increase in turf.  However, I will discuss that in relation to the compulsory powers, but you will do considerable damage to these men. It is these men, as I say, who will be hit and they are being sacrificed for an alleged advantage&mdash;I do not really know to whom&mdash;to the people who go into co-operative societies and sell through the board.  That it will produce more consumption of turf, I take the liberty of doubting.  Remember that the people who are going to be hit are precisely the men who purchase turf already in the country towns from a private individual, and not the people whom Deputy Victory wants to hit, the people who are too grand to use turf.  He wanted this as a kind of guillotine against snobbery.  It is not going to be used for that purpose. It is to be used for the purpose of hitting those people and their suppliers who up to the present used turf.</P>

I am sorry he did not bear it in mind when answering Deputy Mulcahy earlier in connection with Section 2, because that fine, and the fact that you will have to have control, not merely of the purchases by the merchant, but also of the sales by the merchant and purchases by the consumer, would ensure that there was no evasion of the Act.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see Section 12 withdrawn.  If the penalties in Section 11 are not sufficient to prohibit unregistered coal dealers from carrying on, I suppose the Minister will take other precautions to enforce the Act.  What is the object of adding the penalties in Section 12 to all the other penalties?  Why should an ordinary purchaser be penalised for an offence of which he is not wilfully cognisant?  If a merchant sets up in defiance of the regulations and operates as a coal merchant, surely the ordinary citizen must assume that such a man is legally entitled to operate as such.  If he goes in and buys coal from an unregistered person he is to be subjected to the same penalties <Col N="734" /> as the man who sells him the coal. I object to the penalty in this section; there is no necessity for it.  I would like the Minister to withdraw the section altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy mixing up the section with some other provision of the Bill?  This is a section which prohibits the purchase of coal from an unregistered coal retailer. Having regard to the general scheme of the Bill, it is obviously fair to the people on whom the obligation is placed that some such provision as this should be in the Bill.  If you go to a coal retailer and say: &ldquo;Under penalty you must sell a certain amount of turf with the coal,&rdquo; I think you must at the same time impose an obligation on the turf purchaser to take that quantity of turf.  If the Bill is to go through with this provision that is an essential part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has drafted Section 11 as drastically as he could to prevent an unregistered person operating.  That being so, he should not press this section.  If a man escapes the attention of the Minister with all these provisions it is natural that the ordinary person in the street will assume that he is entitled to sell coal.  It is the same as if a solicitor or doctor displayed his qualifications in his office.  That certificate is hung up in a part of the office where nobody sees it.  This section is asking the purchaser of coal to take precautions which he ought not be asked to take.  If the Minister is going to operate Section 11 he ought to operate it in such a way that it would be impossible for an unregistered coal merchant to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a normal provision in Acts of this kind.  There is a similar provision in the Transport Acts.  It is illegal for anyone to hire a mechanically propelled vehicle from an unlicensed person for transport purposes.  The same applies to agricultural Acts in which registers are established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Question proposed: That Section 13 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could I bring to the Minister's mind an analogy that was once put up here; there was a certain amount of justification for it afterwards?  I am not saying that the Act was not successful. I remember when I was introducing the Compulsory School Attendance Bill, it was put up to me by a number of experienced men in the country that one result of the Bill would be to procure the non-attendance in school of children once they reached the age of 14 years, that the children when you met them and asked them &ldquo;Why are you not at school to-day?&rdquo; would answer &ldquo;I am 14.&rdquo; They were compelled to attend until 14 and they would think that the mere fact of reaching the age of 14 was an excuse for non-attendance.  Though that Act has been a success up to the age of 14, I wonder if it has been a success after 14.  There are places in which the Minister intends to operate this Bill, appointed areas.  In country towns compulsion in this matter may have the opposite effect.  For instance, the Minister compels a person, who is at present buying a quantity of turf, to buy turf and coal from a merchant.  There is <Col N="736" /> just the danger that the person will confine himself to that specified quantity of turf and will not bother buying from the man who sells it as a side line, as Deputy Victory would call it. There is that danger.  However, I presume that is a danger that has been taken into account by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The point that I raised previously is quite relevant to this particular section, that is, I asked the Minister whether there had been full co-operation between the different Departments. I put forward that point on the Second Reading.  The Minister said there had been.  Do I gather from the Minister's statement that, for the last three or four years, the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash;and, remember, the Government have been giving attention to this turf problem for a number of years&mdash;has seen to it that in the new houses that have been erected in such numbers all over the country grates and ranges have been installed suitable for the consumption of turf?  Is that the contention of the Minister?  When he answered my question that there had been co-operation, I thought that was what he meant, because that was underlying the question I put.  I suggest that, if the Minister or his Department means to be serious about this turf production problem, and anxious to promote the consumption of turf, they would have ensured that there was adequate co-operation between the two Departments&mdash; Industry and Commerce and Local Government.  I am referring now to houses that have been subsidised by public grants, and I am suggesting that some arrangement should have been made in connection with the houses built during the last couple of years to see that they would be properly fitted for the consumption of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather gather from the gesture made by the Minister just now that that has not been done, at least to any considerable extent.  I believe I am correct in assuming that.  I suggest in that case that it would have been much more advisable that some steps in that direction should have been taken, especially when help was being given through the medium of public <Col N="737" /> money, rather than that compulsory powers, such as the Government are now asking for, should be sought. That would be a more reasonable and, I think, a more fruitful method of dealing with the problem.  Deputy Mrs. Concannon raised that point incidentally in the course of the Second Reading debate.  I think if the Minister had allowed his mind to run on that particular line, instead of on the compulsory line, he might get better results spread over a number of years.  From the point of view of increased production, I believe a policy of that kind would be more effective than this continual use of compulsion.  I am very doubtful about the feasibility of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>There is one matter upon which I would like to glean some information. I am not making any particular point about it.  My desire for information on the matter is partly stimulated by certain remarks made by the Minister.  He referred recently to turf being utilised for the production of power.  That problem, I presume, was fully considered by his Department and turned down&mdash;or was it turned down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the utilisation of turf for the production of power has been receiving very careful examination.  In that connection I do not think it would be practicable to use hand-won turf, but we may be able to secure the mechanical production of turf for that purpose in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister spoke of mechanisation, the use of machinery, I thought he had left these things out of account.  I understand the Minister's Department and other Departments are co-operating towards the establishment of a new electric power scheme, and that that is being done without any reference to whether or not we are to utilise turf in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that an ideal combination for the production of power is a hydro-electric scheme and a turf scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But from what we have been told it would appear that the Minister will have to rely on a dry <Col N="738" /> season in order to operate the turf scheme.  Surely you are not going to set up a turf power-producing station merely for the purpose of waiting for a dry year in order to operate it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a standby plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But that will not be enough, if you are going to use turf in the sense in which you have referred to it&mdash;using it as it is being used in other countries.  Has the Minister in mind the utilisation of turf in the Pigeon House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister has in mind establishing a big plant where the turf is produced, in the middle of the country, in such a place as that where he had lunch last Saturday.  I am not to be taken as objecting, but it must be clear to the Minister that the new hydro-electric scheme will certainly postpone any such project for some time.  It is not the type of plant that you can set up and use only occasionally; if it is to be productive it must be a plant that will be continually used. What I am anxious to know is what consideration has been given to that matter and why it was determined not to develop along these particular lines in the places where you have turf in large quantities and where you have not immediately on the turf area a large turf-consuming population.  That would get over to a large extent the question of transport.  That was one of the points the Minister referred to during the Second Reading debate and it was one of the reasons why he was anxious to operate this measure particularly in the turf-producing areas so that the cost of transport would be cut down as much as possible.  Surely, one of the advantages of producing power from turf in the centre of the big bogs is that you can get over the cost of transport?  You already have the transmission lines.  I presume that with some modification it would be possible to utilise existing transmission lines.  I merely want an assurance that that question has been fully considered. Perhaps the Minister will tell <Col N="739" /> us how we stand in regard to that matter and what is the relationship to the existing hydro-electric schemes.</P>
      <P>I have objected to the particular powers that are being taken by the Minister.  We are half-way through the Committee Stage of this Bill and I must confess that Deputies are still in the position that they do not know precisely what are the Minister's intentions as to the use of these compulsory powers.  If anybody in the House wishes to say that he intends to use these powers in the most oppressive manner, he can find statements in the course of the Minister's speeches to back that up; if a Deputy wishes to say that this is merely a stunt on the part of the Minister and that he has no intention to operate this measure, he still can find statements made by the Minister to back that up. That is why I suggest we should not lightly give powers which tend to have a wide ambit, particularly when we have such very vague indications from the Minister as to how he is going to use them.  I suggest that to do so would be a very wrong thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the production of electric power, we can leave that matter over because an Electricity Supply Bill will have to come before the Dáil in the course of the present session.  So far as the production of power from turf is concerned, there is no technical problem involved; the only question is the price at which the turf can be delivered into the bunkers at the power station, and that question cannot be answered satisfactorily for some time to come, at least until the problems associated with the mechanical production of turf have been solved.  The question of the equipment of the new houses with grates and ranges suitable for the utilisation of turf is one that, naturally, has given us concern.  A number of houses recently erected in certain parts of the country have been so equipped.  The answer to the Deputy's question in this connection is that it has not been made a condition for the receipt of financial assistance for house-building that the <Col N="740" /> houses should be so equipped.  That will come, undoubtedly and, in fact, with the enactment of this measure and our being able to see more clearly ahead the future development of turf production.  The question will have to be taken up with the Department of Local Government at an early stage. It was considered undesirable to do so until the position of the turf scheme, as a whole, was more clearly defined. Another matter raised by the Deputy was the Government's intention in respect to the powers of the Bill.  We would hope it would not be necessary to use the compulsory powers of the Bill.  In any event these powers will be only utilised to the extent that is necessary to enable the actual turf produced in the season to be disposed of.  There certainly will be no unnecessary utilisation of these powers for the purpose of creating an artificial scarcity of fuel.  At the end of the producing season it will be possible to ascertain, with a fair degree of accuracy, the amount of turf available for disposal, and the amount that can be used in the ordinary way without the powers of this Bill.  It is only if there is a surplus to the extent that only with the use of these powers could it be disposed of, the compulsory powers will be utilised at all.</P>

      <P>That is what I might call the key section of the Bill.  I do not propose to go very deeply into it, and I do not know whether the point was debated fully or not on Second Reading, as I was not here.  Under this particular section a coal merchant may not sell to anybody more than two hundredweights of coal without at the same time selling to him an equal quantity of turf.  In another section&mdash;Section 19, I think&mdash;sub-retailers have not that privilege.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

      <P>I do not think he will have any difficulty in disposing of the turf as turf.  I am not clear upon the point, but it seems to be that the sub-retailer is bound as much as anyone else.  It seems to me if a bellman has to take turf, whether he wants it or not, he will find it very difficult to sell it.  The coal merchant seems to have an advantage over him.  If the intention is otherwise, I must confess it is very badly worked.  There is one point that I would like the Minister to elucidate.

      <P>The more I read this section the more difficulty I have in seeing that the Minister's interpretation is the one that an ordinary individual would place upon it.  It seems to me that the Minister, according to his statement, intends, when he has made his orders, that nobody else living in any other area is entitled to exemption from the provisions of this Act.  That is what I understand the Minister's statement to amount to. I should like this section to clearly set out what the Minister intends.  There are several other matters that arise under this section Some people have been talking about the proper grates for burning coal and turf.  I do not know whether Deputies are quite clear that to get the full benefit either out of coal or turf you want special grates or ranges for them. They do not vary a great deal.  At the same time, the question of whether the bars are horizontal or vertical is governed by whether you are going to burn coal or turf.  If you are going to burn turf you would require a bigger fire-box in the range than you would for coal.  If you burn turf in a grate or range made exclusively for coal you will not get the same results.  To my mind, this is part of the policy of the Government, and it creeps into certain other Acts where they do not seem to have one separate and distinct line of policy.  To my mind, the Government ought to have started in on this line&mdash;that a person who is going to use turf requires a grate or range of a certain type and could not use coal.  The person who is going to use coal, and who has got a grate or range <Col N="743" /> for that purpose, cannot use turf.  I do not mean to say that you could not shovel the alternative fuel into them and get some sort of result, but you will not get proper economic working in that way.  That brings me to another point&mdash;that the Government, in my opinion, are trying to manage the affairs of the country to too great an extent under this section.  I suggest to the Minister that, as he is out to promote the sale of a native product, he ought to consider how that could be done with the least trouble and expense to the community.  I suggest that turf is not the only native fuel; that we also have coke and Irish anthracite.  I should like to see some provision in which coke or anthracite could be expressed in terms of turf and that a person whom it suited could use either of these products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree; but I want people to be allowed to substitute coke or anthracite for the compulsory purchase of turf.  I wish to leave the people the utmost freedom. I am speaking now as a Dublin Deputy. There may be some portions of the country to which my remarks do not apply, but there is a considerable number of people who live upstairs in houses and who have a limited storage capacity and I can imagine turf becoming a nuisance to these people.  I, therefore, suggest that where people do not want to use turf they ought to be able to substitute either coke or anthracite.  That ought to be allowed and the people given the utmost freedom. I ask the Minister to consider the question why the people cannot be left&mdash;inside the provisions of a Bill which is obviously framed to benefit, promote, or stimulate the sales of the native product&mdash;to use other fuel if they object to the dust from turf getting on the room or to the smell of turf.  I also request that the Minister should make it perfectly clear that anybody who is not in an appointed area is exempt.</P>

      <P>I listened to the phrase used by the Minister which, it seems to me, has been used in reference to all the legislation enacted by this House for some time past.  He mentioned that it was hoped that they need not use the power which the section confers.  It is not the first time that the Minister made that statement. I remember the same phrase being used by the Minister for Agriculture in connection with Acts which he introduced. But, when it comes down to administering these Acts, what is the position?  They always use every power which is conferred upon them. We are now discussing a Bill in connection with which the Minister himself does not seem to know exactly what he wants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the Dublin householders and to the use of coke and anthracite.  There seems to be nobody to speak in this House for the rural dweller.  Is there no other fuel used in this country except the fuel mentioned by Deputy Dockrell and the Minister?  What about all the firewood that is used in this country? In my own district I see people making a living by carting blocks into the town for sale.  If Deputy Dockrell's contention is reasonable, and I think it is, is it not just as reasonable to ask for an exemption for the householder who buys what is a native fuel just as much as turf is and which is giving employment to those engaged in the sale of it?  Where does the farmer come in in connection with this?  Has he not to use the surplus firewood on his land?  Under this Bill he will be compelled to buy turf.  I only intervene to say that I strongly object to this phrase, that they hope they will not have to use the powers which the Bill confers on them.  Why look for these powers if they do not hope to use them?  While I think there is justification for the point of view put forward by Deputy Dockrell, I think it is only reasonable to consider the people of the rural districts who have to burn what is a native fuel just as much as turf is.</P>

You have one Department which for several years now&mdash;since the Government came into office&mdash;have had before their minds this magnificent turf scheme; then you have another Department with a housing scheme, and the two Departments work independently.  We now gather from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is no approach to the Department of Local Government to see that the new houses which are being built on a Government subsidy will have better accommodation for the consumption of turf than the old <Col N="746" /> houses.

      <P>The idea was there before.  It was there from the moment the Government took office, according to the Minister.  The logical step would be to see that the houses being built were properly fitted in the first instance.  It is quite obvious that the Minister had not thought of it.  It was not made a condition.  Other conditions have been applied to the giving of Government grants.  Roofing of a certain type has to be used, and various other necessary provisions are put in, but here, in a case where it was necessary to make some obvious provision to promote this industry which you say you have in mind, nothing was done.  If that is co-operation I do not know what lack of co-operation is.  Therefore, Deputy Dockrell ought not to be surprised if anthracite coal is not treated in the same way as turf is treated here.  Not only is there a lack of co-operation between the different Government Departments, but there is a lack of co-operation in the different departments of the Minister's mind in regard to those matters.  He may bring in another Bill to promote anthracite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the idea that he should ever advert in this Bill to what he would do in the anthracite Bill is asking too much.  We have heard about not letting your right hand know what your left hand does. The Minister does not let the left side of his brain know what the right side is doing.  We need not expect him then to go outside his Department to the Department of Local Government and make any suggestions to them.  Before the House grants those compulsory powers it ought to be convinced that they will be productive of good. Nothing that the Minister has said on this Bill would convince any man that those powers are going to be utilised to the advantage of the country.  Compulsory powers ought not to be asked for without reason, and the Minister is asking for them without putting forward sufficient reason to induce this House to give them.  He comes to this House asking for those powers and saying: &ldquo;Give them to us.  We hope we will not have to use them.&rdquo;  You can justify a demand for the most despotic powers in that way.  Every despot that the world has ever seen, unless he is mad, would much prefer not to use his despotic powers if the people would only do what he wants them to do without his using those despotic powers; it would be much more favourable for him.  The Minister should not get those powers unless he shows the House sufficient reason for asking for them.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister to go to bed with this headache? Section 13 is the operative section of this Bill, and provides that any person who buys more than 2 cwts. of coal must take a specified quantity of turf. If they buy less than 2 cwts. they are exempted from the provisions of this Bill.  What is to prevent someone who wants to buy a ton of coal from going to the rural retail distributor and saying: &ldquo;I want a ton of coal.  I am going to order a cwt. at 12 o'clock, a cwt. at 1 o'clock, a cwt. at 2 o'clock, and a cwt. every hour until I have accumulated my ton of coal.  I will <Col N="748" /> take delivery of the ton of coal in that way&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Remember we are dealing with small rural towns, the full length of which in many cases is a quarter of a mile.  I am familiar with the circumstances obtaining there, and would have no difficulty whatever in effecting delivery of a ton of coal in individual cwts. to customers in the town in which I live.  They could perfectly easily, and have on occasion, asked for delivery of three or four cwts. of coal at separate hours on the same day.  They got it as a matter of course.  Am I to understand that, having provided for every administrative difficulty which could be thought of in connection with this scheme, the Minister has overlooked this point?  I want to warn him that if I want to buy five cwts. of coal, and my alternative is to take it in five separate orders or take with the coal five cwts. of turf when I do not want turf at all, I will simply buy five separate bags of coal. Do not let the Minister imagine that that would present any insuperable difficulty to any rural retail distributor of coal.  It will not.  Let me take a case in point.  Supposing we have five customers for coal at one end of the town, and they want five cwts. of coal apiece. Nothing is easier than to send out five cwts. in the first lot, and drop one cwt. at each house.  You can then send out another five cwts. later on in the day and drop one cwt. at each house, and so on until the five cwts. are delivered.  In any case you would have to send out five cwts. to each house to meet each individual order, and to avoid the necessity for delivering unwanted turf you simply drop each individual cwt. as you go.  In that way the whole Bill ceases to be operative.  I just want to give the Minister that headache to go to bed with, because I think if he consults with any of his experts, or with any of his colleagues who are <Col N="749" /> familiar with rural trade, they will tell him that the procedure I have here outlined for him is not only eminently practicable but absolutely certain of operation in the event of this Bill passing. I mention the thing at this juncture because the Bill is a farce and a joke.  It is simply another piece of evidence of the growing Hitlerism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who loves to have the right to tell everybody in this country what they will burn, what they will do, and how and when they will do it.  The fact is that he is becoming gradually obsessed with the idea that he can run everybody's business in the country.</P>

      <P>The difference is that the Minister is seeking statutory power to give force to his words, and it is only right for him to realise that there are limitations.  He has reached them so far as Section 13 is concerned. The Bill is a joke, and therefore it is unnecessary to put down amendments to try to bring it into line with realities.  It is a bad Bill, and if it did operate it would have very undesirable effects, but Section 13 blows the whole bottom out of it in so far as the distribution of coal in rural areas is concerned.  I gather that it is the Minister's attention to apply the Bill only in rural areas at the present time; there is no question of applying it in the cities.  I think, then, that the House need not seriously worry, because the compulsory purchase of turf with coal will in fact be as rare as the white blackbird.</P>

      <P>The Deputy presumably refers to the written examination for bilingual certificates held annually in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the examination for bilingual certificates is to ascertain whether the teachers attending it have a sufficient command of Irish to use <Col N="610" /> the language as a medium of instruction in the schools.  The programme and question papers for the March examination for this certificate are designed mainly for teachers who have been serving in the schools for a number of years.  The papers, for instance, do not include questions which would test the candidates' general knowledge nor which would require the candidates to memorise poetry&mdash;restrictions in the setting of the papers which would not be applied if they were intended solely for newly-trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Students in training are examined for both the ordinary certificate and the bilingual certificate at the final training college examination held at the conclusion of their course.  Newly-trained teachers who have not secured the bilingual certificate at that examination are afforded an opportunity later of attending the March examination for serving teachers.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I see no reason for adopting the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
