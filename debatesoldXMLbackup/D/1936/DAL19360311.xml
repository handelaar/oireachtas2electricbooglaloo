      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This Bill is intended to implement an agreement arrived at between the Corporation of Dublin, the Dublin Board of Public Health and the trustees of the House of Recovery and Fever Hospital, Cork Street, Dublin, with a view to the provision of improved institutional accommodation for cases of infectious disease occurring in Dublin City and County.  The principal institution at present available for the treatment of such patients is the Cork Street Fever Hospital, founded about 130 years ago, and which is under the control of a voluntary association incorporated by charter in 1903 under the name of the House of Recovery and Fever Hospital, Cork Street, Dublin.  This institution contains about 250 beds.  A convalescent home situated at Beneavin, Finglas, County Dublin, is owned by the same body.  There are also beds for cases of infectious disease available in Clonskeagh Fever Hospital and in several of the general hospitals in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent epidemics of diphtheria and scarlet fever in Dublin City and portions of Dublin County have demonstrated that the existing institutional accommodation for dealing with cases of infectious disease in these areas is inadequate.  A grant has already been made available from sweepstakes funds for the extension of the Cork Street Fever Hospital, but it is not possible to provide any further suitable accommodation for the purpose on the site of the present institution, and the continuance of a fever hospital in the midst of a densely populated area is open to serious objection.  It is, therefore, necessary to obtain a new site and it is deemed desirable that the proposed new institution should provide sufficient facilities for the treatment of all cases of infectious disease occurring in Dublin City and County so as to obviate the present objectionable arrangement under which such patients are dealt with in several institutions, and are <Col N="1937" /> received into hospitals in which other non-infectious cases are treated.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as the great majority of the patients dealt with in Cork Street Fever Hospital are paid for by the Dublin Corporation and the board of public health, it is obvious that these authorities should be represented on the governing board of the fever hospital which is to serve their administrative areas.  The grant already made from sweepstakes funds to the trustees of the Cork Street Fever Hospital will be made available in respect of the expenditure involved in the provision of the new hospital. The chargeability of the cost of administering the new institution has also been agreed upon.  The annual establishment expenses will be payable by the Dublin Corporation and the board of public health in the proportion of the respective valuations of the City and County of Dublin, while the patients' expenses will be defrayed by the sanitary authority of the area in which the patients have resided before being sent to the institution.  I will now give a general summary of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains the title and definition clauses, and authorises the fixing of an appointed day on which these provisions shall come into force.  Arrangements are provided for the election of representatives of the trustees administering the present fever hospital to the proposed Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  The usual powers are given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to hold sworn inquiries and to incur necessary expenditure in connection with the exercise of his functions under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill authorises the establishment on the appointed day of a board entitled the Dublin Fever Hospital Board to administer the existing fever hospital at Cork Street, Dublin, and the convalescent home at Beneavin, Finglas, and to establish and maintain a new fever hospital in due course.  This board is to consist of 20 members, comprising seven representatives of the Dublin Corporation, three representatives of the Dublin Board of Public Health, seven representatives of the corporate body at <Col N="1938" /> present administering the Cork Street Fever Hospital and three representatives appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the arrangements for election of these various representatives and deals with their tenure of office and the procedure to be observed in carrying out the business of the hospital board.  It is prescribed that a resident medical superintendent shall be appointed by the board who shall be responsible for the internal administration of the hospital and convalescent home, but who shall in the performance of his duties carry out any directions given by the medical superintendent officer of health of Dublin City.  The hospital board are further authorised to appoint and remove officers where necessary, subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the necessary enactments for dealing with such officers are applied.</P>
    <P>Authority is given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to make rules governing the discharge of patients from the fever hospital and convalescent home, while the hospital board are empowered to make any necessary regulations for the conduct and management of the institutions and for the admission and control of patients.  The board are required to admit into their institution so far as accommodation is available, cases of infectious disease sent by any medical officer in Dublin County Borough and Dublin County, and they are empowered to enter into agreements with sanitary authorities of outside districts for the treatment in the institution of patients sent by such sanitary authorities.  The medical superintendent officer of health of Dublin County Borough and the county medical officer of health for Dublin County are to be entitled to enter and inspect the board's institutions and to engage in research work in consultation with the resident medical superintendent.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets forth the procedure for defraying expenditure incurred by the hospital board in providing and maintaining the necessary institutions for the treatment of infectious disease, and for this purpose such expenditure is <Col N="1939" /> classified either as establishment expenses or patients' expenses.  Establishment expenses, which may be roughly defined as the general overhead expenses such as those of a capital nature and the cost of staff and general services, are to be defrayed by the Dublin Corporation and the board of public health in the proportion of the respective valuations of Dublin City and County.  Patients' expenses include, generally, the cost of food and medicines and other matters provided for the treatment of individual patients. These expenses are to be defrayed by the corporation in respect of patients admitted from Dublin City and by the board of public health in respect of patients admitted from Dublin County.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the expenses payable by the corporation, being defrayed from the Municipal Fund, and for the expenses payable by the board of public health, being raised by means of the poor rate as a county-at-large charge.  Provisions are included in the Bill dealing with the borrowing powers of the hospital board, the audit of their accounts, their power to acquire and dispose of lands, to make contracts, to accept endowments, and to exercise, generally, the powers conferred on a hospital board in relation to any institution under their control.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is authorised to make regulations in regard to the financial relations between the hospital board and the corporation and board of public health.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides that the hospital board shall, as soon as possible after their first meeting, submit to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health a scheme setting out the proposed arrangements for the establishment of a new fever hospital in or near the City of Dublin, including particulars of the intended site, plans and estimated cost.  The scheme may be approved by the Minister with or without modifications, and he shall then fix a period within which the new fever hospital is to be established.  The hospital board are thereupon to erect and equip a hospital to be known as the Dublin fever hospital in accordance with the approved scheme, and are empowered to administer that institution <Col N="1940" /> when provided.  They are also authorised, subject to the Minister's consent, to extend, alter or otherwise improve the new fever hospital in due course, and to erect, establish and improve a convalescent home.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill prescribes that on the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; the body corporate and the committee of the Cork Street Fever Hospital shall be dissolved, and their property, assets and liabilities shall pass to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  Special provisions are made for the preservation and continuance of existing contracts of the dissolved body and of any pending legal proceedings, as well as for the transfer of their officers and servants to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  The rights of these officers and employees are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains transitory provisions for the control of the existing fever hospital and convalescent home as from the appointed day, and authorises the closing of the existing hospital and the existing home when such course may be deemed necessary, subject to the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and the control of the Minister is also retained in regard to expenditure on extending or improving the existing hospital or convalescent home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the Second Reading of this Bill, there are a few matters which I should like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The first thing I would suggest to him is that he ought to consider incorporating the old name, House of Recovery, in the title of the new fever hospital.  It would be an indication of the continuity of the hospital started 130 years ago.  I think I am right in saying that the present Cork Street Fever Hospital was about the first of its kind in Ireland or Great Britain, and I think it would be a great compliment to those who have carried on this class of treatment in Dublin for so many years to continue the old name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision of accommodation in the new hospital, there is some suggestion that there will be about 400 beds.  I do not know whether <Col N="1941" /> that is correct, but I should like to point out, in connection with the treatment of measles and other epidemics that occur, say, every two years, that the Cork Street Hospital has not been able to cope with the number of cases. In 1935, application for treatment was made by 2,289 persons, and 538 of those were refused.  One hundred and fifty-four of them could receive appropriate treatment in their own homes or in hospital, but 584 were suitable and could have been admitted to Cork Street Fever Hospital had accommodation been available.  In the first five weeks of 1936 there has been an alarming increase.  No less than 132 cases have had to be refused through want of accommodation.  Of these, 122 were suitable for admission to the hospital. Those cases relate to scarlatina, fever, diphtheria and measles.  I think that whatever consideration is being given to the capacity of the new hospital, some opinion is advanced that having regard to the amount of better housing conditions, sanitation and such like, there is less danger of those epidemics occurring.  I am sorry that from the particulars we have before us, such does not appear to be the case; it is quite the contrary.  The reason, I think, is that, if I may say so, there is more of an accumulation of children in the new housing areas than in any other part of the city, with the result that measles and such diseases, which are usually very contagious, are more inclined to spread.  I just make that point in order to urge on the Minister that in the provision for the new hospital every care should be taken that, if we are going to make an improvement at all, the improvement will be in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Sub-section 2 of section 21 says:</P>
    <P>The resident medical superintendent shall be responsible to the hospital board... and shall in the performance of his duties observe and carry out any directions given by the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Here we find the resident medical superintendent having to carry out the instructions of the medical officer of health and the hospital board.  Perhaps <Col N="1942" /> the Minister would explain in what way it is intended that should be done.  I should like also if the Minister would explain the wording of section 28 which says:</P>
    <P>The medical superintendent officer of health... shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter any institution... and to inspect such institution and the arrangements made for the care of patients therein and to inspect and examine respectively the city patients and the county patients in such institution. ...</P>
    <P>The implication there is that this officer can come into the hospital without acquainting the medical superintendent. I would suggest to the Minister that the wording of that section might be improved on, or perhaps when he explains what is in his mind about the word &ldquo;examine&rdquo; it may satisfy all concerned.  Having made those few points, I support the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Without doubt, all sections of the House will welcome the introduction of this Bill, in view of the principle that has been established by the Bill, but there are a few points which, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary could answer, if not now, at a later date.  There are other difficulties confronting the citizens of Dublin, and in particular members, say, of the Dublin Corporation, with regard to hospital accommodation for cases of fever and other diseases.  While I know that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department have been in consultation with the county council and also with officials of the Dublin Corporation, I should like to know from him whether any decision has been taken with regard to a definite fixing of the site for this new hospital.  My reason for raising the point is that some of us in the Dublin Corporation have for some considerable time been advocating that the Clonskea institution, which is at present used for fever cases, should be used as an institution to take care of tuberculosis cases amongst infants, as the present practice which exists of infants suffering from tuberculosis being sent to Crooksling with adult cases is certainly not correct.  If <Col N="1943" /> it is going to be the decision of the Department to acquire the Clonskea site, I should like to know what arrangement is being made for the development of the other ideal.  I am sure other members of the Corporation in the House here are aware of that situation.  I think it was discussed some considerable time ago and left in abeyance pending the introduction of this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle has dealt with the number of beds that it is proposed to have in this new hospital, and I am wondering whether it would be wiser, now that this new scheme is being embarked on, to have a hospital with considerably more accommodation than is at present being provided for.  It is quite true, as Deputy Doyle has said, that the present institution which is covered by this Bill has on occasions been unable to cope with the cases when epidemics arise.  Consequently, although we are going to increase the accommodation, at great cost, from 250 beds to about 400 beds, I think that that is not ample provision at all. I should like to say that I am sure every one of us would prefer to see unoccupied beds in a hospital of this kind than to hear, as we all do from time to time, that beds are not available for cases, and that great difficulties arise.  From the point of view of the amount of money that is going to be spent, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary ought seriously to consider making much more accommodation available than is evidently conceived in this Bill.  I want to again emphasise that I should like the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying to give us, if he can, an indication as to what is going to be done with regard to providing accommodation for infant cases of tuberculosis.  As I said before, I believe the corporation hoped at some time to acquire Clonskea&mdash; which is at present being used as a fever hospital, chiefly for children&mdash;for this particular purpose.  I think the present practice of sending infant children to mix with adult patients in the Crooksling Sanatorium is, to say the least of it, scandalous.  If the intention is to acquire the Clonskea site for the removal of the present Cork <Col N="1944" /> Street Hospital to that area, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give us some indication as to what is going to be done about the other problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the two Deputies who have spoken in welcoming the Bill which the Parliamentary Secretary has explained to us.  I think he and the Minister are to be congratulated on coming forward with this Bill to bring about a very much needed reform.  Deputy Doyle has spoken of the great service that has been done to Dublin for over a century by the Cork Street Fever Hospital, a similar service being rendered in many institutions by such purely voluntary bodies as the Cork Street Hospital was. I join with Deputy Doyle in suggesting that part of the name of the old hospital should be incorporated in the name of the new one, in order to perpetuate some recognition of the debt which the citizens of Dublin are under to the philanthropic people who established and managed this hospital for many years, and to show the continuity of the new institution with that old institution.  While that institution gave great service to the city, it was quite clear that its accommodation and equipment were not adequate for modern requirements. Having studied this Bill, I believe that the scheme which has been brought forward to-day is as efficient a scheme as one could devise for providing suitable accommodation for fever cases in Dublin city and county in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points on which I should like to get some additional information from the Parliamentary Secretary, if he can give it.  He mentioned that the grants already made to the Cork Street Hospital from the Sweepstakes Fund will be available towards the cost of building the new institution.  I do not know the amount of those grants or whether the grants already given are adequate for the purpose of building this hospital.  If not, I should like to know if the Minister is prepared to make such a further grant from the Sweepstakes Fund as will erect the institution and <Col N="1945" /> equip it, or is the whole of that expense to fall on the public health authorities of Dublin City and County?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary give us some indication also as to what is the total amount he expects would be needed to build and equip this institution? Reference has been made by, I think, Deputy Doyle and Deputy Briscoe to the suggestion that the hospital should be built to accommodate 400 patients. I do not know if there is any limitation in the Bill as to the number of beds in the hospital or the number of patients to be accommodated.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if it is his intention, at the moment, at any rate, that it should accommodate 400 patients?  I do not suppose that anybody would consider the building and equipment of a smaller institution than one with 400 beds.</P>
    <P>As to the point that Deputy Briscoe has raised&mdash;the selection of the site&mdash; I would say that is a matter of very great importance and not merely from the point of view from which the Deputy approached the subject.  I was very glad to hear that aspect of the matter put forward by Deputy Briscoe and to hear this view emphasised as coming from an important representative of the City of Dublin. As regards the position of the hospital itself, there is no doubt that its site is a matter of very great importance.  The selection of the site taken will rest with the governing body of the hospital and, will, I take it, also be subject to the Minister's approval. With modern transport facilities, proximity to the centre of the city is not a matter of primary importance, more particularly in the case of such an institution as the fever hospital, where ordinarily there would be no visitors. For that reason there is no necessity why those in charge of selecting the site should confine themselves to the neighbourhood of the populous part of the city or, say, to the neighbourhood of Clonskeagh.  What is of extreme importance in the choice of a site is that there should be plenty of open space around it, plenty of space within its grounds and, if possible, plenty of open space outside.  Any one who has happened to visit the fever hospital <Col N="1946" /> in the City of Belfast will have noticed that the fever hospital is some way outside the city and will have noticed also how much more attractive that has made the hospital.  There you have several wings of the hospital isolated and connected by covered corridors with each other.  The hospital there stands out as a series of pavilions in a beautiful garden.  Such surroundings have more than an æsthetic beauty and they add to the value of the treatment in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that it was intended that the fever wings in the existing hospitals would be closed.  I do not desire to comment on that.  I do not know whether that is provided for in the Bill or not or whether it will still be in the power of the existing hospitals to maintain separate wings as fever hospitals cut off from the rest of the hospital.  If it is the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister that these wings should be closed in the existing hospitals, I think myself that that would be a desirable thing.  I do not know whether that is provided for in this Bill and I do not know whether it would be desirable to provide for it in the Bill.  That is a matter on which I would like to have the views of the medical officers of health of Dublin City and County.</P>
    <P>In the past it was almost necessary to maintain those wings for the purpose of clinical teaching.  I understand that under the present and future management of this hospital there will be adequate arrangements for clinical teaching.  That is the only respect in which the proximity of this hospital to the city appears to be of importance.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fever wings as if they were in the same building. I do not think that that is so.  In Dublin, in every case, the section of the hospital devoted to fever cases is entirely separated structurally from the rest of the building.  It has a different entrance from the main building, the part which is occupied by the ordinary patients.  I welcome this Bill.  I think its scheme is a good one, and I wish the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the governing body of the hospital success in carrying it <Col N="1947" /> through.  It will be a great boon to the residents of Dublin.  I hope that the accommodation will be such and the structure of the building such as to be capable of expansion in the event of an epidemic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Deputies from the city who have already spoken I welcome this Bill whole-heartedly. Deputy Rowlette has touched on a number of points that I would like to have cleared up by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.  One is what it is they propose to do with the old building of the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  I understand that there is a suggestion in the Department of Local Government and Public Health that the old buildings, or some of them &mdash;I hope none of them&mdash;are to be handed over to the Coombe Maternity Hospital, in fact that the whole site of the old Cork Street Fever Hospital is to be handed over to the Coombe Maternity Hospital, and that some of those buildings are to be kept for maternity purposes.  If that is so I personally would most strongly object and I hope every Deputy in this House will join with me in that objection. There is sufficient money to build a suitable building for the Coombe Maternity Hospital purposes.  Some time ago I brought this matter to the notice of one of the hospital boards and asked them what they would do with the old buildings of the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  One member of the board said, &ldquo;Knock them down.&rdquo;  The suggestion of the Hospitals Commission, I understand, was that some of the old buildings of the Cork Street Fever Hospital were to be retained and that the Coombe Maternity Hospital would get the site.  The suggestion was that some of the buildings used for fever purposes would be left standing.  I mentioned the matter at this particular board, and one well-known city doctor said, &ldquo;We will knock them down,&rdquo; while another said, &ldquo;We will burn the damned thing.&rdquo;  I agree with the second view.  I believe that rather than hand them over for maternity purposes that these buildings should be burned down.  I believe when the Cork Street Fever Hospital is given over to the Coombe Hospital <Col N="1948" /> that not a brick of the place should be left standing.  It will be better and cheaper in the end to take it all down and erect a new building on the site. I wish to join with other speakers in paying a tribute to the Hospitals Board which has done so much for Dublin City in the past in their management of Cork Street.</P>

      <P>I hope the advice given by the Lord Mayor of Dublin will not be taken; otherwise premiums on insurance in the city would soar.  I join with him, and with previous speakers in welcoming this Bill.  I can also extend a welcome to the Bill from the Dublin County Council and the Dublin Board of Health.  Deputy Rowlette spoke with that technical knowledge upon this matter which, of course, I could not at all claim in connection with this Bill.  I accept his analysis of the Bill from the medical standpoint when he said it was a good Bill and one which could scarcely be improved upon.  That was a great tribute coming from Deputy Rowlette &mdash;a distinguished member of this House with no associations with the Government to which he saw fit to pay it.  I think it is a tribute in which we can all join, when such independent testimony as to the value of the Bill is made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of points I would like to develop.  The first is this: Fever, I understand, is very largely due to bad housing and bad food, and on these two points I wish to say a word.  This hospital, I presume like all other hospitals, will be endowed.  Before the Minister for Local Government, at the moment, is a requisition from the Dublin Corporation that the endowment fund should be invested in housing.  Whatever endowment moneys are available, the Dublin Corporation, and the board of health are prepared to accept for the building of houses.  There is I understand a considerable amount of money from that fund that finds its way into British War Loan.  I suggest to the Minister that his last answer to the Dublin Corporation upon this matter should not be his final answer. At any rate the Dublin Corporation <Col N="1949" /> are going to keep on knocking at the door, and indeed another messenger is now on the way.</P>
    <P>I pressed on the Parliamentary Secretary, the last time this Bill was before the House, to provide good milk for the citizens.  If he would carry out what was proposed in the Bill to be carried out he would not allow a loop-hole to exist whereby that section of the Bill could be got around by a request from the Minister for Agriculture to allow milk into Dublin which should not be allowed in.  That milk is coming into Dublin at the rate of 10,000 gallons a day at present, and it is not up to the specification of milk for human consumption in either Northern Ireland or Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two observations I wish to make in connection with this Bill.  One is that I wish the erection of fever hospitals in rural Ireland could be proceeded with upon the same or similar lines as the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  I do not want to labour that at any length because it might make me stray from the context of this Bill.  But I think <Col N="1950" /> the Minister will agree that when money of the same kind is necessary to be spent on hospital accommodation it ought not to be wasted.  The other point is one of very great importance to this House.  The board of Cork Street Hospital will be very largely under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Until recently I would have concurred without hesitation in any proposal that permitted the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to set such a service upon its feet.  I would have been satisfied that he would have done that with no other object in view than the best interests of the sick poor and the interests of the prospective occupants of the fever hospital.  But now I desire to address this categorical question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister: Whether his attention has been drawn to the utterance made recently by Deputy Corbett at the Galway Board of Health to the effect that the Minister was habitually overridden by permanent officials in his Department and that there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence that Freemason opinion bore upon the decisions of the Department; and whether the Minister has any information that these allegations made by Deputy Corbett are in fact true.  If the Minister is a Freemasonridden slave we ought to consider well whether Cork Street Hospital ought to be run by Freemasons.  If he is a hoodwinked fool, as suggested by Deputy Corbett, we ought to consider whether he is a proper person to set it going.  Heaven forbid that fever patients should be given over to Freemasons and fools for care.  If these charges are not true, we only hear echoed from the lips of Deputy Corbett, charges which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he was Deputy O'Kelly, made himself against Deputy Mulcahy when he was Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I remember the eloquence with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government used to shriek Freemasonry across this House at Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Mulcahy.  I <Col N="1951" /> remember how they used to charge that Deputy Blythe was in the pocket of Freemasons and how the Freemasons used to comb Deputy McGilligan out of their hair.  Is it any wonder if Deputy Corbett will have discovered at the next election that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is a Freemason and, I suppose that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is infesting the hair of the Freemasons.  I think it is wise that the effect of this kind of thing should be known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that this House should realise first that Ministers of this State were not susceptible to any kind of improper pressure during the last Administration, and that it is as false and as libellous and as unscrupulous to allege such pressure and intimidation against the Minister for Local Government to-day as it was to level them against Deputy Mulcahy when he held that office five or six years ago. It is as necessary to bring home to the country the fraudulent libels that were published about those men as it is to do the excellent work contemplated in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister for Local Government will carry out the duties in connection with this excellent proposal scrupulously, having received the advice of competent civil servants, and having weighed that advice carefully, as it is his duty to weigh it.  I am satisfied that he will not be hoodwinked by civil servants and I am satisfied that no civil servant will seek to hoodwink him.  I am satisfied that he will not allow the influence of anybody outside this House to sway his judgement improperly; and that neither Freemasons nor Knights of Columbanus or any other sectarian body in this country will concern itself to have anything done in regard to the Cork Street Fever Hospital or the affairs of the Galway Board of Health that they do not believe to be in the best interests of the country.  I think it is right that the Minister for Local <Col N="1952" /> Government should take this opportunity to scatter ashes on his own head and to cry &ldquo;Peccavi; I cannot blame Deputy Corbett for saying to-day about me what I delighted in saying about my predecessors six or seven years ago&rdquo;&mdash;with just as much truth, just as much foundation, and just as much justification as Deputy Corbett has for saying it about the Minister to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Doyle and Deputy Rowlette as to the name of the new institution is a point which has not been raised before.  The proposed name of the new institution has, I understand, been agreed upon by the trustees, the representatives of the Dublin Corporation and of the Dublin Board of Health.  If, however, there is any very strong feeling in favour of a change in the name of the institution, I do not see that there can be any radical objection to it, but it is the first time the point has been raised.  On the question of the number of beds, I am quite sure that everybody is anxious that adequate provision should be made for the future as far as we can reasonably anticipate the demands that will be made upon those beds. At the present time, in the existing institution, the number of beds is 250 approximately, and it is proposed to provide 400 in the new fever hospital. I am not satisfied that that is not adequate provision, but, at any rate, on the new site there will be plenty of room for future development, and if we begin by providing a 400-bed institution and plan our institution in such a way that it can be advantageously extended in the future, I think the position is sufficiently safe to satisfy anybody.  If it is necessary to add 100 beds at some future time it can easily be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle is anxious that Section 28 should be explained.  It seems to me that it is not too easy to put it in any clearer language than is set out in the section.  The medical officer of health for County Dublin and the medical officer of health for the borough shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter any institution, being a fever hospital or convalescent home which is for the time <Col N="1953" /> being being managed and controlled by the hospital board, and to inspect such institution, the arrangements made for the care of patients therein and to inspect and examine respectively the city patients and the county patients in such institution.  Deputy Doyle apparently has some anxiety as to whether the medical officers of health under this section may consider themselves free to go into an institution at any time they feel so disposed, without acquainting the resident medical superintendent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to be set out in the Bill that previous to going in to inspect an institution or examine patients it shall be a statutory obligation on them to inform and consult with the resident medical superintendent, but I think it can, with absolute safety, be assumed that the medical officers of health will not visit an institution and examine the patients unless after consultation and in agreement with the resident medical superintendent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but so long as the Deputy is clear as to what the intention of the section is, I am quite satisfied.  Deputy Briscoe is anxious about the question of the site. The Bill, of course, does not deal with the site at all.  A provisional committee is at present engaged in inspecting a number of possible sites, and these will eventually come to the Minister for Local Government for approval.  They will be further inspected by the Minister's technical advisers, and ample opportunity will be offered to members of the corporation, and to any other interested parties, to put forward their views as to the suitability of any of the sites offered, and any views put forward by responsible persons will be very carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not fix the number of beds, as I said earlier.  The ultimate decision on the number of beds will rest with the Minister, after consulting the local authorities concerned.  As to <Col N="1954" /> the capital expenditure that will be incurred in the provision of the new institution, it is not possible at this stage to indicate with any degree of accuracy what the probable cost of a 400-bed institution will be, but, from our experience in providing similar institutions throughout the country, I should say that we are not likely to build and equip a new fever hospital at a much lesser figure than about £300,000.  The existing fever hospital board have in hands, from moneys provided from sweepstake funds, approximately £58,000, and while it is not set out in the Bill, nor is it necessary that it should be, it can with safety be anticipated that the balance of the cost of building and equipping the institution will be borne out of sweepstake funds.</P>
    <P>As to the provision being made for fever cases in general hospitals in Dublin at present, there is no provision in the Bill directed towards preventing general hospitals from having a fever wing.  If it is desirable that such a practice should be discontinued when the new fever hospital is provided, I do not think it will be necessary to have any statutory power to bring that about.  I believe it can be brought about by negotiating in a friendly way with the voluntary hospitals, and that they will be quite in agreement with us if the necessary provision for that particular type of case is found in the new institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne, the Lord Mayor, appears to be concerned as to what purpose the existing fever hospital buildings may be put when the new hospital is provided.  I think it will be a number of years, at any rate, before we will have to deal with that problem, and nothing definite has been decided. Negotiations have taken place between the board of governors of the existing institution and the authorities of the Coombe Hospital, and I understand that a tentative agreement has been reached, but nothing in the nature of a final agreement has been reached.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Byrne will be satisfied that every precaution will be taken to ensure, if the buildings are given over for a maternity hospital or for any other purpose, that the Minister will satisfy himself, whatever the particular <Col N="1955" /> scheme may be, that the public health will not be endangered.  Anyhow, if it is considered necessary to burn the buildings, as Deputy Byrne suggests, I suppose we shall have to burn them; and if it is considered sufficient to demolish them, they will be demolished.  If, in the long run, it is considered that it would be safe to hand them over intact to the new institution, having carefully considered Deputy Byrne's representations and his anxiety, the Minister's ultimate decision will, I am sure, be one that will safeguard the public interest.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are any other points arising out of this discussion. I do not propose to follow Deputy Dillon's diatribe.  We get accustomed to that kind of thing from Deputy Dillon, and I think that the country generally pays just as little attention to Deputy Dillon when he gives vent to such outbursts as the members of the House do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide new arrangements for the regulation of the imports of sugar.  At the present time, the imports of sugar are controlled by the quota system under the Control of Imports Acts.  That method of control is becoming more difficult to operate in consequence of the decline in each year of the quantity of sugar which it is necessary to import, apart from the fact that it causes an appreciable amount of work in the Department of Industry and Commerce in the fixation of quotas, the examination of applications for licences, and the issuing of licences, etc.  The object of the control at present exercised under the quota system&mdash;that is, the restriction of the amount of sugar imported to the figure which corresponds to the gap between home production and home requirements&mdash;can, in our opinion, be best achieved if the work of controlling the imports under the present system by the Department of Industry and Commerce is ended and authority given instead to the sugar manufacturing company, called the Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, to import whatever sugar may be required.  The imports of sugar, as I have said, will continue to decrease and it is obviously more economical to have such imports dealt with by a single organisation like the Sugar Manufacturing Company than by a number of small importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed change in the method of controlling imports has the approval of the interested parties and, in fact, representations were made to me by the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association, which speaks for all the sugar importers in the Saorstát, with a view to having the control of sugar imports transferred to the Sugar Manufacturing Company.  In the view of the sugar importers, as represented by the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association, the new arrangement will prevent the <Col N="1957" /> dislocation of present trading methods. Even if the position should arise, as it probably will arise next year or the following year, that the Sugar Company is in a position to manufacture the whole of the requirements of sugar of the Saorstát, there will still be cases in which, for some special reason in connection with some process of manufacture, it might be necessary to use a particular class of imported sugar.</P>
    <P>If the present system of control were to continue in operation it would mean that, in order to enable a particular importer to bring in a specified quantity of sugar for a special purpose, a quota would have to be fixed in which all other registered importers could share.  Any such importer, when he received his licence, could use that licence for the purpose of importing sugar of a class manufactured by the Sugar Manufacturing Company, and, consequently, the disposal of the company's stocks would be retarded and the financing of these stocks would be rendered somewhat difficult.</P>
    <P>In this Bill it is proposed to give the Executive Council power to make an Order prohibiting the importation of all or any specified varieties of sugar during a specified period. During the period that such prohibition is in force power is given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the application of the Sugar Company, to give to that Company, and to that Company only, a licence to import specified quantities of particular varieties of sugar.  It is intended that the Company will make no profit on the importing and merchandising trade which it will thus be given, inasmuch as there is power to charge the Company a fee for the licence, and that fee will be arranged so as to ensure that the Company will have no profit, allowing, of course, a reasonable margin for handling the imports and for overhead expenses.</P>
    <P>The price of foreign sugar fluctuates. At present, and for some time past, foreign sugar, plus import duty, has been slightly less than the price at which home-produced sugar is available. During last year, for example, in the period in which home-manufactured sugar was not available, that <Col N="1958" /> difference in prices existed, but the difference in prices between imported sugar, plus customs duty, and the home-produced sugar was not sufficient to enable a reduction in price to consumers to be effected.  The smallest reduction in price is a farthing. The difference was not sufficient to enable a reduction of one farthing in the price to be made, and so the difference became an increased profit for the importers.  If that situation should exist in future the difference will be taken up by the licence fee for the benefit of the Exchequer and not for the benefit of the Company.  The price of sugar, which has been increasing on the world market recently, may move forward to a point at which the imported sugar, plus duty, will be slightly dearer than the price at which home-produced sugar is made available.  In such circumstances a fee will not be charged.</P>
    <P>Last year the production of the sugar company was about 30,000 tons short of the total quantity required to meet all the needs of the Saorstát. This year the total production will be about 18,000 tons short; that quantity will have to be imported over some period in the middle of the year.  We consider that one of the advantages which it is believed will follow from the adoption of this better method of controlling imports, will be that a uniform price of sugar will be maintained all the year round and that will operate in respect of the commercial users of sugar in a manner which will ensure that one manufacturer will not have any undue advantage over another.  If, for instance, a manufacturer of jam purchased home-produced sugar and had it in stock for the purposes of his factory, he might be at a disadvantage compared with another manufacturer whose stock just ran out at the period when the home-produced sugar became exhausted and who was permitted to import sugar at a reduced price.  The advantage of the uniform price throughout the year will be obvious to anybody.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill needs any further explanation.  It is a simple measure, designed particularly to effect that change in the method of controlling imports.  In future, instead of <Col N="1959" /> licences for the amount required to supplement our production being issued to persons on the register of sugar importers, they will be issued only to the sugar company.  That change is made at the request and with the consent of the sugar importers, who believe it will lead to an improvement in the present position.  I recommend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Minister when he says that very little need now be added to what he has said.  I am very glad to see Deputy Corry in the House, because the proposal made here is one that requires to be discussed from many aspects.  One is as to the point of view of the person who has to buy sugar as a very necessary item in family provisions.  Another point of view is the farmers'.  While I might say some things from the farmers' point of view on this particular subject, I think Deputy Corry has been saying things from the farmers' point of view that ought to be repeated in this discussion here.  The Minister's proposal is to hand over the whole sugar situation in this country to the sugar company and to pull down the blinds completely on the people here as to what the sugar situation is outside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When additional taxes were being put on sugar in order to give the sugar company here greater control over the purse of the sugar-buying person 12 months or so ago, the explanation given was that sugar was being dumped here.  One aspect that concerns me is that we are paying £1,203,000 more across the counter for our sugar than our people would be paying if they were buying their sugar across the counter in Northern Ireland.  I base that statement on an estimate that the sugar consumption in this country is about 104,000 tons. We have been told by figures published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> that 66,031 tons of sugar were produced by the sugar factories in this country in 1934-35.  If we take the acreage now being devoted to beet, 57,288 acres&mdash; that was the figure for last year&mdash;then the sugar factories are going to provide this year 84,000 tons of sugar.  I <Col N="1960" /> am basing my estimate of the cost over Northern Ireland's payments on the fact that we will probably import 20,000 tons, leading up to a consumption of 104,000 tons.</P>
    <P>We want to know why we should be paying that amount and who is getting the benefit of it.  The Minister will tell us that the farmers are getting the benefit of it.  Deputy Corry will have quite a number of long-drawn-out replies to that.  Someone else will tell us that farm workers are getting more money as a result of the sugar beet growing.  I think if there are any members of the Labour Party present in the House while we are discussing the price of sugar, they will be able to say three or four things on that.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House deals with the transfer of the control of the imports of sugar to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann Teoranta.  Such transfer may react on the price of the home-grown product, but the policy of growing beet and manufacturing sugar here does not arise for discussion.  That policy has been decided by the Oireachtas. If the Deputy maintains that the proposals in this Bill will react unfavourably on home prices, he is entitled so to argue.</P>

On a point of order, I would put it to you, Sir, that in discussing this Bill I am entitled to discuss the gross income the farmer gets for the growing of beet; the gross income that goes to the agricultural worker in this country for the growing of beet; the amount that is spent on cartage; the amount that comes in to the revenue in excise duty; the amount that comes into the revenue in Customs duty; the amount that the company get by way of subsidy, and the total amount of money that our people pay across the counter; together with the actual effect of those sugar-beet proposals on the growing of crops of a particular kind.  Would I be in order in discussing that whereas in the Province of Leinster between 1931 and 1935, there was an increase of £18,079 acres of beet, to the extent of 13,357 acres, that was a substitution for mangolds and for turnips&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am putting a point of order.  The whole finances of sugar purchasing and sugar production by this company, I submit, are in order, and where are we going in the matter of our prospects of continuing to produce beet.  I submit that we are in order in doing this, Sir, by reason of the fact that this proposal actually does set out to put the company into the position of controlling in every possible way everything in regard to sugar, as well as to prevent us from knowing or feeling anything <Col N="1962" /> about the outside world price with regard to sugar.  I should like to have your ruling on that.</P>

      <P>On a further point of order.  May I submit, in view of the fact that this is a proposal to grant a complete monopoly to the Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, it is relevant for us to discuss the capacity shown by that organisation to administer so much of the sugar market as they already control.  When we come to decide whether the rest of the sugar market should be placed in their safe keeping, may we not argue that as a result of the expenses involved in the production of beet sugar by Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, and the resulting distribution of the proceeds of the sugar manufactured amongst farmer, labourer, consumer and company, we are not satisfied to hand over the remainder of the sugar market to this company for administration, inasmuch as we think it could be better administered and more economically administered and more advantageously administered from the point of view of the consumer if it is left in the hands of those who are already handling the sugar market, which it is now proposed to hand over to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.  There are two specific points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you rule on that, a Chinn Comhairle, I want to raise a point of order.  I gathered from your ruling that the price of sugar could be discussed on this Bill.  This Bill has no relation to the price of sugar. It relates only to the method of the control of importation.  Under the existing method, the quantity of sugar to be imported is determined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has so lucidly expressed this observation, I <Col N="1963" /> should like to say that this Bill does definitely impose a further cost on the price of sugar.  The Minister has in this Bill a clause which says that he may charge a certain fee for a licence. That is in addition to and not in substitution for any previous charge.  The Excise duty is already there.  The Excise duty on sugar manufactured in this country stands at 4/8.  The Customs duty is 21/-.  The duty is added to by reason of the cost of the licence, which is included in this Bill. Further, there is a point which has already been made by Deputy Dillon, and to some extent by Deputy Mulcahy, that a monopoly is now being conferred by reason of this measure, and whatever competition there was between the imported sugar and the sugar that is manufactured here, that competition now ceases.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There was this competition, that the average price, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, for sugar delivered on the quays in Dublin was 7/6 per cwt., and the average price of sugar manufactured here is 16/4 per cwt. in addition to that.  Once this Bill passes, the sugar company has not alone a monopoly, but it has the right to fix any price it pleases.  There is no control over it; the Minister has taken none and exercises none.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>That is not a point of order.  A rather alarming prospect has been opened up by Deputy Mulcahy and to a certain extent by Deputy Dillon.  As stated, this Bill deals with one specific thing. There was an import of sugar controlled-by quotas.  As I understand this Bill, it is proposed to transfer the control of import now to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The control of import will remain with the Minister. <Col N="1964" /> The actual quantity will be determined by the Minister.  It is proposed that licences will be issued to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences will be issued by Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.  The question of Customs duty does not arise.  Neither does the policy of beet growing, which is based on legislation and cannot be discussed on a measure of this kind; as existing legislation cannot be criticised, being subject only to repeal by express motion or a Bill.  The production of beet, the policy of manufacturing sugar, and the price the farmers obtain, do not arise.</P>

May I not argue that Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, from its record in the manufacture of beet sugar, is not worthy of confidence in the administration of a sugar monopoly, and may I not advance reasons to convince the House that such a monopoly should be withheld from that institution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely I must be allowed to argue that as the result of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann's administration of that part of the sugar market which has been secured to them by legislation they are charging too much to the consumer, paying too little to the producer, and that there are thousands of pounds being lost? Could I not so argue, and then go on to say: &ldquo;If this be the case in regard to the sugar they are actually producing, what must we anticipate if we give them the remainder of the market and allow them to conduct the same transactions with regard to that?&rdquo; It is a matter of fundamental importance to the Exchequer and to the consumer. and to the producer in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to help you as well as I can, Sir, and you can stop me if I am going off the track. I am quoting, from the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 15th October, 1934, a statement which was made by Mr. J.B. Connell, Vice-Chairman of the Irish Sugar Company:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Their prices included the delivery to over 30 of the most important distributing centres in the Free State, and this should enable the sugar to be sold retail in these centres at 3¼d. a lb.  They had information as to the retail price in several important towns in the Free State, and those prices varied from 3d. to 3½d. per lb... There appeared to be no reason why the retail price should be more than 3¼d. in any of the towns to which the Board proposed to deliver.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now that is a responsible official of the company, but the Minister tells us to-day that the retail price of sugar is 3½d. per pound.  Taking it, on the average, that the retail price of sugar sold in the country is 3½d. per pound&mdash; and the Minister must be aware that some of the sugar used is sold for 3¾d. per lb., and that there are places where sugar is actually sold at 4d. per lb.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it is necessary for us to get some information as to why it is necessary for people to pay so much for sugar and where the money that they do pay goes.  All that is now in the hands of the company. That is the proposal.  So that across the counters in this country people pay £3,397,000, assuming that they consume 104,000 tons of sugar. That is to say, the people are paying £1,213,000 more than they should pay if they bought their sugar under Northern Ireland conditions.  That figure is very much too high.  The Minister is the only person in a position to examine how the unnecessarily high charge comes about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for discussing this thing in the House is not that I can tell the Minister where the unnecessary high charge is, or who is getting some of this money they ought not to get but that it is necessary to try to do it.  It <Col N="1966" /> took two years' systematic discussion of the housing statistics with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to put this House and the country in the position that they knew how many houses were really being built in the country and what the country would really have to pay for them. It is my view that the country and the House should know the exact number of houses built and the exact amount of money they cost.  If that is so, it is quite as important that the country should know the exact amount of money being paid over the counters throughout the country for one of the greatest necessaries of life.  It is important also to know where that money goes to when we arrive at the figure.  It is for that reason, Sir, that I want to know from the Minister what are the amounts that are going in particular directions, and in case it might be imposing too much on the Chair, I will not elaborate as to where these figures come from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that when I asked the Minister 12 months ago what was the amount of money spent on machinery for the three factories being erected and the country from which the machinery came, the Minister stated that it was not in accordance with practice to disclose information relating to the business of an individual company.  Now, under this Bill, once an unfortunate woman pays 3½d. for a lb. of sugar across the counter, everything that happens after relates to the business of an individual company, and there is no way in which one would be entitled to discuss how much of that 3½d. goes to the farmers; how much of that money goes to the farm labourers, how much of it goes to the railway, and how much of the money goes to Customs and so on.  It was for that reason that I thought this was an occasion on which I might get that information.  I am going somewhat on these lines until you, Sir, pull me up.  I will try to be as reasonable <Col N="1967" /> as possible.  I suggest that of that £3,397,000 that our people are paying a sum of £812,000 goes to the Revenue, a sum of £780,000 goes for sugar brought into the country and a sum of £1,372,000 goes to the company, and that out of that £1,372,000&mdash;and this is based upon the 1935 crop of 57,388 acres&mdash;the farmers get £700,185, there is paid in agricultural wages £243,440, in cartage £155,750 and in wages to the factory workers, according to the statement made by the Minister, £160,000. We do require to get clear what are the exact gross amounts going to the farmers, what are the exact amounts going to the labourers in the field, what are the exact amounts going to the labourers in the factories, and whether there is not an excess in the spending of money by the company, and whatever direction that could be spared, and whatever direction that could be reduced, so as to reduce the price of sugar here.  I hope Deputy Corry will be able to discuss from his side of this Bill the amount of money there is going to the farmers.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, I think it is a great pity, and it is not any credit to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he should come before the House here to close up completely the whole sugar situation and put it in the hands of the company in this particular way without giving the House an opportunity&mdash;which I cannot see it is going to have on any other occasion&mdash;of discussing the sugar-beet business generally.  The promises to the farmers are completely belied by the facts.  The result of that now is that in one area in the country where sugar beet was particularly brought in to assist, it has become entirely a substituted crop.  I find it difficult to proceed, Sir, if I cannot discuss the wages that are being paid in the sugar factories.</P>

      <P>This is the Bill designed to transfer to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann a monopoly of the sugar trade of this country.  I desire to represent to this House that the Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann is not fit to have a monopoly of tallow candles much less of sugar.  My submission to the House is that as a result of the past record of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann the consumer in this country has been plundered, that the farmer in this country has been plundered, and that the farm labourer has been plundered as well, and that the only persons who are getting anything out of it are the Exchequer and Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.  When I have made that case I think I could turn with confidence to the House and ask them to forbid the transferring of any greater share of the sugar business of the country into the hands of a concern like that. The points made by the Minister are all very well, but that at the moment, and under the circumstances, we are bound to argue that the responsibility rests with Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, and on that basis I propose to proceed. Before this insance scheme of beet sugar production was foisted upon the country, sugar produced in the markets of the world yielded to the revenue a very substantial sum, and was sold to the consumer at a moderate price, considering the requirements of the Exchequer at the time.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of making his own speech.  He does not want to hear me now, but he is going to hear me.  He can ask any question he likes, but he need not try any rough stuff at this juncture.  He is at his old game, but it will not work.  Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann took over the supply of sugar for the people here.  As a result of that we are confronted with the situation in which that corporation informed the Government and the Government informs us that they could not carry on if they did not get a subsidy in respect of sugar amounting to £16 3s. 4d. per ton on sugar produced.  When we came to make an estimate, based upon these figures, we discovered that the scheme that this firm suggested was one demanding that for every acre of beet the Government had to go out and buy the beet, that they had to put £7 into each waggon with each consignment of beet, and that, having made the present of the beet to them, and £7 per ton per waggon for taking it into the factory, they then had to tell them to go out and sell the produce for what they could get for it. That is what is described as an achievement in this country that should command the confidence of the people, and that should secure a monopoly of this produce for the company.  The Minister may ask: why find fault with the company?  They were required to do this and they got a subsidy to do it. They were supposed to supply labour on the land and to give the farmer an economic price for his beet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister says, &ldquo;They were not bound to do this, but I made them do it, and because of that they have been labouring under disabilities, and because I put this upon them they now ask for a monopoly&rdquo;, my answer is, I deny these things.  I say it is because of the inherent incompetence of the corporation that we are <Col N="1970" /> faced with this situation.  I am prepared to say the corporation failed to discharge any of their undertakings. And I say if they are given this monopoly they will fail to discharge the undertaking they give now as they have failed to discharge the first undertaking they gave to manufacture sugar in this country.  I say that the Labour Party were forced into agreement by the plea put up by the Minister that this firm were going to provide a great quantity of agricultural labour and pay a fair agricultural wage.  Deputies in the Labour Party will remember that.  They said they recognised that this was going to put a burden upon the consumers, but at the same time it was a scheme in which the consumer would get a great deal back in the form of social service. What are the facts?  Fortunately a calculation has been made of the exact quantity of labour provided by this company.  A very exhaustive examination was made of this question by one of the most eminent research bureaux in the world.  These figures were never contradicted either by the Department of Statistics or even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and God knows the Minister would deny anything, whether it was in the Synoptic Gospels or anywhere else, but he did not dare to deny this.  Each acre of beet provides for agricultural labour in its production, from the sowing of the seed to the despatch to the factory, 24 man days per acre.  The Labour Party will remember that since the Minister came into office agricultural wages have fallen steadily in this country, until now they stand, on their own claim, at 21/3 per week.  I challenge that figure.</P>

      <P>I do not want to discuss them.  All I am discussing is that, having given this undertaking, the company had not kept it.  I say that a company that has given an undertaking and has not kept it is not likely to keep an undertaking if it gets a monopoly.  They have not worked in accordance with the undertaking given <Col N="1971" /> by the Minister on their behalf when he introduced his original Bill.  They received in aid originally £24 per acre, but the labouring man gets £4 5s. out of that.  Surely it is a public scandal and something which this country should be ashamed of that in activities in respect to which the Government provides £24 per acre the unfortunate man standing up to his knees in mud and filth and crawls on all fours up and down the ridges thinning beet gets only £4 5s.  The company gets the rest, but he does the work.  That is all he gets. This is something that the Labour Party here and Deputy Corry and a few more members of the Fianna Fáil Party have been confronted with and asked to recommend to the House.  Perhaps Deputy Corry will say if the labourers are not getting all they should it is not his job, but that it is the job of Deputy Corish to look after.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission is that Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann has withheld from the producers of  so large a proportion of the subsidy they are getting from the State that they are not fit persons to whom to entrust a monopoly of the entire sugar industry of this country.  They are getting from the State at present £24 for every acre of beet they handle and they then can sell the proceeds to the public for whatever price they can get for it.  The farmers of this country are getting out of that £24 approximately&mdash;and this is putting it at its very best&mdash; £17 11s. 3d., and out of that sum they have to pay the labourers the wage which I have given as £4 odd per acre, so that in fact the farmer has for himself for his crop about £13 and out of that he has to carry the crop to the station to put it on rail.</P>
      <P>This whole business in which the beet sugar factory has been engaged is a ramp.  It is plundering the Exchequer; it is plundering the consumer; and it is plundering the producer of the raw material of this industry.  My submission to this House and to the country is that it is a monstrous thing to give the whole sugar trade of the country into the hands of a corporation of this kind.  I would argue without hesitation that far from giving a complete monopoly these factories ought to be wound up immediately, save for this consideration, that a very large number of farmers and labourers in this country have, at the instance of the Fianna Fáil Government, made themselves dependent upon this crop.</P>

      <P>It has been further argued with a view to securing the consent of the Labour Party to this extravagant proposal, that even if that portion of the sugar fund which was made available to farmers and farm labourers was trivial in comparison with the cost to the State of the whole scheme, the Labour Party should seriously consider the enormous advantages that would accrue to the towns of Tuam and Thurles, the Cork factory and the Carlow factory.  They were told that the factory wages there would run into a very large sum of money. In fact, the factories employ about 2,600 persons during the manufacturing season and about 540 persons in the non-manufacturing season.  The factory wages for 1935-1936 and normal succeeding years may be estimated at approximately £160,000 per annum. This whole scheme is costing this State approximately £1,372,000 in subsidies. Of that the labour fund going to the workers in the factories amounts to the figure that I have mentioned, £160,000 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to put the best complexion I can on the case of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, so I say we may reasonably anticipate that the operatives in the factories will get £160,000.  It may be doubtful whether the figure would be as big as that, but that is the best that can be said.  It is upon that figure that the argument is based, that Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, is an invaluable alternative market for Irish agriculture and is a great social service, and that the administration of the sugar fund by Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, has amply justified this company in asking us to repose <Col N="1976" /> further confidence in them by way of giving them a complete monopoly of the sugar trade of this country.</P>
      <P>From every aspect from which we can approach this question Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, has shown itself to be a swamp into which money and labour has been poured without any proportionate benefit to any section of the community.  We have lost time, production and money in this experiment, which was so aptly described by the Minister for Finance as an egregious white elephant.  To this white elephant is now going to be committed the material for growing fatter and more fecund than it has proved to be at the expense of the sugar consumers of this country.</P>
      <P>Bad and all as that is, it seems to me that there is inherent in the Bill other very formidable dangers.  It is extremely difficult to get this House to see the perils that lie in the way of vesting a wide discretion in the Minister for Industry and Commerce unless one can point to the general system which he has pursued in the administration of similar powers.  It is proposed to give him the right under Section 7 (2) to attach to any licence issued by him for the importation of foreign sugar certain particular conditions. One is &ldquo;the times within which and the places at which sugar may be imported under such licence.&rdquo; That gives him the absolute right to confer as a bounty on any particular port in this country a very valuable slice of import trade.  If the Port of Sligo is not sufficiently subservient to the Department and its officials no sugar will come through that port.  If Deputy Corry wants a few votes in Cobh the tip can be passed to Deputy Corry: &ldquo;Get a deputation to call upon Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

I suggest that he should undertake the growth of another between this and the introduction of his Estimate&mdash;he will want it.  Under paragraph (b) he is entitled to impose a condition &ldquo;limiting such licence to sugar manufactured or produced in a specified country.&rdquo;  We used to have in this House the archaic theory that Oireachtas Eireann is the ultimate authority for the transaction of international agreements.  But it appears from this document that we are now going to hand over to the Minister and the permanent officials of his Department the negotiation, confirmation, and execution of international agreements of a trade character. Under this Bill we give the Minister complete authority to enter into a tacit agreement with any other State whereby he will buy all his sugar requirements from it in exchange for some consideration such as possibly providing a home to which individuals like Deputy Corry might be deported. I quite agree that you will want to take more than 80,000 tons of sugar from any particular country before they would contemplate a permanent residence for the Deputy for East Cork.  We have to bear him for nothing.</P>

      <P>Now we come to (d) &ldquo;the manner in which and the routes by which sugar imported under such licence shall be brought to Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  This is being put in because the Minister discovered from his experience of the Spanish trade agreement that there are certain advantages to be derived from having the power to impose such a condition. If you are importing a certain <Col N="1978" /> quantity of a certain commodity from a certain country and you can impose a condition on the importer that he must bring it in along a certain route in a certain ship you can put into the pocket of a particular trading company or ship operating company a very valuable consideration.</P>
      <P>If you arrange, for instance, that Spanish oranges which are to be brought into this country must be shipped direct from Spain to Saorstát Eireann, you make it impossible for anybody to ship oranges but one individual who will ship a cargo, if there is no regular steamer service between this country and Spain.  So that the person who gets the shipping of the cargo gets the advantage.  Supposing there are two competing for that privilege, one of whom is subscribing generously to the Fianna Fáil funds, and the other subscribing to Fine Gael funds, one of whom is the white-haired boy with Deputy Briscoe and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other is the <i>enfant terrible</i> in respect of that Minister and his Department, whom do you think will get the licence to import the cargo?</P>

      <P>Surely the Chair is not going to maintain that every statement that falls from the Minister's lips is to be taken as gospel, because 90 per cent. are untrue, and demonstrably untrue?  The Minister puts it to the Chair that the only person who can get a licence to import is Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta. Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta has no ships on the high seas and the Minister can give a licence and then prescribe, under paragraph (d), &ldquo;the manner in which and the routes by which sugar imported under such licence shall be brought to Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The Minister will try any trick on the Chair or anybody else in order to get a verdict in his favour. With great respect, I submit that the Chair ought to know him well enough by this time.  That is his whole object.  The Bill is drafted to create the impression that it is a disinterested endeavour to put the whole industry in disinterested hands. But the Bill is peppered all over with provisos and yet, when the spoils come to be divided, the voice will be the voice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister proceeded to deal with the fees he intends to charge under a licensing proviso and he says quite blandly that it is not intended the corporation should have any profit on transactions in sugar which they may enter into under the powers contained in this Bill.  Everyone expected the Minister was going to announce that during the period when foreign sugar was to be imported the consumer would get a material advantage from the cheaper sugar.  Not a bit of it. Having levied a tax for home-made sugar on the consumer, having levied a revenue duty of 4/8 on the producer, the Minister now announces that on all imported sugar he is going to collect 21/- Customs duty, and, in addition to that, he is going to levy a sum equal to the profit which sugar importers used to take, for the benefit <Col N="1980" /> of the Exchequer.  Does Deputy Corry remember the happy day when he was hoping to reduce taxation by £3,000,000 per annum?</P>

Since the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act we have become accustomed in this country to taxation by decree, which has been a great and a growing abuse, which has been fraudulently and scandalously used by the present Executive Council, and which has been used to the betrayal of every undertaking they gave to this House when the Bill was passing through.  Ought that not be a warning to us before we confer exactly similar powers under this Bill on the Minister for Industry and Commerce? The Minister told us that this measure was designed for no other purpose than to collect such profits from Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann as would be too small to pass on to the consumer. His object, he said, was that where there was a potential profit of less than a farthing it should be raked into the Exchequer for the benefit of the community.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Minister when the sum is larger than a farthing will the consumer get it and he has not replied to that.  The answer to the Minister's question to me is very simple.  If you have a profit of one-eighth of a penny, you can accumulate it for the first half of the import period and during the remaining half of the import period let it be added on to the further profit and be ultimately given to the consumer in the form of a reduction of his sugar cost.</P>

I will press him again to answer my question: Does he undertake, where the profit is more than a farthing, that it will go to the consumer, or does he intend to put it into the Exchequer, having falsely represented that he has no intention of doing so?  One of the purposes of the Bill is to rake into the Exchequer additional revenue in the well-proved Fianna Fáil method, in such a way that it will appear neither in the Supply Service Estimates nor in the Central Fund Services, nor in any other sphere where its true character can be held up before the people and discussed, as it ought to be, in this House.</P>

    <P>It may be argued that it is waste of time to direct the attention of members of the Fianna Fáil Party to these evils.  It may be argued that the standard of morality on the Fianna Fáil Benches is so low that they see nothing wrong in the Minister coming here, with the approval of the President of the Executive Council, asking for the powers conferred under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act as a weapon to combat an attack on this country by Great Britain and then using them for the purpose of imposing tariffs affecting the ordinary economic life of the country.  Their sense of public rectitude may be so low that they do not recognise the dishonesty and the subterfuge resorted to by the Minister who inserted in that Act a proviso that any duty imposed would have to be reviewed in this House within eight months of its being made and subsequently made an Order <Col N="1983" /> under that Act for the purpose of venting a private spleen on an individual company and repealed the Order before the time when it should come up here for discussion.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to show that powers of this character cannot be given to the Minister with any degree of confidence; that his undertaking that this power is to be used solely for the purpose of collecting such sums as would represent less than a farthing a pound on sugar is not worth the breath that was taken to give it.  This proviso is designed to collect into the Exchequer all the revenue he can grab, and will be so used if he is allowed to get away with it.  I say that those conditions which it is in his power to attach to licences issued to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, and which are set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), subsection (2), Section 7, can and will be used in a way which very few Deputies in this House anticipate.  I say such powers should be vested in no individual Minister.  I say he should not have the right to give, by his ungoverned volition, valuable considerations to any individual citizen of this State.  I do not care whether he is a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government or a Minister of the Fine Gael Government, such transactions are calculated to destroy public morality in this country, and ought to be definitely put an end to.  I say that a transaction of an analogous character has <Col N="1984" /> taken place.  I say that under the Spanish trade agreement shipments of oranges have come in, and an order has been made to-day that oranges must be shipped direct from Spain to Saorstát Eireann, and may not be imported indirectly even if it can be proved that they are of Spanish origin.  That order is made under a power strictly analogous to the power conferred by Section 7 of this Bill, and they are powers which should be enjoyed by no individual Minister whatever.</P>
      <P>The whole scheme out of which this proposal arises is a delusion and a fraud.  It has cost the community an enormous sum of money, and it appears that it is going to cost them infinitely more.  I object most strenuously to a monopoly being given to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann in connection with this business.  I consider it is creating a most undesirable precedent, and only leaves us one very short step away from the worst form of insolvent Government enterprise in connection with the sugar production in this country.  I urge on the House most strongly to reject this Bill; to stand for free trade within the Saorstát in sugar supplies, for the benefit of the consumer.  I urge on the House most strongly to put in hand at the earliest possible opportunity the reform of existing conditions which will make it economically and socially desirable to wind up the whole beet sugar scheme, and provide the farmers of this country with a more profitable method of employing their land and enabling them to make out of their land more than Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann has ever made available for them or for the labourers whom they employ in the production of this commodity.</P>

      <P>This amazing genius over there who has spent the last two hours on this job has charged his leader, Deputy Cosgrave, with being insane.  I really do not know by what cuckoo means he succeeded in getting in there beside Deputy Cosgrave, but &ldquo;this insane scheme,&rdquo; as he called it, of growing sugar beet was first foisted on the country during Deputy Cosgrave's régime here.  When we hear Ministers here called dishonest, called thieves, <Col N="1985" /> and everything else, for two hours, I do not think I would be going too far wrong in stating that this &ldquo;insane scheme&rdquo; was first foisted on this unfortunate country for the purpose of sweetening a very sour seat for the late President of the Executive Council; that the farmers and labourers of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and the other counties were to pay £25,000 a year in subsidy to the farmers of Carlow to keep a sugar beet factory going in County Carlow for the benefit of the late President of the Executive Council.</P>

I do not wish to deal with it at any great length, but I do want to state that some deluded farmers down in Cork refused to grow beet during the first year on the advice of the Fine Gael organisers in the country. Those deluded farmers, at the very period that the beet-growers' organisation were fighting for a good price for the farmers for their beet, were rush ing in with letters to the Sugar Company offering to grow beet at 30/- a ton.  If the farmers are not getting as good a price as we would wish them to get to-day, that is the reason.</P>

      <P>At least I am not going to take two hours to do it.  There is one particular matter on which I should like to hear from the Minister in connection with this.  A certain excess acreage was grown by the farmers, in spite of the sugar company and in spite of the losses that the farmers were sustaining in growing it. A certain excess acreage was grown last year.  The Sugar Company refused to accept that acreage of beet into their factory.  They refused to convert it into sugar.  I should also like to point out that in the particular area of the Carlow sugar factory the acreage under beet had to be very much cut down last year.  Most of the farmers in that district who previously grew nine or ten acres of beet were cut down to four or five <Col N="1987" /> acres.  I suggest to the Minister that the 18,000 tons short in the supply of sugar could be very easily produced in this country.  If that were done there would be no occasion for this Bill at all.  To my knowledge the farmers are only too anxious to grow the acreage of beet required to supply the country with all the sugar required.  They should be allowed to do so.  An addition of a couple of thousand acres in each of the areas supplying the four factories would practically make up the amount of sugar to be imported.</P>

      <P>If the Minister instead of bringing in this Bill would make representations to the sugar company and get the acreage under sugar beet increased there would be no necessity for this.  In that way he would obviate the need for importing sugar at all.  We heard a lot from Deputy Dillon about the imports of sugar and the amount of money involved in it.  I know that the farmers supplying beet to the sugar factory last year got something over £300,000 for the beet supplied.  Of course that is nothing.  It is no use to them because it was not paid by John Bull. If this money came out of the tail of an old bull it would be all right but because it came out of an article produced in Ireland and consumed in Ireland it is no good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to discuss the various statements made by the speakers who participated in this debate, because most of their statements were entirely out of order. I know they made those statements despite the ruling of the Chair that they were out of order.  Very few of the speeches made dealt with the Bill. The Oireachtas in its wisdom decided that the beet sugar industry should be promoted in this country.  I am prepared to discuss now or at any other time the wisdom of that decision. For the purpose of this Bill we must recognise that the decision was made that sugar factories were to be built here with the intention of producing sugar for all our requirements.  That was done. But for the time being, and only for the time being, these factories are not producing sufficient.  There is an existing deficiency which must be made up by imported sugar.  The only question <Col N="1991" /> that arises is by what method we are to control that import of sugar.  It is controlled at the present time.  Under the Control of Imports Act quotas are fixed from time to time for periods stated in each Order.  These quotas represent the amount of sugar which, in our opinion, must be imported to supplement home sugar produced in order to meet our requirements.  Each quota is divided up between the sugar importers on the register who get licences for a certain quantity of sugar to be imported.  Under the authority of these licences the registered importers bring in the total quantity required.  That is the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing to change that in a manner contemplated by the Bill, so that in future the only licence to import the quantity of sugar necessary to be imported will be issued to the Sugar Company&mdash;Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann. That change is made for two reasons, because of the administrative difficulty of operating the present system and because the quantity being imported is too small to permit of dividing up the import satisfactorily.  Because of these things it is proposed to substitute this new system for the other.  In that connection a communication was addressed to the Secretary of the Sugar Company by the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association of Ireland, which is incorporated with the sugar merchants' Association, stating that &ldquo;after very careful thought and taking into consideration the many difficulties that would arise if free import of sugar was allowed to all registered importers during the short interval&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, the period during which Irish sugar is not available&mdash;&ldquo;to say nothing of the complete dislocation of the present-day trade arrangements that would result, I am asking you to place before the Minister a strong request that your company act as sole importers during the interval in question and continue to supply the various firms with sugar on the same basis as at present existing.&rdquo;  That is what the registered importers themselves ask. The only reason why this Bill is required is because their request could not be granted without legislation because, as the law stands, the Irish <Col N="1992" /> Sugar Company cannot be given a licence to import sugar.  We might have got a voluntary arrangement so that new legislation would not be needed, but as the law stands the Sugar Company is not empowered to get that licence and, consequently, we have this legislation.</P>
    <P>As to the criticism of Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon, it was complete, unadulterated nonsense. They indulged in a lot of wild talk which was entirely irrelevant.  I never heard a greater lot of clotted congealed nonsense handed out by any Deputy than was uttered by Deputies opposite on this matter.  We were told that there was a fund which represents the total amount paid by the Irish consumer for sugar, and that the only people who get anything out of that are the Irish Exchequer and the Irish Sugar Company.  What does the Irish Exchequer get out of it?  The Exchequer gets a small revenue, smaller than it ever got previously from sugar. What did it get from sugar in 1931? Does Deputy Mulcahy know what the revenue got from sugar in 1931 was, or does he care?</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite are very concerned now about the price <Col N="1993" /> of sugar.  They are concerned because they are in opposition.  All this hypocrisy and humbug which has always constituted the policy of the Party opposite constitutes their policy on this occasion also.  They are wailing for the poor woman who has to pay 3½d a lb. on sugar but they did not wail much for her in 1931. What advantage is the Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann getting?  What is this company?  It is a company set up by the State, all the ordinary shares of which are held by the Minister for Finance as trustee for the Irish people.  Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann gets nothing out of this; it all comes back here for the benefit of the Irish people.  Every penny paid in dividends by that company on its ordinary shares goes into the Exchequer.  This corrupt, malignant monopolistic organisation which Deputy Dillon has talked about has been set up by the Government.  The shares are owned by the Government and the profit goes to the relief of taxation.  If there is a profit the benefit goes to the Irish people and not to a little group of sugar importers.  I submit that is very desirable.  The variation that can take place between imported sugar and the price of home produced sugar will be very small.  It can never reach the figures Deputy Dillon suggested. In that event imported sugar at 6/- or 7/- per cwt., would have to be reduced by 2/4 per cwt., and that is not going to happen.  Last year the benefit of that margin between the prices went to the importer.  If there is a margin this year it will go to the Exchequer for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>We have had this question of the price of imported sugar raised here frequently in the past.  CzechoSlovakian sugar could be delivered in Dublin and sold here if there was no excise duty at 1d per lb.  In CzechoSlovakia they pay 6d. a lb. for that sugar in order that they could sell it here at 1d.  We could get the immediate benefit of that if we were prepared to close down our factories and turn beet growing land back again into grass and buy imported sugar at 7/- a cwt.</P>

We can buy Argentine beef more cheaply than we can grow bullocks; we can buy butter from other countries more cheaply than we can produce it here; we can buy mangolds and turnips more cheaply than we can produce them here.  Why should we grow any of these things if we can buy them more cheaply?  That is the philosophy of the Opposition. There is not a single item produced in agriculture or industry in this country which we could not buy more cheaply somewhere. Is it their view that, because of that, we should produce nothing and buy everything?  That is a pleasant prospect to hold out to the Irish people.  Sugar is being sold here at an economic price, and Deputies opposite will agree with me in that if they agree with my definition of an economic price, as a price that yields a fair return to the producers of the raw material, a fair wage to the workers employed in the industry and a fair profit to the company engaged in it.</P>

      <P>In any event, I agree with the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that this question of the wisdom of the decision which the Oireachtas took to foster the sugar beet industry is not relevant to this debate.  I contend also that the administration of the beet sugar company is not relevant to the debate. The beet sugar company has been remarkably efficient.  We have had Deputy Dillon talking about its incompetency.  Deputy Dillon, of course, is always glad to befoul any Irish enterprise.  What has happened? The Irish Sugar Company which constructed these new factories established a world record.  I defy Deputies opposite to find anywhere a new enterprise like that, involving the establishment <Col N="1996" /> of factories as large as these factories, and the installation of equipment as intricate as the equipment of these factories, which was in production 12 months after the preparation of the plans for their establishment was undertaken. It was an achievement, and engineers and scientists all over the world have paid tribute to the extraordinary expedition and efficiency with which the Irish Sugar Company established these factories and got them into production.  It is only in this House, from members of the Party opposite, from people like Deputy Dillon, that we get these rotten slanders, these allegations of inefficiency and these efforts to blacken and besmirch Irish enterprise and Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>And when the first factory was established it was a white elephant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So it was, at the time. Deputy Mulcahy talks about £1,000,000 subsidy paid to keep the four factories in production.  In 1924, they paid £1,000,000 subsidy to keep one factory in production.  It was a white elephant.  It was the most incompetent and inefficient scheme ever started in any country, and the first thing this Government did was to terminate it by buying out the company they were subsidising and handing over that factory to the control of a company, the shares of which are owned by Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had Deputy Dillon talking about the inadvisability of giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce the powers set out in Section 7, because he is corrupt, because he is dishonest, because he will use these powers to fill the pockets of the political supporters of his Party, and he gave an example.  We have these powers at present under the Control of Imports Act.  No new power is given to the Minister by that section; he has these powers already in relation to sugar or any other commodity subject to a quota order. Deputy Dillon picked one example&mdash; oranges.  We must not give the Minister these powers, he said, because of the way he used similar powers possessed by him in relation to oranges.  He used these powers, he said, to require that oranges be imported by a particular route direct from Spain to the Saorstát for the benefit of the carrying Company, which had established a shipping service between Spain and the Saorstát; because that company had subscribed to Fianna Fáil funds, and because representatives of it had gone around speaking at week-end meetings on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  That is the Limerick Steamship Company.  If there are any of the Limerick Deputies in the House, they will realise the joke of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested here seriously by Deputy Dillon that I made that regulation for the benefit of the Limerick Steamship Company, because the Limerick Steamship Company had subscribed to the funds of the Fianna Fail Party, and because the directors of that company had spoken at meetings on behalf of Fianna Fáil candidates. That is the type of foundation there is for all the allegations we get from Deputy Dillon and his colleagues on the opposite benches.  The power to regulate the importation of any commodity that is subject to a quota order through any particular port, or by a <Col N="1998" /> particular route, is designed to break down the system which operated here to the detriment of our people, by which goods imported from all countries in the world came to us through English middlemen.  Spanish oranges came into this country before. They were imported into Great Britain and they paid a 10 per cent. duty to the British Government.  They were auctioned on a British market and reexported to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a word about it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but Deputy Dillon's contention was that I should not be given the powers set out in Section 7, because I had abused similar powers in relation to oranges. Deputy Dillon was allowed to make the argument, and I presume I am allowed to answer it.  I say there was good reason to use these powers in that way in relation to oranges.  By doing so we established direct connection with the producers; we established a new Irish shipping service; and we secured that the English middlemen and merchandising organisations would not be able to get a rake-off upon trade between Spain and Ireland.  Is that contrary to the policy of the Party opposite?  I must presume from Deputy Dillon's speech that it is a Party that stands for giving England a rake-off in everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had also the suggestion that this Bill is introduced for the purpose of increasing the revenue and securing that the actual tax upon imported sugar will be higher.  Deputies opposite need not concern themselves about that.  We are going to make all the sugar the Irish people want here in the country.  This year there will be a deficiency&mdash;a deficiency due to various causes.  Perhaps the sugar company were unduly cautious in allocating acreage last year, as they had not got precise knowledge of what the market was going to be, or the supply of beet. There was a slight reduction in the sugar content of the beet produced. Due, however, to these causes, and certain others, production this year will be some thousands of tons less than <Col N="1999" /> our requirements, and that quantity of sugar will have to be imported.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give the Sugar Company the right to import it on condition that they make no profit out of the importation of that sugar or its resale to Irish wholesale merchants. That is the condition on which they are to be given a licence&mdash;that they will make no profit.  If there is any slight variation between the price at which sugar will come in and the price at which Irish sugar is sold, the benefit of the difference, whatever amount it may be, will accure to the Exchequer and to the benefit of the Irish people, not to the benefit of the small number of registered sugar importers.</P>
    <P>Next year the importation of sugar will be negligible.  There will always be a necessity to import small quantities of special classes of sugar used in particular manufacturing processes. We have at the present time the ridiculous position that, if we want to allow in for a manufacturer of condensed milk 300 tons of sugar over a certain period to produce a certain class of commodity in which he is interested, we have to make a quota order for a very much larger amount&mdash; a quota order so large that, when allocated between all the registered importers, the one importer in whom we are interested will get 300 tons, so that a quantity of sugar far in excess of requirements is imported.  It is necessary to terminate that position, and this is the sensible way to do it&mdash;the way that certainly works to the benefit of the Irish people.  The quantity that will have to be imported next year will be negligible.  It will amount to a few hundred tons at the outside.  There will be no undue accession of revenue to the Exchequer or of profit to the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I seriously ask Deputies opposite to deal with measures that come before them on their merits.  We have had no attempt made to deal with this Bill on its merits.  It was used instead as an excuse for a series of wild general allegations about the operations of the Sugar Company and the effects of the sugar scheme upon agriculture and the wages of agricultural labourers. Deputies knew quite well that these <Col N="2000" /> matters had nothing to do with the Bill.  Just because they had no concrete or positive statements to make on the Bill, but nevertheless felt that they had to make speeches, and they went into all these irrelevancies.  Even in these irrelevancies they had the facts all wrong.  We had the stupid statements made by Deputy Dillon and the equally stupid statements of Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;all based upon a misconception of the facts, as well as inability on their part to relate the facts to the measure before the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Cosgrave, now that he is re-elected Leader of the Party, will try to get some sense of responsibility into its members.  They have been sent here as members of Parliament to do the work of governing the nation, and the only thing they can do as an Opposition is to contribute constructive suggestions on the various problems before the country and to give us the benefit of their constructive criticism upon measures introduced in this House. We have not had a constructive suggestion from them since they went into opposition.  If they want to be taken seriously as a Party, or if Deputy Cosgrave wants to be taken seriously as Leader of the Party, they will have to change their tactics.  Certainly a repetition of the exhibition we had to-day in the debate on this measure would be the best argument that could be advanced for Fascism in this or any other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister when he will take an opportunity of telling us what the farmers will get out of this money and what the agricultural labourers and the workers in the factories will get.  I should also like him to tell us whether the price to be paid to the farmers for beet this year is the same as was paid last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters which can be dealt with by parliamentary questions addressed to the appropriate Ministers.  So far as I know, the farmers are working upon a three years' contract with the Sugar Company.  So far as the argument that Deputy Mulcahy is trying to develop is concerned, he will appreciate that <Col N="2001" /> the whole of the sum which is paid by the sugar consumers for sugar, the whole of the sugar fund as he described it, stays in this country.  The whole of it goes somewhere.  It is not going into the Exchequer.  The Exchequer is getting less from sugar than ever. It is not going to the Sugar Company, because if the company make profits these profits go to the Exchequer.  It is going to Irish workers and farmers and no one else.  It cannot possibly go anywhere else.  Once Deputy Mulcahy has that fact right, he will appreciate the benefit of this scheme to the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his lucid explanation in answer to the criticisms passed on the measure, stated that we were approaching the point where we would manufacture all the sugar required in this country.  May I ask him in that connection, when exports are taking place from this country, what drawback will be allowed to manufacturers sending goods out of the country?  Is it only the Excise duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Manufacturers are put in the precise position as if they could buy duty-free imported sugar.  The manufacturers exporting goods containing sugar get a drawback of the <Col N="2002" /> duty paid plus a compensation bounty provided for in the Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I put.  The Minister stated that we were approaching the point where we would manufacture all the sugar here.  What I want to know is if, in connection with the exports, the drawback is going to include any sum over and above the cost of the import of the sugar into this country?  In other words, the exporters are dealing with world prices.  I want to know are they only to get the drawback, or will they get a sum equivalent to charging them in the manufacture of the goods only for the import price of the sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said. The manufacturers who export goods get the sugar which is in these goods at the world price.  The Deputy's use of the word &ldquo;drawback&rdquo; is confusing. A drawback is a drawback of duty. They get a drawback of the full duty paid, plus a compensation bounty, which represents the difference between the cost of manufacturing here and the world price, which is provided for in the Finance Act, and for which provision is made in the book of Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of interpretation are extremely difficult, but I <Col N="2008" /> think the experience of lawyers is that where you have a sub-section clearly excluding a farmer in certain contingencies the court would assume that he is not excluded unless that contingency exists.  The new paragraph (c) says that there is excluded from the section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the cleaning by a farmer on his own premises of seeds <i>bona-fide</i> intended to be sown by him on land in his own occupation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Take my own case.  I had oats-threshed in the autumn, and it certainly was not in a fit condition to sell as seed when it came from the threshing machine.  I put it by in a loft, and when the seed oats season comes around and I am going to offer that oats for seed I would ordinarily clean it if I had the apparatus wherewith to carry out that operation.  It appears to me that I would be committing a breach of the law if I did it under the Bill as at present defined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment that was inserted at the request of the people in the trade who made a very strong case that it would be absolutely impossible for them to carry on the business giving the country of origin on every particular package.  On hearing the case that the trade made, I thought there was not much to be gained by retaining the words &ldquo;place of production&rdquo;. These are small packets of seeds such as onions, turnips, carrots and parsnips which, as everybody knows, are, of course, imported, and nothing is to be gained by printing on <Col N="2013" /> the packet the country it comes from. I think we have put in sufficient safeguards without putting in the country of origin.  What we are concerned with is that the seeds are fresh as far as possible and that they have not been held over from other years.  I suggest that the Dáil would agree to have this amendment accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no serious objection to accepting it.  Deputy Belton agreed with the Minister in saying that he looked forward to the time when indigenous strains of seeds would be available.  I venture to suggest that there are certain types of seeds which would never be indigenous to this country, because they could not be produced here.  The Minister, I understand, said they could.  If the Minister were serious in that intention I suggest what could easily be done.  If it is impossible for seed merchants to identify the actual country of production it should be possible for them to endorse a package with the words &ldquo;home production&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreign production&rdquo;. If the Minister is serious in the suggestion that he is aiming at evolving indigenous strains for our market gardens he should take power now to see that the packages are marked &ldquo;indigenous strains&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreign strains,&rdquo; or &ldquo;seeds of foreign origin.&rdquo;  That, I think, should present the seed merchants with no serious difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Certain types of seed can be grown; types such as carrots and onions are imported.  I know, on the other hand, it is felt that seeds such as cabbages and cauliflower can be produced here.  The suggestion made was that they should be marked either &ldquo;imported&rdquo; or &ldquo;homegrown.&rdquo;  The merchants have no objection to that. But I must admit it was going to put them to a certain expense.  Any little additional operation done in connection with the seeds must add to the cost of the packing and that is liable to raise the price.  We do not want the price of these small packets raised. That is why we want to impose as little cost as possible on the importers.</P>

The place of production of seeds is usually advertised on them. The time may come when we will be producing these seeds.  The time may come when a pact may be made with the British and we will arrange to buy British seeds only.

      <P>If the Chair will allow it, I will discuss it now.  Deputy McGilligan is talking about the cost of living and prices being raised but if the Deputy will examine the matter he will find that the cost-of-living index figure is no higher now than when he was in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest I can reply to that.  The cost of living has been tackled and the way in which it has been tackled is most depressing. The farmers' products have been brought down to below cost of production.  The producer is getting a lower price and the result is that with the cost of living and other matters up the purchaser is able to purchase less.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should be beholden to the Chair by bringing the discussion back to amendment No. 8.  The suggestion that this would materially increase the cost of packing the seeds we have in mind&mdash;packages costing 1d. and 2d. &mdash;would not hold water.  As the Minister knows there is usually a paragraph at the back of the package giving advice as to planting.  Merely requiring to add the words &ldquo;foreign produce&rdquo; or &ldquo;home production&rdquo; could not possibly and anything to the printing of the notice on the package. I do not press the matter because I do not know how far the Minister's advisers are prepared to go in forecasting the production of agricultural seeds in this country.  If the Minister seriously intends that there is to be a substantial production of these commodities here, then he ought to require that the seed merchant add these words to the package.  If he seriously does want the production of seeds here then it does not matter whether he inserts these words or not.  I am speaking from the point of view of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there would be very much advantage in doing it.  Experiments have been carried out in the last few years with regard to the production of agricultural seeds which have not been produced here up to now.  These experiments have been so far successful and I think they will prove successful. But it will be some years before we can get the best possible strains as commercial seeds.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> (2)  The following provisions shall have effect by way of qualification of the provisions of the foregoing sub-section of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the year in which any such bag as is mentioned in the said sub-section was packed is clearly stated on a seal securing the mouth of such bag, the statement required by the said sub-section to be on such bag of the year in which such bag was packed may be in the form of a statement to the effect that such bag was packed in the year stated on such seal;</P>
    <P>(b)  different particulars and different things may be prescribed for the purposes of the said sub-section in respect of different classes (defined by reference to such matters (including the retail price) as the Minister shall think proper) of containers or of bags.</P>
    <P>This amendment also arises out of a discussion we had with people in the trade.  The practice of the trade is that certain seeds are packed in cotton bags.  They suggest that there might be a metal tag attached to the bag so that the bag might be used again.  I do not think there is anything to be lost.  It might appear at first sight that they might change the bag or they might empty the seed out of it into a new bag.  If we had not some such system as the tag we might be putting merchants to the cost of providing new bags each year.  We recommend this amendment because it seems to be simple and economic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister has taken the counsel of his office in this matter.  I look upon this amendment with the maximum of distrust. The additional expense that would be involved in providing new bags would be trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be.  Merchants ought to be able to forecast the sort of demand they will have.  There is no necessity when buying cotton bags to require the manufacturer to print on <Col N="2017" /> the date.  You can have a design which can be packed in around a certain space, on which it is intended to stamp the date.  Then, when you have the bags turned out in that way, you can get a rubber stamp and stamp on the date in indelible ink which would suffice for the purpose.  If you do not do that, you are going to have a date on these small bags about the size of a Saorstát Eireann sixpence attached to the neck of the bag.  I do not know if the Minister knows what that would look like.  It would be extremely difficult to decipher what is written on it.  If you are going to incorporate into that a date, I venture to say that five out of every ten farmers would have material difficulty in deciphering what the date is.  In recent legislation the Minister requires a tag to be attached to each bag stating the proportional nature of the material in the bag, and not on a tag attached to the bag which for all practicable purposes would be illegible. The figures on the metal tag would be about an eighth of an inch long and would not be legible to anybody except people in the habit of examining things of that kind.  I do not want to put extra expense on any merchant preparing such matters for sale.  I have a good deal of experience myself in the sale of agricultural seeds and I do not hesitate to say that the letters should be printed on the bag of a reasonable size in order that no possibility could arise that would prevent them showing to customers that they were for this year's produce and not for last year's produce.  Some merchants might say they could transfer seeds out of last year's bags into this year's bags and get sale in that way.  But suppose a man had 100 1-lb. bags, with no indication except the metal disc.  He might sell all that seed with the exception of 25 1-lb. bags.  These might be left on his hands, but most seed merchants provide that in that case you could send them back and get two-thirds of the price.  Many of them might put them aside and on getting next year's seed might mix them with other bags. One or two of the customers might examine a bag and find the date 1936 on it, and other customers would walk off on the assumption that they were <Col N="2018" /> all getting exactly the same.  On the other hand, if the bag was stamped with indelible ink in figures not less than one inch, no one would attempt under these conditions to sell a bag of seed not suitable for planting in the year of sale because there would be endorsed on it in bold figures the year in which it was sold.  I urge upon the Minister to withdraw the amendment and to require that there should be stamped on each cloth bag of seed the date on which it should be sold.  There will be no additional substantial cost upon the seed men and a real guarantee against possible abuse will be provided.</P>

The wholesalers distribute to a large number of retailers and they would get back a number of bags from such persons.  If he had to sacrifice these bags it would be a great loss to the wholesaler.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are going very far away from what was originally in the Bill where there was intended to be, I take it, what Deputy Dillon has spoken of&mdash;a declaration in bold figuring on the bag of the year.  We are going to depart from that altogether. It may be justified but it is certainly a big departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite recognise that the seed merchants will not be one bit grateful to me for this, but I speak with some experience of the seed trade, from the point of view of the rural retailer, and with some experience of the reaction of the average small farmer in the west of Ireland buying the seed, and I tell you that the date endorsed on the seal of the bag is no adequate safeguard against an evil which I believe to be a genuine possibility. I tell you further, with some experience of the expenses of packing, which I do not want to make too heavy for anybody, that it is not an unreasonable case to make in a matter of this kind that to put the date on a bag will involve the packer in undue expense.  I say without hesitation that it ought not only to be put on the bag, but ought to be put in figures of a fixed minimum size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I make the point that the printed bags that are returned, if they are not suitable for containing horticultural seeds, can be turned to some other purpose by turning them inside out and selling them white for turf mould or Bulbolene, the kind of stuff used in packing bulbs.  There are a number of purposes to which a seed merchant could turn these bags as plain bags and I have no hesitation whatever in saying that that ought to be insisted upon.  There is no necessity for the wholesaler to bear all the loss.  After all, if a retailer overbuys, he must be prepared to pay some little penalty for not having anticipated his requirements more expertly.  Let the wholesaler, in the discount which he will deduct from any returned seeds, make an allowance of one half of the cost of the bags which the retailer is <Col N="2020" /> sending back and let them share the loss that will accrue.  I urge the Minister most strongly not to accept the alternative of the date on the seal for the date in legible figures on the bag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that this applies to seeds supplied by a wholesaler to the retailer in a sealed bag.  If the retailer fills a bag out of a bulk amount, this does not apply. Having that in mind, do I understand from the Deputy that he believes that the seed people would not be too thankful for this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said they will not be too grateful to me for resisting the Minister's amendment.  I think the seed merchants will like the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might also help me in this matter.  I understood that the wholesaler who supplied seed of this type to a retailer took back whatever was left unsold, allowing the retailer in full for what he takes back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In my experience, they usually make a discount of 10 or 20 per cent., according to the man you deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly makes a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of the bags of seeds that come from Suttons of Reading, &ldquo;Hawlmark,&rdquo; Dicksons, and Fullcrop from somebody else.  They are mainly mangels, turnips and English Red Clover.  They are the three principal contents of these bags and, as I tell you, one merchant's custom differs from another, but, in my experience, there is a deduction of 10 to 12½ per cent. on returns made by the wholesale seed merchant.  But, whether that is the case or not, I am quite prepared to stand over the position that whatever loss accrues in the matter of bags should be faced for the major purpose of securing that last year's seed will not be retailed by country merchants to small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan directs my attention to a point that did not occur to me.  At present, if I return a pound of turnip seed as surplus to a wholesaler, <Col N="2021" /> what happens, so far as I am aware, is that he segregates all the seed he gets back at the end of the 1935 sowing season, and when the 1936 sowing season opens, he submits all that seed to a fresh test for germination, and so much of it as passes the germination test goes out in 1936 as seed suitable for sowing in 1936.  If we put a proviso in this Bill whereby the date must appear on the bag, we should make it clear in the body of the statute that the date appearing on the bag is the year in which it will be permissible to sow the seed and not a statement that it is seed garnered from a crop sown in such and such a year.  Suppose we insisted on a man putting &ldquo;1936&rdquo; on a bag, it might operate to place him under a statutory obligation to put into the bag nothing but seed which was collected in the winter of 1935.  We do not mean to do that.  What we mean to do is to put on him the obligation of seeing that any seed contained in that bag is suitable seed for sowing in the season 1936-1937, and, if we insist on his putting the date on the bag, we ought to make it clear that it is not 1936 crop seed he is putting into the bag, but seed suitable for sowing in 1936.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the date of packing. As the Deputy says, seed grown in 1934 might be quite suitable for sowing in 1936, if it has passed the germination test.  If we send an inspector to take a sample, the wholesaler cannot have the defence that he sent out that seed last year and not this year.</P>

      <P>I want to mention that paragraph (b) relates to quite a different matter, although perhaps it is not apparent at first sight.  It is designed to empower the Minister to exempt packets under 3d. in value from the necessity of stating the name and address.  I think it is an amendment that will be necessary because the reputable firms will not permit their name and address to be given on packets sent out to small huckster shops throughout the country for the reason that they may be put aside and sold the following year.  If we insist on the Bill as it is, we will have a position in which the reputable firms will be driven out of this business altogether and less reputable firms will be coming in.  On that account, I think we should exempt them from the obligation to put their names on the 3d. packets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I object strongly to this.  This Bill is primarily designed to protect the consumer who buys a cheap packet of seed.  It is the little fellow venturing to start a little garden, the allotment holder and the country cottage tenant; for instance, the labourer's cottage tenant who has never had a garden and whom people have been pressing to cultivate his garden and have something in it.  That is the man who buys the 3d. package of seed.  If he buys a package of seed that is rotten and sows it and half the crop will not come up and he will get a crop of weeds, it is ten times harder to get that person to make a venture again than it was before he ever made the endeavour. The last thing he will blame is the seed, because the worse the seed is the more beautful will be the picture on the cover of the package. Seeds that will not grow will have pictures of turnips on the package of a large size, or magnificent onions with huge green heads, or gladioli of a gargantuan size.  When you open <Col N="2023" /> the package, you will find two or three miserable seeds of what are as likely to be thistles as anything else.</P>
      <P>I suggest that no reputable firm need hesitate to sell seeds in a decent package if they put upon them in clear print that the seeds should be sown in 1936.  If the notice is clear and easily legible the man who buys a package of seeds is often a great deal daintier in a matter of that kind than the man buying in bulk.  If, next April, he sees on a package of seeds a notice that the seeds must be sown in 1935, he will say: &ldquo;I will not have these seeds; I must have this year's seeds.&rdquo;  Far from driving the reputable firm out of business, if we insist on the cheap package of seeds having a notice on it as to the year in which they should be sown, we will drive the disreputable firms out of business, and make it possible for any firm, no matter how distinguished or important it is, to engage in a trade which I think is very important.</P>
      <P>I want to see the allotment holder, the labourer's cottage tenant, and the small tenant purchaser sowing vegetable gardens and flower gardens.  I think it will be a very good thing. Far from exempting these seeds, I press on the Minister most strongly to insist that the rigour of the law should be enforced with respect to the cheap package of seeds, because no person is more easily trespassed upon or defrauded than the person who will be buying this 2d. or 3d. package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the feeling that we could do something in connection with <Col N="2024" /> this section which would materially improve the seed situation without involving expense of a kind analogous to that which will fall on the ratepayers or taxpayers in connection with the Warble Fly Order.  I detest in existing conditions proposing any reform which would involve inspection, because every time you propose inspection you let loose another flood of out of-works drawing fat salaries for doing absolutely nothing.  This House knows my view on wheat and all belonging to it.  However, I am one of those who believe that when you have been reluctantly forced into the adoption of a scheme by the will of the majority, the best thing you can do is to exert yourself to the best of your ability to make it as successful as you can and to avoid, as far as you can, the imminence of more serious losses.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that in the years when the production of wheat was an economic business in this country, before the prairie lands of Canada became so easily accessible as they now are, two things operated to finish wheat as a regular crop in the Irish rotation: One was the inclement weather and the other was a series of attacks of black smut which culminated in the disaster of 1865 or thereabouts, when the wheat crop was struck with black smut, just as the potato crop was struck with blight in 1848 and again in 1881.  From that time up to a few years ago the control of black smut was a very serious problem. Now it emerges, apparently, that in some kind of virus disease it can be effectively controlled by dressing the seed with products such as Ceresan. I would not wish to see any plague like black smut reappear widely in the country.  Therefore, I should like to see as much cereal seeds as possible dressed with some similar preventive dressing.  I know that leaf stripe in oats very materially reduces the yield of oats crops all over the country. One other difficulty is that a great many farmers do not recognise that disease when they see it.  They put it down to frost or wire worms, which is another favourable excuse.  In fact, the crops give a very much smaller yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent experiments failed to establish <Col N="2025" /> definitely that leaf stripe disease is a virus disease, or can be controlled by dressing it with a preparation like Ceresan.  But it does appear that the incidence of the disease can be much reduced and that possibly a good effect is had by using such a preparation. Therefore, I think it would be well if a proviso could be made that no retail sale of wheat should be made to a farmer by a seed dealer unless there was included with the purchase of the wheat or oats a quantity of any approved preventive dressing such as Ceresan, or whatever dressing the Department would sanction.</P>

      <P>It would require the seed merchant to supply with the seed a suitable preventive.  It must stop there, because if you do not stop there you will have to have a thousand inspectors to see that it is used.  My theory is that if you make the stuff readily available to the average farmer he will use it.  These farmers who are not using preventive dressings are not using them because it is too much trouble, first of all, to ascertain accurately the proper quantity to use with any given quantities of seed and, secondly, because it is too much trouble to go into the town specially to buy it, if it is not readily available. If you make it obligatory to include sufficient of the dressing with each portion of oats or seed wheat supplied, the vast majority of the farmers will use it.  Some Deputies will say that that does not cover the sale of seeds in the market.  It does not and I do not think you can cover them at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average farmer, however, who goes to buy seed wheat, oats or barley in the market is on the <i>qui vive</i>; he feels he has to use his own judgment in the purchase of the seeds and it is up to him to see that the seed is of the proper quality and is not liable to carry disease or weeds on to his land.  If he buys it from a reputable seed dealer he says: &ldquo;I am prepared to pay for these seeds and I want the best;&rdquo; and when he gets the certificate of a reliable seed dealer he feels he has something on which he can depend.  He will be, therefore, <Col N="2026" /> less likely to take precautions about seed supplied by a dealer than if he bought seeds in the markets. It is for that reason that I want the House seriously to consider the advisability of making it obligatory to have a sufficient quantity of preventive dressing supplied with seeds so that it will be brought home to the farmer's mind that, no matter how good seed may be, it is necessary to take this additional precaution.  I want it done in that way so as to avoid the necessity of having inspectors going around to enforce it.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  I want to avoid the appearance of disease of the character of black smut in a widespread way.  If the suggestion I have put forward is adopted it will go a long way towards preventing a plague of black smut.  A small quantity of Ceresan will dress a comparatively large quantity of seeds and the cost will not involve more than 8d. or 1/- a barrel.  The Minister will be better able to give an estimate of the cost than I.  Anyhow, the cost will not be very alarming.  When you are looking at the cost, do not look at the cost of the seed so much as at the cost of the crop.  The extra cost for the dressing should be related to the produce of a dressed crop as opposed to the produce of an undressed crop and not to the original cost of the bag of seed to which it is going to be applied.  I shall be glad if the Minister will give us his estimate of the additional cost of a preparation such as Ceresan, applied to a barrel of wheat.</P>

      <P>This is really a matter for education in relation to agriculture. A great deal has been done, and I think it is invariably the experience of any farmer going to a seed merchant to find that the merchant will recommend a dressing for the seed.  It happened in my own case last year when I was buying seed wheat.  The seed merchant said that there should be a dressing and my recollection of the cost was that it worked out at 1/- or 1/6 a barrel.  It <Col N="2027" /> is altogether a matter for education and I do not think that it should be dealt with in legislation such as this. Certainly, I know the matter is not being lost sight of.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister does not know that with every packet of peas sold there is a pea tablet inserted?  The history of that is simple.  The pea packers found their trade was being destroyed because people would not cook peas properly. You should have some preparation of soda with peas and have them soaked before you cook them.  The packers found they could not get people to buy a packet of this material and use it when they were cooking dried peas, with the result that now every shopkeeper who packs peas&mdash;and most of them are packed by comparatively small shopkeepers&mdash;always inserts a pea tablet.  If they did not, they would lose their trade to the other merchants who did put pea tablets in. I suggest that if it is possible to do that in the hundreds of packets of peas that one merchant will sell in the 12 months, it ought to be equally possible to require the seedsmen to put in a package of preventive powder with a barrel of wheat.  Unless you do that, you are going to come up against a very nasty outbreak of black smut.</P>

      <P>Really, this business of inspectors is becoming a standing terror.  We have already appointed a flock of inspectors.  I was recently at a cinema and I saw there a scene from Surrey representing some hundreds of thousands of starlings fluttering over the countryside.  The sky was darkened with them.  I could not help thinking that in this country before <Col N="2030" /> very long it is not starlings that will darken the sky, but inspectors.  We appointed a horde of inspectors under the Cattle and Sheep Act and they have now apparently nothing to do. We appointed them to ensure that the farmers would get the minimum price for their cattle and sheep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the primary purpose.  Having appointed them, we then determined that there would not be any minimum price&mdash;the rule would be <i>sauve qui peut.</i>  Hordes of inspectors went round the country, astonishingly enough not to get the minimum price for the farmers, but to extract a minimum levy from the butchers, who thereupon proceeded to extract a levy from the farmers.  So the poor old farmers, having expected a visit from inspectors to ensure them a minimum price, discovered to their horror that the inspectors were proceeding to drag out of them, by indirect methods, the maximum levy they could extract. The next thing we heard was that the British Government declared the warble fly was giving them a spot of bother and our Minister for Agriculture said to Dr. Elliott: &ldquo;If you imagine you can best us in this matter, you do not know what we can do.&rdquo; Last Saturday, we appointed 19 inspectors to look after the warble fly in County Roscommon.</P>

      <P>I do not know how many were appointed for Cork, but I am aware that hordes of inspectors have been appointed to look after the warble fly.  Why we should not have the cattle and sheep inspectors chasing the warble fly when they gave up chasing the minimum price, I cannot imagine.  Now we have the warble fly inspectors chasing the cattle and sheep inspectors and the cattle and sheep inspectors in turn chasing after the warble fly inspectors.  In the meantime, the warble fly will probably get away.  On top of the warble fly inspectors and the cattle and sheep inspectors we are now going to appoint seed inspectors.  Where is it going to end, or will a time come <Col N="2031" /> when there will be nobody in this country but inspectors?  Do the people in this House realise that at the present time an ordinary farmer living on 12 acres of land in the West of Ireland, whose annual income amounts to about 15/- per week&mdash;that is all he has for himself&mdash;is liable to be called upon by the seeds and weeds inspector, by the veterinary inspector, by the Tuberculosis (Cattle Order) inspector, by the warble fly inspector, by the meat inspector, by the dairy inspector, by the cattle and cowsheds inspector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at least ten inspectors, all discharging separate functions, entitled to call on one unfortunate farmer, and any one of those inspectors is being paid more by the farmer than the farmer himself earns in the 12 months.  Is it not a marvellous country?  The way this country can live off its own fat, the way one section of the community can live off another, and the way this country can eat its own tail, are a source of unending amazement to me, but I really suggest to the Minister that under this Seeds Act no inspector should be appointed, and that the existing servants either of the Department of Agriculture or of the committees of agriculture should be required to do the work.  The thing is becoming a public scandal, and the personnel of the Civil Service and of the local authorities is becoming absolutely prohibitive and absurd.  I press very strongly on the Minister that none of the powers conferred on him by way of appointing inspectors under this Act should be availed of, and that either the meat inspectors or the agricultural instructors should carry out whatever requires to be done under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy took a long time to get to his point but I do not think it will be necessary to appoint any new inspector.  It is necessary, as the Deputy must realise, to give somebody authority to <Col N="2032" /> deal with the people under this Act. Therefore, it is necessary to put it into the Act that the Minister may appoint inspectors, and so on.  The present inspectors under the Department of Agriculture, who are dealing with that question of seeds in the Department, and the county instructors, will in my opinion, be sufficient. I should like to deal with some of the other points raised by the Deputy. For instance I do not think it is true that the farmer is paying the levy on his cattle.  No Deputy&mdash;and especially no one holding the view, as the Deputy does, that the export price rules all prices&mdash;can possibly be of the opinion that the farmer is paying the levy, because surely the butcher must pay the export price, and if he does pay the export price how does he exact the levy from the farmer?  It is obviously a fallacy for the Deputy to say that the farmer is paying the levy when he sells his cattle to the butcher.  With regard to those other inspectors, the warble fly inspectors of course are under the local authorities and are, therefore, not my officers.  The inspectors under the Cattle and Sheep Act are my officers, and therefore, the two must be different men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously give it as his justification for appointing upwards of 200 warble fly inspectors and that one lot is under the local authority and the other lot is under his control?  Does he seriously say that that is the reason why this double number of inspectors is charged upon the public purse, although the warble fly inspectors were appointed as a result of orders issuing from his office?  The Minister for Agriculture is an innocent kind of man, and in many ways one feels sorry for him in the ridiculous positions into which he is forced.  It was the Minister for Agriculture made the Order requiring the control of the warble fly?</P>

Let him not transfer this service under another Department and give that as an excuse for raising the number of inspectors.

      <P>Then in that case why is this section here if the thing has <Col N="2036" /> been done already?  Why is there an amendment to this section further amplifying it.  The Minister knows well it is not being done and if it is being done it is like a lot of other things that are being done.  The Minister knows quite well that inspection of seeds in a seed store is very different from inspection of corn in the market sold for food purposes or the inspection of any other commodities sold for immediate consumption.  In testing seeds you will want purity and you will want to test for germination. Nobody can take a sample of a seed and looking at it say there is so much per cent. germination and so much per cent. purity.  These can only be ascertained scientifically.  When all these samples are taken I presume they will be tested.  If not it is a pure waste of money taking them.  It is only bluff.</P>

      <P>As the Minister says a certain amount of testing has been going on.  I am aware of that.  But I did understand that this Bill was to go much further and multiply the work one hundredfold.  I think the Department of Agriculture was not satisfied that it controlled the situation.  The Minister says a certain thing has been happening and will happen with a certain amount of inspection.  I do not think there will be any improvement on what has been going on.  My impression was that it was not satisfactory, that enough samples were not taken and that the smaller samples were not tested at all.  Now this will multiply the work.  If the Minister thinks he is carrying it out by a certain amount of inspection as before he is mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will be able to succeed in this.  There will be a considerable <Col N="2037" /> amount of increased samples taken and there are other provisions besides sampling.  It is quite possible with the same number of inspectors to carry on.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am not amending, but rather deleting certain words.  I wanted to amend that by <Col N="2041" /> deleting the phrase in the opening of Section 1 of the Act of 1933.  It was put to me that that was repealing a statute.  I suggest that it is not.  If I wanted to repeal the Act of 1933 I should have to say that the meaning given to the word subscriber established and always had been that contained in the Dáil Eireann Loan Fund Act and no other.  The Dáil put into the Act of 1933 a principle extending the meaning of the words. No one proposed to change that.  I do not propose to change the words of the Act of 1933 in the slightest, but I say that when we come to extending the time for making application, the only people who should be given power to make application in the extended period, are the folk who made application originally.  To the objection that I am proposing to amending the statute, I say I am not.  The statute is left without full force now in the time limit in the Act of 1933.  We are now arriving by way of extension at the time for making applications, and in that connection I submit we should limit the persons entitled to make application to the original subscribers or their legal representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it introduces a completely new machinery with regard to accounts.  When the House passed this Bill on Second Reading it passed it with the phrase providing that certain words and expressions to which a particular meaning is given by Section 1 of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Fund Act, 1934, or by Section 1 of the 1933 Act should have that meaning given to them.  Your ruling would preclude any discussion in relation to these two Acts.  That is a ruling that was never given before.  Definitions were changed from time to time for the purpose of the Bill.  The practice of the House has been that one cannot move to insinuate the principle not passed on Second Reading.  I am moving to agree, by way of limitation, to the extension of the principle passed on Second Reading.  I suggest the only principle accepted was that allowance should be made for the recovery of certain moneys other than the period prescribed, and that that was the only point of principle on Second Reading. Otherwise we must assume that the principle carries not merely outside the basic consideration round which the principle is built but the outstanding feature including the definition.  I suggest this is a very serious limitation of the rights of Deputies in this House in regard to amending measures brought in as amending Acts, because you cannot get it even stated that Dáil Eireann has one definition in a Principal Act and that an amending Act, being an amendment aimed at one point, carries the statement that words defined in a particular way, in a previous Act, should have the same meaning. Apparently, we are being coerced into accepting the contention that such a clause carries, as part of the principle, the definitions.  I say that that has never been done.</P>

The first employment period Order was made on the 28th March, 1935.  It became operative on the 17th April, 1935, but it was not tabled in the House until 4th June, 1935.  Over two months elapsed between the period on which the Order was made and the date upon which it was tabled in the House.  One could understand an isolated omission of that kind, but, when we come to the second employment period Order, we find that it was made on the 29th June, 1935, became operative on the 17th July, and was not tabled until the 30th October.  An Order made on the 29th June was, apparently, held up deliberately until the 30th October of the same year, though it became operative on the 17th July.  It was, therefore, not submitted until three months after it became effective.</P>
    <P>In the present instance, the employment period Order was made on the 10th February, 1936, became operative on the 4th March but was not tabled until the 4th March.  It was necessary to put questions in the House to induce the Minister to lay the Order on the Table.  Otherwise, we should probably have found that the Order would be held up for two or three months, as occurred on two occasions last year. <Col N="2045" /> While the element of delay has been common to the employment period Orders of 1935 and to the employment period Order of 1936, the annulment of which we are now discussing, in other respects there has been a very considerable change in the character of the employment period Orders.  In the case of the first employment period Order of 1935, it was provided that the Order, which affects persons with a valuation of £4 or over, would operate from the 17th April, 1935, until the 21st May, 1935&mdash;a period of five weeks. Later in the year, the Minister made another employment period Order applying to the same persons and others with whom we are not concerned in this discussion.  We are discussing now the application of the Orders of 1935-6 to the class of persons who have a valuation of £4 and over.  The second Order of 1935 became operative from the 17th July, 1935, to the 1st October, 1935&mdash;a period of eleven weeks-so that for the year 1935 the two employment period Orders which were issued were operative for a period of 16 weeks.  At that time the Minister admitted that he made no investigation on any national scale to satisfy himself that persons in this category would be able to obtain work during the currency of the Orders.  He admitted that he made no local inquiries to ascertain whether in certain areas the valuation of the land was such that it was impossible to expect people to exist and to maintain families during the currency of the orders.  The land they held might have been specially valued at a low rate because it was exceptionally poor.</P>
    <P>Although he has carried out no national investigation, and made no local investigation this year, as far as the House is aware, the Minister comes to the Dáil and lays an Order on the Table, the object of which is to prevent persons who hold land with a valuation of £4 or over, from receiving unemployment assistance benefit, not for five weeks or 11 weeks as was provided in 1935, but for a total period of 34 weeks.  Last year the Minister deprived persons with a valuation of £4 and over from drawing unemployment assistance benefit <Col N="2046" /> for a period of 16 weeks under two periods, one of five weeks, and an interregnum, and then a period of 11 weeks.  This year, though he has no evidence to produce to the House to show that the Orders of last year were justified, on the basis of the information available, instead of making two unemployment period Orders, the Minister makes one Order, in respect of that class of person, and provides that it shall be operative from March 4 without interruption until October 27.  It begins therefore much earlier this year than last year and will end much later.  There will be no interregnum during which the persons concerned can draw unemployment assistance benefit.  In other words, the Minister, having succeeded in depriving such persons of benefit for 16 weeks last year, has come to the House and asked for authority to exclude the same class from unemployment assistance for 34 weeks this year.</P>
    <P>We have had no explanation from the Minister either in the Press or in his recent speeches to justify his belief that these persons can find employment during the period of this Order.  We have had no indication from the Minister that he is undertaking any inquiry this year, or that the circumstances in these areas have been investigated with a view, to exempting them from the scope of the Order.  We have had no evidence whatever that there has been any kind of inquiry into the circumstances in the areas affected.  Instead, the Minister comes to the House, apparently prepared to confess that there was no such inquiry, and he asks it to approve of a blanketing Order, the effect of which is to get people with a valuation of £4 or over off the unemployment assistance register.  In my opinion the reluctance and apparent unwillingness of the Minister to carry out any investigation, to make any particular inquiry in any area, or to advert to the circumstances in any area is all due to a desire-and is probably a part of the policy of the Executive Council-to save as much money as possible at the expense of those who were formerly entitled to <Col N="2047" /> unemployment assistance benefit. While the Minister may call this an employment period Order most people who have any contact with the circumstances in rural areas will have no hesitation in saying that this is nothing more or less than an economy Order, designed to sweep thousands of persons off the unemployment assistance register, and to save the benefits formerly provided for them. Last year it was bad enough to sweep them off for 16 weeks.  The Minister feels that having economised so much last year, he can come to the House this year and more than double the hardship that he then imposed on these persons.</P>
    <P>A question was addressed to the Minister on February 6th in which he was asked to state in respect of each employment exchange and branch employment office the number of persons precluded from receiving unemployment assistance owing to the operation of (a) the first employment period Order and (b) the second employment period Order made in 1935, and the total estimated amount saved to the State by the operation of the two Orders.  In his reply the Minister indicated that it was estimated that £12,000 was saved by the first employment period Order of 1935. A sum of £12,000 therefore was saved by excluding persons with a valuation of £4 and over from the unemployment assistance for a period of five weeks.  In other words, the Minister saved by the first employment Order £2,400 per week for five weeks.  This year the number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit is no less than last year, and instead of saving £12,000 for five weeks we will find that the Minister will save not merely £2,400 per week for five weeks but will save approximately £2,400 for a period of 34 weeks.  Last year the saving was £36,000 during the currency of the unemployment period Orders in respect of persons whose valuation was £4 and over, but this year the Minister is going to go one better, and to present the Minister for Finance with £81,000 representing a saving at the rate of £2,400 a week for 34 weeks, all <Col N="2048" /> at the expense of small farmers with valuation of £4 and over.  During the operation of this unemployment period Order the local authorities will be expected to contribute their quota in full towards the Unemployment Assistance Act.  All the savings will be on the Minister's side.  Local authorities will not be empowered to save at all. The entire savings will be on the part of the Central Fund to the tune of £81,600 this year at the expense of small farmers with valuations of £4 and over.</P>
    <P>This year there is the same absence of any kind of inquiry, but the hardship which extended for 16 weeks last year is going to be more than doubled, because these people are going to be deprived of benefit for a period of 34 weeks.  I should like to know from the Minister, and we ought to have had an explanation long before now, what is the basis upon which it is sought to justify an Order of this kind for such a long period, and in the blanketing manner suggested by the Minister?  Is it the contention of the Minister that holdings with a valuation of £4 and over can sustain a man, his wife and family, and that they can by operating such holdings be able to win a standard of remuneration equivalent to what they would receive under the Unemployment Assistance Act?  The Minister can tell us if holdings with a valuation of £4 or over are capable of yielding an income to small holders?  I think the sooner we know in what way a standard of civilised existence can be provided for these people the better. The assumption underlying the Order is that when allowance is made for expenditure in the tilling or the utilisation of the land these people will be able to get £39 by operating the holdings for that period.  I should like the Minister to tell the House in what way a person operating a holding with a valuation of £4 or £4 10s. Od. can secure a return of £39 after his expenditure in the utilisation of the land had been deducted from the income received.</P>
    <P>That test is applied in the case of a holding, a large portion of which is bog, a large portion of which is mountain land, a large portion of which is <Col N="2049" /> utterly unfitted for utilisation in the way of wheat or beet production. When we are discussing the possibility of a farmer being able to find remunerative employment on a small holding of that kind, we have got to remember that only a fortnight ago the Minister for Education asked us to pass an Education Bill the object of which was, during this period, to release the children of small farmers from school so that they might operate on the land, so that, during the 34 weeks referred to in the Order, the smallholder has not only to find remunerative employment for himself on his holding but his wife and family are also to apply their energies to the land.  It is suggested that a man with a family of five or six can find remunerative employment for a period of 34 weeks for himself and his family on a holding with a valuation of £4. I think it is preposterous to suggest that it is possible to utilise the energies of a small farmer and his family, on a holding with a valuation of £4, over this period of 34 weeks.  It is equally absurd in existing circumstances to suggest that, irrespective of the location of such a small holding, it is possible to secure a margin of £39 for that period from the land after the expenses of the farmer in utilising the land have been deducted.</P>
    <P>I think that the manner in which this Order has been tabled is utterly unfair. It has not been tabled as a result of any kind of inquiry.  It has not been tabled as a result of any kind of scientific investigation.  The whole object of the Order seems to be to save money for the Exchequer and in that way to reduce the cost of unemployment assistance for the State.  I suggest to the Minister that it is utterly unfair that the small farmers of the country should be compelled to make this contribution to the saving of State funds when other sections of the community are much more capable of bearing the burden of these savings than the persons affected by this Order. Last year, when the first employment period Order was made, I received a letter from a small farmer in these terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The valuation of my land is £4, but all I get out of it is one meal of <Col N="2050" /> potatoes a day, and a little drop of milk.  I cannot find work so how am I to provide for my wife and nine in family?  I am left on the roadside. Up to last week I was getting 5/6 from the exchange, and some beef. Now both are dropped and I got a notice to say that I can get nothing more until October.  I am in a terrible condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bad as that man was last year, when he was denied benefit for 16 weeks, he is going to be in a still more terrible condition this year when denied benefit for 34 weeks.  Yet these are the people who are supposed to be able to utilise their lands to support themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the man's statement that his valuation was only £4 was correct, he was not affected by the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not write the letter and I am not responsible for the phrasing of it.  The man said that his valuation was £4 but it might be that it was £4 1s. 0d. or £4 2s. 0d.  At all events, such men are cut off from unemployment assistance, under this employment period Order, because of the holding which gave him one meal of potatoes a day and a drop of milk. His family of nine were unable to get a livelihood on the land but they were denied unemployment assistance benefit during the period of the Order. That happened to him last year for 16 weeks.  He is going to suffer the same hardship this year but in a multiplied way because he is going to suffer, not for 16 weeks, but for 34.  There was not a single advertence to the circumstances in that case or similar cases when this Order was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister ought never have made these employment period Orders.  He should have allowed these people to draw unemployment assistance benefit; but if he were able to show that if they had holdings capable of providing remunerative employment, then the circumstances in individual cases could be reviewed, or a provision could have been made in the employment period Order for an appeal against such persons being <Col N="2051" /> deprived of unemployment assistance benefit for a period of 34 weeks.  But the Minister will not allow any appeal during the 34 weeks.  He is not prepared to allow the cases to be reviewed individually, in the light of the circumstances of each smallholder or in the light of the quality of the land or the size of the family to be provided for.  The reluctance of the Minister to do that is clearly based on his belief that this Order could not be justified if there was any kind of rational inquiry into the circumstances of people in the rural areas affected by the Order.  I think the members of the House will have no hesitation in making of the employment period Order was unfair in principle in the first instance, but that the making of an Order which extends the exemption from unemployment assistance benefit to 34 weeks instead of 16 last year, is still more unfair.  I ask the House to support the motion so that the Order may be annulled.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the objection that has been raised to amendment No. 1.  If I might briefly summarise what was said, it was put to me that amendment No. 1 was out of order on the ground that it is attempting to repeal a statute.  I suggest that whatever reason may be given for ruling it out that is not the reason.  It does not attempt to repeal a statute, and whether it attempts to do so or not, it does not succeed in doing so, because it leaves the Act of 1933 completely in force for the purposes for which the Act of 1933 was passed, and within the time assigned by that Act.  I ask for a ruling that it is not out of order on the ground of repealing a statute, because it certainly does not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took it, however, from what you said, Sir, that a second objection had emerged, that what is now proposed is against the principle that was accepted on Second Reading.  That is not a point I was so well prepared to meet as it was not put to me, but as it is put now there appear to be two <Col N="2055" /> things agreed as having been included in the principle (1) the extension of time and (2) the machinery of audit. These two things are mentioned.  If the Act of 1933 was not mentioned I think there could be agreement that by bringing a reference to it I was bringing in something outside the scope of the consideration of those who passed the Second Reading but, equally with the mention of the time, and the machinery of audit, there is mentioned the class to whom the Bill applies by reference to the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>If I am allowed to move amendments to the time which, I believe, I am allowed to move, and to the machinery of audit which I have moved, and which have been passed, I cannot see how logically I am forbidden to move amendments to the only third point that occurs in the Bill, namely, the class of people to whom it is to apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy states that his amendment would leave the Act of 1933 in full force.  The House agreed that this Bill should apply to the Acts of 1924 and 1933 in regard to the definition of a subscriber. Therefore, to curtail the meaning of subscriber would certainly not leave the Act of 1933 in full force, and is against the decision which the House came to, that this Bill accepts subscriber as defined in the 1933 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the definition of the class to whom it was to apply was not by way of reference to another Act, but was the phrase &ldquo;subscriber shall mean,&rdquo; would I be allowed to move an amendment?  I suggest, certainly, as I am allowed to move an amendment to the time, by either enlarging or extending it, or an amendment to the machinery by asking to have a new scheme of audit approved. If the reference was to subscribers, not by reference to a definition in another Act, but by a definition contained in this Bill, I suggest that I could clearly move an amendment enlarging or limiting the class.  When the House passed the Bill which has three things in it&mdash; audit, machinery, time within which application should be made, and the <Col N="2056" /> people who may make the application &mdash;it is suggested here that I may move to change the audit, that I may move to change the time, but I may not move to change the classes.  There is no logic in that.</P>

      <P>If the Bill contained a definition of &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo;<i>de novo</i>, as it does provisions for audit, the Deputy would have been entitled to submit an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;subscriber,&rdquo; but the term &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; is defined in the Act of 1933, and the House agreed that the amending of the date and the audit should apply to the Act of 1933.  Therefore, to alter the word &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; is submitting an amendment not to this Act, but to the Act of 1933, and I definitely rule that amendment and amendment No. 5 similarly out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition carried into this Bill by reference to the Act of 1933 is an enlarging of the original subscriber, and this was done in a Bill ordinarily known as the <Col N="2057" /><i>Irish Press</i> Bill, and this is the <i>Irish Press</i> Bill, second edition.  It has no other purpose than to bolster up a journalistic position which, apparently, is not healthy and needs some sort of buttressing.  That was achieved in the Act of 1933 by enlarging the class of people who could make application for the repayment of moneys paid into a particular fund. Originally, when moneys were to be repaid, they were to be repaid only to a subscriber as defined, and the definition of a subscriber was a person who had subscribed or, in case that person had died, his legal personal representatives. Repayment was only to be made to the individual who subscribed, except that person had died, when there should be repayment to the legal personal representatives.</P>
      <P>In the 1934 Act that was changed. Power was given then to make repayments of moneys, where the subscription had been made by A, B or C to people who claimed to have a right under or through A, B or C, but not being A, B and C themselves, or in the position that A, B and C were dead. The reason for that was because, previous to the measure being passed, and not having it before them when the other arrangement was made, certain people had assigned, for particular purposes, their rights, whatever they were, in some of these Dáil Bonds.  The President of this State had got these into his possession and proposed to use them in a particular way, which was described in the debate which took place the last time, as a dishonest use of State money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was thought that the claim could be substantiated under the law as it stood, there was a very easy way to test it.  If the President got such an assignment of these moneys as to enable him to use them under the law in a private way for the buttressing up of the newspaper, he could have gone to the court in one case and fried it out.  But he shirked that issue. He decided to have this House, governed by a majority of his Party, pass an Act which would give him, as head of that Party, the power to apply State moneys to a newspaper of his own.  That enlargement was carried <Col N="2058" /> here, and was in the end carried when you, Sir, ruled out discussion on the Fourth and Fifth Stages, when only one speech had been made, after an all-night sitting at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.  That was the attention that the House was allowed to give to this particular matter of what I call a dishonest diversion of public money to a proprietary concern for Party purposes.</P>
    <P>Because the President, presumably, had not been vigilant enough to get these moneys thoroughly inside his grip before the last Act was passed, and before the time limit to make an application under the last Act expired, and in order to enable more moneys to be diverted in this particularly odious way, the President has to be given another opportunity to allow himself to get hold of more bonds, and as agent for these people, and on behalf of his newspaper, to make application to have further moneys diverted from the State for his own special personal or Party purposes.  That is the only reason for bringing in the definition given to &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; in the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that sufficient odium had been incurred over this whole very nasty business and that whatever the President had got away with&mdash;it is a phrase appropriate to loot, and loot is appropriate to this discussion&mdash;through his agents, or through the supposed agency matter, was good enough for him.  But it comes to the peak point of brazenness to come to the House, running against criticism for the second time, in order to enable the President to get more of these unfortunate people to hand over these bonds in order that he may get diverted to him, for his own personal Party purposes, the moneys subscribed for the State.</P>
    <P>They were supposed to be subscribed for a republic and supposed to be paid only when the republic was functioning. I should have thought that one might say: &ldquo;There may be some subscribers who have not heard either of the Act of 1924 or of the Act of 1933; they have not made application and we will give them a chance to apply.&rdquo;<Col N="2059" /> That could be done by saying &ldquo;subscriber,&rdquo; but &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; as it was limited in the first Act, and that only subscribers themselves were now to make application within the extended time, or, if subscribers were deceased, that application could be made for them by legal personal representatives. That was the purpose I aimed at in the amendment ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a Bill containing that, and containing the further provisions about audit and winding up, would be a Bill that this House could pass without any conscientious twinge or feeling that the House again was being used for very obvious and disgusting Party purposes.  We are not being asked to do that.  We are not being asked to make an enlargement of the <Col N="2060" /> time in order to enable subscribers themselves, or, in the case of dead subscribers, their legal personal representatives, to claim the money that belongs to them.  Nobody is anxious to make anybody wait until the republic has been six months in existence. Nobody could object to these subscribers, these genuine subscribers, being allowed to get back their own money. In so far as this measure, by a definition, allows again the President to work this odious and dirty trick on the House and on the country of getting into his hands for use in his Party newspaper the funds subscribed for the good of the country generally, I am going to oppose this particular clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 2 to Section 2; as I have informed the Deputy, the amendment introduces a new principle and is, therefore, out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of obtaining information, may I take it that it is considered to be improper in this House to introduce not something which contravenes a principle passed on the Second Reading, but something which is subsidiary to it?  I understand, and I have always understood, that we would not be allowed to move amendments which ran contrary to the principle that was accepted on Second Reading, but I understood that that was a standard in relation to the principle. There is a new point being introduced now&mdash;that some principle which is not phrased even to be contrary to the Second Reading idea must be ruled out.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is this: I do not know how language can be strained to say that a machinery resolution or a machinery clause can be regarded as a principle.  To ask that there should be put before the Dáil a statement of those who have already got money from the State, and in regard to those people in each case to state whether it is the original subscriber or some agent of his, I cannot understand how that can by any stretch of imagination be construed to be a principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put some hypothetical questions, which the Chair will not answer.  The Chair rules on specific points, and gives a ruling on any amendment submitted. In my opinion this amendment introduces matter which does not arise out of the principles of the Bill as read a Second Time and is therefore out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before that ruling is given definitely, I should like to say that the principle as I understand it which was passed on Second Reading was to enable an enlargement of time to be made with regard to the application for subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann Loan, and to introduce certain machinery for audit; as part of which machinery for audit I propose to add the laying on the Table of the House of certain information.  I have been told that amendments 3 and 4 are in order, although they are proposing to add to what is proposed that the House should also get information in each case as to whether the subscriber or an agent has made application.  I also propose to extend that so as to cover subscriptions already paid.  How does it come that one is in order as not being an extension of the Second Reading principle, and the other is out of order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in this Bill for the audit of the accounts of those funds.  Amendments 3 and 4 deal with that audit and, therefore, are in order.  I might say incidentally that if the Chair in courtesy notifies certain Deputies beforehand of its attitude towards their amendments it is hardly fair to paraphrase the wording that the Chair used in so notifying Deputies.  Regarding amendment No. 2, which asks the Minister to lay before Dáil Eireann within one month after the passing of this Act certain lists, it does not relate to either the audit or the date.  I consider that it is not relevant and, therefore, I definitely rule it out.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation.  I do not want it to be thought that I introduced any paraphrase. This says: &ldquo;Amendment 2, which introduces a principle in amending the Bill as read a Second Time, is out of order.&rdquo;  That is exactly my phrase.  I had my eye on that when I read it.  It was no paraphrase.</P>

      <P>I was not commenting in particular on what Deputy McGilligan did on this occasion.  I refer to the general principle that if the Chair in courtesy writes to Deputies and informs them in advance of its attitude towards amendments, that information should not be debated in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second, this is to amend Section 4 of the Act of 1933 by introducing the date of 30th June, 1936, instead of the date of 31st August, 1934.  The whole section is that any person or the duly authorised agent of any person who claims to be a subscriber to the External Loans may at any time before that date apply in writing for the redemption of the amount claimed.  It further says that no person who has omitted to make an application under the foregoing sub-section for redemption would be entitled to be repaid.  In the section the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by the Minister. That gave power not merely to the original subscribers, or to their personal representatives if the original subscribers were dead, to make application within a certain time, but gave power to any person or duly authorised agent of any such person.  We are now asked to extend the time.  We have not been told why.  We have not been told whether any original subscribers failed to make application within the time and had since made application to the Ministry.  We have not been told if it is a matter of the President &mdash;again I use the word advisedly&mdash; scrounging for more of those assignments to him of moneys previously subscribed to help this country to a certain national position, and now wanting to divert those for the purpose of his Party newspaper. If it is that, surely we should condemn him, at any rate, for his lack of vigilance.  Most people are <Col N="2064" /> vigilant about money.  Most people are particularly vigilant about money that does not belong to them.  Why should we give a man an opportunity to mend his hand by getting, for the purpose of his Party newspaper, money which does not belong to him after a date that was originally fixed?  If, in fact, the President did not get enough &mdash;and enough varies according to the particular stage of the decline of the newspaper&mdash;what might have been enough when the Act of 1933 was being passed may now not seem to be enough at all.  The appetite grows by what it feeds on, and if we had to help a particularly lame dog over a rather low type of hurdle, then there is now more of this peculiar type of oxygen needed to get it a step forward.</P>
      <P>I submit there has to be a case made; whatever case has to be made about the pilfering of public funds for Party propaganda let it be made here. Why did not the President get the money?  Were any people recalcitrant? Did any people write to him?  Why has the date, the 31st August, 1934, been passed?  What is the reason for giving these various agents of the original subscribers time to the 30th June, 1936, to make their applications? If the original subscriber made a case nobody could object.  There would be no objection to the making of a case that in the main there is a group of original subscribers who did not know anything about the Act and did not make application.  Then there would be some satisfaction in passing this. On account of the absence of an explanation of these things, there is bound to be the suspicion that it was because the President defaulted in getting these moneys into his own fist for the purpose of using them for his Party newspaper.  We should object to that.  It is bad enough to have to give way with a republican Government in office and to have to veer from the original tone of the bonds which gave a sufficiently good expectation of payment within a reasonable time.  We are not surely now so despairing of the declaration of a republic that the people cannot wait another six months to get this payment for those who failed to get it within that time.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan does his usual stuff, throwing as much dirt as he can in the hope that some of it will stick.  The Minister for Finance explained on the Second Stage of this Bill that it was necessary that those who subscribed during the Black and Tan war and helped this country to free itself should be repaid.  Upwards of 15,000 had applied after the date fixed in the Act of 1934.  Deputy McGilligan knew that perfectly well.  If the Deputy wanted to know the reason for the extension of the time, if he took an intelligent interest in the matter, if he looked up the reasons that were given on the Second Stage for its introduction he would know.  Of course, we all know and we are pleased to see that Deputy McGilligan is angry at the success of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  When the Act was being introduced and discussed a couple of years ago it was prophesied that the <i>Irish Press</i> would not last another six months.  It is still going strong and, thank goodness, the Irish people have a newspaper on which they can rely for news.  The Irish people will not be confined to papers that sided with the British against the Irish people.  They will not be confined to those papers in order to see what is happening.  Of course Deputy McGilligan and those with him would like to see us dependent on those papers still.  They would like to see the people absolutely blindfolded in regard both to home affairs and to foreign affairs.  But that is not happening now and it is not going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who subscribed originally to the Dáil Eireann External Loan have a right to be repaid.  Even the Government that was in office here before the present Government promised to repay them.  It did not suit their political purpose at the time to carry out their promises.  But we are carrying them out and we are repaying the people who came forward in a time of national stress to help the Irish people at home in their fight. If any of those people abroad thought it right or thought it wise in the interests of Ireland to transfer some of these bonds to the <i>Irish Press</i> they <Col N="2066" /> had a perfect right to do so.  What is worrying Deputy McGilligan is that a large number of people who were faithful to Ireland in 1931 carried on and supported the President when he was establishing an Irish national newspaper here to continue the fight for Irish freedom.  Notwithstanding all the dirt that Deputy McGilligan may throw, the people who subscribed originally are going to get paid and any of them who did not apply within the time limit fixed by the Act of 1934 are going to get an opportunity of applying now within the time fixed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is evading my question.  There were certain moneys in America.  We will assume for the purpose of argument, that some of that money was X and some of it was Y.  X was in America and Y was to be put up here.  Is the Minister aware of the fact that in my evidence before the commission held here I stated that we did not want the money and that when we got the money it would be left here and an equivalent sum in proportion to our liabilities would be added to it and that the money would be paid to the subscribers?  That offer was not accepted.  The moneys had not been entirely distributed before we left office.  But assuming that some time had elapsed, we did not get possession of the documents.  We did not get them from the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe proceedings were in course to get possession of them and to get information about them.  At all events, it so happened that it suited the Minister and his Party that the moneys had not been distributed, and if there is any advantage in it, it is for his Party the advantage is.  We wanted none of that money for our Party, not one penny of it.  We undertook to discharge the payment, and would have discharged the payment of the money subscribed had we not been interfered with by the Minister and his Party.  The prime mover in that was the present President of the Executive Council.  That action of his has cost this State, I suppose £100,000 at the very least. Was it good business?  Apparently the Minister and his Party considered it was.  But it was not honourable business&mdash;not by any means honourable business.  The Minister has no right to say that there was any political manoeuvre in the case of the last Executive Council in meeting this liability.  They wanted to meet it ten <Col N="2068" /> years ago and would have met it were it not for the interference, obstruction and opposition of the Minister and his Party.  As I have pointed out, it has cost this State £100,000 and it has dragged our name in the mud.  That has been the work of the Minister and his Party, and not our responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is anybody trying to drag the name of this country in the mud over this business it is Deputy Cosgrave's Party.  Will the Deputy tell me that the man who buys a Government Bond cannot assign it to another person in discharge of a debt or as a gift?  Will the Deputy claim that a person who subscribed £100 to the National Loan cannot transfer that?  The Deputy talked about the repudiation of debt.  If I buy £10 worth of national bonds, or subscribe £100 to the National Loan, and assign it to the <i>Irish Press</i> or any other organisation, would he repudiate my right to do that?  Would he claim he had any right to repudiate the contract he entered into with the original subscriber, and that he was entitled to refuse to repay it?  Who is dragging the country into the mud, if not the Deputy and his Party?  People who subscribed the money to the original Dáil Eireann Loan are in exactly the same position.  Deputy Cosgrave says he agreed at one time to repay that money.  Why did he not carry out his promise?  What right has he to repudiate any liability on foot of the debts he said he would repay?</P>
      <P>If the Currency Commission issued £1 six or seven years ago and someone who held it gave that £1 to the <i>Irish Press</i> is not the <i>Irish Press</i> entitled to claim that £1 from the Currency Commission? The Deputy should think twice before lending his name to the tactics Deputy McGilligan adopts in this matter.</P>

      <P>Pay the subscribers. This is another question. Let us understand one another. Much the same case arose before when we were dealing with Dáil Eireann Internal Loan.  The Minister can inquire whether assigning was allowed.  My recollection is that we disallowed it, unless it was made with the knowledge of the Department, and for very good reason.  A man walked in one day to a friend and gave him a bond for £100 which, in 12 months time, was to be worth £140.  He said he wanted the money.  Just in order to sound the man with regard to what he thought it was worth, the other asked him what it was worth. He said: &ldquo;I will take £50 for it.&rdquo; Would the Minister stand over a thing like that?  Would he stand over an arrangement by which a bond that would be worth £140 in 12 months was transferred for £50? Would the Executive Council stand over that?  It would not be fair. This money was borrowed for a particular purpose.  It ought to be paid back to those who subscribed it.  If a subscriber properly sold his bond for a consideration, and that consideration turned out to have due relation to the bond, it would be a different thing altogether.  But if an unfortunate man who finds himself short of money is prepared to transfer a bond worth £140 in 12 months for £10 or £50 or even £90, I would not stand over that. It would not be right.  If the Minister wants any comment from me as to what is being done in this case I would say that I am positively ashamed of what has been done about these assignments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>Will the Deputy answer my question?  If I subscribed £100 to the National Loan and got no bond at all except that they said they would repay me plus a certain interest for each year, if I wished to sell that £100 worth of National Loan for £10 or £50 or for 10d. or to give it away altogether, would the Deputy say that the person to whom I assigned it would not be entitled to exactly the same rights <Col N="2071" /> as I had originally to the repayment of that loan inside a certain number of years and to the interest in the meantime?</P>

      <P>I give the same answer to that question as I gave to the other.  The former Executive Council would not stand over an assignment unless it was positively proved that the consideration was worth the money.  The Minister may say that he has a perfect right to sell that £100 for even 10d. if he likes, but I say that the person offering the 10d. for the £100 is not an honest man.</P>

Reveal the purpose of it and we shall know where we stand, without this parade of national dignity and national honesty to buttress up a decaying newspaper.  That is what we are against.  The Minister makes the case that he has the right to assign a £100 bond.  Does he want that applied to the facts of the Dáil loan?  If so, why put into the measure of 1933 the phrase that a subscriber means not merely a subscriber but any person entitled to hold by or under him and any such subscriber's agent&mdash;why put in this phrase unless the Ministry had a fear that the courts might inquire into the way in which the President got hold of these bonds and might decide that it was dishonest and not allow him to get the money?  It was because of that that the second extension of the word &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; was made.  The Minister may say that he has the right to assign.  He has when the transaction takes place between two parties who know the circumstances and are properly advised.

      <P>The phrase is withdrawn, but I am going to describe the President's conduct.  I cannot use the phrase which has been ruled out of order, but the English language is not without its resources.  The President fooled people into parting with their money.  What did he do?  He went across at a time when nobody expected to get anything on these bonds, and he put up the case that there was great need in this country for a newspaper. He buttressed his arguments by quotations from Professor O'Rahilly, which Professor O'Rahilly never authorised him to use, and from Professor Tierney, which Professor Tierney repudiated as soon as he saw them.  By means of all that, the President is enabled to fool people into assigning these bonds to him.  If the Ministry believed that these assignments were properly made, they need not have extended the meaning of the word &ldquo;subscriber.&rdquo;  One test case would have decided whether the assignments were properly made or not.  The Ministry would not face that issue.  They did not want it brought to the courts.  They did not want to face the courts on the question whether the President had fooled the subscribers into parting with their money or not.  So they evaded the issue by extending the meaning of &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo;<Col N="2074" /> to any authorised agent or any person claiming by or under such person. If the Minister had any belief in his contention that those people in America had the right to assign, had rightly assigned, and that the transaction was a legal one which the courts would have stood over, there was no necessity to enlarge the meaning of the word &ldquo;subscriber.&rdquo;  The fact that that was done shows what, in their own innermost thoughts, the Ministry felt about the President's action.</P>
      <P>One of the Ministers has told us that those people who subscribed did so to help the country to free itself.  That is not a real, republican phrase.  That is not the sturdy republicanism I should expect from the Minister.  One ought not to be ashamed of the phrase in the bond.  The bond is payable &ldquo;six months after the declaration of an Irish republic.&rdquo;  There is no nonsense there about getting the country free.  The &ldquo;declaration of an Irish republic&rdquo; is the phrase that is used.  The Minister ought not to be afraid to have these words in his mouth.  He has recently helped to jail people for using them. There was a time when he was very fond of the phrase, and he should not run away from it now.  He should not be afraid to look forward to&mdash;with the Ministry at present in power&mdash;the very short period that will elapse before the Irish republic is declared.  There is no nonsense in the bond about people parading to free the country.  A specific event was to determine the time at which the necessary payment was to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that American case to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred. The President was the instigator of that case, and it was fought by him. It cost the funds that were subscribed by these people £100,000 at least.  What was the gist of the argument by the President on that occasion?  That the late Government were not the successors of the Dáil under whose auspices this loan was run, and, therefore, had no right to get any of the moneys, and no right to repay them.  Nevertheless, the present Government, who are the successors of the Government that were not the inheritors of the republic, get hold of the moneys and proceed to <Col N="2075" /> pay out.  We have gone a long way from the declaration of the Irish republic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this is completely within the section.  I think we should get that question settled once and for all so that there will be no interruption.  This debate has progressed on ordinary lines and quite relevantly to the subject matter of the section.  The case to which I referred was fought out in America. The President argued that the late Government had no right to any of these moneys, because the late Government were not the successors of the republican Government.  But the people who succeeded us are the successors of the republican Government and are paying out although they, before they succeeded us, said that we, to whom they hoped to succeed, were not the successors of the second Dáil. On that futile controversy, £100,000 of this good money was wasted.  The late Government did make a promise to repay and the gist of the issue lay there.  They promised to repay&mdash;to whom?  To the subscribers, and there was to be no monkeying with the subscribers' money.  They were to get the money.  I should have no objection to subscribers being told at a certain point, &ldquo;This bond is valuable; you are going to get payment for every cent of it; you can now assign it, knowing that it is valuable consideration.&rdquo; But I think it is ludicrous to ask this House to pay out this money to people who, we say, when parting with these bonds, did not believe they were worth five cents&mdash;at a time when there was legal action being taken to prevent the Government who had control of funds from getting any right or title even to repay the bonds.  The people who adopted that attitude go across and say, &ldquo;Give us these bits of paper; they do not mean very much,&rdquo; and now, as the Minister says, they were paying to enable this country to free itself.  The Minister asked Deputy Cosgrave to think twice.  That would be a big effort for the Minister, but I <Col N="2076" /> ask him to think once and, apart from thinking, to read the bond.  If the Minister is not illiterate he will know what the phrases are, and will know what the proceedings turned upon as to who were the successors of Dáil Eireann.  The Minister must know the argument that was put up against that.  I object definitely to be asked in an amending Bill at this time to allow an extension of time.  I do not refer to the original subscribers that the Minister was so vague about.  If there are any original subscribers to be added who missed the opportunity, let us open the door to them, but certainly shut it against the President in an attempt to get money for the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I was told incidentally regarding the <i>Irish Press</i> that the Irish people have now a paper upon which they can rely.  There is an obvious way of showing whether people rely on it or not.  Are they buying it; are they advertising in it?</P>

Some of these might be found not to be new applicants.  How many applications are being made through the agency of the President? That is what I want to know?</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan said that the American subscribers to the Dáil Eireann External Loan parted with their bonds to the President when they were not worth five cents.  The Deputy also alluded to the fact that the American courts had ruled that these funds were to be returned to the subscribers.  That was at least three years before the <i>Irish Press</i> was started, so that the people who assigned any of the bonds to the <i>Irish Press</i> knew perfectly well that they were assigning bonds worth at least their portion of the fund which the courts said were to be returned.  So <Col N="2077" /> much for the Deputy's argument that they did not think the bonds were worth five cents.  Deputy Costello can assure Deputy McGilligan that that is so.  Bonds were assigned to other people besides the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I was in America about 1928 and I remember that a representative of an Irish church organisation in the United States circularised and canvassed a large number of the original subscribers to the Irish External Loan, asking them to assign the bonds to the Chinese Mission, and I am perfectly well aware that a large number of them did so assign their bonds.  I know also that in another instance, the building of a church in memory of the late Father Yorke of San Francisco, a number of gentlemen in that city canvassed the original subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Loan and asked them to assign their bonds to the committee for the purpose of building a church.  Deputy Cosgrave stated that they had announced to the world and to the subscribers as far back as 1924 that they would repay these bonds. Simply because these original subscribers knew that the bonds were at least worth their proportion of the funds held by the American courts, which the courts held should be returned to the subscribers on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President Cosgrave, on behalf of the Free State, stated that he would supplement the award that was made by the American courts to bring the payments up to the full 100 per cent.  The owners knew that the bonds they were assigning were worth a substantial amount&mdash; worth, as President Cosgrave said, 100 cents to the dollar.  Some of the bonds were assigned to the <i>Irish Press</i>, some to the Chinese Mission, some to the church in San Francisco, many to friends and to other charitable purposes. Because this is a dirty political game, and because some people exercised the right to assign the bonds to the <i>Irish Press</i>, Deputy McGilligan is endeavouring to prevent them exercising their right to assign the bonds to the Chinese mission or to the church&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I desire to ask the Minister for the sake of the credit of the Government, which, for good or ill, is the Government of the people, to give clear evidence of its resolution not to be involved in any shady transaction. If the promoter of any mining enterprise discovered a valuable deposit of ore on the property and then went around to his friends and said: &ldquo;I have no particular reason to believe that these shares are worth anything. In fact, I hold that the people at present running the mine could not pay a dividend, because they are not the legitimate owners of the mine at all.  Therefore, what about making them over to me.  I will put them to some good use.&rdquo;  I think the Minister would seriously consider prosecuting that man for a fraud, if he proceeded to run the mine and to pay himself dividends on shares obtained from dupes.  The present President of the Executive Council went to the American courts and said that Saorstát Eireann could not pay these funds as <Col N="2079" /> they were not the legitimate successors of the Second and Third Dáil.  He afterwards abandoned that position and acquired the bonds by assignment from people who could ill-afford to assign them, and with the bonds in his pocket he came home and introduced legislation to redeem them at 100 per cent.  There is a simple way of testing whether the assignors of the bonds believed them to be worth face value. Let the President take whatever bonds cent.  There is a simple way of testing were assigned to him and let the cheque issued by the Government of the Saorstát for the redemption of the bonds be returned to the assignors with a letter to the effect that the assignments were made when the value of the bonds was in question, but that as they were now being redeemed at 100 per cent. he waived his claim to any assignments made under a misapprehension, in the confidence that if the assignors intended that he should get valuable bonds they would return the cheque and cancel the bonds in favour of whatever purpose the President desired to use them.  The President would then receive the bonds from the assignors when they knew what they were doing, knowing that they meant him to have the money. Surely that is the easy way to put an end to the whole thing, to give these people an opportunity to revoke the assignments, if, in fact, they were misled when making them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they were not misled, they will send the money and the cancelled bonds back to the President who can use it for any purpose he likes or for any purpose the assignor indicates. There is no use in the Attorney-General or the Minister for Defence trying to pretend that it is a desirable or savoury transaction for the President of the Executive Council to introduce a Bill to this House and subsequently pass an amending Bill for the purpose of providing himself with funds&mdash; because that is what the effect of this legislation is&mdash;at the expense of persons in America who bought bonds, when they were ill able to do so, for a very lofty purpose and subsequently parted with them under very ambiguous circumstances.  A Deputy once <Col N="2080" /> said that the President of the Executive Council should be like Cæsar's wife&mdash;above reproach.  Cæsar's wife would not have lasted long if she entered into transactions of this sort. Her name certainly would not have become proverbial for a very lofty standard of conduct in succeeding generations.  I suggest both to the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General that quite apart from the President's personal character, his character as President of the Executive Council of the State demands that there should be no question of ambiguity in regard to any financial transaction into which he enters directly or indirectly.  Ambiguity is a charitable description to apply to the manner of the acquisition of these bonds for no consideration except shares in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>We object to the redemption of these bonds on such an assignment. We believe that it reflects on the public life of the country, but if the Minister will now say that the President is quite prepared to pay the money to the assignors&mdash;the President can invite them if he likes to return it to him&mdash; I have no hesitation in saying that our objection to this Bill will be immediately withdrawn and we shall be glad to facilitate him in securing the names of subscribers and in taking such other steps as will enable the Executive Council to redeem the loan to its last penny.  But to enter into a conspiracy with the Government to line the pockets of the shareholders of the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;who, we cannot disguise from ourselves, are largely representatives or supporters of the Government &mdash;or to enter into a conspiracy with the Government to buttress up a semi-decrepit political hack paper is something we are not prepared to do.  The Minister can prove his good faith and that of the President by adopting our suggestion.  If he is prepared to do that he will have the unanimous support of the House in any steps he takes which are necessary to secure the repayment of this loan to the last penny.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Deputy who has just sat down that before he lays down what should be a guide to be followed by the President in this matter he should have considered suggesting a guide to the Opposition in regard to their attitude towards the previous Bill and towards this Bill.  This is the first time I have taken part in a discussion on either of these Bills, but I have listened to the deluge of bilge from Deputy McGilligan and others in connection with certain transactions which they have described here to-night and described in words which seem to me to be words which should not have been used by responsible Deputies, particularly by persons in a responsible position in the Opposition, without first satisfying themselves that there was some basis of justification for their charges.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan have calmly alleged here to-night that there was some onus on the Party to whom these bonds were assigned to go to the court and inquire as to whether the transactions by which these bonds were acquired were legitimate and proper.  They have accused the President&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can deal with my interpretation of his remarks afterwards.  Deputy McGilligan used certain words here in his attack on the President.  The exact word he withdrew but, as he said himself, he fell back upon the resources of the English language to say in other words what An Leas-Cheann Comhairle had ruled out of order.  He charged the President with touring America &ldquo;scrounging&rdquo; for funds for the <i>Irish Press</i>, deluding and deceiving unfortunate people into parting with certain property on a misrepresentation as to its value.  That is a charge, of all those things which are included in the word &ldquo;overreaching,&rdquo; which I take it any lawyer member of the Opposition must know, if they could substantiate it in court, would justify the cancellation of the transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon; I did not interrupt him and he might allow me to say what I have to say without interruption. Deputy McGilligan talked a lot of ridiculous, absurd law.  I have said that I think it is a disgrace to the Opposition, that throughout these two long debates they have lent themselves to abusing the head of the State, in the manner in which they have, without producing one single instance of a subscriber, or a person who has assigned a bond, who suggests that he had been defrauded in any way by the President.  I say, and Deputy Dillon ought to realise it, that persons who make charges against the head of the State in that way, two years after the principal Act was passed, ought to have been able to produce in this House, at least one single instance of a person who alleged that he had been misled into parting with property the value of which he did not know and into parting with it because he was deceived by the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years have elapsed since a debate in this House in which Deputies who are here, and a Deputy who is not here now, made allegations of this kind against the President.  They have run these debates with something like a smile of satisfaction on their faces, knowing that they were throwing mud at Ministers of the State and hoping that some of it would stick, but never have they produced even a single letter from a subscriber to suggest that their charges were justified.  The Minister in charge of the Bill said that the number of subscribers was 200,000, and that of these 200,000, 15,000 had sent in their claims late.  Out of these 200,000 subscribers, Deputies opposite who have levelled this charge and have utilised these debates for the purpose of showering bilge water on the President and the Government, have not mentioned a single instance which would bear a moment's examination, to show that such charges were justified. <Col N="2083" /> Then Deputy Dillon, perhaps honestly, but I should say without due consideration, comes forward with the suggestion that it was on the President of the Executive Council to prove that everything he had done was above suspicion.  Two years should have been sufficient to enable the Opposition to produce even one case of a person who could show that the President had acted improperly.  The Minister for Defence has shown the history of these transactions.  Deputy Cosgrave knows their history, and to-night he suggested that he had made terms, away back when the matter of these transactions was before the courts, to put up sufficient money which, added to the amounts held in the American courts, would enable the money to be paid in full.  He did not say that he ever withdrew that offer or that any bondholder was anything but under the impression that at some future date the bonds would be honoured in full by some Government here.  He only suggested that the delay in payment was due to the proceedings initiated by the President in the courts there.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are quite aware of the hollowness and hypocrisy of the case which is being made here against the President.  They are well aware that they claimed to be successors of the First Dáil and claimed these moneys.  They are well aware that, whatever may be said against the President's action in challenging their title in the courts, the judge in America did not decide in their favour. It is true that the judge did not decide in the President's favour either, but gave judgment that the money should go back to the subscribers. What was to prevent Deputy Cosgrave, the moment that decision of Judge Peters was given, from saying: &ldquo;I am prepared now, the moment the money has gone back to the subscribers and their names have been ascertained, to add to the sum awarded to each subscriber the amount necessary to bring it up to the full figure&rdquo;?  According to Deputy Cosgrave himself, that was what he was prepared to do; but now <Col N="2084" /> it is suggested that, because the President got assignments of the bonds from the people who owned these bonds, these particular bonds should be kept out&mdash;that every other bond assignment and every transaction dealing with them should be honoured, but that these particular bonds should be earmarked for non-payment.  That is what I understood was suggested.  Now, two years after the main Act was passed, those people who have been suggesting that these transactions were tainted, and should not be honoured, have not been able, by one single instance, to justify these charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General, apparently, altogether excluded from his recollection the initial move in this case.  The initial move in this case was the move of the President to prevent this State getting these moneys and discharging those obligations.</P>

      <P>And the same person, having put every obsfacle in the way of this State in getting these moneys, and consequently in preventing them from being paid, occupies his time in getting these assignments and puts this State to £100,000 expense.  Now, assuming for the moment that that person can be painted even more gloriously than the Attorney-General, in his enthusiasm, has painted him&mdash; that he is almost angelic&mdash;such action, to say the least of it, is not businesslike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with the persons who make the charges.  I am stating the case.  The Attorney-General comes in here, as a lawyer and as the adviser of the Executive Council, and he has not a leg to stand on in the case he has made.  The very person he is supporting put this State to the expense of £100,000 and, having done that and having gone to the courts to prevent this State from entering into possession of the assets, so that they might be able to shoulder the liabilities, then a certain amount <Col N="2085" /> of time was employed by that person in getting those assignments.  You can call him angelic if you like, but I do not like that sort of thing.  It does not look well.  In the first place, we were not the successors&mdash;this State wis not the successor&mdash;of the persons who borrowed the money.  Very good! The case goes before the courts.  It is a very unsavoury case.  You were beaten in that case in the courts until other people came in&mdash;representatives of the bondholders&mdash;and money was poured out in America&mdash;for what purpose? -to prove that this Dáil was not in the line of succession from the First Dáil.  That was the whole case.  I will just give the Attorney-General two questions that were put to the President of the Executive Council.  The judge said: &ldquo;You say you had a Republic?&rdquo; The answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Had you your own postage?&rdquo;&ldquo;We allowed the British to function as regards the Post Office.&rdquo; The judge said: &ldquo;That is not the question I put to you.  Had you your own postage?&rdquo;&ldquo;No, we allowed the British to function.&rdquo; The next question was, &ldquo;Had you got your own currency?&rdquo; The answer was, &ldquo;We allowed the British currency, to circulate.&rdquo; Again the judge said: &ldquo;I did not ask you that.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly.  Let us come to this.  I had a different answer, as President of the Executive Council of this State later, and, as I said in the course of the case, the <Col N="2086" /> first Dáil had altogether in its funds perhaps not as much as the Dublin Corporation had of a revenue for a year.  In the time I was giving evidence in this case the revenue was over £20,000.  You went to America, and damaged as far as you could the status and standing of this because you impugned the person who was then President of the Executive Council and would not accept his statements regarding payments, although at that time steps had been taken here and payments had been made here out of the Dáil Eireann funds.  Denunciation of his political opponents will not absolve him in regard to his action in this whole business from behinning to end.  The Attorney-General has asked if we have any instances of persons objecting.  We did not look of any. I do not want one instance.  I say that the bond of a person in America or elsewhere&mdash;a bond with the undertaking of the people to pay&mdash;should not have beer sold at a discount or for the ten cents the Minister for Defence has mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>The Attorney-General has tried to get a declaration from Deputy Cosgrave here to the effect that there is a parallel between the case of the President of a functioning republic and that of the President of what might be called a republic of the future.  Deputy Cosgrave has shown, from the statement of an American judge, that there never was a republic.</P>

I see that the Attorney-General is agitated, but I do not know whether his agitation is due to enthusiasm or not.  The Attorney-General, on A certain occasion, a good many years ago, put a statement on record to the effect that he never would serve the Irish Free State.  In view of that statement, I wonder, when I look at the Attorney-General, whether his agitation is due to shame or enthusiasm.</P>

      <P>It has gone now, as far as I am concerned.  The Attorney-General has asked for proofs.  The greatest proof of the President's odious conduct is his own action in regard to this Bill.  The Attorney-General must face the test I tried to put and failed to get across to the Minister for Defence.  He either believes these assignments were legally and properly made in a way that would stand investigation by a court or he does not.  If he believes they were made properly and the word &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; would carry with it in any court the interpretation that it was payment to a legally authorised representative of a subscriber, there was no necessity to put a phrase like that in the Bill.  Why was it put in? Because either the Attorney-General <Col N="2088" /> or somebody else whose legal opinion the Government took had advised that those assignments were &ldquo;dickey&rdquo; and could not be stood over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  So you had to cover the assignee?  Is there any test, apart from the law, as to whether these assignments were made by people who knew that the bonds they had were valuable and that they were parting with them for what amounted to nothing?  Is not a very easy test of that, apart from the courts, to try it out on any dozen, to try it out by advertisement in the newspapers, by one single advertisement in one single American newspaper?  Put in an advertisement that, although under that the President is empowered to cash the assignments of these bonds which he got at a particular period, he is prepared to hand back, or, as Deputy Dillon put it, to waive, that assignment in his favour to any person who, seeing that advertisement in one American newspaper, asks for the waiving of the assignment.  Will he do that?  Gracious, will the <i>Irish Press</i> not loosen up on the possibility of having to give away 100 dollars?  Will they not risk that on one advertisement in an American newspaper?  This is not on legal matters, but as to whether the people who gave those bonds away realised what they were doing, and, whether they did or not, whether they rue it now when they find that the bonds have a definite assured value.  Why cannot we get the thing down to some concrete point like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General has talked about the description of the President's activities which I gave.  I think I described them rather mildly.  He did go through America and he created the impression, so far as he could, by a court action that people here were not entitled to pay.  In fact, if I might put it, a great deal more definitely than that, he tried to create the impression that nobody could pay until there was a republic declared in this country, <Col N="2090" /> until there was a republican Government, the inheritor of the Dáil under whose auspices these moneys were borrowed.  That must certainly have caused a great deal of disappointment to very many people in the States, if there were any people looking forward to an early payment.</P>
    <P>That is the first thing he did.  He tried to create the impression that payment was a very long time off.  He then went to those people and made an appeal by a circular.  In that circular, he had two statements, one of which was certainly unauthorised for use and the other repudiated the moment it was found it was being used. They were the only two specific items quoted from this country with regard to what was described as a really national newspaper.  Having created the impression that payment was very far off, he then, as I say, by the use of two statements in an unauthorised way&mdash;and one was definitely against the author's wish&mdash;tried to get up this sentimental idea about a newspaper in the Country.  It is said here that people knew what these bonds were worth.  To anybody who had followed the case&mdash;and mind you, they were a limited number, particularly when one thinks of the class of people who had subscribed in the States&mdash;it was known that there were about 44 cents of every dollar awaiting them.</P>

      <P>That is only to those who followed the case.  How many were those?  Any of the people who were infatuated with the President and who read any part of that case would have turned immediately to what would have turned immediately to what he said and to his cross-examination. What did they find there?  His definite denial that any Government, other than a Republican Government, that is to say, a Government functioning in a republic could pay the money.  That certainly would have weakened their expectation of getting payment soon. Surely the tactics of going around and getting people to assign for the purpose of a newspaper, backed by two statements which had afterwards to be withdrawn, merit any terms I have poured on the President's conduct. <Col N="2091" /> Was that not fooling the people?  If it was not, is the President prepared now to take even the one test of saying to certain folk: &ldquo;Look here, in case I did get any of you folk in a mistaken idea of your rights to subscribe to this newspaper, I will give it back to you.&rdquo; That is the easiest, way to test the whole thing.</P>
      <P>I am not so concerned with what the President did in Amerift.  The curtain will never be lifted on that, but we know enough to make us suspicious that a great deal more did go on than we have heard of. It is with what he did when he came home that, I am more concerned-bringing in the 1933 Act and prohibiting any single person, such as the Attorney-General challenges us to produce, making his appearance when there was some reason for his appearing. The Attorney-General can get quite indignant and say that, two years after the Bill was passed, there has been nobody found to talk about rights.  Why has that happened?</P>
      <P>Because this Dáil has taken away rights which left it open to him to go into court and to claim that there is some substantial reason for his appearing.  You definitely precluded any such person from coming along by saying: &ldquo;It does not matter the President got on your soft side long ago and, without any knowlede of what your rights were, you signed this bond and we are going to cash it in favour of President de Valera in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  That is a discreditable transaction, and my remark about fooling the people in America still holds good, and the best proof is the President himself.</P>

      <i>Land Division in County Dublin.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day I put a question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in relation to land in the bands of the Land Commission for sub-division in County Dublin, the land in course of acquisition and the land contemplated to be acquired.  Many people in County <Col N="2092" /> Dublin inquired from me how they would ascertain what land is available for distribution.  I asked them why they wanted this information and they stated that they wanted land and had written to the Land Commission for particulars of land available for distribution. In reply they received a form which, among other things, required an answer to these questions: Where do you require the land?  On what estate do you require the land?  Give the exact name of the estate and address and reference number, if you know it.  How is any working man or smallholder in County Dublin or in any other county to get that information if he does not get it from the Land Commission?  They failed to get it from the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I took up the matter on their behalf about three weeks ago and wrote to the Land Commission for the particulars I have asked for in this question. I have not got even an acknowledgment of my letter since.  Then I put down this question: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will give the names and locations of estates in County Dublin (a) acquired by the Land Commission, (b) in course of acquisition, and (c) the acquisition of which is contemplated for sub-division among uneconomic holders and landless men.&rdquo; The reply to that question was both stupid and evasive, but the evasion in it would not fool anybody The Parliamentary Secretary has been three or four years in the Land Commission. I spent nine years there in a capacity in which I had to work and got very little pay.  The Parliamentary Secretary occupies a position in which there is very little work and plenty of pay, and the people of the country who are paying him are entitled to get information which they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his answer to my question the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;The statistical returns of the Land Commission show that, under the Land Acts, 1923-33, in County Dublin, to date, (a) 39 estates, comprising a total area of 7,664 acres, have been acquired by the Land Commission for division.&rdquo; I did not ask that question at all. I asked how much land they had acquired and had in hands for sub-division, and he did not answer that <Col N="2093" /> question. rlicn the tnswer went oil (b) 30 estates, comprising 5,265 acres, are in definite course of acquisition (that is to say, they have reached the stage of gazetting or the making of an offer for purchase).  (c) 69 estates, comprising 11,768 acres, have been inspected, or referred for inspection, as to suitability and price, but have not yet reached a further stage.&rdquo;  That is 138 estates in all, and about 25,000 acres.  Here is the Parliamentary Secretary's final comment: &ldquo;It is not the practice of the Land Commission to supply information as to the names and location of estates dealt with or in process of acquisition.  Apart from other objections, the resulting diversion of the Land Commission staff from the much more urgent work of land division is not desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary gave that answer to an American backwoodsman, even he would not be satisfied. What has the giving of this information to do with the work of sub-division? Who will give this information? A clerk, perhaps earning £2 per week.  Is that man a material cog in the wheel of acquiring land for sub-division? What is the delay in land division?  Inspectors, objections, hearings, price, arbitration, proving of title. How in the, name of honesty and decency would the giving of this information by the clerk delay the work of land division?  I will guarantee that, if I am given access to the books&mdash;and I know more about them than the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I will get that information in half an hour.  It is pure dishonesty to give an answer like that.</P>
    <P>How is it that certain people in County Dublin, as well as in other counties, can get this information? They have it in all the Fianna Fáil clubs.  Is this a national Government or a political Government?  Are the fag-ends of estates to be given to Fianna Fáil organisers and propagandists in County Dublin and elsewhere, to be hawked about and sold at a profit of a couple of hundred pounds?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of that?  Does he know what I am hinting at?  If he wants more information I will give it to him.  Here are 138 estates or farms to be taken over.  All that is needed to be written in is the <Col N="2094" /> name of the townland.  The registers are available in the Land Commission. The Parliamentary Secretary knows or should know that there are head or chief inspectors in the Land Commission who are over so many sub-inspectors or surveyors, a certain number being alloted to each county.  Then there are clerks corresponding to the outdoor staff dealing with these matters in the office.  All that is necessary is to refer this to the inspector dealing with the County Dublin who would give the information to the clerk and the information would be ready in half an hour.  There would be no diversion of staff from the work of the Land Commission.  We can cut out that as so much eyewash.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that a person who is entitled by precedent and by all the rules of the game to a piece of land, when land is being divided will get a form to fill up and will be asked: &ldquo;Where do you want land?&rdquo; He does not know what land is available, and when he asks the Land Commission to tell him where available land can be located, they will not reply to his letter.  I was asked as a public representative to write to the Land Commission and I did so, but they did not answer my letters.</P>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary here to-day, the man who has in the neighbourhood of 21,000 a year from this State, and he said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he would not answer me.  He gives figures that have no relevancy to the matter.  Is the policy of the Government to be boiled down to this, that people in this county and other counties, who feel they are entitled to parcels of land, are to be given no assistance in getting extra land?  What are they told to do?  They are told to fill the prescribed form and answer the query: &ldquo;Where do you want the land?&rdquo; They do not know What land the, Land Commission has, the Land Commission will not tell them, and they have no direct means of finding out.  Are they to be allowed to say: &ldquo;We will have Pat Murphy's land close to where we live?&rdquo; Will a dozen more around Pit Murpby's holding send in similar requisitions and, if sufficient of those are sent in, will that <Col N="2095" /> be considered good enough by the Land Commission to make the case that there is congestion, that there is a demand for land and they must take Pat Murphy's land at any price they like, and, if Pat Murphy dares to stand up in defence of his home and his land he is going to be boycotted, and the Government by this machinery will intimidate Pat Murphy into giving his land at any price?  On the other hand, are we going to have he Land Commission as the people's servant instead of the people's tyrant?  It is a public Department, paid for good work, I hope, paid to give information to the public, and yet, it refuses to give that information.  I think that I would be destroying the case trying to labour it too much.  The facts are these, that there are hundreds of people in County Dublin and I presume in other counties who feel they can work land and who want, to get parcels of land if there is any available.  They are not out to confiscate the land of others.  If the Land Commission has land available, those people want a fair chance; they do not want to follow as slaves the tail-ends of the runners and camp followers of the Fianna Fáil clubs in County Dublin or any other county. They want to get what is their right, and they are prepared, to apply for that and take the chance of a fair square deal in getting a parcel of that land.  They are denied information by the Fianna Fáil Government as to what land the Government has acquired or is about to acquire, to be paid for with public money.  The Land Commission will not tell those people where the land is.  They will not give those people a fair chance of applying for that land.</P>
    <P>I presume the first the public will know about land being acquired will be when they learn that the camp followers of the Fianna Fáil organisation in County Dublin and other counties are being given holdings.  I will not comment on some of those people beyond saying that they have not been a shining success in working land or doing any labour.  I have a fair idea of how the information is spread through those clubs.  Certain <Col N="2096" /> people will be told &ldquo;Apply for Iand that is acquired in certain places, and you will get it.&rdquo; It is just like case of a, leading light of Fianna Fáil who bought a farm from the Land Commission about a month ago for a couple of hundred pounds and who, I am reliably informed, has now sold it for £400.  Is the Land Commission going to be used to provide land for land jobbers and hawkers instead of for land workers?  I leave the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us how the land worker is going to get a fair deal in County Dublin and I presume the same applies to other counties</P>

      <P>The last statement made by Deputy Belton is possibly the most truthful part of his whole speech.  He says that the same thing applies to other counties as applies to County Dublin. In County Dublin, the Land Commission are dealing with no fewer than 138 estates.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Belton.  The Land Commission are dealing with 138 estates in County Dublin.  Dublin is only one of 26 counties, and Deputy Belton, strange though it may appear, is but one of 153 Deputies in the House, each and every one of whom is entitled to the same facilities as are being given to Deputy Belton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent any Deputy putting down a question asking for long tabular statements such as are required by Deputy Belton.  Does the Deputy seriously suggest that we should divert the Land Commission staff from the very important and onerous work which they have in hand, and set then to prepare statistics to suit Deputy Belton, or any other Deputy <Col N="2097" /> for that matter?  The purpose of the Land Commission is to acquire and divide land, and the inspectors and general staff are being hard driven at present to see that the maximum output which it is possible to give will be reached by the Land Commission this year.  Judging by the results of the past yell, I think that even Deputy Belton cannot deny that there has been a big advance made in the division of land as compared with that obtained in the past.</P>
      <P>If we are to give this information to one Deputy, we cannot deny it to every other Deputy.  Deputy Belton seems to overlook the fact that in order to obtain this information it would be necessary to recall a great number of files from inspectors scattered in over the country, thus holding up the division of lands in other places and that is a condition of affairs which no responsible Minister would be prepared to stand over.</P>

      <P>This is not a new departure.  One would imagine from all the wild allegations of Deputy Belton which I do not propose to reply to and which I win treat with the contempt that they deserve, that this was quite a new departure, and that this information was circulated by the Land Commission in the past.  I do not think that that was the case.  On Thursday, 4th December, 1930, a question was put down by Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla Phóil, addressed to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, who was asked &ldquo;whether he will give (1) the names of the estates in the County of Galway that have been vested by the Land Commission in the tenants since 1923; (2) the names of estates in process of being acquired, and (3) those at present in course of distribution; also, whether be will give the acreage in each case.&rdquo;  The reply was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceedings in the Land Commission in respect of tenanted and untenanted lands in the County Galway are of very large dimensions, and the collection of detailed particulars <Col N="2098" /> of every estate in the count, dealt with during the last seven years would be a lengthy operation, requiring much labour and research on the part of the Land Commission staff, who would have to be withdrawn from their normal duties in order to compile such a list as the Deputy asks for.  I fail to see any useful purpose to be served thereby, and I cannot accede to the Deputy's request. The statistics of the activities of the Land Commission in each county are given in their annual report, but if the Deputy requires any total figures for County Galway during a particular period I would ask him to be good enough to put down a question stating the precise statistics he desires, under what Land Acts, whether tenanted or untenanted land, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy put down his question to-day, and I gave him the total area with which the Land Commission were dealing, although in his statement to-night be denies that he was given that information.  My reply was segregated under three different headings, (a), (b) and (c), which dealt with a total of 138 estates and approximately 25,000 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am not going to give it, for the reasons I have already stated.  If we were to do that, and give similar information to every other Deputy, the entire Land Commission staff would have to be withdrawn from their other duties and utilised for this purpose.  I do not propose to deal with the Deputy's allegations about information bein given to Fianna Fáil clubs.  That is untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely untrue.  There is no information being given to any Fianna Fáil clubs, or no information being denied to Deputy Belton that would not be denied to any other Deputy.  The Land Comminssion cannot possibly give all the detailed information which a Deputy may require, and, even if they were to give it, it would be undesirable from. <Col N="2099" /> another point of view.  Supposing for a moment that we were to give Deputy Belton or any other Deputy a list of estates and their location in any particular county, you would immediately have agitation around the district where this land was about to be divided; everybody would be clamouring for division of the land.  Some of those estates have undergone only a preliminary inspection.  Some of them may never be acquired.  You would be creating false hopes amongst the landless men and the congests in the area. For that reason alone it would be most undesirable to give this information. If there were no other reason to justify the Land Commission in refusing to give all the details asked for by Deputy Belton, I think that alone should suffice.</P>

How is the ordinary agricultural labourer or uneconomic holder to know where the Land Commission have land for sub-division?  I should like tn ask the Parliamentary Secretary that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I win reply.  Any ordniary Jabourer or any smallhonder in any county knows very well every large estate at least within ten miles of him.  In the normal course, of events he cannot expect to get accommodated on land any further away.  The Land Commission, as a general matter of policy, distribute the land amongst the people withn, a two, miles radius of an estate.  Every smallholder and labourer within two miles of any particular estate, especially if it is a large estate, knows very well when the Land Commission inspector comes on the land.  They have ways and means of making their applications, either direct to the inspector or otherwise.  In the country districts, I need not tell Deputy Belton or anybody else, this news spreads like wildfire.  Once an inspector goes on an estate everybody within miles becomes aware of the fact, and every person who thinks he is entitled to land can make his application. Each of those applications will be considered on its merits and on its merits alone.</P>
