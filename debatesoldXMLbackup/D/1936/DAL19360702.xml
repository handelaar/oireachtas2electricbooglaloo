      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that the British Government is setting about the formulation of a new food policy in connection with the development of its defence programme, and if our representatives are keeping in touch with the British Government on this important matter of food supplies, and if he will take the opportunity thus afforded, of not only ending the present economic war, but of securing a permanent advantageous position in the British market for the agricultural products of this country.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the British Government have recently set up a committee to examine the question of food supply in an emergency.  It is, of course, not possible to foretell what the findings of that committee will be, or what policy will ultimately be formulated thereon, but in any event the Government of Saorstát Eireann will continue to use every opportunity of improving the position of Saorstát Eireann agricultural products in the British market. The Government keeps in touch with the British Government on this as on all matters affecting our trade interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that motion, Sir.  The provision generally made for a supplementary agricultural grant now is a substantial reduction on the amount of supplementary agricultural grant that was available for relief of rates on agricultural land, say, three years ago.  In the meantime, the farmers find themselves in the position, at the end of each of the last two financial years, that between the arrears in rates, amounting to £1,000,000, and the arrears in payment of land annuities, amounting to, say, £1,250,000, that they are faced with, apparently, a stabilised debt for the end of the financial year of £2,250,000, representing payments that they are unable to meet inside the proper year. <Col N="844" /> I do not know if the Minister has given any consideration to the position which that discloses, and whether he contemplates during the year increasing the amount of money that would be available for the relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not contemplate that there will be any increase in the amount of relief given on the question of rates on agricultural land during the current financial year.  Undoubtedly, there are arrears &mdash;not as great as Deputy Mulcahy suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but still there are arrears of rates due in different parts of the country and also arrears of annuities due.  I submit, however, that the agricultural community is this year in a much better position financially than they were last year or the year before, and that there has been a not inconsiderable increase in the prices of certain agricultural products.  I think the prospects for this financial year are good, and that the arrears that were shown on the 31st March, that have now been considerably reduced, will not be anything like as great as they are this year when the end of the financial year comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests that the figures are not as great, and I admit that, as far as rates themselves are concerned, the amount of arrears of rates at the 31st March, 1936, was slightly less than £1,000,000, but when the arrears of land annuities and rates are taken together, the 31st March, 1936, disclosed that in the gross total there was an increase of more than £100,000 of arrears.  Now, I should like to feel that the Minister was correct in thinking that the farmers' condition was such that the arrears would be reduced by the 31st March next year.  Personally, however, I do not see anything in the situation that indicates that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Money Resolution, Sir.  The Money Resolution in connection with this Bill is designed to render more effective the remedies at the disposal of the Minister for Agriculture for implementing the maize meal mixture scheme and the compulsory use of home-grown wheat in flour sold in Saorstát Eireann.  On the Second Stage of this Bill I referred at some length to the maize meal mixture scheme, and, I think, made an unanswerable case for the winding up of that scheme as a thoroughly unsound experiment that has conferred benefits upon nobody and that has increased the burden on the producers of pigs, live stock, and live-stock products, by 3/- per cwt. on the costs of their feeding stuffs.  I reminded the House that, if a contention be made that benefits have been conferred by this legislation on the producers of cereals&mdash;a contention which I categorically deny&mdash;those who make it must go on to admit that the benefit accrues mainly to those farmers living in Leix-Offaly, North Tipperary, Kilkenny and Kildare, while the burden rests on the shoulders of those farmers who produce pigs and who, according to the report of the Pig Tribunal, live almost exclusively in West Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, North-East Donegal, North Longford, Cavan and North Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That list of areas corresponds exactly with the list of areas described by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance as the list of areas in which unemployment, poverty, and low standard of living are most prevalent in this country.  I say that it is a rank injustice to finance any relief which <Col N="846" /> may be extended to farmers living in Leix-Offaly, Kildare, North Tipperary, and the more comfortable parts of the country, out of the pockets of the uneconomic holders in the west and north-west of the country.  If we want to subsidise the production of cereal crops in Kilkenny, Leix-Offaly, North Tipperary, and such parts of the country, then let it be done out of the Exchequer and let the whole community bear its fair share of the burden.  You have no right, however, to lay the whole burden on the shoulders of the small farmers who are finding it hardest to live in the existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not want to trespass unduly on the patience of the House, but it would be possible to expatiate at greater length on the peculiar hardships that will fall on the small farmer who is a producer of live stock, not the fattener&mdash;not the person who buys live stock at a low price, and having fed it, sells it at a high price&mdash;but the man who is the primary producer of agricultural produce, on whom ultimately the whole burden of the destruction of the agricultural industry falls.  It is that class are asked to bear the burden of this maize meal mixture scheme, and I say it is an unjust burden, a burden that is being borne with no good purpose, because no one derives any benefit, good, bad or indifferent, from it.  This financial motion is also directed to promote the compulsory use of Irish-grown wheat in flour mills in this country.  I entirely agree with the Government, in so far as they take the view that the milling industry should be protected from absorption by any extra Saorstát combine. I think that could be effected much more efficiently by another machine than that at present employed for the purpose.  I would be prepared to notify anyone, whether from outside the Saorstát or inside the Saorstát, that if he attempted by trade operation of any kind to monopolise the entire milling industry, the Government would step in and take over the milling industry altogether as a Government concern.  I think that would be a very deplorable development, that would react most unfavourably <Col N="847" /> on the community as a whole, but if I had to choose between a monopoly of the flour-milling industry by an individual capitalist and monopoly by the State for the community, then I would choose the lesser of two great evils, and that is monopoly of the milling industry by the community.  But I am satisfied that if potential monopolists were given notice, that any attempt to monopolise the milling industry by any individual would be met by the State with resolute and, if necessary, punitive measures, any danger of such would disappear, and we would not be confronted with the danger of a monopoly arising either from a national of this State or someone coming from outside.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture this question, and it is one to which I have never succeeded in getting an answer from any member of the Fianna Fáil organisation, from the Minister down to the secretary of a cumann in the country.  It is a question that we need not lose our tempers about.  It is purely an economic question, a theoretical question, which ought to be the subject of illuminating argument between us.  What sound reason can there be for burdening the community with added expense in order to induce farmers to grow wheat? What advantage does the community get from growing wheat in Ireland? I can quite understand the individual farmer, who likes to have a bit of his own wheat ground into wholemeal flour for his own family, growing wheat.  Any farmer who does that, does a wise thing.  The more wheat that is grown on the individual farm for consumption in the household or on the farm, the better it is for everyone, because there are no transport costs.  That is a raw material to manufacture, a process which the farmer carries to completion on his own land. If an individual farmer wants to sow a bit of wheat, and wants to have it ground into wholemeal flour and have it eaten in the household, I think all Parties will take the view that that is a harmless form of agriculture. When we come to the State intervening to induce farmers to grow wheat which is sold and milled into flour, I <Col N="848" /> want to ask Deputies what is the point of it?  Why do you want to do it? I remember warning the House many times and often that we are actually paying more for worse wheat when we buy Irish wheat than we would be paying if we bought Canadian wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture sternly rebuked me for that allegation, but I challenge the Minister to deny if he can that at this present moment no miller in this country is putting a grain of Irish wheat into bakers' flour.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, bakers' flour was made of Manitoba wheat, with a little Saskatchewan, and I believe in some lower grades of bakers' flour, there was a very small percentage, five to ten per cent., of Danubian wheat.  My information to-day is that for a certain time the place of that Danubian wheat was taken by Irish wheat, but that now in bakers flour there is no Irish wheat being used at all.  It is all Manitoban or Canadian wheat of one grade or another, and the entire production of Irish wheat is being used in shop flour.  I ask Deputies to bear that in mind, and to realise that we are paying 11/- a sack more for bakers' flour than if we bought it in Liverpool.  I do not want to buy it in Liverpool, but I want Deputies to understand what is happening. Millers in Ireland are using exactly the same wheat that millers in Liverpool are using, but the Irish people are paying Irish millers 11/- a sack more for flour than they would have to pay for it in Liverpool.  That 11/- a sack means 1½d. on the quartern loaf for people who eat bread.  How on earth can Deputies go on believing that a scheme of that character has any merit, unless they are prepared to say that the growing of wheat on Irish land has some extraordinary merit from the community point of view?  I cannot see that it has any merit.  The only argument I ever heard for subsidising the growing of wheat in any country in the world was that, in time of war, a country was independent of external sources of supply of flour and bread.  There may be rumours of war in Europe, but there were no rumours of war last year or the year before.  What <Col N="849" /> then is the point of growing wheat when we are not on the verge of war? Are we forever to insure ourselves at the expense of £1,500,000 per annum against being caught in the toils of war or against having a crop of wheat in the land?  If that is not the reason why we are to grow wheat, will some one tell me what is the object of growing wheat in this country?</P>
    <P>No rational man will contend that the quality of wheat here is equal to the quality of wheat we could buy in Canada.  That is no reflection on the community.  It is a reflection of the dispensation of God, Who provided that the climate and the season that obtains in Canada would suit the cultivation of wheat, while the climate and the season in this country suits green crops and live stock.  It happens that, in Canada and in parts of the United States of America, they can grow peculiarly fine qualities of wheat sufficient to supply the requirements of a greater part of the world.  These countries cannot produce horses of the same quality as we produce.  Can absurdity be carried to greater lengths than to suggest that Canada would refuse to buy Irish horses, which are unanimously the best horses in the world, and that we should refuse to buy Canadian wheat?  We want good wheat; they want good horses, and we are both sitting at our respective sides of the fence, the Canadian saying: &ldquo;Although we have wheat to sell and although you have horses to sell, we will not take your horses and you will not take your wheat.  Therefore, you may cut your horses' throats and we may burn our wheat, you can go on eating bad wheat and we will go on driving bad horses.&rdquo;  That seems to me to carry economic insanity to its wildest extreme.  I appeal to the Deputies on the opposite side to examine this question calmly and detachedly, if such an examination be possible, and to see if we can arrive at some kind of rational agreement in regard to it because, if we do, we can save the State an immense burden and we can use the money, that we would have if we were not squandering it on this wheat scheme, for a variety of other most necessary purposes which, I believe, <Col N="850" /> command the sympathy of the Government just as earnestly as they command ours.  I invite the Minister for Agriculture to set before the House again why he believes in this doctrine of increased cultivation of wheat, and to state if he cannot see that there is some force in the argument I submit, that the benefits conferred on the community by the scheme are very small and that the alternative of allowing wheat to become an ordinary commodity of sale and exchange in our foreign trade, with resultant savings to the community purse, would enable us to do for the country things that we cannot do to-day.  I would ask him to consider whether the arguments I put forward do not outweigh any considerations that he may have in mind in sponsoring this increased wheat cultivation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, first of all, attacked the admixture scheme.  He cannot understand why Irish farmers who feed pigs should dream of buying from other Irish farmers oats or barley to feed their pigs.  He thinks that it should not be done.  Deputy Dillon considers, perhaps, that Irish pig feeders should pay £1,500,000 each year for Indian corn to foreigners instead of purchasing the 300,000 tons of Irish barley and oats that went into the admixture scheme last year.  Deputy Dillon, of course, does not want that. Deputy Dillon does not want the poor, ruined farmer&mdash;about whom he shed so many crocodile tears last year, the previous year, and the year before that, the ruined farmer who had no market &mdash;to have a market for 300,000 tons of grain.  What is the position?  On a few occasions in regard to this subject I quoted an instance here in this House to show how the scheme was working out and how these poor pig-feeders for whom Deputy Dillon has all the sympathy, are making money.  When these poor pig-feeders adopted Deputy Dillon's advice and went across the water to fatten pigs on the Indian meal imported free there, after conducting that experiment for six or 12 months, they came back again to Glanmire to fatten pigs on the 50 per cent. admixture. <Col N="851" /> That is a definite instance I gave here repeatedly.  I do not like repeating it too often, but evidently it has not yet sunk into Deputy Dillon's head.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon attacks the wheat scheme and asks &ldquo;why should we grow wheat; why should any body of Irish farmers get £2,000,000 a year from wheat?  It is a terrible thing.&rdquo;  That reminded me of Deputy Mulcahy's proposal that they should send their milk to the creamery at 1½d. per gallon. That is the kind of agricultural policy we get from the people over there. Deputy Dillon asks why the Irish farmers should grow wheat.  In the first place we are saving roughly £2,000,000 a year that we would be paying to foreigners for wheat if it were not grown here.  Secondly, we are giving that £2,000,000 to the Irish farmer. We are giving him a guaranteed market for his product, so that he knows on the day that he sows it, what he is going to be paid for it.</P>

      <P>When he is going to war again, he is going to give Deputy Dillon 12 months' notice that he intends to go to war, so that he can plough up his fields and sow wheat.  Deputy Dillon is going to get 12 months' notice.  I do not know where are the powers who are going to give him that notice that war is coming.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon ate any of the war flour sold in this country in 1917 and 1918.  I am sure he had a couple of bags of decent flour stored up for that particular occasion.  If he had eaten that war flour, he would have less noise about the bad quality of the Irish wheat.  I saw a lot of people like him who were complaining of the bad quality of Irish wheat, and who used to come round to my place at night to get a couple of bags of it to be crushed into flour in 1918, rather than eat the material that was handed over by John Bull at that time for their consumption.  These are the stock arguments of Deputy Dillon on all occasions.  It is in keeping with his particular policy and with that of his colleagues.  They do not want the farmers to have a market for anything. They want to ensure that the farmers are to sell their milk at 2d. per gallon. Deputy Bennett knows that.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Mulcahy tried to drag Deputy Bennett into the Lobby to vote for such a policy, and when the Deputy refused to do so.  Deputy Dillon wants that people in Tipperary represented by Deputy Curran shall have no market for their 300,000 tons of grain.  He wants all that thrown on the market with no demand for it.  The next thing he wants is that the farmers growing wheat in my constituency, in Deputy Curran's constituency, and in constituencies in Leix and Offaly, shall not have a market for their produce. Nothing grown in this country is good enough for Deputy Dillon's appetite. His pigs will die if they are fed on Irish oats or barley, and he will himself get sick if fed on the produce of Irish wheat.  That is one of Deputy Dillon's great fears.  It is a bad form of disease, but I am afraid, in a few years more, Deputy Dillon will not be able to get any foreign wheat.  He will then have to follow some of his friends who went across the water.  All this only shows the kind of ridiculous statements we get when any cereal Bill is brought in.</P>
      <P>There is just one thing that I want to warn the Minister about and that is price.  The Minister should see that a proper price is fixed, an economic price and a price that will give a profit to the farmers.  These are the men whose interest is worth watching. I wish to point out, from my own knowledge, that as far as pig breeding is concerned, those engaged in it are making money and not losing money as has been contended by Deputies opposite.  These men are making money out of this scheme which Deputy Dillon condemns.  I have given instances of large pig breeders who are definitely opposed to me politically, and I have given their statements quoted in the public Press.  These statements bear out my contention that the pig feeder is making money and fairly big money out of this scheme.  So far as wheat is concerned Deputy Dillon will not be able to stop it.  He and his colleagues on the benches opposite will not prevent Irish farmers growing wheat so long as they get an economic price for it.</P>

      <P>A Chara,&mdash;At a meeting representative of all Parties&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash;held in Ballingeary on Sunday, the 15th instant, a copy of the following resolution, passed unanimously, was ordered to be forwarded to the <i>Irish Press,</i> the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> the <i>Southern Star,</i> and to all T.D.s concerned, and their kind co-operation solicited:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;That we, the people of Ballingeary and district, request that, owing to the enhanced cost and inferior quality of the meal admixture, the Government discontinue the meal admixture scheme as applicable to this district and substitute one placing at our disposal qualities of pure maize meal of proved value and at a reasonable cost.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>You are kindly requested to use your utmost efforts to this end as I feel you recognise the urgency of the request.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not that an answer to Deputy Corry?  Will Deputy Corkery or Deputy Moylan contradict the statement in that letter.  I have been an advocate of the principle mentioned in this resolution since the Minister introduced his mixture policy.  Before the Minister ever came into office I protested against it, when it was brought <Col N="855" /> before our Party, and as long as I am a representative of the people I will continue to protest against it.  I believe, as I said in the last fortnight, that it is a crime to inflict such hardships upon the poor people living in the wildest parts of this country. Deputy Flinn must have been interesting himself in relief schemes in the area and must be aware that people have been driven into the position in which they are as a result of the policy of the Government which has put 3/- a cwt. or 7/6 a sack more upon them, in the cost of this mixture than they would have to pay for pure Indian meal.

Why is that?  Because he destroyed the market that people had for their grain, which they were able to feed to pigs and cattle and dispose of in that way.  Deputy Corry talks about pig-feeders making money. I would like to meet the pig-feeder who is making money to-day.  They must have been millionaires in the past if they are able to make money to-day.</P>

Deputy Dillon pointed out <Col N="856" /> that we are paying 11/- a sack more for our flour than they are paying in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which means a burden upon the people of this country of £1,650,000, but Deputy Corry says that we are keeping £2,000,000.  In order to do so apparently we are paying this huge tax.  There is one consolation in all this, and that is that the Government have not been able to bluff the people of Dublin with their free beef and free milk; and when the people of the country get an opportunity they will very soon put the Party opposite where they ought to be.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry probably looks upon himself as a great expert on agricultural matters.  He was kind enough to refer to the county represented by Deputy Curran, Deputy Séamus Bourke and myself.  He said he was concerned regarding the disposal of the 300,000 barrels of grain from that county.  Deputy O'Leary answered him fairly effectively.  May I remind Deputy Corry that, before Fianna Fáil came into power, we were able to dispose of all the grain we grew.  Before Fianna Fáil came into power, the farmers of Tipperary had not to dispose of their white oats at 8d. per stone.  Let the Deputy remember that, notwithstanding the absence of an admixture policy in 1930 and 1931, the farmers of Tipperary, Cork and Wexford were getting as good prices for their barley as they got last year.  The Deputy suggests that we want to deprive the farmers of the only market they have got.  Who is responsible for its being the only market they have got?  The Deputy and his colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is concerned about the 300,000 barrels of grain.  Would the Deputy concern himself with the live stock.  He tells us that pig feeders are making money <Col N="857" /> while using this admixture.  I doubt that they are, but let us assume that they are.  May I suggest to the Deputy that, if they could buy feeding-stuffs at 3/- per cwt. cheaper than they are getting them at present, they would make a lot more money?  Deputy Corry talks about the wages paid, about the £2,000,000, and about the market. What he says, in effect, is that farmers like him whose lands are suited to the growing of wheat and beet are able to pay wages because they are paid doles by the State.  Wheat can be grown only in certain counties, and only in certain parts of these counties.  It can be grown by only a small number of farmers, having regard to the total number.  Yet, the whole of the community is to be taxed to the extent of 8d. per stone on their flour, so that Deputy Corry may level up for the loss on live stock brought about by the activities of himself and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Even those in receipt of outdoor relief and those obliged to apply for unemployment assistance have to contribute that sum of 8d. per stone to Deputy Corry so that he can come in here and boast that he is making money out of the growing of wheat.  I should like the Deputy to address himself to that aspect of the question.  If he does, he will probably find that his position is not quite so strong as he thought it was.  I advised the Deputy last year to keep away from the grain problem.  It is a rather touchy problem at present.  The Minister would, I am sure, tell the Deputy in confidence of some of the difficulties which are confronting him in connection with grain which he is notable to dispose of, notwithstanding the 50 per cent.  I want to emphasise, for the Deputy's benefit, that before ever Fianna Fáil came into power or the admixture scheme was thought of, all the grain grown in Tipperary was disposed of at at least as good a price as, if not a better price than we got last year under the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry let drop a remark which I should like to elaborate.  He said he hoped the Minister, when fixing the price of grain, would fix a decent price.  Let us <Col N="858" /> analyse that.  To whom are you going to sell this grain and at what price? You are going to sell it to the farmers of West Cork, Kerry and other parts of the country.  So far as the admixture is concerned, I think the question is one of price.  The admixture is only a raw material and the price of a raw material should depend, to a great extent, on the price of the finished article.  I notice that Deputy Corry is leaving.  I would ask him not to go just yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of maize to-day is £4 10/- per ton.  I am paying for Dr. Ryan's admixture £7 18/- per ton.  That is what I grumble at.  I do not complain of the quality of the article.  I have no fault to find with it.  I do not want to disparage the cereal admixture.  The admixture is all right; it is the price which gives rise to question.  I grow oats and I grow some barley and I shall be compelled to buy the admixture from somebody else.  What am I to do with my own grain?  If pig production and bacon production are so profitable, why do not barley and other grain growers go into that line and produce the finished article?  You are asking the farmers in the poorer parts of the country to buy the admixture.  I do not know what price the Minister intends to fix, but I have quoted the price of ordinary maize and, the price I have to pay for the admixture.  I say that £8 per ton is a big price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why there is any problem to solve in connection with grain growing is because the farmers are not using the admixture to the same extent as feeding-stuffs were used, owing to its price.  I heard the Vice-President say to-day that times were getting good.  I was tempted to ask him &ldquo;why?&rdquo; Because cattle prices have improved.  We know very well that good, forward yearlings are making a good price.  That was because they were scarce, as they were not fed in the same numbers as in previous years, because this admixture was too dear.  We ought to realise that the farmer, like anybody else, has to get <Col N="859" /> the cost of production.  What he can pay must depend on the price of the finished article, whether it is beef, bacon, eggs or poultry.  Owing to the action of the Government in connection with the dispute with Great Britain, farmers are not even yet getting economic prices for some of their products, particularly live stock.  I put this point to the Minister as to the relative prices of maize and the admixture. I do not want to dwell at any length on it, but, if the Minister intends to fix a price, due regard should be had to the price of the finished article.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal can be said for and against this admixture scheme.  Those living in the grain-growing counties argue in favour of the admixture, while those who do not live in grain-growing counties are very much opposed to it.  Before any legislation was passed here in connection with this admixture, a good deal of that admixture work was done in the grain-growing counties.  The sort of barley and the sort of oats that were mixed for feeding with maize meal at that particular time were barley and oats of a certain quality.  That was used as a mixture with the pure maize meal, and it was used with great success. I know that it turned out the finished article in a shorter time, and it was done with more success than if the animal were fed with maize meal, and on the other hand, if the quality of the food-stuffs fed to the pig was somewhat better, the quality of the finished pig was also somewhat better. As Deputy Curran stated, the worst feature of the admixture is this: that under present conditions the mixing of the barley or oats with the maize meal means an additional price for the admixture, and one wonders where is the profit to come from with regard to any particular animal that is fed.  If there is any hope of making a profit, that hope can only be realised by the farmer being able to get food-stuffs that will give him or the feeder a fair return for the money invested and for his time.  I think a 50 per cent. admixture of barley or oats is too much.  It is <Col N="860" /> much too high.  In my opinion, a mixture of 25 per cent. is sufficient to give the results that are necessary to produce the right quality of bacon, and to make a food mixture that will fatten the animal in the shortest possible period.</P>
      <P>The securing of an outlet or a market for the surplus corn the farmer has is all right so far as the admixture is concerned; but when one comes back and considers the whole agricultural policy of the Government one is forced to realise that the number of calves slaughtered in the last three years must and will have a very prejudicial effect in the way of supplying a market for the farmers' surplus corn. When one considers the amount of food that would have been consumed by these slaughtered calves if they had been brought to maturity one can see at once that this slaughter of calves puts a very big hole in that market. That is a very big factor in the problem of dealing with the amount of surplus corn that the farmer is produing and in the finding of a market for that corn.  I should imagine that we are short in the last two or three years of over 500,000 cattle owing to the slaughter of young calves.  That slaughter must result in leaving a certain proportion of corn unsold.  In speaking here some time ago, I told the Minister that I thought his policy was wrong from the very beginning. That policy is nothing less than interfering with and mixing up the business of these people.  The fact is that the farmers of this country if left to themselves grow what they consider best for themselves and for the country and they know their requirements better than does the Minister for Agriculture, no matter who he may be.  A farmer will do better by managing his farm in his own way and using his own methods than he will by being dictated to by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this admixture, I have no hesitation in saying that 50 per cent. is too high.  Then, too, the cost of the food mixture supplied to the farmer is too high.  If we could buy this food-stuff at a more reasonable price it would leave some profit, and <Col N="861" /> we would have an opportunity of producing a decent class of finished article and get better results all round. As to the subsidy on wheat, a good deal can be said for that.  I know that the growing of wheat at a lesser price than 22/- or 23/- a barrel at the moment would be impossible; but to force farmers to grow more wheat and to give them a subsidy for growing it is not a good policy, for this reason that every farmer in the country is limited in the amount of land on which he can grow corn with success and at the same time keep his farm in good heart.  If the farmers were allowed to carry on their business in their own way there would be little or no surplus corn in the market.  As I have already said we are now facing the fact that there are 500,000 less cattle in the country, and this will influence considerably the market for the surplus of corn the farmer has.  I do not know in what way the Minister can deal with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to question the figures given by Deputy Dillon. The Deputy has stated that the admixture scheme has resulted in increasing the price by 3/- per cwt.  I doubt that very much.  We have gone into the question and examined it in our county. The millers operating in Tralee are experts in their own business.  They understand all about this question and they tell us that the total increase in the price per ton is 15/6.  That 15/6 is made up of tariffs, handling, sacking, commission, etc.  I, therefore, submit that Deputy Dillon's statement that the cost is as high as 3/- per cwt. is entirely wrong.  Then Deputy Curran points out that maize meal costs £4 per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned this because in our County of Kerry at that period there was a meal ring in existence and, in our efforts to right the position, we took steps to obtain these prices.  I would like Deputies to offer a fair criticism of this measure. In order to show how difficult the position is, I want to point out that even in Kerry one finds that the northern portion of the county is a grain-growing district, while the south and west parts of the county are quite the opposite.  In other words, the people in the poorer districts there are subsidising the people in other parts of the county in this matter of the admixture scheme.  How can you come down to have a perfect system for the whole country?  The people realise that, and they realise that the Minister under these circumstances is doing everything possible to have a fair and just system for all concerned.  I should like, if possible, to see special conditions for congested districts where people are going in very much for pig raising and, therefore, have to buy large quantities of meal.  The millers supply this commodity and they can only acquire one-twelfth of their requirements in the county; they have to import the remainder from Kilkenny, Carlow and other counties, and through the extra cost entailed in freightage, etc., they have to charge an extra 15/6.</P>

      <P>The scheme as it exists for the whole country is the best possible scheme that could be inaugurated, because, as was pointed out by Deputy Corry, you are excluding the purchase of foreign maize; you are developing your own internal agricultural system, and encouraging the farmer to produce oats and barley, etc., at a guaranteed price.  I am only just making the suggestion to the Minister with a view to drawing his attention to this point.  The millers in Tralee state that if they were allowed to have one-fourth of the quota allowed to Messrs.  Rank, they in turn would establish flour-milling in Kerry, and thus have less overhead charges and be able to reduce the cost of the meal under this system to the small farmers in the other districts.  That may be well worth consideration, and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They go on to say that under the present system they find it difficult to compete against other concerns.  They point out that Messrs. Williams of Mallow are competing against the people in Kerry, and they allege that Messrs. Williams are not paying the trade union rate, and that if the system was examined, and the Conditions of Employment Act made operative throughout the different counties, so that all milling concerns would pay approximately the same rate, the price could be reduced by the millers to the consumers and to the people I have referred to.  Now that the Minister will have power to purchase grain, an arrangement might be come to by which the Tralee millers would get supplies at special rates on an under taking by them to supply people in congested areas with cheaper meal.  In general, the scheme is working out satisfactorily, and I am glad to notice that the Minister proposes to take power to purchase grain.  I believe that is a move in the right direction. The merchants of Tralee also referred to the system mentioned here in the Bill, that is, the dehulling of corn. They suggest that under the present system two-thirds of the corn is wasted.  Following on that point raised by the millers, I believe that the Minister is quite right in providing for this under the new measure.  I <Col N="864" /> just want to make one plea in regard to the two areas concerned.  Otherwise, on behalf of the people whom I represent, I can say that we appreciate everything the Minister is doing under this system which will bentfit both the large and small farmers.</P>

      <P>I have not had the privilege of hearing the earlier speeches made from this side of the House, so that I do not know the line of criticism taken by the Opposition with reference to the admixture scheme.  What I have gathered is that the economy of it is interlocked with the economic war.  Leaving aside the question of the economic war, which we on this side of the House chose as a major plank on our platform against the Government, and facing up to the position as we find it, the admixture scheme from what I know of it is benefiting the barley-growing counties and, therefore, I must certainly give it my support.  As one who is interested in the grain trade, it may appear that I speak from a selfish point of view.  On the contrary, I wish to speak entirely from the farmers' point of view.  I quite agree with the remarks I heard from Deputy Curran in respect of the prices which, naturally, are the effect of the admixture scheme, because of the cheap price at which maize could be imported as against the price of the admixture, if barley alone were used.  There are, of course, times when maize is very dear and you must go backwards and take the general average price as against the present-day price of barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister was faced with was this: that in certain areas last harvest there were from 90,000 to 100,000 barrels of unsaleable barley. That barley was lying out in the farmers' fields, some in stacks and some in stocks.  It was in such a condition that if it was not handled and taken into proper storage, dried and sweated, the crop would have been irretrievably ruined.  There was no possible market for that barley&mdash; it was a complete glut in the market.  No merchant, no miller, no maize admixture miller, and no warehouse <Col N="865" /> man could deal with the situation. That extended not only down to Carlow and to Deputy Holohan's county&mdash;Kilkenny&mdash;but it also was a problem in Wexford and Tipperary, and in certain other barley-growing areas here and there.  If the admixture scheme had not been operating, as far as we could see the Minister could not do anything to deal with the situation last harvest.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the method which the Government adopted it would have been impossible for the Minister to deal with the situation that was created by the surplus of barley last year.  Some people are of the opinion that 50 per cent. was too high a percentage to fix for the admixture, but after very careful consideration the percentage had to be raised from 25 to 50.  If it had not been raised to 50, as directed by the Minister for Agriculture, it would have been impossible to deal with the problem that was there.  Merchants would have no use in going on the market, clearing that corn and paying the farmers who saved it, if it could not be used up before the next season's crop came in. I quite agree that feeders and those engaged in the rearing of pigs have a genuine complaint.  You had on the one side a crisis as regards the amount of grain that was on offer, and on the other side the unfortunate position that the price had to be raised for those engaged in the feeding of pigs.  But, taking the whole agricultural situation into account, the last thing that anybody would desire to see would be to have things made harder for the agricultural community as a whole.  In my opinion the problem could not have been dealt with otherwise than it was. Quite a big number of farmers in eight counties benefited considerably by having all the barley cleared off the market.  The same applies to oats.</P>
    <P>I have studied very carefully the figures agreed upon between the Department of Agriculture and the merchants.  From these figures one learns that at one time there were between 200,000 and 300,000 cwts. of barley.  You had all that corn lying there to be disposed of.  In my opinion, the scheme that was adopted had <Col N="866" /> the effect of saving the farmers concerned from very heavy losses.  As far as the admixture scheme is concerned I desire to give it my support. That does not necessarily mean that I agree that it is the only system that should be adopted for dealing with a surplus of grain.  I know quite well that, as long as you have grain grown in the country, you are going to have lean years as well as surplus years, so that what we gain in one year on the swings we lose the next year on the roundabouts.  As a result of the market becoming glutted with any particular crop one year, you will have people in the following year getting out of that crop.  The result is that in the next succeeding year the produce of that crop, whether it be grain or anything else, becomes scarce.  There is a scramble to buy it up and prices rise, and following that you have people rushing in to grow it again. That applies to barley and oats and to other crops.</P>
    <P>As far as the corn situation is concerned, experience has shown that if we grow about 143,000 acres of barley and about 617,000 of oats we can produce sufficient of both to meet our internal requirements.  But nobody can give a guarantee as to how the yield of either crop is going to turn out.  Deputies know that in the case of barley we had a most prolific yield last year.  I do not think there was ever anything like it in the history of the corn trade in this country. Whereas the average yield is 15 or 16 barrels to the acre, last year the yield was 22 and 23 barrels, and in some cases it went as high as 25 barrels. Taking these facts into consideration one can easily understand how the grave problem which faced us last season arose.  If it were not for the fact that, after consultation with the Department of Agriculture, we were able to arrive at agreement and provide machinery for increasing the admixture, it would have been quite impossible to save the farmers in many parts of the country as regards the disposal of their barley and oat crops.  The surplus which was there had to be disposed of, and, therefore, in my opinion it was wisely decided to advance the admixture from 25 to <Col N="867" /> 50 per cent.  It was the only method of clearing the surplus that was there before this season's crop came in.</P>
    <P>On behalf of merchants in many parts of the Free State I desire to pay tribute to the services that were rendered in dealing with a difficult and delicate situation by the officials of the Department of Agriculture. From the very start they co-operated with the merchants.  There was no friction.  The advice and assistance which these officials were able to give, coupled with the business experience of the merchants, helped to solve a very difficult problem.  If it had not been solved, it would have meant carrying over into this season something like 250,000 barrels of grain. If such a thing as that had occurred, a situation would have been created that neither the Government nor the merchants could deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that neither pig feeders nor farmers will derive very much comfort from the speech that has just been made by Deputy Minch.  I would like to approach this problem from a somewhat different angle.  At the outset I want to say, arising out of certain remarks made by Deputy Minch, that no one ever cast any reflection either on the Minister or his officials.  They certainly did their best in a very difficult situation, but that is not the question before us now.  The question is: Is the scheme with which this Money Resolution deals framed on the right lines?  Has our experience of it during the past two years been such as to make us enthusiastic for a continuation of it?  On a previous occasion the Minister, when advocating it, emphasised two things which he desired to achieve: one was an increase in the quantity of the grain to be produced in the country, and, secondly, a more remunerative price for the grower.  Looking at the scheme from these two points of view, has it been a success?  The people of the country were encouraged to grow a larger acreage of grain in spite of the fact that there was only the home market to absorb it.  No Deputy in this House despises the value of home-grown grain for feeding.  I have said more than <Col N="868" /> once that at home in my own place we not only use all the grain that we grow, but that we buy more.  The question for us to consider is, what is the most advantageous way to do that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minch referred to the price which is the ruling factor.  Has the price to the grower been increased as the result of our efforts in this House? If we take the average price that growers have received for this year's crop, I think we must admit that the return they have received is a very poor one.  Has the feeder got the benefit of that lower price?  Deputy Flynn, who has just left the House, questioned Deputy Dillon's figures.  He could not understand Deputy Dillon's statement that there was a difference of 3/- a cwt. between the price of the admixture and the materials, taken separately, that go to make it up. There is no difficulty whatever in explaining Deputy Dillon's statement. The price of the material required to make a 2-cwt. bag of feeding-stuff is round about 10/-, while the cost of the admixture is from 15/- to 16/- per 2 cwt.  We as farmers are saying: &ldquo;Is the difference there warranted?&rdquo; One cannot speak for the miller on this point, because the miller has certainly extra expense.  The greater the increase of the home-grown mixture the harder it is to grind; it will cost more, so there will always be a big discrepancy in the price of the raw material and the price of the finished article.  We believe that is not justified and it raises matters to the point that it is not economic to feed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry says that he or his neighbours can make money out of feeding pigs on the present price of the meal admixture and the present price of other components.  Perhaps they can.  He gave an instance of somebody who left the country and then came back to face the situation here.  I could bring Deputy Corry to several people along the Border, Free Staters, who found it so difficult to make money at this business that they have gone across the Border, taken land there and are feeding pigs there. They can buy their meal mixture cheaper and they can get a bigger price for what they produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> As to the production of oats, I do not consider that it is a well-balanced policy to advocate the growth of oats alone.  There may be farms in certain of our counties that can stand bearing oats year after year, but certainly that does not apply to the land in my county.  There we believe in a rotation. We believe the growing of grain continuously, without intervening with roots and feeding and manuring the land, will impoverish it.  Even suppose that for a few years you can continue growing grain, the question is, are the people satisfied and do they think they have got a fair price for their oats?  I am sure the Minister has received a copy of a resolution from the Mid-Monaghan Working Farmers' Association. They did me the honour of sending me a copy and it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we call upon the Government to raise the minimum price of oats to 14/- per barrel as the present price of oats is below the cost of production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this Bill asks people to grow grain below the cost of production, then surely it is not a desirable object. Deputy Minch told us about the surplus of grain that was in his county and how it could be disposed of.  It was after two years of the policy of asking people to grow more grain that we had that surplus on hands.  In my opinion we would be safer in these days of so many bonuses to give people a bonus for using a certain amount of, grain rather than to go to all the expense and put 2/6 or 3/- per cwt. on the cost of the stuff to the feeder.</P>
    <P>There is another small point to which I would like to call the Minister's attention.  As feeders, we are always on the look out for cheaper feeding stuffs, because the lower the cost of our production the better our remuneration.  I notice that for a number of years at this time of the year there has been an export of offals, bran, pollard and all the rest of it.  Some feeders in Northern Ireland asked us how it was that we could sell our pollard so cheaply and told us that it was offered to them at a certain price.  On inquiry, I found that they were able to buy it at nearly £2 a ton cheaper than I <Col N="870" /> could buy it in the home market. There may be some reason why the offals should be exported, but I may say that as feeders we would have been very glad to get an opportunity of purchasing that material at the price at which it was sold elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In 1934 there were 14,874 cwts. of corn offals exported and there were 3,049 cwts. in May of this year.  If there was any way of lowering feeding costs it would solve our problem.  The argument may be used that we are not feeding as much grain to our live stock as in days gone by, but we hope it will not always be so and that there will be a change in that respect.  In the meantime we would like to take advantage of such facilities as are going.  This meal mixture is one which is causing a great deal of irritation, and I do not know that this present Bill is going to simplify the position.  It seems to me to be throwing more difficulties in the way of feeders and millers.  All that goes back on the producer.  The producer has nobody to whom he can hand his troubles.  I am sorry I cannot support this Bill or display any enthusiasm in regard to it.  We feel that the thing is altogether wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There, is one aspect of this that strikes me very much.  Deputy Corry, with what one might call full-blooded effrontery, painted a magnificent position for the farmers, but I think he was sufficiently dealt with by Deputy O'Leary.  He did say that the farmers were getting £2,000,000 a year, which was coming out of this scheme and going into their pockets.  Deputy Minch spoke of a particular type of farmer in a particular area, and he felt that this was a very necessary scheme for such farmers and thought that it would be a disaster for them if they lost it.  The problem we are concerned with here, taking cognisance of the problems of various sections in the country, is the problem of agricultural well-being as a whole and employment in agriculture.  The areas that were dealt with by Deputy Minch did have our very careful consideration and our direct assistance when the sugar beet industry was introduced, particularly for the purpose <Col N="871" /> of assisting the areas of which the Deputy spoke.</P>
      <P>When we are discussing a measure which is gravely criticised from many parts of the country, and when we hear Deputy Minch speaking enthusiastically in regard to his part of the country, we naturally turn to the agricultural conditions in his part of the country to see what they are.  If we take Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Offaly, Wexford and Tipperary, the areas that perhaps he speaks most about, in every single one of these counties there were less permanent agricultural labourers employed last year compared with the year before Fianna Fáil put its political hand to the farmers' plough and said it would help them.  In Carlow the fall in the number of permanent agricultural labourers was 81; in Kildare it was 180.  The position was worse in Kildare, in that the members of farmers' families engaged on agriculture had also been reduced by 148. In Kilkenny there was a reduction of permanent agricultural labourers to the extent of 249; in Offaly, 144; in Wexford, 28, and in Tipperary, 490. It is very hard for the ordinary person, particularly in the city, to whom the Cereals Bill is reflected as an increased price for flour and an increased price for bread, to understand why they should pay those increased prices when the policy that is being pursued is reducing the number of permanent agricultural labourers employed in counties that particularly ought to benefit by the scheme.  There is that to be taken into account when considering the enthusiasm with which Deputy Minch approaches the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the agricultural position with regard to barley, it is very hard for people not deeply involved in the barley industry to understand why there should be such a terrible crisis in connection with barley in 1935, when we grew only 23,000 acres of barley more than was grown before Fianna Fáil went in to assist the farmer, and when there were 8,600 less acres of oats grown.  On the claim which Deputy Corry makes that £2,000,000 are going into the pockets of the farmers, we have absolute and <Col N="872" /> clear evidence that, however they are managing to get that money&mdash;if they are&mdash;it is not doing them any good, because we must take as one definite criterion of the well-being of the farmers the position of agricultural labourers in the country and the pay they get.  When we take the country as a whole, there were 617 less permanent agricultural labourers employed in 1935 than in 1931, and there has been a grave reduction in their wages.  It has to be pressed home on every occasion that there is a decrease in agricultural wages, on the figures quoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce alone, of £900,000, as compared with the year 1931.  But when we go further than that, and take outside opinion as distinct from statistics that are built up on the cream of agricultural labour in the country, the position is infinitely worse.  Only 12 months ago, speaking at this time of the year, and no doubt referring to the circumstances around him in Cork County, the Bishop of Cork stated, as reported in the Press of 18th June, 1935, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one class with which I should like to express my sympathy, and that class is the farmers' labourers.  I am not speaking with any political motive, and when I single out farmers' labourers I should like to say it is not the farmers' fault that the labourers are not paid more.  The farmers are unable to pay any, more.  It would be well for the Government to realise that there are many labourers with families who are not getting more than 10/- a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we consider the proposals that are put up in measures like this as a change and extension of proposals already discussed by the House and already looked very much askance at by the House, we should not close our eyes to the fact that it is possible for authoritative opinion living very closely in touch with men like the farmers and the farm labourers to point out such facts as are stated here.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly, I have drawn the attention of the Minister for Agriculture himself to the fact that in his own <Col N="873" /> county at the beginning of last year the County Committee of Agriculture in three months running discussed the position of agricultural labourers.  The motion to be discussed at the first meeting was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we call on the Minister for Agriculture to set up at once a wages board for agricultural labourers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The motion to be discussed at the second meeting was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Government be called on to subsidise the present wages of agricultural labourers so that they will receive a living wage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had a Kerry Deputy here a few moments ago asking that the small farmers in Kerry be subsidised in order to help them to bear the burdens resulting from legislation such as this.  At the discussions of the County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford it was emphatically stated by one member and not repudiated by any person &mdash;their whole discussions and all their recommendations made to the Ministry at the time were based on such a statement as that&mdash;that the average wage of the married agricultural labourer in his area was 8/- a week and his support.  That was reiterated by another member; in the second month of the discussion about subsidising the existing wages of agricultural labourers another member said he would like to include in his motion a request that the wages be brought up to 14/- a week.  The proposal was that the Government should give 6/- a week subsidy, in order to add that to the 8/- they were getting and make it 14/- a week.</P>
    <P>It may be that a scheme like this is necessary to fill in a gap because of the general conditions in the country, and the general position to which agriculture is brought by the Minister's policy.  Owing to the conditions indicated here in the homes of agricultural labourers and in the homes of small farmers in Kerry, the Government inevitably is driven, by force of circumstances, to go into the homes of the agricultural labourers and into the homes of small farmers in the Ballingeary district and the Kerry district to help them to run <Col N="874" /> their places.  What chance is there of any Government helping an agricultural labourer who has wages even as high as the Labour Party quoted&mdash; 14/-, 15/-, 16/- or 17/-?  What chance is there of any Government or Government Department going into a home where 14/- or 15/- are coming in, and helping the man of the house and the woman of the house to run that home?  It cannot be done.  The sooner a situation is brought about that will enable the big farmer in Kildare, in Carlow and in Tipperary to run his business more along the lines that he would be inclined to run it if he were left alone, the sooner will we have a situation where the agricultural labourer will be able to run his business and rear his family and run his home without there being strong pressure on the Government to send relieving officers and inspectors of all kinds into the homes of the poor classes who are dependent upon agriculture for their living.  While we may sympathise to some extent with the ideas that are put forward by Deputy Minch with regard to those larger farmers in larger areas, the fact that must strike us in the face is that even in counties where there are those big farmers who are getting this assistance, there are less agricultural labourers employed to-day than before ever they hoped or looked for or wanted the type of assistance they are getting under this Bill.</P>

      <P>This debate to-day has been rather pleasant to my hearing, because so far six or seven Deputies have spoken, and it is the first time that I heard a measure of this description debated so long without our being told that bankruptcy was only three or six months ahead.

      <P>It was not mentioned to-day; it may be yet.  When this Government is anxious to at least try to have some token of self-sufficiency I wonder at some of the Deputies talking there about maize meal when we are trying to promote the growth of <Col N="875" /> what will support this country in the case of any emergency.  There is no use in telling us about all the trouble and about Canada, and so on.  There is no use talking about it.  What we should be talking about is how we are going to conserve the food supply of this country in order to be able to feed the inhabitants of the country.  That is the position to be faced, and I say that this Government is trying to face up to that problem so that in case of any emergency of that sort we will at least be in some position to try to supply the needs of our people here.</P>
      <P>Deputies here on my left have spoken on this matter.  Some of them do not see eye to eye with me as to the nature of the problem.  Deputy Minch has praised this much more than, perhaps, I do.  Deputy Holohan told us that the admixture produces a better article than the maize meal.  That is true. We are trying to fix the price of bacon and if we had not the article we could not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the one chance you have.  All you can do is to try to cast that up against us.  Now, it is the duty of the Government to try to provide employment here.  Take the case of the cattle trade and its connection with the economic war.  I am a farmer myself and I feel that, perhaps, certain better arrangements might be made in the line of trying to solve that problem, but I think that any Deputy will agree that, at any time in this country we had a boom in cattle, we also had a boom in emigration.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> Some of the Deputies here have made suggestions and I only wish that at least four or five of the Deputies who have spoken were as much in agreement with the Government on certain other matters.  Some of them have made helpful suggestions, and I am very proud indeed that so far in this debate I have not heard anything about tins alleged bankruptcy of the country we are accustomed to hearing so much about.  We are told that agricultural wages have gone down, and I will say that they did fall somewhat two years ago, but I think that Deputies will agree that agricultural wages are at a higher level now than they were, say, 12 months ago.  We are also told that even though there is more grain produced in the country there is less employment.  Well, we all know&mdash;any of us who are practical farmers&mdash;that farming methods are more up-to-date nowadays than they were some years ago.  I can see it myself in my own part of the country, and I see that a man is able to do more with a pair of horses than he or I could have done years ago, because methods are very much improved.  In that respect, it could be quite possible that although we had more production there might be less employment.</P>

      <P>Until Deputy Victory had spoken I was of the opinion that the economic war had been won, but I gather from his remarks that there are still some difficulties.  Furthermore, I gather from Deputy Victory's remarks that the trouble in this country is not to get rid of our produce but to try, as he says, to conserve the products of the country to protect the people.  I always thought <Col N="877" /> that the economic problem in tins country was that we had a big surplus of our produce that we could not get rid of.  Accordingly, I find it difficult to get at the mentality of the Fianna Fáil Party in a matter of this kind.  Deputy Victory also spoke about world conditions.  I think that we, as farmers, should have first consideration for the people of our own country, of our own world here, and I should like to speak in this connection, on behalf of my own constituency, which is one of the biggest in Ireland.  It is a very remarkable fact that it is the only constituency in Ireland that has not a Fianna Fáil representative.  That is a very significant fact.  It is the only constituency that has not a representative of Fianna Fáil, and I am of the belief that if there were an election in the morning there would be very many constituencies in the country that would follow the lead of West Cork in that respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry told us about what the Government had done for the people.  He told us of the thousands and thousands of pounds the Government had put into the farmers' pockets for their crops.  Well, take it from the point of view either of the grain-producer or of the feeder. I do not think either of these has got any money from the Government. The man who produces grain, or grows wheat, if you like, in connection with the wheat scheme, gets his money, not from the Government, but from the increased cost in the price of bread. In a short time we will be discussing another measure in connection with the control of the price of bread, which is about 10d. per 4 lb. in this country, and I say that only for the Government's schemes bread could be sold, at a decent profit, at 8½d. per 4 lb.  As a result of the Government schemes the price is 10d., and the difference of 1½d. comes out of the consumers' pockets to subsidise the wheat-growing scheme, and not out of the coffers of the Government.  The poor people in the towns are paying 1½d. more than they ought to have to pay, and that is the fund from which the subsidy comes.  It does not come from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Now, with regard to the maize meal mixture scheme, all my life, ever since I was born, I have been familiar with milling, and I have come to the opinion that, in balancing up things, it would be better for us if we had never stopped or lowered the importation of maize into this country.  I was always a believer in Irish Ireland and always held that this country should be as self-sufficient as possible, but I am afraid that a country that has no raw materials will never come to be on a self-sufficient basis.  We shall always have to import something, and if we can import certain commodities advantageously and sell our own goods advantageously, if the balance is in our favour it would be better to export the things that we can export advantageously and to import the things that we can get at better advantage by importing them. So far as the farmers are concerned, the average price of oats in this country for the last four or five years has been about 5/-, and I say it would be better to throw it away at a 2/6 or so a cwt. and buy at a proper price.</P>
    <P>I come from West Cork.  Now, the eastern side of it is mixed tillage, but the western side is all small farmers who cannot grow these subsidised cereal crops.  They simply live on their little sucklings and yearlings and on their pig trade.  At the present time those people are buying the native grain in places like the midlands and around the Pale and in some parts of East Cork, and paying a very high price for it.  They are not getting any advantage from the growing of any of the crops that are being grown in this country.  They must pay for what they buy, and that is something over £8 a ton.</P>
    <P>There is the further disadvantage that this mixture takes at least a month longer to fatten a pig with.  So that, not only is there an increased cost on the farmer but there is an increased period in producing the finished pig, and even then, with the increase of a month in time, I do not know if it is a better pig than the pig that is fattened completely on the pure maize meal.  Maize meal in its <Col N="879" /> purity could be sold at a good profit by millers in this country to-day at £5 a ton&mdash;or £5 10s. 0d., at all events &mdash;as against the £8 for the mixture.  I need not point out to the House the difference between paying £5 or £5 10s. 0d. for a proper article and paying £8 or £8 10s. 0d. for an inferior article.  That is the position in West and North-west Cork.  They are small farmers who live on rocks and who are known as &ldquo;rock farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary produced a resolution that was passed by a party that is not a political Party.  I have also got copies of resolutions from Labour people, Fianna Fáil, and from extreme republicans who have to live on these holdings, asking me for God's sake to try to have this admixture scheme done away with, as it is ruining them.  I implore the Minister to see the wisdom of getting away from that scheme.  He is subsidising a very foolish scheme that is costing more and more every year, and that is inflicting more and more injury on these unfortunate people.  Every farmer who goes for tillage derives his profit from what walks off the land.  The only profit this class of farmer gets is from what walks off the land on four legs.  The Fianna Fáil Party tried to get away from that system, but now they see, notwithstanding all the talk, that employment on the land is decreasing, that farmers are getting less profit, and are in a position to pay less labour, at a time that more cost is being put upon them.  They are selling at a disadvantage while everything is costing more and more to produce.  As there is no Fianna Fáil T.D. in West Cork, I make a special appeal to the Minister for these people who have no T.D. in Fianna Fáil to make representations. I speak on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in West Cork and ask the Minister to consider the position of the people in that district.  If the Minister knew how these people try to exist he would be moved by their condition.  I appeal to him to do something, even if necessary to bring in an amending Bill so that there could be exceptions made to the general rule, and that these poor people who are trying to <Col N="880" /> eke out an existence would not be treated as they are treated under the present system.  I make that appeal earnestly on behalf of the best people that we have in the Fíor Ghaeltacht in mid-Cork and West Cork, as they deserve more consideration from this House than they have got up to the present.</P>

      <P>I am intervening to ask one question arising out of the onslaught by Deputy Dillon on the growing of wheat on a commercial scale in this country.  The events of the last few days have perceptibly brightened the prospects of the United Ireland Party being in power in 12 months' time.  The question I want to put is one that ought to be answered. With regard to the wheat scheme, I want to know whether or not it is the intention, on the part of the Opposition, to drop it if they come into power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will give way I will be glad to answer.  It has been repeatedly stated in public that it is not our policy to drop the wheat scheme instantly, it being our view that revolutions in agricultural practice of that kind are calculated to do nothing but harm.  It is quite clearly our policy to tell our people that, in our opinion, the production of wheat is hopelessly uneconomic, but still we would continue the present guaranteed price for wheat in the event of our forming the Government of this country, lest those who have adapted their husbandry to wheat production should suffer unduly.  We consider, however, that at that price wheat will no longer prove an attractive proposition when a far better price could be got by using the land for other types of agriculture, founded on production of live stock and livestock products.</P>

      <P>I commend the helpful and the fair contribution that <Col N="881" /> Deputy Minch made to the debate. As would be expected from one who is intimately associated with the grain trade, and one who understands the position, the Deputy had the courage to come here to say what he thinks. The burden of his speech was one of agreement with the policy of the Minister and with the officials of his Department, for the very effective manner in which they handled the grain problem that confronted this country last year.  As Deputies who represent grain-growing constituencies know what that position was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a great meed of praise is due to the Deputy, and, as a rule, I say what I think of people inside as well as outside this House. I remember quite clearly the position that confronted tillage farmers when the change of Government took place. I know that the acreage under tillage was on the decline.  I know the difficulty there was in obtaining a market at any price for cereals.  I know that, in 1931, farmers in County Kilkenny who produced barley had to sell first-class malting barley at prices ranging from 11/- to 12/6 per barrel, while the lower grades could not be sold at all.  Oats was selling at what might be described as scrap-iron prices and farmers here had to compete with the famous subsidised German oats and Canadian oats that were being imported and sold on the market at prices with which they could not compete. The inevitable result was that the land was going out of tillage, and there was a spirit of hopelessness amongst working farmers.  The admixture scheme preserved the home market for the home producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the basis of the scheme, and the basis of Government policy generally in regard to it.  The admixture scheme has resulted in an increased acreage under tillage.  The acreage under barley has considerably increased, and the yield of barley last year was 40 per cent. better than the yield in a normal year.  While the percentage was increased, it was not sufficiently increased, in my opinion, <Col N="882" /> before the new crop went on the market. Most of the grain grown in the Midlands, especially barley, would be left with the farmers, and would be unsaleable but for this scheme.  This year the admixture percentage was increased to 50 per cent.  While I have no definite information about last year's percentage, I understand that pressure was brought to bear on the Minister by the maize millers to leave it as it was, and that they assured him all the grain that was available would be cleared before the new crop came on the market.  It was not cleared, and as there was a good deal left over, there was difficulty after the threshing season in selling the new crop, which was an abnormally good one.  As many millers had considerable quantities of barley and oats on hands, they were then unable to take large supplies from farmers in some districts at the start of the usual buying season. All that trouble has now practically disappeared as a result of the Minister having increased the percentage of the admixture to 50 per cent. and having adhered to that.  By the time the new season's crop will come in, there will be no surplus grain.  That answers pretty effectively the suggestion made by Deputy Holohan that the percentage should not be raised over 25 per cent.  What are we going to do with the remainder of the grain if the percentage is reduced to 25 per cent.? We know the position that existed in 1931.  People were getting out of tillage because they could not sell their grain in the country.  Deputy Holohan, in contradistinction to Deputy O'Neill, stated that the quality of bacon produced from pigs fed with the admixture was better than the quality produced from pigs fed on pure maize.</P>

      <P>Deputy Holohan said that the usual mixture with maize, before this scheme was enforced, was of inferior grain.  If the inferior grain at that time proved so satisfactory in the admixture, surely, now that better corn is being used and that a good price is being given for it, the admixture must be much more satisfactory? Deputy Curran, like every other member of the Opposition who spoke in this debate, had something to say about the economic war. Deputy Curran, who, I am sorry to say, is not now in the House, is connected with a big creamery organisation which has a number of auxiliaries. I make the statement, and I am sorry that he is not here to listen to it, that that co-operative society is in a very much better and a much more secure position than before Fianna Fáil took office.  The same applies to other co-operative creameries in County Kilkenny. Of course we know Deputy Dillon's attitude regarding wheat. Any doubts which remained in the minds of the people as to his attitude have been dispelled by his considered answer to Deputy MacDermot.  We seem, according to the Deputy, to suffer or to be afflicted with such a terrible dose of original sin in this country that we cannot grow wheat. We grew it for generations, just as well as the Canadians did and we had an exportable surplus.</P>

We have certainly not improved in <Col N="886" /> that respect since we ceased to grow wheat and mill our own flour.  Our climatic conditions, I suggest, are just as good as those of any country from Scandinavia to the Equator.  If Deputy Dillon has not been convinced that wheat can be grown in this country by the splendid crops which have been produced for the last three years, I think it must be very hard to convince him.  If the past three years have not convinced him, he will see a splendid crop growing this year, a crop equally as good as that grown in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and those other places with high-sounding names. The people of this country, I maintain, are solidly behind the Government in its agricultural policy.</P>

      <P>When the proper time comes we shall ask the people about it.  I join with Deputy Corry in urging the Minister, when fixing the price of barley and oats to fix a remunerative price for these cereals. Deputy Haslett read a resolution in regard to the price of oats in the County Monaghan, but there will be plenty of time for consideration of that later.  I would urge the Minister to see that the farmer gets a remunerative price for his oats, barley and other crops and he will certainly do a good day's work for the tillage farmers in this country.  Were it not for the special measures that the Minister has taken the land of Ireland would practically have become a prairie instead of showing an increase in cultivation.  Were it not for that increase, going on from year to year, and were it not for the policy of self-sufficiency in agriculture, the prospect before the working farmers in this country would be hopeless indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons has given us his views as to the position in the County Kilkenny, but his colleague in the representation of that county did not agree with him. The farmers in the County Cavan are opposed to this whole scheme.  Cavan is not suitable for extensive tillage. The farmers there have tilled all the land they could, and they do not need <Col N="887" /> to be pushed any further.  They feed all they can to pigs and cattle, and they supplement their home-grown supplies of feeding stuffs by Indian meal.  Now they have to pay 4/- or 5/- per bag extra, and there is general complaint of the quality of the grain supplied them.  It is sometimes no better than sweepings from lofts. Farmers, faced with this position, will have to get out of the pig breeding business altogether.  They bring bonhams to the market and they find there is no one to buy them.  From every point of view, the Minister's scheme is detrimental to their best interest.  They always believed in feeding what they grow to pigs and cattle, and selling these to the best advantage.  They never relied upon selling their grain to their neighbours or selling barley for malting purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons said that the farmers in County Kilkenny could not sell their barley in 1931.  What was to prevent them in 1931 feeding their barley to their live stock, and selling their live stock for which there was then an unlimited market?  There was no limitation upon the exportation of pigs and cattle at that time.  They could also sell their barley to the people in other counties who went in for pig feeding. The Minister should give consideration to other counties in Ireland than the grain-growing counties.  The County Cavan and the County Leitrim cannot go in for extensive grain growing.  The whole scheme is against their interest. They are paying extra for their flour and for their feeding-stuffs, and, notwithstanding the increase in the price of pigs, they find very great difficulty in disposing of their pigs.  When they sell them they get worse prices than the people across the Border who buy their feeding-stuffs several shillings per cwt. less than the people in the County Cavan.  In view of these things, farmers in the County Cavan have become so restless that they have been criticising, not only the Fianna Fáil Party, but all Parties in this House. They seem to think that we are more or less approving the Minister's scheme.  Of course we are not.  But it is hopeless, speaking to the Minister and to the empty benches behind him, <Col N="888" /> to effect any change.  I have been disgusted trying to convince the Minister of anything.  The Minister will not be convinced and neither will Deputy Corry.  The Minister lectures the farmers from time to time as to how they should do their business.  Lately he went to Limerick and told the farmers there that they were not managing their farms as they should do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that we have good workers in Cavan, I do not know about Limerick, but I am sure all the same they know how to make proper use of their land. They have lived on the land and worked the land as did their fathers and grandfathers before them.  For one thing the Minister cannot accuse the farmers of Cavan of being lazy; they are a very industrious people and grow all they can.  They want to get a chance of carrying on their work in the way that pays them best.  They cannot go in for wheat growing.  The land is not suitable and the climate is not suitable.  Some of them have grown wheat but it did not compensate them for the loss they incurred in other directions.  They could never go in for growing wheat for sale.  They grow some wheat, and use it, for their own purposes.  But the quality is such that they can only use about 5 per cent. of it to mix with their flour.  That is all the use the wheat scheme is to them. All they get in return is extra taxation. They have to pay extra for their flour in order to benefit the grain-growing districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the meal mixture. Instead of buying Indian meal, at the same price as the farmers in the County Fermanagh, they have to pay 4/- or 5/- a cwt. more for it and they have to sell their pigs at a loss.  They are living in impatience.  I am not in the least surprised that they are biding their time waiting for the opportunity to come.  Unless the Minister changes his policy he need not come to Cavan to ask the farmers there to support his Party.  I hope the Minister will consider mitigating the worst hardships of this scheme and will give some consideration to districts that cannot take advantage <Col N="889" /> of it.  In the West of Ireland this scheme is very unsuitable and is doing serious injury to the small farmers there.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House, dealing with this particular Bill is, I think, the very best illustration we could have of Government interference in legitimate, well-established business of the people. Once a Government starts tinkering with an old-established industry, run by people in the best way they consider it should be run, they cannot stop themselves from continuing to interfere.  This is an illustration of it.  The Minister has my sympathy in trying to deal with this problem. The Bill we are financing by this motion is, I understand, a necessary adjunct to previous legislation of that kind.  The Government started on the absurd lines of an anti-live-stock-cereal-policy. Deputy Corry told us of the wonderful efforts the Government had made to provide a market for grain in this country.  What market did they provide?  Did not the Government go out on an anti-live-stock campaign?  If you have an anti-live-stock policy, what is going to consume your cereals?  What are you going to do with the cereals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is hopeless. Deputy Corry thinks that it is a very fine thing for the Government, having reduced the live stock and the live stock remaining not being able to consume the home production, to step in with this admixture scheme. The Minister for Agriculture himself told us not so long ago that we might have to content ourselves with a lower production of live stock.  What would happen the admixture scheme, then? Are not live stock the basis of the whole scheme?  Deputy Gibbons has, as a sensible man, tried to talk on this subject in a very sensible way. He seems to be honestly convinced that this is a good attempt to deal with the situation.  Possibly, it is the only attempt that could be made in the circumstances but it ought to be a warning to the Minister and to those who will follow the present <Col N="890" /> Government&mdash;that may happen very soon &mdash; that tinkering by legislation with a legitimate, well-established pursuit of the people leads you into a morass.</P>
      <P>Once you fix a price for grain, you must fix a price for the miller.  You must also fix a price for the man using the finished article.  You must fix a price for the wholesaler and the retailer, and you must fix the wages for the labourers and for the people who have to buy.  The Government have a very good lesson here.  The more they can keep their hands off agriculture, which is our main industry, the better not alone for themselves but for the industry.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from some of the speeches delivered here that a desperate situation confronted the Government, that the country was flooded with cereals which it could not get rid of, and that, as a result of Government policy, we had during the past few years an enormous increase of tillage and an enormous increase of cereals, which must be got rid of.  I am sure Deputy Gibbons was honestly convinced of that.  At all events, he gave me the impression that he was However, the figures do not bear that out.  I have them before me.  In 1931, there were practically 623,000 acres of oats.  In 1935, there were 614,000 acres. which was a drop of about 9,000 acres in oats alone.</P>

I am dealing with the admixture scheme and the basis of any market you will have for that admixture is live stock.  Barley, oats and rye are the only crops concerned with the admixture scheme.  They are the crops which we have to deal with.  There is subsidisation to the extent of £3 10s. 0d. per ton for this admixture scheme.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will permit me to interrupt him for a moment.  The House knows that there is a subsidy of 5/- a cwt. given to the English farmer, with the result that the price of stores has been higher for the past 12 months than the price of beef.</P>

      <P>Yes, and the more forward we have our stores, the better for ourselves.  I remember Deputy Matt.  O'Reilly speaking from the opposite benches recently and saying that one-third of the Irish cattle were not fit for sale at all.  That was what Deputy O'Reilly thought.  I remember that Deputy O'Reilly was introduced, to a meeting at a by-election in Galway, as a man who knew more about farming than the whole Cumann na nGaedheal Party put together.  That was the opinion of Deputy O'Reilly as regards our cattle.  There is no use in pretending that Fianna Fáil had a desperate situation confronting them and that they solved it by this admixture scheme, which is costing the people an enormous amount of money.  All they have got to deal with are 13,000 odd acres.  That is the only extra cereal production, outside wheat, which we have had since Fianna Fáil came into power.</P>

      <P>No case has been made for the admixture.  Deputy Holohan said that, in his opinion, it produced better bacon than did maize meal.  Possibly.  I would not set myself up as a judge.  I feed pigs mostly on what I raise on my own farm.  I grow wheat and I was growing it long before I heard of Fianna Fáil. The price charged for the admixture must lessen the return to the farmer for his live stock.  I do not think that Deputy Gibbons should put it to the credit of Fianna Fáil that the bacon-curers of Waterford have made enormous profits since Fianna Fáil came into power.  I do not think it is to the credit of Fianna Fáil that they have done so.  If they have made these profits, it has been at the expense of the producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably grow as much cereals as any farmer who has spoken here to-day and I should like to make a few comments on this Bill, though my contribution to the debate will not be a very long one.  I regard the wheat policy of the Government as a useful one.  I have one complaint to make in regard to it.  That is, that it is costing the consumer more in the price of his bread.  Twenty years ago, I was growing wheat.  I did not commence to grow it when Fianna Fáil came into power.  I was growing wheat ten or 12 years before Fianna Fáil came into office.  I grew luxuriant crops of wheat and very bad crops.  I suppose I was not any more unfortunate than other farmers in having to plough up many a crop of wheat owing to the inclemency of the weather.  Wheat is a &ldquo;chancy&rdquo; crop.  Farmers like myself get a certain benefit by growing it.  But at whose expense do we get that benefit?  At the expense of the consumer.  I am a grower of 14 acres of wheat at present.  I expect it will pay me as well as oats or barley but the consumer who has to pay 11/- per sack more for his flour in order to provide the subsidy has some cause for complaint.  When we were growing oats and barley before the Fianna Fáil Government came into power, I never heard of these big surpluses lying over. What is the reason for the change now?  Until Fianna Fáil started this economic war, we had a market for our live stock.  Farmers like myself could feed our cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry and we had not to be looking for a market for our surplus grain.  We could feed it to our live stock and sell them in the English market.  I am not ashamed to repeat that we could sell in the English market.  What was the price of cattle in the Dublin Cattle <Col N="894" /> Market in 1931?  The price in the Dublin Cattle Market at that time was 41/- per cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the price in 1932 and in 1933, after Fianna Fáil came into office?  The price was 22/- per cwt., live weight, or a reduction of 19/- a cwt. in two years.  What wonder is it that the feeders of this country are not able to make agriculture pay.  Could any man now feed live stock and make it pay?  No, and the reason is because of the economic war that was started by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Their policy has finished the farmers of this country. Before Fianna Fáil came into office there was one way of getting rid of agricultural produce and that was to feed it to the live stock on the farm and make it walk off the land in the form of cattle, pigs and sheep.  These were sent direct to the London market. That was the market after which the whole world has been &ldquo;galloping.&rdquo; But that was the market that our Government wanted to get rid of.  We were such big fellows that we wanted to get rid of the British market.  They told the people that we would produce our own stuff and eat it ourselves and we were going to have bellies on us as big as John Bull himself.  At the present moment we see that the Fianna Fáil Government is engaged in trying to find how they can retain the English market.  They are paying subsidies now in order to get into it.  They did not see their mistake in time.  They see it when it is too late.  We heard the cry &ldquo;do away with the English market.&rdquo;  They forgot that the English market is the only market in the world that was freely open to us. It was open to us until the Fianna Fáil Government started off with their foolish ideas.  That is what the country has gained by the policy of the Parties opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy Martin Corry here to-day telling us about the campaign of Fianna Fáil.  He told us about the millions of money that are going into the farmers' pockets.  If that is so, <Col N="895" /> how is it that the farmers are not getting rich?  How is it that we find the sheriff in my locality at the farmers' houses every day?  It is not now a monthly visit to the farmers' houses but a weekly visit.  We find them going around from door to door gathering up shillings, if they cannot get pounds, anything at all for the time being.  We are told there is an increase in employment in this country.  But so far as Leix is concerned the people there have a fair idea of what the increase in employment is.</P>
    <P>The position there is only like what it is elsewhere amongst the agricultural community.  The Fianna Fáil Party tell us that their tillage policy is bringing more employment to the agricultural community.  Well, we have the Government statistics, and the Minister for Agriculture has them before him.  What is the position? In the case of Leix, there are 177 less labourers employed in agriculture now than in 1931.  In Offaly, there are 144 less labourers now than in 1931. But we are supposed to have an increase in tillage.  How is it then that there are less labourers employed? We have an increase in tillage, but who is carrying on the tillage?  The farmer himself, especially the small farmer, with his own sons and daughters. These are the people who are carrying on the tillage.  As a matter of fact, I must tell the House this much: that it is shameful when travelling along the roads of the country to see housefuls of little girls out in the beet fields weeding the beet, and up to their knees in wet and earth, thinning beet. I know one parish in Leix where two or three schools have been closed for the last three weeks.  And for what purpose?  That the school children should be kept at home to aid their fathers in going out working in the beet fields.  That is the result of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government. Now, if this beet were a paying proposition, would not the farmer be in a position to pay labourers?  The farmers of that area always paid labourers. They paid them an honest, decent, good wage.</P>

      <P>At the present time there are farm labourers working down the country, and I know it, for little or nothing.  Some of them are working for their board, and many of them for their board and tobacco money. There are labourers there who are getting only a couple of bob a week. Before this Government came into power, no farmer could think of offering a labourer less than 25/- or 30/- a week, and no labourer was working for less.  That was the general rate of wage there.  Now we have labourers going around from door to door seeking work at any sort of wage.  The trouble is that the farmer needs the services of these men badly, but he is unable to employ them and pay them a decent wage.  What happens then is, rather than ask a man to work for him for a few shillings a week and his board, he lets the man go and does the work himself with the assistance of his little children.  And, in face of all that, we are told that the growing of beet and wheat is a great advantage to the agricultural labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to see the position in which agriculture is to-day because for the last 35 years I have been working a big tillage farm.  I have always tilled about 40 acres.  I never found it hard to work it or to employ labour or to get on as long as we had a live-stock trade.  Then we had the policy of the present Government and the economic war.  The economic war ruined the farmers.  It ruined the live-stock trade, and when it ruined the live-stock trade, it ruined the only hope the farmers had.  As long as you have live stock you cannot have too much tillage on a farm, because you can feed all the cereals off that farm to the live stock and you will be paid for it.  I was paid for it in the past but not at the present day. I knew a man who when malting barley was making 14/6 per barrel, kept 50 or 60 barrels of malting barley every year, sent it to the mill to be ground, and fed it to his live stock. At present we are selling barley for 10/- and 11/-.  The farmers in my area were only too delighted to get rid of it at that price.  After the <Col N="897" /> last harvest they went around begging people to take it at 10/- per barrel.</P>

      <P>I am.  You do not live 100 miles away from me.  Why not come down to my place and see what farming is?  Although you are of different politics, I shall entertain you for the evening.  I never sold a barrel of malting barley for the last 30 years at less than 14/6&mdash;not even in 1930 or 1931&mdash;any year you wish.  Last year the farmers had to go round the country looking for feeders to buy their barley at 10/6 or 11/- per barrel. I hope that a similar crisis will not arise this year.  I should like to be able to congratulate the Minister on making a price for barley and oats this year.  If he does not take steps in time before the harvest, it is my opinion that a similar crisis is going to arise this year.  It is all very fine to talk about this meal mixture.  I do not approve of it for one.  I would sooner have the old way.  I may be wrong or I may be right, but if I <Col N="898" /> had my way, I would feed my live stock with oats and barley grown on my own farm, and it would cost me 3/- per cwt. less to get it ground and use it in that way than if I sold it and bought it back from the merchant. If I was not able to make money by feeding my own corn to pigs or cattle at 3/- per cwt. less than I can buy it, how can the farmer who has to go to the retailer and buy it at 8/- per cwt. make money or live? It cannot be done.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take these things into consideration.  I like to do what is just.  I do not want to put up a case for which there is no foundation. I should like to argue on a straight issue.  If you want to buy a ton of pollard I am sure the first place you will make for is the place where it is cheapest.  If pollard is being sold in Rathdowney for £8 a ton, in another town for £7 a ton, and in a third town for £6 a ton, surely I will go where I can get pollard at £6 per ton.  I think that this campaign of trying to get offals is very bad policy and a poor one.  There is only one way to end this policy and that is for the Government to finish the economic war and let the people get the price for live stock that they formerly got.  If I could get 41/- per cwt. for cattle to-day, which I got some years ago, I am sure I would not be sowing wheat or beet.  I could sow cereals and root crops in rotation and give more employment by feeding that stuff to live stock and I would be doing a better day's work for myself and a better day's work for my employees.</P>

I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all, but as a grower of cereals for so many years I thought it <Col N="899" /> my duty to put my ideas before the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told by the Fianna Fáil back benchers that the bacon curers of the Free State have had a good time.  They have had a good time, a very good time, at the expense of the consumer and the producer. The constituency which both the Minister and myself represent is a tillage one.  Labour, however, is not paid very well there.  The majority of the labourers have 10/- per week and their support.  When a labourer's wife goes to the country shop to lay out these few shillings on a Friday or a Saturday and asks the shopkeeper what is the price of bacon, and she is told 1/2 or 1/3 a lb., she says: &ldquo;I must go home without any.&rdquo;  That is what is happening.  We are told about the prosperity of the bacon curers.  They may thank the Pigs and Bacon Board for that.  This system of grading is unprofitable for the pig breeder.  I have often been asked, and I have often asked the question myself: &ldquo;Where is this third-grade bacon sold?&rdquo; Poor people come to me and say, &ldquo;I had a couple of pigs for sale and was cut 14/- or 15/- per cwt. in the price because it was said the pigs were too fat, but when I went to the shop to ask for that fat bacon I could not get it.&rdquo;  So that there is something wrong, and very wrong in the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to see that, if a pig producer is cut from 10/- to 12/- and 13/- per cwt. on the pig that he has to sell, he will get the benefit of that loss in cheap bacon.  We have been told that we can use up a lot of barley in pig feeding.  As a pig feeder, it is my opinion that barley is not a profitable meal to use for pig feeding.  If you use 50 per cent. of it you will lose money in the production of pigs.  Before the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board was established, I went in in a small way for pig feeding, just as I engage in <Col N="900" /> most other branches of farming.  I go in for mixed farming.  When I was turning out pigs with my own mixture, that is, balancing my own ration, I was able to produce a pig weighing 16 stone live weight, at six months old.  If I were to do that to-day I would be cut 13/- per cwt. on that pig.  It now takes eight months to turn out a 16-stone pig. Surely, no Deputy will deny that an eight months old pig will eat more. and, therefore, cost more to the producer than a pig that you can fatten in six months.  Deputy Gibbons told us about all that the Government have done for the pig industry.  My answer to him is that it has killed the pig industry.  It has made the bacon curers rich and the pig producers poor.  There is no man in this country to-day who can feed a pig for eight months at the present price of meal, sell that pig at the fixed price and make money.  What is happening is the pig producers are losing money.</P>
    <P>We were asked what was the price of cattle in 1921 and in 1930.  My answer is that, in 1921, we were getting the world's price for our cattle.  To-day we are up against the British tariffs.  I am not going to argue now whether that is the fault of the British Government or of the Free State Government, and I am not going to enter into a discussion as to who fired the first shot in the economic war.  But I do say that the sooner the economic war is ended the better it will be for the country.  Let us get back to sanity again.  It is a shame to have things going on as they are. As I was saying, in 1921 we were getting the world's price for our cattle.  We are not getting that to-day.  There is a British tax of £4 or £5 a head on the cattle that we are sending out of the country.  We had no tax like that in 1921.  That is what the present Government have done for us.  They told the people that they would get alternative markets for them, and that the British consumer would pay the tariffs.  They told the people everything but the truth.  It is about time, I think, that the people of this country wakened up, and especially the farmers on the Fianna Fáil Benches, and asked themselves <Col N="901" /> this question: how long is this kind of thing going to go on?</P>
    <P>In 1931 we had not flying squids going around the country looking after the interests of the farmer.  He was able to pay his way then.  He did pay his way, and was only too happy to do so.  The Government, by their policy, have deprived the farmer of the way of making a living, and they have left the agricultural labourer in a worse position.  He is in the most pitiable position of any man in the world.  He is working long hours and getting bad pay.  He is not too badly off if he is employed by a farmer who is giving him his support; but think of him when he goes home to his wife and family with his 7/- or 8/- or 9/- a week.  The whole thing is ridiculous in a Christian country.</P>

      <P>May I ask Deputy Gibbons a question?  The Deputy congratulated himself and the Government on the fact that the co-operative bacon factory in Waterford and the co-operative bacon factory in Cork are making greater profits now than they ever made before.  Does Deputy Gibbons realise that those two factories between them do not produce much more than 5 per cent. of the total amount of bacon produced in this country, and that the rest of the bacon is produced by privately-owned bacon factories?  Does Deputy Gibbons seriously congratulate himself on this, that the bacon factories of this country are making greater profits to-day than they ever made before in their history, and, if he does, can he tell us at whose expense are they making them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated a fact when I informed the House that the Waterford Co-operative Meat Factory, a farmers' co-operative organisation, made a substantial profit this year. It made some profit last year, and in previous years, during the very long term of its existence, it was working almost entirely at a loss.  That statement was in the form of an interrogatory to Deputy Holohan as to whether the Waterford Co-operative Meat Factory had been doing well.  Since the price of pigs was fixed, pig producers <Col N="902" /> in my area say that they are doing comparatively well, particularly as compared with the position in 1931. These are incontrovertible facts, and Deputy Dillon may inject the word &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; or whatever else he wishes into them.  I have made a statement of fact.  We have had the Deputy's considered attitude towards wheat growing.  We find that his whole attitude, and that of Deputy MacDermot, is one of asking us to look across the water for guidance, etc.  Is it not a remarkable fact that the English Government is subsidising wheat growing, and is carrying on an intensive campaign to increase the area under wheat in that country at what the Deputy would consider an unremunerative price?  But if wheat growing is a bad policy here, it is surely a bad policy there, and yet it is being done there.</P>

      <P>Some Deputy said that this debate had been rather helpful in many ways because it had been carried on on more constructive lines than is usual in the case of such debates.  I think that is true.  As a matter of fact, I think there were very few destructive arguments used by the Opposition that were not answered by other members of the Opposition. Some of the Opposition talked about the inferior quality of the maize mixture. One was Deputy O'Neill, but he was effectively answered by Deputy Gibbons.  Deputy O'Neill started off by saying that he was a Sinn Feiner all his life, that he was always in favour of Irish products, and then proceeded to tell us what an inferior article Irish grain was as compared to foreign grain.  We had the usual assertions from Deputy Dillon.  One was that the farmer is feeding his pigs either on a pure maize meal mixture or pure meal.  He then talked about. the extra cost of 3s.  I pointed out on the Second Realing that any farmer would naturally mix the feed in order to get a balanced ration.  In order to get the cheapest and best value in his ration, he would, of course, have to use a certain quantity of bran and pollard. In fact, to have a balanced <Col N="903" /> ration at all you would have to use a certain quantity of bran.  To get a good balanced ration he would have to use bran and pollard and meat meal.  By using a complete mixture of that kind, in comparison to the mixture that is fed to pigs in England and in Northern Ireland, there would not be a difference of 3s. per cwt.</P>
      <P>Deputy Curran, in order to try and prove that there would be a difference to that amount, talked about maize being worth £4 10s., and said that a maize meal mixture is worth about £7 18s.  I give that as a type of the comparisons we get in debates of this kind.  The price of maize in the port of Dublin, before it leaves the ship, is £4 10s.  As a matter of fact I think it is a bit dearer now, and that the price would be about £4 15s.  There has to be added to that the cost of transporting the maize from the port of Dublin to the mill in Tipperary, and the cost of grinding it before we can know what the actual price of it is.  When all that has been done, the price will surely be a good deal more than £4 15s. before it reaches Deputy Curran.  If a fair comparison were made, I am certain that the difference would not be anything like 3s. per cwt.  I am afraid, no matter what I say or what proofs I give, that the members opposite will stick to their ideas and go on maintaining that there is a huge difference. Therefore, I think I may leave that for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be good enough to say what is his estimate of what the difference would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the difference between the maize meal mixture and pure maize would not, at the outside, be more than 30/- a ton.  If you take the balanced ration for the pig, maize meal, pollard, bran and meat meal, and put them together, as compared with the price in England, the 30/- a ton would be very much reduced, because our bran and pollard, as a result of our milling on a larger scale, are cheaper than they were before the cereal policy and the flour-milling policy were taken up, and our meat <Col N="904" /> meal is also cheaper than in England. On the last occasion on which I took the prices in Liverpool, as published ex-mill in Liverpool, and the price ex-mill in our own returns, the difference would be 15/- a ton for pig feeding, and that is the outside.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon wanted the big reason we have for burdening the community with extra cost in order to induce farmers to grow wheat.  It is part of our protective policy.  I defy Deputy Dillon or anybody else to take charge of the Department of Agriculture and drop protection.  I believe there is not a single thing that our farmers are producing that they could continue to produce if we allowed free imports into this country.  For instance, we have a tariff of 6d. a lb. on mutton and lamb, and, in spite of that, lamb was imported last year for a short period. It shows the extent to which they are able to jump in regard to some tariffs. We have 6d. a lb. on bacon, and the same amount on beef.  I believe if these tarifis were dropped on beef, mutton and bacon, it would be impossible for farmers in this country to exist. In fact, although Deputies opposite are not satisfied&mdash;and I admit I am not satisfied, either&mdash;I believe that the present prices for meat&mdash;I would like to see them higher&mdash;poor as they are in the eyes of Deputies opposite, would be much worse if we allowed free imports of beef, mutton and bacon. Protection is a thing that, whether we like it or not, has to be adopted.  If we adopt it in the case of meat, in principle, at least, I do not see why we should not adopt it in the case of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon that we do not grow as good wheat here as they grow elsewhere.  We do I and a good many people agree that the bread made in a person's own house from home-grown wheat, or a large proportion of it, is much more tasty than the bread made at home from imported wheat.  If that is true in the case of home-made bread, I do not see why it should not also be true in the case of bakers' bread.  We carried out a series of experiments.  We had home-grown wheat milled into flour and bakers' bread was made from that. <Col N="905" /> It was 100 per cent.  Irish-grown wheat. Certain people were asked to report on the flavour and the appearance of the bread.  They reported that the flavour was excellent, and the appearance was not quite as white as would be the case with bread made from imported wheat, but otherwise it was quite attractive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the millers are not putting Irish wheat into baker's flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon alleges that the millers are not putting a grain of Irish wheat into baker's flour. That is not true.  I asked for information on that point some time ago. I have not got the exact percentage with me, but I know that some millers, for a period last year, when the home-grown wheat was coming in in large quantities, milled as high as 50 per cent. of home-grown wheat in their flour for bakers and they got no complaint.  It must be remembered that baker's flour does not usually contain more than 40 per cent. of Manitoba or strong wheat.  It usually contains 60 per cent. of the weak wheats, Pacific, Australian and wheats of that class.  Our wheat can replace these weak wheats quite well and we will have no difficulty, with the varieties of wheat we are now growing, in meeting all household requirements with our own wheat and supplying up to 60 per cent. of baker's flour.  It will not be very noticeable, I hold it will be an improvement. Even if people's tastes differ, there will not be any noticeable change in the flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been experimenting on strong wheats in order that we could, if necessary, later on replace also the 40 per cent. of strong wheats which are at present found in baker's flour. We have grown the Manitoba varieties here with success in certain classes of land.  As time goes on we will get more information and we will get to know better the class of land where these wheats will succeed, the way they have to be tended, the time of sowing, and so on.  After a few years, when we have experimented further, we will have no difficulty in growing these strong wheats in this <Col N="906" /> country.  One difficulty at the moment is that they are more addicted to certain diseases than the varieties we have been growing so far, but where we have a scientific investigation department, a very good department, in the Albert Agricultural College, I do not think we will have any difficulty in getting over that point.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Dillon is right or not in saying that the sack containing 20 stone of flour is 11/- dearer here than in England. There is a Bill coming forward later on and it will be more appropriate then to elicit that information.  So far as home-grown wheat is concerned, it could not possibly make that difference. I think we have not exceeded 25 per cent.&mdash;21½ per cent. is about the percentage this year.  If we take it even at 25, the price of Irish wheat, on the average for a few months back, was about 8/- more than imported wheat.  If we take three barrels of imported wheat and one barrel of Irish and put them together it means that the whole lot is increased by only 2/- a barrel.  You get only 70 or 72 per cent. of flour from wheat and on calculation it will be found that the increase due to the admixture of Irish wheat works out about 3/- a sack at the outside.  That is the increase that can be ascribed to the admixture of Irish wheat.  There is a Bill coming on after this which will deal more intimately with the price of flour and bread.</P>
    <P>I was asked by certain Deputies, when fixing the price for barley and oats, to fix it so as to give the farmer a good return.  Every Deputy realises that it is obvious that, if we fix the price of oats and barley too high, that has to be passed on and the price of the mixture becomes dearer to the consumer than it would otherwise be. That renders it very difficult for the consumer to make any profit on the feeding of pigs or cattle, and might eventually have the result of cutting down the amount of feeding-stuffs used; in that way it would react against the grower.  A certain balance has to be kept in mind when considering this matter, in order to see what would be fair to both the grower and the consumer.  It is not true that, as <Col N="907" /> Deputy Morrissey has said, I am driven to desperation in any way to find a market for grain this year.  We had quite a large amount of grain, as explained by Deputy Minch, because, although our acreage was not very much up, the yield last harvest was far in excess of the average yield.  We had, therefore, far more grain to dispose of than we had expected when a census of the acreage was taken.  That became apparent as soon as the harvest came in and threshing operation commenced, so we had to consider what was going to be done: Eventually we had to increase the percentage of home-grown grain in the maize-meal mixture.  As a result of that increase it will at any rate be practically all absorbed by the end of August, and possibly all absorbed.  There will certainly be no more carried over than there would be in an ordinary year, that is a few tons by each maize-meal miller to carry him into the new season.  As far as that goes, there will be no problem in regard to surplus grain by the end of August before the new crop comes in.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, quite accustomed to statements being made by members of the Opposition that we have destroyed the market for bacon, beef, and so on. The strange thing is that if any Deputy opposite, in the interests of truth, wants to look up the matter and see how much bacon was exported last year, as compared with a six- or seven-year average before we came into power, he will find that, between the increased consumption at home by shutting out foreign bacon, and what we exported, we had a larger output of bacon in 1935 than we had for the average of six or seven years before 1932.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about exports of pigs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking all that into account&mdash;live pigs, pork, bacon and all. I am taking our output.  Our output would mean what we consumed at home and what we exported.  I think 1931 would be higher than 1935 because it was a very high year, but taking the average of five, six or seven years <Col N="908" /> before 1932, it will be found that 1935 was as high or a little bit higher, and this year it appears to be higher still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think 1931 was higher; it was abnormally high.  As the Deputy knows, you have cycles in pig production, and that was the top of a cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true; prices were extremely low at the end of 1931.  The same thing applies to cattle.  If we take the number of cattle that we consumed at home in the ordinary way &mdash;for free beef, tinning, canning and for meat meal &mdash; and the number exported, it will be found that our disposal of cattle also in 1935 was as good as in any four or five years average that might be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister include the slaughtered calves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because they have consumed practically no food.  I am talking about the disposal of grain and so on.  Another thing I might mention is this, that taking the year &mdash;I am referring to the cereal year now because it gives a better idea of the matter&mdash;commencing 1st September last, if we go on milling as we are doing at the moment&mdash;which is not too optimistic, because usually milling increases a bit in July, August and up to September&mdash;the output of the maize mills will be as high in this cereal year as it has been for the last three or four years.  Unfortunately, in that connection, I cannot give a comparison with a pre-Fianna Fáil period, because we have not got the returns.  The allegation is made here that, because of the high price of feeding-stuffs and because of the poor price for cattle and pigs, there were less feeding-stuffs used this year and that that is why we have surplus grain.  That is not true; there has been the same output from the mills this year as for the last three or four years.  I do not think it is true to <Col N="909" /> say that we were able to dispose of our grain before Fianna Fáil came into power.  There was quite a lot of agitation and, as a matter of fact, as a result of that agitation the last Government had to set up a commission to investigate this maize meal mixture scheme and see whether it was advisable or not.  That particular commission did not favour the scheme, and I am only quoting that because a Government does not set up a commission unless there is some reason for it&mdash;unless there is some agitation amongst farmers showing that they cannot get rid of their grain.  I myself remember attending meetings in the Mansion House and other places about that time&mdash;1929-30 I think it was&mdash;and there were a number of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies at those meetings who were very strong on having something done to get rid of the grain.  Where was the necessity for putting a tariff on oats in 1931 if everything was going splendidly in that year?  Again, I say that a Government&mdash;and above all the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash;would not keep on a tariff unless it was absolutely necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It brought down the price.  There was a very poor price for oats and barley at that time. Since that time the suggestion has been made that we could get rid of oats and barley in the British Market. There is only a small tariff as a result of the economic war, but even if that tariff were gone what would we get? If we take up any of the farming papers which quote those prices it will be seen that week after week for the last 12 months the price of imported feeding barley in England was about 10/6 a barrel and the price of oats would amount to about 5/- per cwt.  That would certainly have been a much worse price for us for oats and barley if we had exported it there.  From the point of view of the grower at any rate he would not have done as well, so that from his <Col N="910" /> point of view the scheme has been a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know what is the price of oats in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at the moment.  I would think it is about 5/- per cwt. Deputy Holohan&mdash;Deputy Gibbons has already dealt with the point&mdash;thought it was necessary to incorporate some home-grown grain in order to have good-quality bacon.  He said 25 per cent. was sufficient for that.  I think perhaps he may be right there.  It was quite sufficient with maize, barley, bran, minerals and all those things that are required, but it is not true to say&mdash;as I think he said&mdash;that if takes longer to fatten a pig on the mixture rather than on pure maize.  We have carried out many experiments on that.  Lest Deputies should think there is any prejudice in the matter I would ask them to look up the reports of the Department of Agriculture for 1929, 1930 and 1931.  They will find there that those experiments which were carried out under the last Government proved that with a certain mixture of oats and barley&mdash;sometimes barley; sometimes oats; sometimes both&mdash;the pigs invariably did as well on the same quantity of feeding with 100 per cent. replacement of maize by barley, and with, as far as I know, 40 per cent. replacement of maize by whole oats.  The pigs fattened on the same quantity, and, therefore, at the same cost.  It is true, as Deputy Gibbons said, that when those pigs were killed and graded in the factories the bacon from the pigs fed on home-grown grain was graded higher in every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn made a suggestion which I am afraid could not possibly be considered&mdash;it is really not a matter for my Department; it is more a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;and that was to grant an extra licence for flour milling in the town of Tralee in order to enable the people there to give better value for maize meal.  It is not true to say that in the dehulling process of oats two-thirds of the grain are lost. <Col N="911" /> About 30 per cent. at the most would be rejected, and perhaps it is not certain that it is altogether lost, because there is a very little feeding value in the hull and if the remaining oats are left it is not right to say that it is reduced by 30 per cent. in value.  It is only a very small percentage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Minch, I think, put it very well.  The whole thing is that it is very hard to get a perfect scheme. Deputies may criticise the scheme, and I do not say that it has no disadvantage. It would be very hard to get any sort of scheme dealing with this problem, or dealing with any other problem in farming or industry, that would not have some disadvantage.  As I say, it is very hard to get a perfect scheme, but if the advantages of the scheme are greater than its disadvantages, that is perhaps as much as we should claim, and I think we should be satisfied if we can establish that much. In any case, however, I should like to know from the Deputies who criticise the scheme what would be their alternative to it?  I understand that their alternative is that we should let this grain be exported, but I want to point out, as I have pointed out before, that the prices would be extremely low in that case and it inevitably would lead, I am afraid, either to people going out of tillage altogether so far as the surplus is concerned at any rate, or lead to a very insistent demand for some sort of bonus or subsidy in order to bring the price of their grain up to a level at which they could continue to carry on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haslett mentioned the question of the export of offals.  I think it is not true that wheat offals were exported last year.  I have power, under legislation, to prohibit the export of offals and that power has been used, I think, for about two years. Some offals were exported about two years ago, but none has been exported since then.  I think this question of the reduction in agricultural labour is on a par with the question of the increase in employment in certain other industries since 1931.  Certain schemes have come in whereby a person must register as unemployed in order to <Col N="912" /> benefit by these schemes, and I think that some of those people, who formerly described themselves as agricultural labourers, have taken themselves off the list of agricultural labourers in order to benefit by the other schemes, because it is true, as Deputies know, that there is an increase in the sale of insurance stamps.  I think that any reasonable person would be convinced, on going into the figures very closely and looking at the thing properly, that there is no reduction at least in the stamping of agricultural labourers' cards.  In fact, I think it would look as if there were an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would ask the Deputy to go into the figures himself, and I am sure that if he approaches the matter with an unbiassed mind and examines the figures closely, he will find that there is not a reduction.  At any rate, agricultural labourers' cards are being stamped all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in the point made by Deputy Victory to the effect that nowadays one man or two men can do more than they could some years ago, owing to the development of machinery.  Deputy Mulcahy, of course, is quite entitled to quote the Bishop of Cork, and the Bishop of Cork is quite entitled to make a political speech, if he wants to do so, but I suggest that it is only a joke when Deputy Mulcahy says that the Bishop was speaking without any political motives.  Deputy Brennan wants the Government to keep its hands off agriculture.  Well, of course, that is really nonsense.  There is no use in going into the implications of that, because every single day, committees of agriculture, county councils, T.D.s, and so on, are coming along and asking me to do something for agriculture, to interfere with agriculture in some way, whether only to get rid of rabbits or something else.  In the same way, on this question of interference, Deputy Dillon and some of the other Deputies appear to adopt a Pontius Pilate attitude, and wash their hands <Col N="913" /> of responsibility in regard to the Pigs and Bacon Bill, and they try to put the blame on me for everything.  However, when that Bill was going through the House, I do not think Deputy Dillon had any objection to it.  I think Deputy Dillon agreed with the whole principle of the Bill, and advocated its passage.  Now, however, of course, when some of his political adherents are complaining, he says, &ldquo;Blame the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, quite satisfied, and I know others who are satisfied. Deputy Finlay says that he never sold malting barley before 1932 for less than 14/6, but the price of such barley was always right. The whole trouble with barley was that the farmer sold a certain amount to the maltster, and that he <Col N="914" /> could not get rid of the remainder. This scheme was brought in in order to deal with a surplus over what was required for malting.  There was never any trouble about the barley required for malting, but there was a surplus to get rid of.  Now, I do not mind talking about the economic war at all, but there is no use in thinking that, if the economic war were ended, this grain question would be ended.  It has practically nothing to do with the economic war.  If the 10 per cent., or whatever it is, on oats and barley going into England were removed, it would not solve our problem in the least in regard to oats or barley, or even wheat.  Some Deputy says that the housekeeper goes in to buy bacon, and that, when she sees the price, she goes home.</P>
      <P>Well, as far as I have been watching the allocations for home killing since the board was set up, there is no decrease in home consumption of bacon.  It is a pity that Deputy Keating found it necessary to go away, because one would imagine from him that everything was going splendidly with agriculture up to 1931, and I was anxious to remind him that he and I spoke from the same platform in 1927 at a place called Ballycullane.  We were not members of the same political Party, but we were friends and we used the same platform.</P>

      <P>Section 9 seems to go further than the sections in the original Act.  The section provides that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, notwithstanding anything contained in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933 to 1935, in his absolute discretion refuse an application for registration in any register kept by him under the said Acts, whether such application is an original application or is made in respect of additional premises or is made by a person whose registration has previously been cancelled by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely, heretofore, the Minister has had to assign some reason for rejecting the application?</P>

    <Col N="917" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he will still have to assign a reason.  The section amends the existing position in this way.  In the original Act there was a qualification put in that the Minister could in the public interest, having regard to the number of mills in an area, and so on, refuse an application.  That, in effect, confined the Minister to one reason.  He could only refuse registration if there was sufficient capacity for milling already there.  He could not refuse an application on the grounds that the person had been removed from another register, had been unsatisfactory about making returns under another register or had given a good deal of trouble in other ways.  It is to cover that kind of case that this section is being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the House think that if a person, in the opinion of the Minister&mdash;and I am not referring particularly to the present Minister, but to any Minister who must be a politician with certain political views&mdash; is a generally unsatisfactory person, he is to be denied the right to earn a living in this country?  Let me put it this way: The Minister would consider me to be a highly unsatisfactory person because if I were operating any commercial enterprise under the terms of one of his several Bills, I would be continually &ldquo;bucking&rdquo; against the restrictions contained in these Bills, which I thought to be unfair.  I would be claiming the letter of the law, and I would be in constant conflict with his Department.  The Minister would be, perhaps, interpreting a thing loosely in order to get the job done.  I would be taking the view that the restrictions ought not to be there at all, but that I was obliged to obey the law, and while I was prepared to obey the law, I would do nothing but what the strict letter of the law compelled me to do. Similarly, I would take nothing less than that to which I was entitled under the strict letter of the law.  I can well imagine a Minister anxious to put through whatever he felt to be for the good of the country, saying, &ldquo;This man is a confirmed nuisance. This Bill has to be amended again, because of his attitude.&rdquo;  I submit <Col N="918" /> that I have the right to do that.  If I feel that the Government is acting imprudently, while I am absolutely bound to comply with the law if I am a citizen of the country, I am entitled to stand on my rights and I will not be any more obedient to the law than the letter of the law demands.  Why, in these circumstances, should we give the Minister a right to penalise me for claiming nothing more than my strict legal rights?</P>
      <P>The Minister very ingenuously says: &ldquo;The fact is I want these powers to put a troublesome person in his place.&rdquo; Does the Minister think that this is a power he should have?  Let us suppose that a member of my Party held a Ministerial post, that the Minister was in Opposition, felt that a grave injustice was being done to a legitimate interest in this country and constituted himself the champion of that interest, and said: &ldquo;I will go into this business with all the peculiar knowledge I possess as a member of Parliament and with all my experience as an ex-Minister I will test out every section of this oppressive measure in order to secure for citizens all the liberties that are left to them.&rdquo;  The member of my Party, who is Minister, would say: &ldquo;Dr. Ryan has got very troublesome bringing forward the claims of these persons that we think should not get licences or should not appear on the register.  If we strike them off the register, he will discover some loophole because of his peculiar knowledge acquired while he was a Minister.  These are very troublesome persons, and because they have been troublesome under the milling regulations, we shall not give them milling licences or an Indian meal licence.  In fact, we shall not let their names appear in any register, not because they have done anything wrong, but because they are cantankerous people who claim all their rights.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observe where that is leading.  The Minister for Agriculture controls very few registers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce controls hundreds of registers in regard to licences and there are many people who are continually fighting the Department of Industry and Commerce to get what they believe to be their rights.  There is <Col N="919" /> another class of person who is continually going into the Department, kowtowing to everybody and being a good fellow, trying to get along as best he can, getting whatever he can and playing the ball generally with the Department. If the principle in Section 9 is to be enshrined in our legislation, the unfortunate man who takes up the position of asking for his statutory rights from the Department, asking for nothing more but refusing to take anything less, can be denied all his rights and told that he will not be allowed to do business at all.  I think that is leading not only the present Minister but every man in the public life of this country up an alley.  If that kind of business creeps in, corruption is inevitable.  Unless my relations as a citizen <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Minister as a Minister of State, are strictly defined by law, it means that I am in the Minister's power to a certain extent and I have to try to conciliate him by whatever means I can employ. Therefore, I strenuously object to giving any Minister the right to refuse to allow a man on a register over which he has control on no other ground than that he is an undesirable person in the Minister's opinion. It astonishes me that the Minister for Agriculture does not see himself how wholly undesirable it is to confer such a power upon him.  No matter how conscientiously the Minister may exercise that power himself, how can he rebut the charge, in connection with some individual he has found it necessary to refuse to register, that it was not done from personal spite?  The ordinary person cannot understand the Minister's difficulties. The ordinary man in the street does not know the difficulty of Civil Service administration.  He does not know how easy it is to throw a wrench, or perhaps I should have said to throw sand, into the machinery and make it difficult for that machinery to work smoothly.  The Minister will be compelled to come out and say: &ldquo;I would not allow that person to be put on the register because he is a nuisance.&rdquo;  The man's friends will say: &ldquo;What nuisance was he?&rdquo; And they will say if <Col N="920" /> he was not a member of Fine Gael he would not be so dealt with.  The Minister will be obliged to say that no matter what organisation the person belonged to he would put him off.  If the person was a member of the Minister's Party that person would, I think, have a disposition to play ball with the Minister.  If he was a member of another political Party he would not find it so easy to play ball with the Minister, and trouble and friction would occur.  Surely, in face of these facts it is undesirable to give the Minister absolute discretion to refuse to put a man on the register on the grounds that he is an undesirable person.  I think the Minister would be extremely imprudent in asking for such powers.</P>

      <P>Supposing we had a person registered as a pig dealer who has been guilty of some irregularities under the Act.  Supposing he was removed from the register, and again restored, and again removed, and seeing that he had no chance of continuing as a pig dealer he comes along and asks to be registered as a maize miller, it would be no use arguing that there is more maize available than is required. Would the Deputy say it would be a wise thing, where we had all that trouble, to put this man on the register? It is only a particular type of case that can be covered by this particular section.  The Deputy may be right in what he says that allegations may be made that because a person was a member of the Fine Gael organisation he was not put on the register, and that because another person was a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation he was put on it.  But the strange thing is that I find that persons who get licences are always supposed to be members of the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is so pleasingly ingenuous that I shall not make any comment upon the quality of his supporters.  If this section were to read as from line 29: &ldquo;Whether such application is made by a person whose registration has previously been cancelled by the Minister&rdquo; then I think the case might be met.  But to say: <Col N="921" />&ldquo;Whether such application is an original application or, is made in respect of additional promises, or is made by a person whose registration has previously been cancelled by the Minister&rdquo; is to give the Minister power quite beyond what he ought to have.  If the Minister will agree to look into that, and see whether he might not accept the suggestion with regard to a person whose registration has previously been cancelled, I think a case might be made for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see that.  The matter can be reconsidered.  But there is this also to be remembered that very often after a person's registration is cancelled there is immediately afterwards an application in, from a son or a brother, to be registered.  There it is quite obvious it is the same person who would carry on.  And that type of evasion should be covered also.  If it is possible to cover that by an agreed section this section could be redrafted.</P>

      <P>It was a section dealing with certain undertakings and I explained that on Second Reading. When this legislation started first we undertook to allow one miller to mill home-grown grain for another.  But now that the percentage is high it is not availed of to any great extent. One miller may get another to mill <Col N="922" /> a couple of hundred barrels for him but I do not think it is any hardship upon a miller to mill all his own grain.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the holder of a milling licence has, in pursuance of an Order made under Section 10 of the Amending Act of 1935, purchased and taken into store before the end of any month specified in such Order in any cereal year any home-grown wheat, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such holder before the end of such month disposes (otherwise than by milling) of any home-grown wheat,</P>
      <P>the amount of home-grown wheat purchased and taken into store by him in such month shall, for the purposes of the said Section 10, be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the amount so disposed of by him.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where any home-grown wheat is purchased by the holder of a milling licence, the amount so purchased by him shall, for the purpose of Section 10 of the Amending Act of 1935, be taken to be the actual weight of such home-grown wheat at the time of purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the holder of a milling licence has, under and in accordance with a licence granted under Section 17 of the Amending Act of 1935, sold or disposed of for seed in any cereal year any home-grown wheat purchased by him in such cereal year, the amount of home-grown wheat which such holder is required, in pursuance of Section 6 of the Amending Act of 1935, to mill into wheat in such cereal year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount which he has so sold or disposed of for seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had considerable trouble in the last couple of years with regard to <Col N="923" /> imported Red Marvel.  The sort imported very often turns out not to be Red Marvel.  The farmer sows it as Red Marvel expecting a good crop, but he finds it is not Red Marvel and that it never comes to maturity.  That means a serious loss.  We have tried, in our last amending Act, to get the greatest possible protection by getting a guarantee from the importer, and getting a guarantee right up to the sowing of the seed.  But even so, it is no great advantage to the farmer to be able to take an action afterwards.  He wants his crop.  To get over this difficulty we thought it better to keep back a certain amount of our own Red Marvel seed.  Millers have agreed to keep it over.  If there is sale they will sell it, and if not they will mill it. If it is not possible for them to replace that by home-grown grain this will enable them to replace it by imported grain.  No miller will have unlimited power to do this.  He will get power to import a certain amount, and in this case he would be permitted to replace the particular quantity he required by importing wheat instead of compelling him to replace it by home grown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statements, the difficulty he mentioned in connection with the importation of Red Marvel occurred before.  Wheat, after it had been sold, was discovered not to be Red Marvel but another variety.  Undoubtedly that has occurred.  When the Minister was discussing the question as to how seed wheat might be dealt with to ensure that objectionable things might not occur again, I understood him to say that the millers would be the people concerned.  Possibly the Minister might take into consideration those firms which have, in the past, carried out the Departmental experiments in regard to seed, particularly in connection with barley-growing.  I am sure the Minister is aware that knowledge in connection with the buying of a particular type of grain for seed purposes, whether for barley, oats or wheat, is gained only after long experience.  The grain requires very careful handling. It has got to be dried with the greatest care.  It has got to be cleaned with <Col N="924" /> the greatest of care, and it has to be separately stored with the greatest of care.  Afterwards, it has to be properly treated with anti-smut dressing. Special dressing machines have to be used.  There are firms which, in the past, have proved to the satisfaction of the Department of Agriculture that they have propagated, collected, stored and reissued a particular type of grain until, by their action, they introduced into their areas the best type of grain and, by degrees, got rid of the bad types.  These firms should, in my opinion, be asked to implement the wheat scheme.  Their experience and their storage are available. They can do very selective buying from individual farmers.  They can guarantee the buying and they can do this work under the Department, as they have always done it, so far as. barley and oats are concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Glasnevin farm is at present experimenting as to the type of wheat which would be best suited for this country.  It will take some years before sufficiently large crops of that seed can be raised to supply the demand.  Those who have been in the seed line for a long time and who know the job should be asked to co-operate.  They should be given the same opportunities as the millers. My view about the millers is&mdash;I have never hesitated to express it &mdash; that they have no experience whatever of seed wheat.  It seemed to me that the millers should, possibly, have taken up sooner the question of seed wheat.  If they had done so and if they had taken an interest in wheat growing, not from the time the wheat leaves the factory but from the time it goes into the ground and exercised the same supervision that the maltsters have done with regard to barley, the trouble which arose about seed wheat last year and the year before would not have been of such dimensions. Therefore, I ask the Minister to give power to those firms who have been handling the seed interests of the farmers in the past to go into this scheme, so that they can play the same part that they have been heretofore playing in the grain-growing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make another <Col N="925" /> suggestion.  If the millers are to be allowed to sell part of their wheat for seed and to use foreign wheat to replace it, two questions arise for consideration. One is, that there should be no avoidance of the law, and the second is that the seed wheat sold to farmers by millers should be sold in the form which will be most desirable from the community point of view.  One naturally apprehends that if millers are reluctant to use Irish wheat and find it easier to handle foreign wheat, there will be a considerable temptation upon them to avail of Section 9, so far as they can.  In addition, we have to bear in mind that smut is a very great menace to the wheat crop in this country, as it is to the wheat crop elsewhere. Smut can be effectively guarded against if seed wheat is properly dressed with disease preventive.  If the millers and the grain dealers to whom Deputy Minch referred are to co-operate with the Minister in getting this spring seed wheat for farmers, I suggest that, in view of the fact that they are to be allowed to sell this wheat only for seed purposes and that it is very clearly understood that if they sell it for any other purpose they break the law, they should be directed, when preparing it for sale, to give it a dressing of ceresan or such other preparation as will render it immune from smut before it is sold to the farmer or retailed to the distributor.  Admittedly that makes it a dangerous commodity if anybody attempted to grind it either for animal food or for household flour. I suggest that the container in which it is supplied should be clearly endorsed with a statement that that wheat is no longer fit for human consumption having been treated with a poisonous preparation designed to protect the seed in the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the very closest attention is now being given to this matter whether the seed has been dressed with curvasine or with ceresan.  All the firms dealing in seed wheat pay the very closest attention to this matter, so that, as far as this is concerned, I can assure Deputy Dillon that there is not the slightest fear of any seed wheat that has been dressed with this poisonous matter being sent out for either human or animal consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; as this very desirable practice is already being pursued by seed merchants and those people who supply seed wheat, then it is clear that if millers are going into the wheat seed business they should be put under a statutory obligation to give to the farmers the seed wheat in as good condition as the seed merchants are giving it at present.  I detest monopolies and I detest any system which gives any one section. of the community a preference as against the rest of the community.  I detest more especially that that should be done by the laws of this House. Here we are concerned with getting the best possible seed into the hands of the farmers.  I suggest to the Minister that a way might be found out of this difficulty.  Suppose the millers were authorised to send this seed wheat out to authorised seed dealers and allow them to do the seed business with the farmers, would not that give an assurance that none of the wheat was disposed of for any other purpose than for seed, and would there not be a further assurance that when the seed reached the farmer through the authorised seed dealer it would have passed through the hands of an experienced seed distributor who would not allow it to get into the hands of the farmers until it was properly graded, dressed and treated in every way with a view to producing the best crop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one final remark I have to make in connection with Deputy Dillon's useful contribution to this matter.  It has been the <Col N="927" /> practice of firms who deal in seed to make a very careful selection in the buying of the grain which they are going to put aside for the purpose of selling afterwards as seed to the farmers.  In addition, they make germinating tests, and I am quite satisfied that in this business the one essential thing to aim at is that when you come around to the spring-time or to the winter sowing period, those merchants who deal direct with the farmers have that seed ready in sacks. They know the quantity available and they can guarantee to the farmers that they give them delivery.  They help the farmer to budget for his winter or spring sowing of corn, as the case may be.  From that it will be seen that it is possible for those who have their stores and premises distributed around the country to have the seed available in a particular district and ready for delivery to the farmers, properly dressed and with all the germinating tests that have been made.  That being the case, the farmer can make arrangements for the sowing of his winter or spring wheat or barley or any other grain crop which he is interested in sowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a scheme that the millers are prepared to adopt.  It is entirely voluntary, and this amendment is put in in order to relieve them of the danger of the seed not being available when needed.  It is only as a reserve that the millers are holding a certain amount of wheat.  It will be a very economic scheme, for if they can replace it by imported wheat it will save so much to them.  Now I come to deal with Deputy Dillon's point, in the matter of the licence which was issued under Section 17 of the amending Act of 1935.  I think that has been covered already.  I think in practice most of this seed will go to the seed merchants. I do not think the millers will go in for selling seed to the farmers to any great extent, but I do not suppose they will refuse the farmers who are living near them.  With regard to Deputy Minch's point, there is nothing at all to prevent other firms going into the wheat scheme.  In the case of the miller this is necessary, because he has <Col N="928" /> to take a certain percentage, but the wheat dealer or seed merchant is quite free to go into the business and no difficulty will be raised.</P>

      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the amending Act of 1935 is hereby amended in the following respects and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion of the words &ldquo;in respect of any month in a cereal year&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;has become liable&rdquo; now contained in the said sub-section, and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion at the end of the said sub-section of the words &ldquo;or, in case the quota for the mill to which such licence relates for such cereal year does not exceed ten thousand barrels, any part of such liability&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with a different matter.  It concerns the case of the small millers who are &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; millers and licensed millers.  They take in a certain amount of wheat to mill and also buy a certain quantity of wheat for sale. As the law stands they would be compelled under their licences to purchase 25 per cent. or whatever it might be <Col N="929" /> of home-grown wheat.  This enables them to take the amount that they mill on commission as having been purchased and deduct it; it relieves them from the obligation of having to purchase a large amount of home-grown wheat.  I think these small millers are at a disadvantage as compared with the ordinary licensed miller and this amendment is to put them on a level with the licensed miller.</P>

He can take each month the amount he mills on commission into account and that gives him a chance of carrying on against the bigger miller.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be convenient for the House, in order to avoid repetition, to take Sections 15, 16 and 17 together as they all hang together.  It is difficult to discuss any one in the absence of the others.  This section is introducing an entirely new principle in legislation.  It has been laid down by the courts on several occasions that the courts will not amend any contract made between two individuals.  All the courts are prepared to do, if a written instrument is produced, is to read it and to interpret its meaning.  They are not prepared to go into it bodily and alter the direction of it in order to convenience anybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Equity has gone a little further and has, in certain cases, varied the terms of a contract where it believed it was just to do so.  But a statute now proposes to go a step further and, where there is no contract at all, or where there is no relation between two parties, the Minister is prepared to step in between them and declare a contract between them, and himself to write the terms of the contract; then to hold that the contract is binding and, I think, not only to give the usual remedies in a contract to either of the parties which he has joined together, but to make it a statutory offence not to carry out the terms of the contract which the Minister has written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can answer by saying: &ldquo;The situation is that I require people to use a certain quantity of home-grown wheat.  The total quantity of home-grown wheat is not so very great, and it would be possible for one individual to corner the whole lot; and where I am putting a statutory obligation on one individual to buy a certain quantity within a given time, I must protect him from having <Col N="932" /> the whole market cornered against him.&rdquo;  I admit that there is force in that reply, but I notice that when we come to this part of the Bill another figure has slipped into the House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has arrived.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is notoriously a State socialist.  He believes in State socialism.  He believes that he ought to nationalise anything that the public will permit him to nationalise.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill ultimately means the nationalisation of the flour industry here.  If you are going to tell a miller what he is to mill, when he is to mill, what he is to buy, when he is to buy, how he is to buy, from whom he is to buy, and at what price he is to buy; and go on to say, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to go on to say at what price he will sell, how he will sell, to whom he will sell, what he will sell, and when he will sell, the difference between that and nationalisation is so narrow that I am becoming unable to see it.  As the difference narrows, the smile on the countenance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce becomes broader and broader. Do we stand for State socialism in this country?  Deputy Mrs. Concannon is a profound thinker in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is a description I would apply, to very few members of that Party.  Does she stand for State socialism, or does she not?  Does she believe it is good to nationalise all the essential industries in this country?  Bearing in mind that land is the greatest industry of all, does she think State socialism should go so far as to nationalise that as well?  The members of the Labour Party are socialists.  They believe in socialism.  They cheerfully proclaim that they are socialists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to any policy which is leading rapidly to the point where the State is going to run everything in this country; where the State, in order to do what the Minister alleges it is his intention to do by statute, will have to take over the mills and operate them; where the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have to take over the railways; where, eventually, the Minister for Lands, who will then probably be Deputy Aiken, will take over the land of the country, on the ground that it is not being used in accordance with Government policy.  The Minister takes upon himself to go in and order a miller to enter into a contract with a man that the miller has never heard of, and, having ordered him to enter into the contract, he goes on to say: &ldquo;I am going to write the contract; you are going to enter into this contract, to execute the contract on a certain date, on certain terms.&rdquo;  I say that it is running a man's business completely when you have got to that stage.  I say that if, not to meet any extraordinary emergency that suddenly presents itself and requires a desperate and prompt remedy of a temporary character, but in the ordinary course of policy you nationalise the entire flour-milling industry, it is only a matter of time until the same principle forces you to nationalise the transport industry and a number of large enterprises in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are members of the Labour Party who want that, who believe that that would be a good plan. I do not.  I think it is a bad plan.  I do not think that Deputy Mrs. Concannon believes it is a good plan either.  I do not think she is in favour of Socialism, but she is in the alarming position now of having in front of her a Minister who does not know whether it is a good plan or a bad plan.  He says that he does not know where this is leading to, and he does not care. He has no principle in the matter at <Col N="936" /> all.  He is just rambling along, and I am trying to warn him that he is rambling on a trail that has been blazed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who knows well where he is going and wants to get there. He knows that if Deputy Mrs. Concannon begins to suspect where he is going that she will put the brakes on him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has given us a discourse on socialism, but I am sure that he does not take this thing seriously.  He quoted the difficulty that may arise of one person cornering a considerable portion of wheat, holding on to it and then saying &ldquo;I know you must take my wheat from me and I am going to hold on to it until you give me £2 or £2 10s. 0d. a barrel for it.&rdquo;  That, of course, is a position that would have to be dealt with, and I do not see how that is going to lead to State socialism, State control or State ownership.  It is a position that must be dealt with.  In <Col N="937" /> all probability it is one of those matters in connection with which it will be quite sufficient to have the power without exercising it.  If a person attempts to make a corner in that way it is not going to do him any good.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 22, I think I am right in saying that Sections 22, 23, 24 and 25 hang together and are jointly designed to restrict the purchase and sale of maize with a view to rendering more effective the maize meal mixture Orders.  As I understand it, the Minister has found it quite impossible to ascertain whether people have been putting the proper quantity of home-grown cereals into the maize meal mixture because it was difficult to conduct any chemical test with a view to ascertaining whether a certain proportion of home-grown grain had been put in.  I know that in the country certain millers were selling maize meal with not more than 10 or 15 per cent. home-grown cereals in the mixture.  At the time there was an Order in force directing them to put in 50 per cent.  It resulted this way, that one miller's maize meal was yellow, while the other miller, complying with the Minister's Order, was selling something indistinguishable from pollard. I can find no good reason for opposing any proposals which will ensure due observance of the law by everybody, but I would like to hear from the Minister if he has any purpose in mind further to restrict imports of maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is merely to ensure compliance with the law.  It is difficult, as the Deputy says, to ascertain the percentage by chemical or microscopic means, although I think an expert would be able to say, perhaps, that there was not definitely 50 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to prove it, but suspicions would be aroused.  We have to go to the miller's books in order to prove the case and it is an additional safeguard in examining the books that he had a licence to purchase so much maize.  There is no intention of interfering with a miller's legitimate business under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I should like to direct the attention of Deputy Mrs. Concannon to where she is being led. The Minister is now going to get power to licence so much stuff going into a mill.  He has power to examine how much of that commodity there is in the mill and he has power to licence how much of that stuff will come out of the mill.  Can Deputy Mrs. Concannon see much difference between that and the Minister going to the proprietor of the mill and saying: &ldquo;I will give you a salary of so much per annum to do such and such a thing&rdquo;? The difference is very narrow between the position in which you will leave the miller an independent person, doing everything he has to do in the ordinary course of his business, and the position in which you will say: &ldquo;I am going to take over the mill and make you the mill manager and you will carry out my instructions.&rdquo;  I invite Deputy Mrs. Concannon to brood on that question.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister just how is it there can be such a difference at present between the price asked by millers for pure maize meal in 1 lb. packets?  In the course of the last week I received two quotations from two millers operating within a comparatively short distance of each other.  One quoted 10/6 a cwt. for pure maize meal in 1 lb. packets and the other 17/-.  How can there be that difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say is that perhaps the second person was not keen on the business.  The 10/6 was perhaps a fair price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has made this regulation, I find myself forced into the position of suggesting that the situation <Col N="941" /> tion the Minister himself has created requires further interference by the Minister.  Certain people in this country are ordered by their physicians to get maize meal to make maize-meal porridge. It is a food I do not care for, and I do not know whether the Minister himself likes it or not, but there are people who do like it, and who are recommended by their physicians to take it regularly.  The Minister forbids the sale of pure maize meal in anything but 1 lb. packets. Surely he ought to forbid the millers from consistently quoting a price which makes it impossible to buy it. If the maize miller is too lazy to prepare this commodity in 1 lb. packets he can adopt the subterfuge of quoting a prohibitive price and saying: &ldquo;Well, if you do not want it at that price I do not want to sell it.&rdquo;  A situation might arise in which all the maize millers in my district would quote a prohibitive price, and if I wanted maize meal in 1 lb. packets I would have to buy it in Dublin, and pay the freight down to Ballaghaderreen.  That, surely, is an abuse.  Can the Minister see any way out of that dilemma?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you make the terms under which a man may sell pure maize meal so onerous that the sale of that commodity becomes unattractive to the vast majority of persons handling maize meal, and if you then go on to say: &ldquo;You may not bring in maize meal unless you are a licensed maize miller,&rdquo; you may create a situation in which it will be impossible to get pure maize meal at all.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section raises a new difficulty.  Section 27 confers on the Minister the right to order a miller to use oats, either in the form of crushed oats or in the form of groats.  A great many millers in this country, when this maize meal mixture scheme first came into force, started using crushed oats. They found that the majority of their customers strenuously objected because the hull of oats in maize meal is extremely unsightly; the customers did not like it.  The tendency was, therefore, for the trade to go over entirely to barley maize meal mixture, where this unsightly hull does not appear.  To <Col N="943" /> meet that difficulty, as I understand it, the Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;Well, where I prescribe 50 per cent. home-grown cereal content, the millers may use one-third less of de-hulled oats,&rdquo; and he pointed out that it would fit in with his plan better if the millers would try to use about equal quantities of oats and barley so that the two crops would move into consumption at approximately the same rate.  To meet the Minister, a number of millers put in elaborate de-hulling machinery, which is pretty costly.  Having put in that machinery, the Minister apparently claims the right to go back on that arrangement and to force them to use crushed oats where he deems it expedient to insist upon it.  What is the object of this new power?  Why does the Minister want to make people use crushed oats instead of groats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this arises more in sections that will come later.  The Deputy is aware that a section will come on later which gives power to prescribe that barley only may be used, or oats only, or a certain percentage of oats and barley. The Deputy on the Second Reading of this Bill pointed out a difficulty that arose during the last two years where we had used up all the oats in the country and barley was left behind; then the price of oatmeal became higher than it otherwise would be if we had used barley first and left oats until afterwards.  In order to get that matter settled it may be necessary at times in certain districts to prescribe the use of say two-thirds barley and one-third oats.  It would be much more convenient at any rate &mdash;if I cannot put it any stronger than that&mdash;if in that case we were to prescribe that the whole oats would be used.  I do not know if I can convince the Deputy that that convenience is sufficient to overcome any objection he might have.  He has already stated that the millers have put in de-hulling plant and gone to considerable trouble and expense, and it would be unfair to them now if we were to ask them to put that, de-hulling plant aside.  When I refer to convenience, of course I mean convenience <Col N="944" /> in seeing that the Act is carried out, and that there is no evasion of putting in the amount of home-grown grain required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I must pass a stricture on the Minister, because this comes of &ldquo;flutherin' &rdquo; about.  This is the fourth Cereal Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But observe that the experience is bought at the expense of the unfortunate miller who has installed the de-hulling plant.  We were told in the early stages of this legislation that everyone was going to work together.  The Minister went out and said, &ldquo;Now, look here, give me a hand.  I want this job done. Buy this de-hulling plant.&rdquo;  The millers very naturally said, &ldquo;It is very expensive.  What is going to happen, supposing something untoward arises and this scheme is not carried out?&rdquo; The Minister said: &ldquo;Now, trust me.  Put in the de-hulling plant; that will help me and you will be all right.&rdquo;  Now comes Section 27, and the de-hulling plant is going to be put on the scrap heap.  I do not think that is sensible; I do not think that is prudent.  I think there is a way out of this problem which would be just as effective if it were worked out.  What we want to avoid is the creation of a famine of oats at the end of a given cereal season, while there is an abundance of barley, because in the months of May, June and July oats becomes a substantial item in human foodstuffs in the form of oatmeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this year the price of oatmeal is being forced up by about £4 or £5 a ton owing to an artificial scarcity that is being created by the Minister allowing oats to be used almost exclusively in the early part of the year, thus creating a famine in oats, while Deputy Minch is grappling with the problem of barley.  Surely some plan could be devised whereby barley would be used exclusively for the first quarter of the year and that then oats and barley might be used at the discretion of the miller.  I see immediately that there is a difficulty there, because, of course, the moment you do <Col N="945" /> that the oat-grower says: &ldquo;Why should you put the barley-grower in a preferential position in regard to me? Why am I not allowed to get the advantage of the market?  If I am left alone I shall get a better price in the back-end than I would otherwise get.&rdquo;  If we force everybody to use barley, that will have its effect on the price of oats in the back-end.  Of course, I believe that we are reaching the stage where we are going to go into every farmer's house and tell him what he is to plant, how to plant it, how to reap it, and what to do with it. If you once begin to slide down the slippery slope of universal regulation, I warn you that you will come to the time when you will have to regulate everything, and if that time comes, of course, you will have to run everything yourself.  I feel that the Minister's scheme is a bad scheme.  I should like to ask him did he consult the millers who put in the de-hulling plants before he introduced this scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the millers have not objected to it.  They have spoken to me in regard to certain other provisions of this Bill, but not with regard to this particular one.</P>

      <P>Well, then, this seems to be merely supererogation.  There is this about it.  The Minister might prescribe a limit for the fibre content.  A miller, acting perfectly <i>bona fide,</i> by <Col N="948" /> grinding a certain variety of oats may get from that variety an undue proportion of fibre.  It would be a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> transaction, but yet the Minister might prosecute him and convict him for having an excessive quantity of fibre in the oats.  Now, suppose the Minister tries to prescribe, he will have to find out from his experts what variety of oats carries the heaviest fibre content.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I dealt with this, as I regard it as one of the major provisions of the Bill.  I explained that for the last two or three years we had to make a voluntary arrangement with dealers to buy oats and barley at a certain price, by guaranteeing that whatever they would have left on hands would be bought back at a price at the end of June.  The merchants were allowed sufficient to cover storage, capital and other charges but were not given any profit.  In effect, what that did was to give an opportunity to make a profit if things turned out well, and they were guaranteed against loss if things turned out badly.  It would be better that the Minister should have the profit as well as the loss, and it is on that account that this section is inserted in the Bill. I do not say that the Minister would ever go out and buy all the oats and barley in the market, but it is quite possible that he might have to go to certain districts and buy, in order to get some competition going.  In that way, by going into the business in a small way, he might do a considerable amount of good by getting other buyers to come out and pay the fixed price, whatever it might be.</P>

Very shortly the Minister will tell Deputy Minch and other grain merchants that their room will be more welcome than their company, and that he will be able to do the whole job himself.  From one point of view, he may be able to do the whole job, and in the old days we used to describe that as State Socialism.  Is it State Socialism?  Do Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party think it right for the Minister to take over the grain <Col N="950" /> trade and operate it?  Do Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party realise that in eliminating all the legitimate grain traders, a day will come which the farmers of this country will have to depend on the Department of Agriculture to provide them with the only market they have for their grain, and when that day comes what form of organisation can it be best described as?  If there is no one to buy grain except the Government, will anyone charge me with crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; if I call that State Socialism?

      <P>Throughout the Bill the word &ldquo;flour&rdquo; is used without reference to wheat, and it is considered desirable to have this definition of &ldquo;flour&rdquo; in order to make it clear that the flour referred to has been obtained wholly or mainly from wheat.  It is purely a matter of definition.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Neill I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After line 13 to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act &ldquo;bread&rdquo; shall be deemed to be of two kinds (a) plain or batch bread and (b) fancy bread;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;plain bread&rdquo; or &ldquo;batch bread&rdquo; means the baked product of wheaten flour or meal, with the elementary ingredients of water, salt, yeast and not baked in a tin or container;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;fancy bread&rdquo; means bread containing other added ingredients such as fats, malt, milk, fruit, spice or sugar and baked in tins or containers;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a loaf of bread&rdquo; means an integral portion of bread weighing not less than two pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object is to have discussion and some enlightenment from the Minister. Really the amendment is relevant to a later section that Deputy O'Neill proposes <Col N="952" /> to add about a certain further definition, that bread shall be of two types, either plain or fancy, and a definition of these types.  The definition as given will have to be the subject of some modification as it is limited in a particular way by the use of the phrase &ldquo;baked in tins or containers.&rdquo; The purpose of the amendment is really to be seen by reference to amendment No. 3.  In the Bill as it stands the Minister takes power, whenever he thinks fit by order which is to be referred to as a bread (price) order, to fix the maximum price of bread of a specified kind, which has this definition for the Minister's use, &ldquo;defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister shall think proper.&rdquo;  That means that when making a price order he can make it vary according to the list of things set out and, in addition, whatever else enters into his head. Deputy O'Neill proposes to remove that.  If there is to be any distinction between a maximum price order it shall have reference only to classification between plain bread and fancy bread, instead of having the multitudinous things that the Minister might put in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is better to leave the Bill as it stands.  It is not necessary to have the first part of this amendment, which states that bread shall be plain or fancy bread because bread can be defined under the provisions of Section 3 (2).  We gave consideration to the desirability of having in the Bill a definition of plain bread and fancy bread, as is now proposed by Deputy O'Neill's amendment, but it was decided, from the point of view of securing the effectiveness of the measure, and good administration generally, that it was better not to insert that definition in the Bill, but to take power to define the particular class of bread to which any order made would relate.  I am disposed to maintain that position, because the Bill has been framed on that basis, and to attempt the change which Deputy O'Neill suggests would require an alteration of the whole framework and, in addition, we feel would prove a matter of administrative difficulty. In relation to this Bill it is necessary <Col N="953" /> to bear in mind that we have already come up against considerable legal difficulties in giving effect to the report of the Prices Commission.  Despite the fairly wide provisions of the Control of Prices Act it became impossible to control the price of bread under that Act, and it is in relation to these matters that difficulties arose, and in a very special way on matters of definition. If we were to put into the Bill what purported to be clear-cut definitions of plain bread and fancy bread, it might be found subsequently that these definitions could be avoided, or orders made under the Bill rendered inoperative, in consequence of some failure to link up these orders with the definitions, or to relate them to the particular class of bread which would be considered as coming within the scope of the definitions.  It was considered a better arrangement, from the point of view of drafting the measure, as well as of administering it when it becomes an Act, that each Order should have within it a definition of the class of bread to which it relates. I, therefore, think no difficulty would arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the definition of classes of bread, to get back to the basic position of the matter, we have been discussing a Bill regarding bread prices, but nobody has been able to define what bread is.  We are talking about something the definition of which is not known.  The Minister will recollect that in some prosecutions under the Bread Act of 1838, a lot of trouble arose over the definition of what was bread.  That Act rightly said that all bread should be sold by weight, except fancy bread and French rolls, but it never defined what bread was or what fancy bread or French rolls were.  My idea in furnishing a definition is to avoid similar trouble in future.  I am with the Minister in saying that, as far as possible, people who are buying bread should know what they are going to get.  With regard to the classification, the object of this Act and the Minister's primary idea, were to see that the public got bread at a fair price.  The object of the Prices Commission was to see that the public got what constituted good <Col N="954" /> wholesome bread at a fair price commensurate with the cost of materials and the cost of production.  I want if possible to define what bread is, and let the Minister confine his legislation altogether to bread.  What I consider as bread is a product made up of the elementary ingredients of flour, water, salt and yeast.  I am quite prepared to fall in with the Minister's idea that in legislating for a matter of this kind we ought to confine ourselves to bread, and it is to help the Minister that I have put forward this definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to avoid that by having no definition in the Bill, and by fixing the price in an Order which prescribes the type of bread to which it relates.  We would then have the position that if that description should prove to be incomplete or ineffective, it could be remedied by new legislation.  You get precisely the same result by the procedure in the Bill which sets out that the Minister shall make an Order fixing the price, and in that Order shall state the class of bread to which it relates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to have.  I have been trying to find a definition of bread, and I have discussed this matter with several people well up in the law.  I have found that there was no actual definition of bread in previous legislation.  The most elementary definition I could find was that bread was a product made from corn, but that definition <Col N="955" /> would include stirabout and rice pudding.  I would ask the Minister to define the class of bread and to confine his operations under the Act to nothing else but bread.  The Minister may say that there is no necessity to define bread any more than there is to define water.  Perhaps not, but bread is something that is manufactured and sold. Water is not manufactured and sold, though bread, like water, is an elementary necessary of life.  I would ask the Minister to confine himself to legislating for bread, and let the fancy bread take care of itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are taking power to define the kind of bread for which a price is fixed, but not what bread is.  Let me put this to the Minister.  So far as the Minister's Orders with regard to price may have widespread effect, he has got in a number of provisions that ensure that.  He may make even conditions in regard to the element of price relating them to where the bread is sold, whether it is sold at the place where it is got out, at the bakery, or some other place. He can make a variety of conditions regarding the maximum price in, relation to different types of bread, in areas, and in relation to variations dependent upon the price of flour. But the Minister seems to think that he is going to be handicapped if he has got to say somewhere or other what bread is or what it is not.  If it is possible to add something to the ordinary ingredients named in the definition, then bread to which that addition is made is taken out of the category to which the Order applies. What he is entitled to do is to fix the price at which bread of a specified kind is to be sold.  If by adding something <Col N="956" /> doubt may be cast on whether the article sold is in the category of bread or not, by putting that something in, you take that article out of the control of this measure altogether. Very good.  Deputy O'Neill puts forward this definition, which I think is closing in on the problem.  There are going to be two types of bread.  You can limit one and say that everything else is over the top.  Deputy O'Neill defines plain bread or batch bread as the baked product of wheaten flour or meal with the elementary ingredients of water, salt, yeast, and not baked in a container.  I am not sure about that last phrase, but let that pass.  Fancy bread is defined as bread containing other added ingredients. If you have a definition of that type, it is very hard to say that something which is usually called bread can no longer be called bread because there is something which is not ordinarily found in bread added to it.  I do not know the Minister's difficulty in this.  So far as his statement indicated it, he suggested that there may be something added to ordinary bread, and then the whole measure fails because that bread contains something which was not in the definition. All apparently he can do is to define the kinds of bread to which an Order relates, and if bread does not come within these categories it escapes.</P>

      <P>I am still very insistent on this amendment, because I am acquainted with this business.  I am surprised the Minister did not retort on me and ask me when did bread cease to be fancy bread and come into the region of cake.  There was a very important case decided here some years ago when bread control was in force during the war years, and it was then proved that any baked product in which flour was the chief ingredient and to which there was added any sweetening matter in the form of sugar, or other sweetening substance, came into the region of cake.  I want to insist and to impress upon the Minister that if he wants to make this <Col N="957" /> Bill a success he must begin with an elementary definition of bread and confine it to bread and not mind about different kinds of bread and shapes of bread.  The more elementary he can make his order the better.  I am now talking of the main principle, which is the control of prices and the giving to the people of a sound loaf at the lowest possible price.</P>

      <P>Let me confine myself to some definition.  If the Minister confines himself to the dictionary definition he will find himself at sea. The dictionary says ordinary bread which might mean currant bread or corned bread or stirabout.  I think the Minister would be well advised to take an ordinary elementary definition. Bread is a very elementary article made from flour with ingredients of water, salt and yeast.  That is bread.  The Minister has shown a great deal of bravery by attacking this question at all.  The last Act passed in relation to bread was in 1838.  There has been nothing done since.  The Minister is aware there were a lot of abuses in the bread trade because of this want of definition. If there was a little more definition, of an elementary character, the matter would become clear and the Minister will find that everyone wants to work in with him.  He should stick to an elementary, clear, fundamental definition.  That would be the proper course to take.</P>

      <P>That is what I object to.  Since the Act of 1838 we have gone on for nearly 100 years. Two commissions were set up here but not a single individual came before them to say that there was any abuse.  For over 100 years people have been content with the Act as it stood.  Some seem to think it failed, and two commissions were set up; yet as I said they could not get a single consumer to come before them and say that anything was wrong.  Here now we have a Bill with a definite purpose and the Minister takes power under it to define bread in a manner in which he could bring in things that are not bread at all.</P>

You are going to define prices, and the maximum prices that are to be charged in relation to bread. You may have an Order in operation as to where bread is to be sold; the price of flour and any number of things are set out, but nothing in relation to what bread is.  Let us know what it is. Let us know what is what we call in the Free State plain bread.

      <P>I have been at it for 40 years, and I want you to avail of my experience.  I think it is even more important to define &ldquo;loaf&rdquo; than to define &ldquo;bread.&rdquo;  I am not going to exclude the small loaf or 1-lb. loaf.  I want to go back to what the Minister and his advisers are aiming at&mdash;that is, that the public should get in all cases what they want.  When a man asks for a loaf of bread from a vanman or in a shop, it is generally accepted that he wants 2 lbs. of bread.  This definition would ensure that where a person sells a loaf he sells an integral portion of bread weighing 2 lbs.  That is intended to avoid some of the tricks the Minister alluded to a little while ago.  The Minister is aware that under the old Acts a person could go into a shop and ask for a loaf of bread.  If it were a plain loaf it should, under the Act of 1838, weigh 2 lbs.  If there were a suspicion that the loaf did not weigh that amount, the shopkeeper could put it on the scales, and if the weight were short he could cut a chunk off another loaf and put it into the scales to make up the weight.  That is capable of great abuse, because nobody buying bread is going to ask to have it weighed.  I want to have it settled that when a person sells a loaf of bread, whether in a shop or from a van in the street, the person purchasing it will get 2 lbs. of bread.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment that gives the Minister power whether he uses it or not to fix the price after consultation with four representatives nominated by the Irish Association of Master Bakers.  The Minister may say the <Col N="968" /> millers' representatives are a statutory body.  I think that in the working of his orders he should have an understanding with the people concerned. That would be the usual thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister consults the Flour Millers' Association he does not do it for the purpose of determining what should be the proper price of flour.  When the Minister comes to fix the price of bread he is carrying out a different function altogether.  If you put on him the obligation to consult with the Master Bakers before fixing the price of bread then in effect you are putting on him an obligation to carry out a new investigation.  We have set up a Prices Commission.  They have heard evidence and they have given their opinion as to the prices of bread and, in consequence of their report that an excessive price had been charged in particular areas, this Bill is being brought forward.  In operating the Bill we mean to take their report and recommendations as our basis and not before making our order to carry out a new investigation covering which they have already covered.  If provision were put in the Bill whereby the price of bread would be again investigated in relation to any change in the circumstances that might alter the Prices Commission's findings.</P>
      <P>It is the Prices Commission that will be investigating this matter and not the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He will act upon the conclusions of the Prices Commission. They will send their report to him. This report will have regard only to the prices prevailing for bread throughout the country.  Therefore, although the Minister would be available at any time to consider representations made to him by the Master Bakers' Association, he should not be under a statutory obligation to consult them, because, if so, that would mean that he would have to investigate the Prices Commission's report and carry out a new investigation himself.</P>

      <P>The millers are a statutorily defined body, and the Minister is going to approach them, not only about what the price of flour should be, but what it is.  I think he should be bound by statute to do so.  Bread is related to the price of flour, but flour enters into the price of bread to less than 50 per cent. of the cost.  There are other matters that enter into the production costs to a greater extent than 50 per cent., and these matters vary in different areas.  That is the reason why I ask the Minister to take cognisance of the particular costs in these areas.</P>

      <P>I want to protest in connection with this measure at the idea that bakers are a frightful lot of unscrupulous and unconscionable profiteers, and that the flour millers are not, because they are protecting a great industry and carrying out a great cereal policy.  The bakery industry is a much more important industry than the flour industry, and there are nearly twice as many people employed in it.  The bakers have no say with regard to the price or the quality of flour that they buy.  They are restricted in their market.  They must buy flour in their own area, and buy it at any price the miller likes to charge. because there is no competition.  When this Bill was being brought in the Irish Press came out with a shout about bread profiteers before there was any investigation.  Anyone who looks at the prices will see that the bakers are not charging unreasonable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork was aimed at especially as a terrible place, while Dublin was said to be a grand place&mdash; they were doing what the Prices Commission wanted.  At that time there was bread being sold in Dublin at more than 2d. per pair above the Cork price, and there was no talk about it, and they were producing a low price bread to put dust in the eyes of the Prices Commission.  The Minister should consult with some of the representatives of the bakery trade with regard to this matter.  I want to deprecate any antagonism between the trade and the Minister.  It would be better for them to work together.  Both the <Col N="971" /> Minister and the bakery trade seem to be in the hands of the millers.</P>

      <P>It would, I think, be quite reasonable to expect whoever is Minister for Industry and Commerce to give consideration to whatever representations are made to him by bakers in one form or another, but I think it would be a mistake to put upon him that statutory obligation to consult, because I think that would, in fact, come to mean an obligation to carry out personally, or through his own officers, an investigation which has been already conducted by the Prices Commission.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that the Prices Commission at the time they made the Order, which is the basis of this legislation, in August, 1935, had investigated the price of bread all over the country and they found that different conditions prevailed as regards costings and the production of bread.  Still they wanted to make an Order applicable to the whole country, irrespective of districts. That shows the foolish things the Prices Commission are likely to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I know for a fact that it was not, because they fixed the same price for places other than Cork, and Cork makes the best bread in the world.  It is bread that costs the most to produce, and costs and wages are higher in Cork than in any part of Ireland, Great Britain, or even the world.  Still the Commission took no cognisance of that fact.  They fixed the price for bread made on the smallest little turf oven in Connemara or Kerry on the same level as bread made in Cork, where the highest quality of bread is produced.  The Minister is going to alter that to some extent by fixing prices for different areas, but he says he will not consult the bakers in the different areas, only the Prices Commission.  We have the mentality <Col N="972" /> of the Prices Commission.  They think in a straight line.  It is a good thing to do that sometimes, but they ought to have regard to the circumstances that obtain in various areas where different conditions prevail.  If the Minister is only going to consult the Prices Commission, he ought to try to get some better advice than he got hitherto.  He would find it much easier to deal with some intelligent body like the representatives of the master bakers, whose intelligence is very much higher.</P>

      <P>I should like to get this on to another plane.  In Section 2 the Minister takes power to fix the price of flour.  He binds himself, in the most rigid way, that before making any order under this section with regard to flour he is to consult the Milling Advisory Committee.  He is going to take power to fix the price of flour, and before he fixes the price, or as often as he changes it, he has to consult the Milling Advisory Committee. He is going to fix a maximum price for bread.  It is suggested to him, in a limited way, far too limited in regard to one sub-paragraph, that he should consult with the Association of Master Bakers.  He says: &ldquo;No, it is wrong to put the statutory obligation <Col N="973" /> on me to consult that body.&rdquo;  Why? He has already put upon himself the obligation statutorily to consult the Milling Advisory Committee before he fixes the price for flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me read what the Minister proposes to do.  Section 2 reads: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order under this sub-section fix, for the purposes of this Act, the price of flour for any specified area, and the price so fixed shall, so long as such order remains in force, be, for the purposes of this Act, the standard price of flour for such area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what it means.  The Minister is going to fix the price of flour.  It may be ascertaining and declaring.  But before he fixes, ascertains and declares, or fixes in technical language, before making any order, he has to consult the Milling Advisory Committee.  When we turn to bread, he is going to fix a maximum price for bread.  He is taking power to fix it with regard to bread of specified kinds.  He is going to fix it with a series of variations regarding places, regarding different kinds of bread, and having regard, possibly, to variations in the price of flour.  Deputy O'Neill says, and I think with too much limitation, that before he fixes the price, where that price is to vary according to the price of flour, he should consult the Irish Association of Master Bakers, not get an agreement with, or go into a long investigation with them, not insist on the master bakers going through an investigation that the Minister may think the Prices Commission had better be told to do; not any of these things, but to consult with the Irish Association of Master Bakers.  The Minister thinks it is a hardship to have that imposed on him by statute.  Why?  He is going to fix the price of bread.  A <Col N="974" /> later amendment asks the Minister that, in case he is going to fix a maximum price for bread, he should consult, not get agreement with, but consult with the Irish Association of Master Bakers.</P>

I would rather have it done in the way set out here, because the Prices Commission is a body which I have always derided. It was given an impossible task to do, and it has failed even to approach that task.  It has not got any public confidence. The Prices Commission has been in being now for almost three years.  It has made, I think, three reports.  The only thing it has done is to help to bring down the price at <Col N="975" /> which coal was to be sold to two bellmen. It made a fatuous report on flour which the Minister has definitely put aside.  The Minister does not even accept that in his measure&mdash;to a great extent it is not accepted.  One of the things that it did explicitly say was that a price order should be made for the whole of the Saorstát and not for any area.  The Minister will not accept that.  One of its reports, the one about flour, the Minister is ashamed to have mentioned in the House.  He will not act on it.

      <P>That is a principle that the Minister will not get across this House.  Although I think it is a bad intermediary, let the Minister if he likes say that, before making an order fixing the price of bread, he will consult the Master Bakers via the Prices Commission.  Let him if he likes cloak himself behind the Prices Commission.  I should prefer that the Minister would consult the Master Bakers directly.  All that Deputy O'Neill's amendment asks is that if a prices order is going to be made varying the price of bread in accordance with the price of flour, that then there will be consultation with the <Col N="976" /> Master Bakers.  The Minister thinks that is a handicap that should not be imposed on him.</P>

      <P>A very important point in this is that the Minister is taking power to make what he calls <Col N="978" /> a variable order.  I take it that he has in mind the suggestion made in the Prices Commission report that the price of bread should vary in accordance with the price of flour.  I think the procedure that has been adopted in England should be followed here.  The system that is in practice there has worked out very smoothly, and I do not see any reason why the Minister should not do something on the same lines here.</P>

      <P>There is no question of dignity in this at all.  If the Master Bakers came to me and said that a reduction of a ½d. for every 4/- in the sack of flour was not a fair calculation, the only answer I can give them is that the Prices Commission report that that is a fair calculation.  The Prices Commission that sat in 1926 made a similar report, and I am accepting their conclusions.  No Minister can give any other answer to that except he was prepared to carry out a separate and a new investigation on his own, and I do not think he should do that.</P>

Consequently, we have got to the position that what the standard to be fixed will be, is already known.  There will be added to that 4½d. or 5d., as the case may be, certain other amounts as set out in the Commission's report to cover costs other than the costs of flour. There you will get the price of bread which has emerged as the result of a protracted investigation by the Commission, and which is confirmed by reference to the report of the Food Prices Tribunal of 1926 which brought a precisely similar recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is another point in it.  This Commission, about whose efficiency the Minister is so satisfied, reported distinctly that there was no reason for area discrimination. They deal with the matter on page 17, under the heading &ldquo;Question of Uniform Prices&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under present conditions, in many parts of the country the smaller bakery has to meet the competition of the larger city bakery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is what that efficient body, who have made such a thorough-going investigation so pleasing to the Minister, report:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A close examination of the economics of baking units, of various sizes and locations, disclosed the following interesting facts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(A)  Purchase of Flour.&mdash;The larger unit has the advantage of favourable terms for large quantities and, being generally adjacent to mills, its transport costs are lower.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one point in favour of the higher unit.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(B)  Output.&mdash;The information we have obtained regarding typical units goes to show that the larger concerns have little, if any, advantage over their smaller competitors as a direct result of larger turnover.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You can call that a draw, I suppose.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(C)  Labour.&mdash;The country unit (and, generally, therefore, the smaller), as distinct from the city unit, has a decided advantage as regards both the cost of labour and its adjustability to day-to-day conditions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They are all square at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(D)  Management and Overhead Expenses: The smaller bakery is, generally, part of a mixed general trading unit.  The consequent saving on overhead expenses offsets, to <Col N="981" /> some extent, advantages in other respects accruing to the larger unit, which, generally, is confined to baking.</P>
    <P>That is something to the advantage of the country unit that the city one has not got.</P>
    <P>(E)  Distribution: The very high distribution costs disclosed in the accounts submitted to us by large scale bakeries indicate a further advantage, under this head, for the smaller unit.</P>
    <P>So they weight the thing in favour of the smaller unit and they draw a conclusion that there should be uniform prices, that there should be a standard price for the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I am proposing to work on the basis of the pound units.  If the Deputy will notice, in Section 4 we are taking power to prohibit the sale or offering for sale in the area to which an Order affecting bread applies, bread covered by the Order unless such bread is so sold or offered for sale either in units of less than eight ounces or in units of one pound or multiples of a pound.

      <P>Bread is always taken as quoted per 4 lb. quartern or per 2 lbs.  Is the Minister going to depart from that?  The reason I brought in the amendment is that in some parts of the country the trade in bread is not in the 2 lb. or 4 lb. unit.  In some places the trade is practically all in 1 lb. units, and the making of 1 lb. units is a very much more expensive process than the making of 4 lb. units.

      <P>The Minister on a particular amendment refused to be absolutely precise with regard to those variations which he may make.  There is not the slightest doubt in the world that the Minister takes power to make and has the intention of making Bread (Price) Orders, varying according to the area.  The Minister does intend that.  The Minister tells me that he has accepted the Commission's report. The Minister will, I am sure, tell me that he has read, thoroughly understood, and gone through the Commission's report.  He has already told me in this House that he cannot find anywhere that they recommended in favour of uniform prices for the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Possibly, but at any rate that is the Commission's recommendation. The Minister did not know it was there until now.  It is the last paragraph above the signatures&mdash;&ldquo;...such Orders should apply to the entire area of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; That is after they had in detail gone through the points which I read before. They examined them under the headings of flour purchase, output, labour, management and overhead expenses, and distribution, and having done that, they recommended in the most wholehearted way, in a flatfooted phrase which I do not think anybody could misunderstand, that those uniform prices &ldquo;should apply to the entire area of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; The Minister thinks he is accepting the report when he brings in area Orders.  He announced here earlier that he intends to make area Orders. Why?  This is a case where the Prices Commission, that expert body to whom the Association of Master Bakers have referred, recommend something to the Minister that the Minister does not entirely believe in.</P>

      <P>I went further and asked him&mdash;quibbling will not get over this&mdash;was it his intention to make Orders for areas, and he said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He did that on foot of the Commission's recommendations.  And the Commission recommended uniform prices for Saorstát Eireann.  Yet, the Minister thinks that is a great body, and its report has been so carefully considered that he will not allow the Master Bakers to consult with him to suggest that possibly their recommendation <Col N="986" /> may have gone wrong under changed conditions.  That is one thing. Will the Minister answer another question?  Under sub-section (1) of Section 3 prices are to be fixed or may be fixed varying according to different sets of conditions,&mdash;and then we get a variety of clauses with regard to the place of sale.  There is, at any rate, a distinction between sale at the place where the bread is kept by the vendor, and sale by the vendor at some place other than where it is kept by the vendor.  There are two balancing clauses there.  There is first &ldquo;that the bread is sold or offered for sale by the baker thereof in a shop owned by him, delivery being taken by the purchaser at such shop.&rdquo;  Then there is the varying one: &ldquo;that the bread is sold or offered for sale retail by a person other than the baker thereof in a shop owned by such person....&rdquo;  There is a distinction, at any rate, permissible there between bread sold by a baker at his own premises and bread sold by somebody other than a baker in that person's own premises.  Is the Minister going to make any distinction between sale by a baker at the place where the loaf is baked and sale by a baker at a shop owned by the baker?  There will be delivery cost there, and there will be distribution cost.  It may not be as great as the distribution cost of a person other than a baker owning a shop from which bread is sold.  But there is a differentiation.  Does the Minister recognise it or will he allow for it?</P>

      <P>Of course the first point raised by the Deputy is, in a sense, a minor point.  The Commission undoubtedly recommended on 21st August, 1935, having completed their investigation, that an Order should be made under the Control of Prices Act, 1932, fixing the maximum retail and wholesale price for bread, and that such Order should apply to the whole of the Saorstát.  We did not make those Orders.  We proposed to do so but we came up against legal difficulties, and because of those legal difficulties we are not acting under the Control of Prices Act at all.  We are introducing here a Bill to put on the Statute Book new power to act in <Col N="987" /> relation to the price of bread.  It is under this Act and not under the Control of Prices Act that any Orders will be made.  We are taking power to make Orders to apply to the whole of the Saorstát or part of the Saorstát, because the new Act is designed to provide permanent legislation for the regulation of the price of bread&mdash;not the regulation as at 21st August, 1935, but the regulation of its price at any time the Executive Council considers it is desirable that such legislation should be effected.  The various circumstances dealt with in the paragraph under which different prices can be fixed in respect of bread are all those recommended by the Commission, and all those in respect of which I think we should have that power, that is in accordance with the paragraph which the Deputy read out.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not recognise any possibilities of difference in the price of bread sold by a baker across the counter of the bakery, so to speak, or on premises attached to the bakery, and the price of that same loaf sold by the baker in a shop away from the bakery which is still owned by the baker?  Would there not be a distribution or delivery cost attached there, and would there not be necessity for differentiation? The Commission has made recommendations with regard to what they call &ldquo;sale over the baker's counter.&rdquo; Will the Minister recognise that &ldquo;the baker's counter&rdquo; might be either the counter of the place where the bread is baked or the counter of some shop owned by the baker which is not the bakery?  Will the Minister recognise any difference in costs, or will he recognise the possibility of a variation in price being necessary?  The Commission have only reported on this matter in connection with the sale of bread by the baker as opposed to sale by a retailer who is not a baker. There is delivery to the householder or delivery by a baker to the shop of <Col N="988" /> a retailer, such retailer not being a baker, and so on.  Surely the Minister must recognise the difference?  Why should there be an allowance for an extra item when the bread is sold in a shop that belongs to a retailer who is not a baker, and why will that cost disappear when the shop is owned by the baker?  If there is to be a transfer some distance to other premises owned by the baker, will there not be some difference?  My point is that there is no allowance for it in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, since I am more familiar with the conditions in this trade, I might be permitted to put Deputy McGilligan's point in concrete form.  I have a shop, say, 30 miles from my bakery.  That shop is in my possession and I work there and retail bread in that shop.  The bakery also has a retail shop. Deputy McGilligan's point is that it is a stupid thing to ask the same price for bread sold over the counter of the shop in the bakery as in the shop 30 miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. Take it from another angle.  Let us take it from the point of view of the four special heads set out at the bottom of page 19 and the top of page 20 of the report&mdash;sale over the baker's counter, delivery to a householder, delivery by a baker to a shop of a retailer, such retailer not being <Col N="989" /> a baker, and sale by a retailer.  What is the difference in price as between the retailer being a baker and the retailer not being a baker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That refers to the customer of the baker, and a 10 per cent. discount is provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a 10 per cent. discount from the No. 2 price, but the No. 2 price is delivery to the householder.  There is, however, a differentiation made between the sale across the counter where the retailer is a baker and where the retailer is not a baker.  Why must there be a distinction and an extra item of cost allowed for a sale across the counter in a shop by a retailer where the retailer is, in the one case, the baker and, in the other case, not a baker?  If there is a separate shop there will be separate overhead expenses in connection with the shop. Will they differ if he is the owner, and, if so, will they so far differ as to make it equivalent to the sale across the bakery counter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I have been considering, following representations from traders' associations in certain small towns where, in order to enable certain retailers to continue to sell bread, the baker marked up his price to the price at which the retailer could sell the bread at a profit.  Undoubtedly, the bakers, when selling bread in competition with the retailers, get too large a profit, according to the Commission's calculations.  Sometimes the baker did not sell bread in competition with the retailers, and the point advanced by the retailers is that if we insist on the baker selling bread over the counter at a reasonable profit, no retailer will have a chance.  I have been looking into that point, with a view to seeing if we could allow a certain amount of elasticity there. But the only practical way to do that is to allow the baker, in respect of that type of bread, to get a higher profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Commissions have reported that it is desirable to give a fresh impetus to the tendency already observable to have more bread sold in bakers' own premises, whether in the bakery or in a shop owned by the baker, because one Commission definitely reported, and the other rather backed it up, that there are too many people engaged in retailing bread.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  While the baker bakes bread, he can sell that across the counter or in a part of the premises attached to the bakery.  He has very little distribution costs and there should be something for that. That is taken and given to a retailer who is not a baker, but when the baker takes that bread and delivers it to a shop of his own so far away as 30 miles there should be some difference in the price as between the sale in his own bakery and in the shop 30 miles away.  That is the only point I am making.</P>

      <P>In connection with this question of the variable price, the Minister will remember the scale to which I referred previously, inserted by the Prices Commission, on which the prices should be regulated on a sliding scale having relation to the prices of flour.  The only thing there is the price of flour, but other things may vary from time to time in such a way as to affect seriously the price of bread.  For instance, the Minister has put a very serious tariff on yeast, and I hope he will take into account the increased cost of yeast, which he has increased himself, and also the increased cost of other matters which go into the production of bread.  The cost of yeast has become a very serious charge.</P>

A baker sells to a retailer at a wholesale price because he has no expense.  This is the same as any other trade in which there is a wholesale list.  Otherwise the baker would have to bring bread into a shop, put paper and twine on it, and record the sale.  Was it not better, to have one price?</P>

      <P>The Minister said that what he wanted to achieve was that if a loaf weighing, say, 1 lb. and a few ounces was sold as a 2-lb. loaf there would be an offence.  If the Minister looks at the section he will see that he may prohibit the sale, by <Col N="993" /> any price order, of bread of any kind unless sold in units of less than 8 ozs. or units of 1 lb. or multiples of 1 lb.</P>
      <P>Supposing you sell a loaf weighing one pound one ounce is that a multiple of a pound?  Surely not.  I think what the Minister means is not less than a pound.  I went through the Commission's report and I think most bread is scaled in such a way that it comes out a little in excess of the pound.  The Minister does not intend to have it an offence to sell one or two-pound loaves some fraction over that weight.  The section makes it an offence to sell unless in units of a pound or multiples of a pound.  Supposing a loaf weighed one pound two ounces, surely that is not an offence.</P>

      <P>(b) any person sells in the area to which such order applies any such bread under any set of conditions specified in such order, such person shall, if so required by the purchaser, give to the purchaser a receipt showing the amount paid for such bread and the weight thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 1, to delete all after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to <Col N="995" /> the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;if the sale takes place in a shop and if the purchaser so requires, weigh in the purchaser's presence the bread that is being purchased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conditions laid down by the Minister are intolerable and I think he will find that, in practice, they will be unworkable.  It might become an intolerable practice if people could insist on getting a printed receipt or a written receipt when sold a loaf of bread, or if a van-man was stopped on the road in some remote district or at a cross-roads.  If they took it into their heads to ask for receipts van-men would have a very difficult job giving receipts for every loaf or half loaf of bread they sold.  The Minister's idea would be achieved by insisting wherever a sale takes place in a shop that the bread should be weighed in the presence of the purchaser. I am sure the Minister's idea is to see that the public get full weight.  The amendment would protect the public effectively, and would give less trouble, while there would not be intolerable conditions imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's concern is due to the fact that the purchaser appears to be given the right to demand a receipt the amendment would cover that right, because the purchaser has a legal right to demand a receipt setting out the commodity and the price.  If the Deputy's intention is to avoid the obligation to give a receipt in the case of a sale of bread from a van it does not achieve that, because I understand a baker's van has been deemed to be a, shop&mdash;a travelling shop undoubtedly&mdash;in the definition of the Act.  Consequently the amendment does not avoid that. If we are going to fix the maximum price of bread, we must provide that the purchaser of bread will get, when making the purchase, some document from the seller, if he desires it, indicating the weight and the price of the bread.</P>

      <P>I take the opportunity afforded by the presentation of <Col N="1002" /> this Estimate to remind the Minister of some representations made to him by the Governing Body of University College, Galway, and to ask him to give them sympathetic consideration. These representations spring from the desire of the Governing Body to see made pensionable the position of lecturerships through the medium of Irish in Ancient Classics, Education, Mathematics, History and Commerce, attached to the College.  On a former occasion when this Estimate was before the House I had the privilege of telling my fellow Deputies of the valuable work equally remarkable from the national as from the cultural and linguistic point of view, done by the holders of these lecturerships.  On that occasion the Minister showed his appreciation in a very practical way. He increased the College grant so as to raise the salaries of all these lecturers to the level of £500.  I feel now he will be equally sympathetic and that he will help the Governing Body in their efforts to make these lecturerships pensionable.</P>
      <P>The reason they were not made pensionable in the beginning was that they were looked upon rather in the nature of an experiment.  That experiment involved three questions.  One was whether students would be attracted in sufficient numbers to the classes held in Irish on different subjects. That was one question that had to be settled.  Another was whether lecturers could be found equally proficient and up to University standards, both in Irish and in the subjects they were called upon to profess.  The third question, which was perhaps more vital, was whether Irish in itself, after its long exile from the mart and the council chamber, from the halls of the Universities or from studies of the learned, would be equal to the heavy task imposed upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it sensitive enough to reproduce the finest shades of classical interpretation and criticism?  Was it so subtly and delicately adjusted as to do justice to the profound principles of philosophy and psychology, underlying the science and art and education?  Would it be sinewy and subtle enough to grapple with the realities and the actualities involved in the very modern <Col N="1003" /> subjects like economics and commerce?</P>
    <P>These were the questions that were before the Minister whose generous help enabled the college to institute the lecturerships.  His attitude at that time was expressed in two letters to the President of University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>On the 7th March, 1930, the former Minister for Finance stated in a letter to Dr. Anderson:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We think that it is not necessary to do anything at present for the existing lecturers through Irish, although we recognise that, if their services are satisfactory and they are reappointed the question of providing for their pensions will have to be dealt with later on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 19th February, 1931, the Minister wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of providing for the pensions of the persons appointed as well as the pensions of the three lecturers through the medium of Irish already in the college will be dealt with at a later date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the &ldquo;later date&rdquo; has now come and I think the three tests to which these lecturerships have been subjected have proved triumphantly successful.</P>
    <P>On the question of the number of students attending in each subject of each faculty in Irish during the session 1934-35, I have some statistics here which I think the House will find interesting.  In the subject of commerce, our of a total number of 100 students in Galway University College, 74 took the course through the medium of Irish and 26 through the medium of English.  In economics, out of a total of 100 students, 74 took the course through the medium of Irish and 26 through English.  In physical geography, out of a total of 31 students, 21 took the course through the medium of Irish and ten through the medium of English.  In commercial geography, out of 29 students, 20 took the course through the medium of Irish and nine through the medium of English.  In Latin, out of eight students, four took the course through the medium of Irish and four through <Col N="1004" /> the medium of English.  In mathematics, out of 13 students, 11 took the course through the medium of Irish and two through the medium of English.  In history, out of 16 students, 14 took the course through the medium of Irish and two through the medium of English.</P>
    <P>In the faculty of Arts:&mdash;In Greek, out of a total of seven students, six took the course through the medium of Irish and one through the medium of English.  In Latin, out of a total of 36 students, 18 took the course through the medium of Irish and 18 through the medium of English.  In mathematics, out of 31 students, 20 took the course through the medium of Irish and 11 through the medium of English. In economics, out of 25 students, 14 took the course through the medium of Irish and 11 through the medium of English.  In history, out of 41 students, 28 took the course through the medium of Irish and 13 through the medium of English.  In education there were 73 ordinary students, of whom 32 took the course through the medium of Irish and 41 through the medium of English.</P>
    <P>I think these numbers are sufficiently eloquent.  They prove that students have been more responsive to the Irish classes than to the English classes, and they also prove that Irish is equal to the task demanded of it.  Galway has been very fortunate in securing for these lecturerships men and women of very high ability, and I am pleased to say the whole language movement owes an enormous debt to them.  I also feel that the College ought to be very proud of them because these lecturerships have made more of a reality than many people once thought possible the turning of Galway College into a Gaelic University.  For these reasons I ask the Minister to consider sympathetically the plea I make to have the work of these lecturers recognised by making their positions pensionable.</P>
