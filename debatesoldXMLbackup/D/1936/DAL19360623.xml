      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether in view of the fact that the arrears in the cottage rent collection in the Cahirciveen district of County Kerry are considerably lower than the average arrears throughout the county as a whole, he will sanction the housing scheme for the workers in Cahirciveen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the arrears of cottage rents in the Cahirciveen district are not so unsatisfactory as in other areas in County Kerry they have increased from £204 in March, 1933, to £262 in September, 1935, and £302 at the end of last month (the average monthly rental is £30). Until there is definite evidence that the board of health and public assistance intend to carry out their duty in the matter of rent collection I am not prepared to sanction further housing schemes under the Labourers Acts in the Kerry county health district.</P>

The applicant appealed and the Court of Referees, having considered the case, recommended that the application be refused.  The court's recommendation was accepted by the Unemployment Assistance Officer.  Representations were subsequently made on behalf of this applicant and certain documents were submitted.  The matter was referred to the Unemployment Assistance Officer who, in accordance with the provisions of Section 20 (1) of the 1933 Act, decided that the representations made and the documents submitted did not contain any evidence which would warrant revision of the decision already given.</P>

      <P>Recently, when certain repairs were needed to the fishery cruiser &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; tenders for the work were received from two firms in the Saorstát, one firm in Northern Ireland and four firms in Great Britain. Without mentioning the precise figures, I may say that the quotations by the Irish firms were, respectively, 41 per cent., 45 per cent. and 66 per cent. higher than that of the British firm with whom the contract was placed. While it is the practice to accord a reasonable measure of preference to our own shipyards in connection with such repairs or overhauls, the difference in prices on this occasion was <Col N="12" /> unfortunately too great to justify the retention of the work in the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>On the occasion in question the fishery cruiser was absent from patrol duty for a period of 25 days, and no special measures were taken during that time in view of the general powers normally reposed in the Gárda Síochána and other sca fishery officers by virtue of the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, 1933.</P>

      <P>No decision has yet been arrived at regarding the purchase of kelp during the 1937 season.

    <P>I think it is essential and important that the House would refer the President's Estimate back in order to give some consideration to certain matters that I want to bring before it.  The whole policy of the Ministry, the question of order and the whole economy of the country are dominated by that part of the President's policy which he keeps foremost above all others, that is the policy of hitting at and tinkering with the Constitution instead of allowing such constitutional safeguards as are desirable and necessary to come in an orderly way with direct reference to national needs and in relation to clear national understandings. The Constitution-mongering to which the President usually devotes himself has a prejudicial and disastrous effect on the situation in regard to order in the country, and on the growth of subversive movements such as Communism, and on the economic situation.  I want to deal particularly with the economic situation and to show how it is affected by the Constitution-mongering of the President because, in the long run, unless the economic situation is satisfactory there can be no decent order in the country.  It is only by having a satisfactory economic situation in the country that the growth of Communism and such other evils can be countered.  With a sound economic <Col N="18" /> situation prevailing in the country, Communism and those other evils would die out.</P>
    <P>Now I want to say a few words with regard to the order situation.  The country was startled&mdash;if the country could be startled by anything arising out of the order situation&mdash;by the murders that took place recently.  The country was satisfied by some of the statements made by the Acting-Minister for Justice on the part of the Government last week.  But the country must equally have been startled by some of the phrases used by the Acting-Minister for Justice in dealing with his Estimate and in announcing the attitude of the Government towards the people who are carrying out those crimes in the country.  The Acting-Minister told the House, with reference to part of the Gárda force, that they had just finished one war and that they were now going to take an another.  If we have a situation in the country in which a Minister of the Executive Council can stand up in the House and tell Deputies that they are now going to take on another war, the House is entitled to hear from the President what it has not heard from the Minister for Justice.  What are the circumstances, and how has the situation arisen which forces the Executive Council and the Guards to take on another war?  There is no one in the country with any sense of reason or any political understanding who does not appreciate, no matter how belated the attitude taken by the Executive Council may be&mdash;that the present Executive Council have now declared to the Dáil that nothing in their power will be left undone and no powers will be left untaken, not only to prevent murder in this country but to see that no subversive organisation will be allowed to develop or grow in this country, that gives any promise of the danger of murder taking place or of the institutions of the State being threatened or overthrown by force.  But we are, unhappily, in the position of having to realise that, if there has been a development which forces the acting Minister for Justice to make the statements he made here the other day, the <Col N="19" /> Executive Council have a certain amount of responsibility for that situation, and the House deserves an explanation on certain points from the Ministry which consider that they have to take on another war.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that the policy of the Executive Council up to the present, even their policy subsequent to the recent murders, has been of such a kind as to allow to exist in the country a hard core of people organised not only to deny the authority of Parliament, but to overthrow it by force and, as part of their organisation work and of their own development, to carry out political murders when it pleases them.  We also have to realise that that hard core of people have, as a result of the policy of the Executive Council, been left with arms.  We have again to realise that there has grown up around them, if not as a protection around them, at any rate in close association with them, a new political body challenging the authority of Parliament, and as part of their plan, for challenging the authority of Parliament, organising, in so far as they can, an abstentionist political body.</P>
    <P>The President and his Ministers cannot shut their eyes to the fact that the growth of such a body has been influenced and developed as a result of the policies they have been pursuing, and they cannot but realise that the growth in present circumstances of a body like that is going to afford encouragement and assistance to what I call the hard core of men who, holding arms, are prepared to use them against the State and individuals.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back too far into history in connection with this, but, when the President sent Griffith and Collins to London to negotiate with the British Government a treaty between Great Britain and this country, he announced to the world, and to the negotiators with whom they were going to work and discuss, that he was not a republican doctrinaire. He practically asked them to meet these men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we consider the effect of the President's Constitution-mongering policy, it is correct to say that it does bear on the situation; that the President does now claim that there will never be peace in this country until there is a republican Constitution here.  The President has not only held that up as an ideal, but he has by his declarations, stamped it as being a national necessity for the peace and proper economic development of the country. He is pursuing policies that not only to us, but, apparently, to those people who have broken away from him and are forming an abstentionist group, and to the people who, having broken away from him, are now a body whose policy is to arm and to endeavour to overthrow the State by force&mdash;he is pursuing policies that to the people both to the right and to the left of him show no hope of bringing about a condition here that will give us the type of Constitution that he considers to be the national ideal Constitution and that he considers necessary for the peace of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that clothed with the authority of the President of this State, he has, to a very large extent, been responsible for handing over to these people the type of ideal they are pursuing. He does hold himself out to them as pursuing the ideal that he has handed to them in an ineffective and futile way.  It is because of that, while assuring the President of the support of every section in this House, and of every person who can be called a follower of any of the political Parties in the House, in dealing with murder and disorder and threats against the State by force, we do put it to him that, when his Minister announces to this House that they have now to take on another war against people who are <Col N="21" /> carrying out these activities or people who are sympathising with them, we do want to hear from him what discussions went on between him and the sections of the people who have broken away from him; what he offered to them as sound and reasonable proposals to hold them to Parliamentary policies, whether Parliamentary policies associated with him or opposed to him.  We had occasion in the past to give the House the fullest possible details of negotiations and efforts that were made to avoid strife before in this country and to prevent groups developing that would repudiate the authority of Parliament built on majority will.  I ask the President not to leave this House at the present time without some explanation as to what are the differences between these groups and him.  But, we particularly wish to point out to him that if the present situation has developed, it has been encouraged and fostered, and force and strength given to it by the constitution-mongering that has been his principal policy.</P>
    <P>Again, the general type of policy he has been pursuing in connection with constitutional matters has been an encouragement to the Communists. They have seen an important and essential part of this Oireachtas wiped out by a stroke, you might say, of the Fianna Fáil pen.  They have been encouraged by the statements made by the President from time to time that the financial situation that exists here and the general economic and social condition that exists here are perhaps not adequate to provide for all the needy people of the country and that there may be a necessity to go outside them.  While expressing these opinions, and showing the people of Communistic tendencies how little respect he has for parliamentary institutions here, if you like, in wiping out the Seanad before he made up his mind as to what should take its place, he has been injuring the general economic situation of the country by the constitutional policies to which he holds on.</P>
    <P>I have said that I regard the economic situation here as such that, taking the long view, it is going to <Col N="22" /> enable this country to secure order, to damp down and wipe out Communistic activities.  It is for that reason, in particular, that I want to discuss the economic situation here.  Various Deputies and Ministers have been pretending to be enthusiastic with regard to the general economic situation here, but they must know as well as I do, and as well as the farmers in the country and the workers in the towns, the general condition to which the people who are running Irish homes have been reduced as a result of the general policy of the Government dominated by the President's tinkering with the Constitution.  We have this phrase in a leader in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 16th June:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Of the economic war it can also be said that so far from succeeding in achieving its object the very reverse is the case.  It has, in the first place, given a stimulus to the revival and growth of our native Irish industries which has effected more in four years than could otherwise have been attained in twenty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The phrase rings very familiarly.  The economic war has effected more in four years than could otherwise have been attained in 20.  I recall another statement that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Truly we have lived through 30 or 40 years of Irish history within the last two years as I conceive it since the Treaty was passed.  We have lived through it, and I believe that we have made more progress in these two years, though many may not see it, than would have been made in 30 or 40 years of ordinary agitation as I thought was the only thing before the country when the Treaty was passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To-day we realise how hollow were the protestations of the President on the 21st July, 1924, when he told us that greater progress had been achieved in the two years before that than would have been achieved by ordinary agitation in 30 or 40 years. I wonder how long we are going to have to wait before it is realised how hollow are the protestations of the Government organ &ldquo;that four years of the economic war has effected <Col N="23" /> more for industry than could otherwise have been attained in 20.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President told us the other day that there cannot be a settlement of the economic difficulties with Great Britain until there is a settlement of our political difficulties.  We should be clear as to what these political difficulties are.  Whatever they are, they divide on one side, from the pursuit of a parliamentary line of politics, a section in this country upon whom the Acting Minister for Justice declares that the Government is going to carry out another war, and they divide us on the other side from any co-operation with Great Britain in matters that politically &mdash; from the point of view of defence and of the economic means of our country &mdash;are absolutely essential.  Only on Sunday last, we had four members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who attended a Fianna Fáil Aeridheacht at Castlefin, appealing there for absolute unity in a movement that was going to frame a new constitution, one that would entirely ignore the Treaty of 1921, that would make no mention of His Majesty the King, in which there would be no talk of an ascendancy chamber, no oath to a foreign King, and one that, generally, would refuse to be a Dominion of the British Empire.</P>
    <P>We want to know from the President, first, what are the political things that divide him from the British, and that, so dividing him from the British, keep him away from the council table to discuss these things; that in keeping him away from the council table, keep us in the economic position to which we have been reduced by the cutting of our external trade with Great Britain.  If the President is still going to pursue his constitution mongering policy, we ought at least to know what these things are.  The country is aware from statements that the President has made here, and from statements that were made four years ago by the Vice-President after Ottawa, that the things that prevent us from trading in the old way with Great Britain, as far as having the British market there for <Col N="24" /> our agricultural produce, are certain political matters.  Four years have passed since that was made clear by the Vice-President after Ottawa, but in the meantime we have got no nearer as to any kind of understanding as to where the President is going constitutionally.  He has said that we are going to be told all about that in the autumn.  We do want to hear from the President if he is not able to reconcile in the autumn of next year his political difficulties with the people of Great Britain, and if the country, tired of what is happening here, is reduced to the absolute economic necessity of getting rid of his Government and of putting in another that will make whatever political agreement it is possible to make with Great Britain that will provide a satisfactory economic arrangement between the two countries, can we have an explicit statement from the President now that he and his Party will support such a Government in a whole-hearted parliamentary way: that they will support such a Government in dealing with disorder and with subversive movements in the country.  If the President cannot satisfy us that he is going to stop tinkering with the Constitution and give this country an economic chance, we are entitled, when we take the economic interests of the country into consideration, to have, beyond any shadow of doubt, a statement from him and the Party opposite that in any changed circumstances that would put another Government in their place, it would have his parliamentary support and that of his Party and followers against people who, because there was a Party in power which would make a political agreement with Great Britain that the Fianna Fáil Ministers or the Fianna Fáil Party would not make, might make the threat of force against the State, against the then existing Government and the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>However, the economic situation here in my opinion demands that the President should stop tinkering with the Constitution and get down to a realisation of the condition that the people are in at the present time. The statement has been made that <Col N="25" /> great industrial progress has been made here.  Has the President looked around at all to see what industrial progress has been made here?  It was only within the last few days that we were supplied with the latest particulars in connection with the census of production for the year 1934.  As regards a large number of industries covered in that census of production, an examination discloses this fact, that the 15,300 people who have got additional employment in the industries referred to have got it at an average wage of 18/7 per week.  Will the President tell the House that he realises that and, when the Government organ paints the great industrial development that has taken place in this country, will it be indicated that they have seen and realised that 15,300 people, the total to be put into industry in 22 of our major industries in the first three years of Fianna Fáil industrial development, were put in there with average wages of 18/7 a week and that these represent the type of people upon which the burdens imposed by the Government are falling?</P>
    <P>When they talk of the well-being of the country, do they understand that residents in town and country have had to pay more money for their butter, sugar, flour and bread, millions of pounds of additional taxation that do not appear in the revenue accounts of the Government and that have had to be paid in order to give increased income to our farmers, and do they realise that these millions have gone down the sewer of futility and that they have not brought increased employment or better wages to the agricultural industry?  Does the President realise that, after all the encouragement in the way of feeding the farmers with these additional payments taken from the purchasers of these commodities and with all the assistance that has been given by the general Government policy and the general Government propaganda to improve the farmers' conditions, there was less agricultural employment in the country last year than there was before Fianna Fáil took a hand in assisting the farmers and, not only <Col N="26" /> was there less employment, but those who were employed got less money? Repeatedly we have had it stated here that there were 600 permanent agricultural labourers less last year than in the year 1931 and that such labourers as were employed in agriculture received&mdash;even on the figures of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; £900,000 less in wages than appeared in the wages bill in 1931.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised not only from here but by very authoritative people, that the Minister's figures, which indicate 21/3 for an agricultural labourer, have nothing to do with reality.  Repeatedly the County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford has stated that 8/- a week was the wage paid to an agricultural labourer.  The Labour Party have indicated that wages were ranging from 10/- to 18/- a week, and 12 months ago the Bishop of Cork warned the Government that agricultural labourers' wages were low because the farmers were not able to pay them and he added that it was near time the Government realised there were married agricultural labourers in Cork getting not more than 10/- a week.  So that if the wages bill on the wage quoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of 21/3 a week per person has to be brought down any way near the figure quoted by the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture, which is the most subsidised county in the place, or the figure given by the Bishop of Cork for 1935, we have to realise that the loss goes nearer to £2,000,000 in the pool of wages available for the agricultural labourer.  These are the people upon whom the increased cost of government is falling here.</P>
    <P>Does the President realise the position the farmers are in?  He has cut down their income by an amount that appears to be appalling.  The British Government will have taken in land annuities by the end of the year&mdash;by the time we see the President's Constitution proposals, if he does not withdraw this Estimate now and consider the things that are important and fundamental so far as the interests of our people are concerned&mdash;a sum of £25,000,000.  The Irish farmers will <Col N="27" /> have had extracted from the produce that crosses the Channel fully that amount.  Not only that, but on their trade with Great Britain for the last few years they will have lost £53,000,000.  What that means to the farmer, particularly when we add the consequential losses that arise out of the reduction in the price that he gets in this country&mdash;what that means to the farmer we can have only a small general impression.  It does mean this, taking one example, that for a beast for which the farmer would get £17 in 1931, he will get £8 10s. or, at the best, £9 now.  That loss is otherwise reflected in the various commodities he sells, excepting, perhaps, butter.  The loss to the farmers of £53,000,000 in five years on their export trade alone is a dead loss.</P>
    <P>While it is claimed that the cereal policy of the Government has brought in additional income to the farmers the facts that we are aware of as regards the lack of additional employment in agriculture and the enormous fall in wages for agricultural labourers show that the farmers have got nothing to make up for these huge losses, and it is clear that the money paid by the people in the towns&mdash;additional money for their sugar, flour, bread and butter&mdash;is no addition to the farmers' income but is simply dropped into the farmers' pockets to fill some of the vacancies created there by the loss of their trade with Great Britain and the reduction of their income from our own people.  It is on the farmers who have had these losses and the agricultural labourers whose wages are so substantially reduced that the burden of government falls, a burden that the Minister for Finance not only gives us no reason for thinking is going to be reduced, but that he has completely run away from explaining.</P>
    <P>Reduced as we are to a Single Chamber, responsible for examining the general economic condition of the country, the financial position, and dealing in a proper way with legislative proposals, we have been completely denied by the Minister for Finance any explanation of the huge burden of taxation that he is continuing to impose on the people.  We <Col N="28" /> have asked him does he remember in 1932 when he came forward to impose substantial increases in taxation, that he then boasted he was putting £4,000,000 additional taxation on the people.  He explained then that he was obliged to introduce an Emergency Budget.  We have asked him if he remembers mentioning to the clothing manufacturers at the beginning of last year that this year was the first year in which we would return to Budget normalcy.  We have asked him does he realise that he presents a bill to the people this year that is a couple of hundred thousand pounds more than the bill he presented on the occasion of his Emergency Budget. We ask him and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the President and any Minister who has any sense of responsibility do they realise that, when the additional £4,000,000 was asked from the people for the Emergency Budget, Ministers went throughout the country and told the people that all this money would be taken from the rich?</P>
    <P>I would ask them to remember that last year the tune was changed; that Deputy Hugo Flinn stood up, and, with such a display of defence as he could make, said: &ldquo;Why should not the working-man be taxed,&rdquo; and that the Minister for Education had to appear this year and ask, as it were, &ldquo;Why should not the working-man pay?&rdquo; The consumers paid last year in customs duties alone £2,000,000 more than they did before Fianna Fáil began their great industrial revival assisted by tariffs.  The shipbuilders of Dublin to-day, who see their work being sent across to Glasgow and to Great Britain to be done there because it would require a customs duty of 41 per cent, to get the work done in Dublin, are asked to pay on every single article that goes into their homes 50 per cent., 75 per cent., and 100 per cent.  In those duties, as I say, last year £2,000,000 was taken more than was taken in the year 1931.  Lumping the financial position, by the end of this year if we cannot stop the policies that are being pursued the Executive Council will have handled £27,800,000 more than the <Col N="29" /> previous Government would have had to handle if they were carrying on the administration of this country.  They handled more than that.  They handled £10,000,000 set aside annually in the past at the rate of £2,000,000 a year to cover payments due in respect of local loans, so that they will end up this year having handled £37,800,000 more in five years than their predecessors in office would have handled.  Where on earth does any Deputy see throughout this country any evidence that there has passed through the hands of the Government that additional huge sum?</P>
    <P>In regard to the considerable amount of taxation which the Fianna Fáil members and Fianna Fáil Ministers complained so bitterly about in the past, not only did they collect the substantial sums of money collected in the past in taxation and other revenue, but they will, by the end of the fifth year which we are now in, have handled £37,800,000 more.  In spite of handling that money the very work that is going on in the country and that it should be possible to pay for substantially out of these sums is not being so paid for. The previous Administration built 23,440 houses, and paid in building grants £1,529,000.  They paid every halfpenny of it out of revenue.  The present Government pride themselves on their housing.  They had, it is true, built up to the 31st March last&mdash;that is in their first four years&mdash;30,749 houses. They paid in grants £1,023,000, but in spite of the fact that they have handled such enormous sums of money they have left a debt on the State to the extent of, I think, £2,264,000; so that, handling this money as they are, and leaving so little reflection of it in the well-being of the people or in work in the country, they are leaving in respect of housing alone a pile of debt to the extent of that particular amount.</P>
    <P>We want to know&mdash;particularly in respect of the statement here that the economic war has given a stimulus to the revival and growth of our native industries here which has effected more in four years than could otherwise have been attained in 20&mdash;how long are we going to wait before the hollowness of that statement is appreciated by the members of the Fianna <Col N="30" /> Fáil Party.  It is perfectly clear that it is appreciated by the Minister for Finance.  That is why he runs away from the discussions that have been invited from him both on the general resolution for the Budget and on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. The Minister for Finance appreciates the situation, but he will not admit it. There is hardly a member of the Fianna Fáil Party who does not appreciate the situation, but they will not admit it.  When members of the Fianna Fáil Party go to the Fianna Fáil Aeridheacht in Castlefin, the reason why they have to talk about the Republican Constitution, the ascendancy Second Chamber, the King of England, the British Empire, and the ignoring of the Treaty, is that they have to keep far away from anything touching the ordinary lives of the people.  Those things, which are the material from which the President weaves his various constitutional ideas, are the things which have stood between this country and the proper carrying on of its business. Those are the things which have developed in the country the type of organisations that the Acting Minister for Justice had to condemn so strongly the other day.  Not only are they the things which have brought about those conditions in the country but they are going to continue those conditions in the country until the President gives up tinkering with constitutional matters, and gets down to the things that really affect the economic conditions in the country.</P>
    <P>Those things can be settled, and again I draw the President's attention to the explicit statement which was made to a representative of the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  As reported in that paper of the 20th August, 1932, the Vice-President in Ottawa stated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have, I believe, reached the basis of a settlement.  It is impossible to fix the date on which agreement will be arrived at but it is measurably close&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In practically the same terms, or in even more explicit terms, he gave a similar interview to a representative of <i>Le Matin,</i> the report of which was reprinted in a Quebec paper.  This <Col N="31" /> House should know now in 1936 what were the terms which were offered in Ottawa in 1932.  They should know what proposals the President has of a constitutional nature which he thinks he can get accepted by the British Government even though he cannot get them accepted by the people who are planning to overthrow this State by force.  There is one way in my opinion in which a settlement of such constitutional questions as are outstanding between ourselves and Great Britain can be arrived at, and that is by carrying on in a proper way the ordinary work which exists between the two countries.  Protestations of goodwill mean nothing to people with whom you are closely associated and with whom you have to work daily&mdash;at any rate, as compared with full and complete and decent co-operation.  The President has been handed down, by the people who were making the real progress when he was patting himself on the back for having made 30 or 40 years' progress in 1932 or 1933, a position in this country that makes him and those he represents co-equal in status in every respect with the British Premier and the British Ministers of Great Britain&mdash;a position that makes this country in no way subordinate to Great Britain in any aspect of its internal or external affairs, any more than Great Britain is subordinate to us in any aspect of her internal or external affairs.  There are definite matters of common interest, economically, between the two countries.  There was an approach made in Ottawa dealing with economic questions that showed that there could be co-operation and that there could be agreement&mdash;showed so much that that was possible that the Vice-President gave several interviews stating that that was so.  If that were possible in 1932, it is possible to-day; and the country is being surely treated, or will surely be treated, by the Fianna Fáil Party, to the thing that was stated when they first embarked on their economic war&mdash;to the economic counterpart of the civil war.</P>
    <P>If the President is going to persist in holding this country in the way in which it is suffering at the present <Col N="32" /> time from enormous economic losses, suffering the growth of disturbances that inevitably arise as much, if not more, out of economic wants and economic ill-being than they do, perhaps, out of his political blundering&mdash; if he pins us to that for any further length of time then, as I say, he is treating this country to the economic counterpart of the civil war and is doing this country infinitely more damage than even the civil war did this country.  People are inclined to say that the civil war should not be talked about or argued about.  It was not talked about or argued about after 1924 or 1925; and until it was necessary for the Fianna Fáil Party to stir up their old constitutional ideals in order to get a strong political tail behind them, the civil war did not matter in this country either between the ordinary people or between politicians.  The President, however, as I say&mdash;I only speak of the civil war by way of comparison&mdash;is doing more damage to the country by his present policy; and the economic damage, the political damage, the social damage that was done by the civil war is as nothing compared with the economic damage that is being done to-day.  It is these things that are holding us to them to-day in the same way as, four or five years ago, the President's constitutional tinkering held us, and I ask that this Estimate be referred back so that he can consider the whole situation, and I appeal to the President to drop his head-on tinkering with the Constitution and allow our constitutional development to develop in an ordinary way in connection with definite national things that he can state and definite international things that can be thoroughly understood by the people of this country and the people of Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, in the matters confronting this country at the present time for which the Executive Council are responsible, I like to think myself a realist.  It might be said with great force&mdash;I think, with unanswerable force&mdash;that President de Valera is personally responsible for the presence of a great many young men of this <Col N="33" /> country in the ranks of the I.R.A., at the present time, which he has just recently suppressed.  I believe that much of what he said during the last three years by innuendo encouraged young men in this country to join the I.R.A., believing that it had approval by a sidewind from the President, and that he was performing the converse of damning something by faint praise&mdash; that he was praising the I.R.A. by faint damning.  However, let us be realists in that matter, and I want to say something now which I think it is right for a responsible public man to say at this juncture.  There are many people in this country who may be tempted, under existing circumstances, to point the finger of scorn at President de Valera, to jeer at him and say: &ldquo;Now you are as bad as Cosgrave.&rdquo;  I want to make this perfectly clear: If we can dismiss from our minds all that has led up to the present situation and concentrate our minds upon that, the present Government are doing to the forces that are arrayed against this State nothing more than a Government constituted by the members of this Party would have to do, confronted with the same situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have arrived at agreement on fundamental principles in this House recently which, I think, are for the good of this country&mdash;and it will be better for all sides of the House if we think of Ireland rather than of our Parties in this connection&mdash;and that neither side of the House should make capital out of it&mdash;and one of these fundamental principles is that no person, no matter what political doctrine he advocates, shall have the right to take up arms against the State or to advocate the overthrow of established government by force of arms. In so far as any Government in this country stands for that principle, this Party will support it, and support it not only against one person who takes up that position, but against all-comers who advocate the use of arms against a Government representative of the majority of our people.  I feel that, when we combine a clear understanding of that position, such as has been arrived at in the course of the last few weeks here, with the clearer <Col N="34" /> understanding of the economic situation in this country, which seems to me to have emerged from much of what the Minister for Finance said in the course of the Budget discussions and the Finance Bill discussions, the ground is clear for reviewing certain other facts and certain other matters which are at issue between us and it makes it possible for us to discuss them in an atmosphere somewhat different to that which clouded them heretofore.</P>
    <P>I think we now have established in this country that everyone is entitled to speak his mind in public, subject to two limitations.  One is that he will not advocate the overthrow of the State by force of arms, and the second is that he will not use in a public place language calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.  With those two saving provisos, every man is guaranteed the right peacefully to advocate any policy he wants to advocate, on the ground that this is a democratic and a free country and one of comparatively few such countries that are left in the world to-day.  In that atmosphere, I want deliberately to invoke the question here of the comparative values to this country of republicanism versus the attitude adopted by this Party, which stands for Ireland as a sovereign and independent nation in the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>There are two matters that I would like to mention before going into the detail of this situation, which, I think, are peculiarly relevant.  One is that we have got to face what is, for me, the deplorable fact that, for at least a generation, the League of Nations at Geneva is going to be a comparatively ineffective protector of small nations. I hope, with Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and with Deputy McGilligan, that, with the passage of time and the contribution of hard work by all who believe in collective security, the League of Nations will yet emerge as a great instrument of national liberty and of human liberty.  I feel, however, that for some considerable time a country such as ours can hope for very little material support from that source.  A second, and perhaps a more remote consideration, I think, is beginning to appear upon the horizon.  Up <Col N="35" /> till now in the history of the world, the geographical position of Ireland made Ireland of very little territorial value to any other Power in the world.  It was separated from Europe by the island of England.  It was separated from the Continent of America by 3,000 miles of the Atlantic.  But the modern development of transatlantic transport by air makes Ireland an immensely desirable territory for any country desiring to establish regular air communications with the Continent of America, and I can well imagine that, if the influence of Great Britain declined and if she did not require to be consulted, it might very well suit one of the dictatorships of Europe to seek an opportunity of annexing at least a part of our territory in order to provide themselves with a jumping-off ground for the maintenance of transatlantic contact by air with the Continent of America.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that having won liberty by a fight which has gone on over seven centuries, we, of this generation, are faced with the appalling responsibility of keeping that liberty that those who went before us fought to get.  What I so gravely apprehend is that history might yet have to tell the story that having fought for seven centuries to get liberty, we did not hold it for more than two days, but threw it away through our own fault.  That brings me to what I believe is the fundamental policy in the whole of President de Valera's political philosophy.  He is perpetually maintaining up and down the country that he is no doctrinaire republican; that Fianna Fáil has never maintained that republicanism is the only form of liberty, but that you have to face the fact that people will not be content with less.  I absolutely deny that contention.  I say that the people will never be content with less than sovereign independence for a united Ireland.  I am quite convinced of that.  But it has been President de Valera's mission, ever since he came into public life in this country, to darken counsel and to blind our people in that very matter.  Since he first appeared on a <Col N="36" /> public platform he has sought to establish that sovereign independence is identical with republicanism, and that anyone who does not advocate republicanism does not believe in sovereign independence.  He has managed to confound in the minds of most of our people two ideas of independence and a republic, and to persuade, particularly the young, that in the absence of a republican form of government, you cannot have sovereign independence.  Having thus deluded them, he then gets up and protests that he is no doctrinaire republican, but that looking into his own heart he knows the people, and knows that they will not be content with anything but a republic, and so we get into a vicious circle.  The President tells the people: &ldquo;You will not be free until you have a republic,&rdquo; and the people say: &ldquo;We insist on being free,&rdquo; and therefore you must have a republic, and President de Valera says: &ldquo;Personally I do not care whether or not, but the people insist on having a republic,&rdquo; and so we get into a hopeless and endless circle of republicanism.</P>
    <P>I say again that our people want and will have sovereign independence with a united Ireland.  They can have, if they want it, to-morrow, a republic for so much of this country as this Parliament has jurisdiction over now, and knowing that they can have it, they are convinced that they are entitled to it by law and equity, if they wish to take it.  I say it would be the greatest catastrophe that could overtake this country if it should declare a republic, and I say that the day that republic is declared the sovereignty and the independence of this country are gone for ever, unless we fight another fight like what we fought during the last seven centuries to get it back again.  I believe we can get that sovereignty and that independence that our people really want and always wanted in a united Ireland in the Commonwealth of Nations, and I put it to Deputies, that at the present time the only possible means of securing national unity is on the basis of the Commonwealth.  I put it to Deputies that if we could establish national unity the religious bigotry&mdash;<Col N="37" /> and we have to face up to it&mdash;which is at the bottom of most of our troubles in the north-east would wilt and wither in an atmosphere similar to that which obtains in the Irish Free State at the present time.  No Protestant living amongst us, whether Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or belonging to any of the other branches of the Protestant faith, pretends that he feels the influence of any religious bigotry in the Irish Free State.  Admittedly, for some time after we got any kind of union in the North of Ireland, indications of bigotry would survive in that part of the country, because it has been so long established there, but I am convinced that with the passage of time and the growth of experience amongst our fellow-countrymen from living with us and working with us, they would come to realise that they would get as much respect and tolerance in a united Ireland as they would get in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Far from desiring to interfere with religious belief, there are many Catholics in this country who respect the Protestant who believes in and works for his Church, just as highly as they respect the Catholic or any member of any other Church who does the same.  I admit that it would take time.  You cannot wipe bigotry out in a moment, but I am convinced it would gradually disappear as it disappeared from the Irish Free State. The alternative to getting unity of some kind on the basis of the Commonwealth is to fight a civil war with at least four North-Eastern countries in order to force them into a republic. Leave Great Britain out of the question altogether.  Let us assume that Great Britain takes the view that we can have a republic for 32 counties and that it is no concern of theirs. It is my convinced belief that our people would have to go out and fight a civil war against our fellow-countrymen in the four North-Eastern counties in order to establish a republic; and I say that no republic and no national reunion would be worth a civil war of that character.  I believe that on the basis of the Commonwealth we can do far more&mdash;first, to secure national unity, and, secondly, to use our influence in the world to promote the <Col N="38" /> political ideals which our people believe in.  Anyone looking around the world to-day sees that democracy and individual liberty are losing on one front after another.  We stand for these two fundamental doctrines, and my submission to the House is that unless the nations of the world who believe in these fundamental principles are prepared to draw closer together for their mutual advantage, they are going to be destroyed, one after another, by dictatorships that want to destroy them.  You have got to face this fact: that a dictatorship is a much more efficient Government in external politics, a much more efficient instrument of external politics than a democratic Government.  A dictator does what he wants to do, before a democratic Government has time to make up its mind what it will do or might do.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the Commonwealth of Nations we can help that body to develop as we have helped it to develop in the past and that in time we can use our influence in it to make out of the Commonwealth of Nations a framework into which can be fitted every sovereign democratic nation in the world that is prepared to co-operate against tyranny and against violence such as are represented by the dictators of the Right and of the Left on the Continent of Europe at the present time.  I see no reason why, in the light of the immense constitutional development that has taken place in the British Commonwealth of Nations during the last 15 years, we should not hope that our destiny in the Commonwealth would be to lead along the line of closer co-operation between the nations of the Commonwealth and the United States of America.  I believe we might hope to lend a hand in breaking down that modern curse of Babel, economic nationalism, through such an approach. I believe along those lines we might be able to build up economic ties between the United States of America and the nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, which would lead to bigger things in the future.  In that connection, I ask Deputies to remember that we are the one country in the world of which it can be said that our people are to be found in every part <Col N="39" /> of the Commonwealth of Nations, and are also to be found in every part of the United States of America.  In every part of the world where they are to be found they are an influential body.  They are respected by their fellow-citizens and they pull great weight in the politics of the several States in which they dwell.  We can admittedly be a great and far-flung power for evil if we desire to use our people for the creation of disruption wherever they may be, but we can also be one of the greatest powers in the world for the drawing together of democratic peoples if we choose to function in that way.</P>
    <P>I want our people to have the advantages of the Commonwealth of Nations for another reason, and I ask the House to consider this particular matter to which I direct their attention.  We hear a lot recently of countries with overflowing populations, countries which are justified in demanding facilities for expansion.  I put it to this House that we are a Catholic country mainly.  The policy of the Government is to sub-divide the land and settle the people on it.  The people are going to marry and may have families, families with a comparatively large number of children.  The tendency of our population is going to be towards an increase, and the more we divide land and settle our people on it, the more rapidly that increase is likely to go on.  At some period, the time is going to come when our population will increase in this country to such a point that either the standard of living must fall down to that at which it stood when this country maintained 8,000,000, 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 people, or else our people must emigrate.  When that time comes for emigration our people must either emigrate to countries where they will be welcome or do as the Italian people are attempting to do&mdash;rob their neighbours and take from them what they have.  There are, of course, some people who will say, &ldquo;We shall bid the devil good morrow when we meet him,&rdquo; but what I want to make the House realise is that the population problem may become either a nightmare, or the greatest blessing that could be bestowed on this country.  Unless it is faced now and intelligently planned for, <Col N="40" /> it may become a nightmare, but if it is looked forward to, and harnessed for the advantage of this country and of the things for which this country stands, it may be a great blessing, not only for Ireland but for the whole world as well.</P>
    <P>I know in this country it has become fashionable to deplore emigration as a dreadful plague.  I said a few days ago that I should welcome an opportunity to say a few words on the subject of emigration and I am glad to have that opportunity now.  Emigration of the kind to which we were used in this country was, no doubt, a horrible scourge&mdash;the emigration which arose out of people being driven out of this country in hunger and in starvation, to land in a strange clime impoverished and miserable.  That is horrible and that is the kind of emigration that no Government could stand for.  But the emigration of an enterprising people going out to take the world before them &mdash;is there anything wrong in that?  Did emigration from Great Britain during the three centuries from 1500 to 1800 do Great Britain any harm?  Has any Deputy in this House met an emigrant from this country who went out in comfortable circumstances in the last 40 years who regretted his going?  Has any Deputy who has been in the United States of America recently, and met our people there, met any of them who ever regretted having gone to America or who had not done something to contribute to the greatness of this country through their activities in that country and through their ability to send home money to improve the lot of their people at home?  None that I ever met.</P>
    <P>They were respected citizens wherever they were.  They were beholden to nobody.  They had built up their fortunes with their own hands. They were proud of their achievement and they were glad to come back and visit the old country, but quite content to have founded a new home and, in fact, in founding it, they were betraying none of the traditional loyalty for or devotion to the home country. Rather, in doing so they had made a contribution to the greatness and the glory of the country from which they sprung.  I say emigration along these lines can be a great blessing to the country from which it flows.  I say that <Col N="41" /> when the population of this country grows, as it must grow, the time will come when our people must make up their minds: are they going to emigrate peacefully to countries where they are wanted or are they going to seize territory from somebody else?  If they are going to conquer and annex, which territory are they going to take?  If they are not going to conquer and annex, and if they find that they will be prohibited from entering any country which is outside the British Commonwealth of Nations, where will they go? I want them to have that whole great undeveloped territory which has been largely peopled up to now by the children of our people.  I want them to have New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the other undeveloped countries of the Commonwealth of Nations to which they will be free to go if they want to go and to which nobody will be in a conspiracy to send them.  I want our people to inherit that.  I want them to have a chance to build up a fuller life than they can hope for in the insular construction of a small island like this, with a steadily growing population. That may be a remote problem, but it is one that any Government must look forward to, and that is the reason I ask the President of the Executive Council to look forward to it to-day. Many people think that that is an extravagant position because many of them divorce this country from Great Britain and from the Dominions, though in my opinion Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa stand in the same relation to Great Britain and this country as we do in relation to them.</P>
    <P>I see at present thousands and tens of thousands of our people going over to Great Britain in the hope of earning their living.  They go over there in the hope of earning a livelihood that they cannot get in this country, where we have only 3,000,000 people.  I want for them an opening there, not as hewers of wood and drawers of water, a position into which many of our people are driven when going to Great Britain at the present time.  We want an opening there for our professional men.  We want an opening for the sons of our people that will enable them to go out and <Col N="42" /> conquer, and to be able to take up their places in the life of that country.  I know in what awful conditions their fathers and grandfathers went to America, leaving it to their sons and to their descendants to work their way up to the top.  We want them to go there thoroughly equipped to take their rightful places in that great community amongst which they go to live.  We want opportunity for those who desire to go, and resources here to equip them properly for any enterprise that they are determined to put their hands to.</P>
    <P>Let me direct attention to this.  I speak of the solemn obligation there is upon us to keep the liberty that has been won for us.  For 700 years we tried to make allies of Great Britain's enemies.  But, time and time again, in the hour of crisis, the enemies of Great Britain abandoned us when it suited their hand.  The French failed to stand beside us to fight for our liberty, when it no longer suited them to do so, and the French fleet went home and left us and our poor people to the hanging and the pitch-cap of the British Government.  In 1916, when the people of this country were engaged in the struggle against the British Government, the German Government led us to believe that our people might look to them for help and succour, but when the time came we were left to bear the brunt of the battle.  I want our people, for the first time in our history, to make allies of England's friends.  Having depended upon their enemies time and again, and having been abandoned in our struggle, and in our time of need, I want to take this opportunity of pointing out that we might do well to depend in the future, and in any future conflict that might take place, upon the friends of Great Britain, with Ireland functioning as a sovereign State, and equal in her freedom and sovereignty with Britain herself, Canada, New Zealand or Australia.  With Ireland standing upon her own feet with complete sovereignty, if Britain attempted to interfere or impair her rights, she would find herself warned by other nations, members of the Commonwealth of Nations, lest they too might <Col N="43" /> find the sovereignty they claimed at present impaired or destroyed in the future.  That is the position at the present time, and that is the stand this country should take in order to gain full advantage at the present time. Great Britain does not know what this country will be in 100 years' time. She does not know what she herself will be in a hundred years' time.  But on the basis I have indicated we could establish an understanding of mutual respect, because it will be founded on the recognition that neither is a potential enemy of the other.  Take the political States in Europe at the present time.  Take Austria, one of the oldest and noblest nations on the Continent, reduced now to her small and impotent size, and by virtue of the war similar in her relationship to Germany that Ireland was with Great Britain.  The Chancellor of Austria is continually, at the present time, in Rome.</P>
    <P>All the people of Europe freely say that the influence of the Roman Government is permanent in Vienna. Others speculate that the influence of Berlin outweighs it.  But nobody ever suggests that the influence of the Austrian Government is the final determining factor.  We have ourselves seen other small nations of different sizes depending on one great power or another, in fact causing the position of sovereignty and independence for them to be bound up in commercial and international politics.  Any Deputy with any experience of foreign politics knows that if the position is not naturally developed by the use of organisation and trade, in war a great nation can make the position of the small nation for the time impossible by economic and diplomatic pressure of one kind or another if it desires to do so.  I do not want this country to be bound up in such an international combination. If we have independent sovereignty let us determine how it is to be used with our people conscious of what they are doing and let us not have a fictitious sovereignty which is to be placed at the service of some nation that chooses to use us for its own international intrigue.  If this House had <Col N="44" /> the courage to establish a republic. where, might I ask, would we find ourselves? We might be in a hopeless position.  The Dominions might begin to think that their position was inferior to that which we could accept. But we have to-day a position in which the status of every member of the Commonwealth is acceptable to men of the most delicate national feeling and should be equally acceptable to us. Unless we accept that we may walk straight ahead into the dangerous and disastrous position of becoming a State, sovereign in name, but in fact a mere messenger-boy of any European Power that wished to dominate us in future. If we were to declare a republic that would be our position.  If we adhere to the Commonwealth we become a sovereign State, working and developing our powers as a sovereign State, and exercising our power throughout the whole world in order to promote things we believe in.</P>
    <P>If we declare a republic let us face the facts.  Let us assume that we declare that as a courteous act, and without the slightest anger to Great Britain in the process.  There are alien laws in Great Britain against the Dutch, the French, and the Germans and the Greeks, and such laws would operate against our people if we declared a republic.  What then is going to happen to the thousands of men and women from this country who go to Great Britain every year and go to work there and secure a welcome there and depend for their livelihood upon what they earn there?  What is to happen to the thousands and tens of thousands of engineers and other professional men sent out of this country to earn a living and always finding the means of earning such living in Great Britain and in all parts of the Dominions?  Are we to abandon the position that we have acquired in that great association&mdash;a position largely acquired through the skill and ability of the first Government of Saorstát Eireann, which, admittedly, went into an Empire that was distasteful to every Nationalist element in the country, but went into it with the knowledge that they had an instrument in their hands whereby they could so remodel that Empire as to make it <Col N="45" /> something which would astonish their successors and even make it something far freer, far bigger and far more consistent with the demand for sovereignty and independence for which this country has always stood, than anything contained in the proposals put forward by President de Valera in 1924?  Admitting that Document No. 2 was an advance on the Treaty, my case is that, having walked into something that was unacceptable, these men brought to pass something that Document No. 2 did not contemplate and made this country the equal of any sovereign State in the world.  It is because I have seen with admiration a body of Irish statesmen able to convert that mighty organisation into an exquisite instrument of constitutional development, which has held together through the shocks and horrors of this extremely difficult period when other States have been shattered; it is because this extraordinary constitutional conception, for which our people are largely responsible, has weathered the storm and is weathering the storm as no other association of peoples in the world is doing, that I do not want to exchange our place in it for a republic whose voice on world affairs would count for nothing, whose trade would be precarious in the last degree and which would be open to the attacks of any Power which wanted to assail it, because we would have nobody joined to us to defend our interests.</P>
    <P>I do not desire that we should sink into the parish pump mentality of a small nation, withdrawn from the current of world affairs.  I believe that our nation has a higher destiny in the world than the taking up of that position.  I do want to go on doing in the world what our people had the genius, the ability and the courage to do.  I believe that the distribution of our people all over the world resulted not only in material prosperity to the country whence they came but that, in their spreading, they carried with them something that has been turned to useful purpose and something that was badly needed to protect liberty and democracy in the world.  I believe that individual liberty and <Col N="46" /> democracy are in imminent peril.  I believe, oddly enough, that this little country can save them.  I believe we can do that by acting as the link to draw the association of nations to which we belong nearer and closer to the association known as the United States of America.  When we have done that, I believe that we shall create a bloc of people believing in the political philosophy to which we subscribe which will be sufficiently powerful to resist the threat of any conspiracy against us and I believe that, having once made such a bloc, having once declared our readiness and irrevocable intention to defend, by whatever means may be necessary, the political philosophy for which we stand&mdash;at that moment we shall start to roll back the tide of barbarism that threatens the world from Russia, Germany and Italy, and set the world back on the sound road of freedom, the sound road of greater freedom of trade and set going a movement by the peoples of the world towards democracy, individual liberty and all those things which make it possible for the ordinary, plain people of every country to live happily.  In that way we could establish an order of things in which not only the few who happen to be in the good graces of a given dictator would have all the goods of this world but where the plain people of every nation, adhering to the things we believe in, would share and share about whatever material prosperity their own particular country had to offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am personally opposed to this Vote because, as the President and the Government have always stood, so they stand now, for a policy the only effect of which is to perpetuate uncertainty, unrest and hysteria in every sphere of public life, national, political and economic. The Government Party always stood for that uncertainty and that hysteria of which I speak.  That was the position before they came into office. It is so now that they are in office. I am prepared to admit that, to some slight extent, but by no means to the extent that the nation has the right to expect, the responsibility of <Col N="47" /> office has calmed that hysteria so far as they are individually concerned. But that revolutionary type of mind, that desire to destroy and upset which characterised them throughout their political career still clings to them.  It is still their outstanding characteristic and no clothing of it with legal formalities will get rid of the basic evil of their policy.  I sincerely and strongly hope that their conversion to legal methods is full, complete and permanent and that it is not merely a momentary conversion. I hope it is not merely a symbol of the declaration we so often hear from the Government Benches&mdash;both front and back benches&mdash;&ldquo;We have the majority and the majority has to be obeyed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that their conversion to legal methods is not of temporary and passing character but that it is something more valuable and more permanent. But to what does their policy amount all along the line?  Can anybody say what they stand for or what they wish?  The man who is responsible for this Estimate may be able to &mdash;or shall I express my meaning more correctly&mdash;may think that he can do so.  But does the public, or do his opponents inside of this House or outside of this House, or do the members of his own Party think or know what they stand for?  Do they know with what Constitution he is anxious to present this country, or, as they would prefer it now that they have got a majority, to impose upon the country? Deputies can see by to-day's paper an adumbration of the proposed Constitution. Can anybody tell whether that is a republic or not?  Can anybody tell whether it is a Constitution for the whole of Ireland or for the Twenty-Six Counties?  Is it not likely from what we know of that Party that anything that comes out of their deliberations will not be in the direction of calming the people but rather in the direction of keeping them in that state of hysteria to which I have referred?  So far as concerns the relations between the Twenty-Six Counties and the whole of Ireland, the solution, from every indication they <Col N="48" /> have given and from their whole mentality, appears to be that we will have a Constitution that south of the Border will be described as a Constitution for the whole of Ireland and north of the Border as a Constitution for the Twenty-Six Counties.  The latter is what it will be north of the Border and beyond the Irish Sea.  We will claim jurisdiction over the thirty-two counties but we will take good care not to exercise it&mdash;not to act upon it, except over the twenty-six.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;  We heard that particular maxim before from a predecessor of the present ruler.  We have heard it from a man whose interference with this country by his wait and see policy was not so very successful.  The country cannot afford to wait and see any more than it could afford to wait and see in the time of his predecessor. We know the disaster that flowed from that particular policy of &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;  We know the effect it had for a number of years on this country.  We here on this side are trying to find out what is in the mind of the President and in the mind of the Government, that is if there is anything definite in the mind of the President.  I am suggesting that there is nothing definite. I am suggesting that he wants to have two contradictory things.  He wants a Constitution for the Twenty-Six Counties and a Constitution for the whole of Ireland, with one interpretation for the people north of the Border and another for the people south of the Border.  And that sort of thing is to satisfy patriotic Irishmen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not present to hear the elaborate statement of his policy that the President gave when he introduced this Estimate to-day.  He had his opportunity of enlightening the public on these factors in which the public is interested.  If the President will use <Col N="49" /> his eloquence to the extent that he used it to-day, how can he expect the Opposition to discuss the things that he refused to put before the House? He had his opportunity.  Let us turn now to another subject; can anybody tell his policy with regard to the markets in Great Britain?  In this case again he is having it both ways. What is his policy there?  You might gather from the policy that the Government sometimes pursues that the British market is a most valuable one, that it cannot be done without. Is that his policy now?  Or is his policy that we must be entirely self-contained, that we should do away with that market and that the economic war pursued by the Government which threatened to deprive us of that market is a blessing?</P>
      <P>On which side does the President stand?  Or is he in the uncomfortable position in economic as in political matters of, so to speak, having one leg on one side of the Border and in England and another leg south of the Border?  This is the Government that expects us to take it seriously! That is the Government that on any important question of policy always speaks with a voice that is ambiguous.  That is the Government that is continually trying to advance in two opposite directions in every sphere of national life.  At one moment we have it saying that the British market is gone, and at another moment we have it saying that we must keep that market at a very heavy price.</P>

      <P>Yes, quotations will be useful.  We remember the blessing in disguise.  As I asked last week&mdash;is the blessing now gone entirely and is the only thing that stands forth the disguise?  Is that not obvious to the Government themselves?  In that, one of the most vital things that this country has to face, can any member of the Government Party suggest that the Government has a policy?  Is that policy not a policy as usual of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no,&rdquo; a policy that stands for a complete cutting off of the British market and at the same time stands for the full utilisation of that market? <Col N="50" /> They have both at the same time &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Richard &ldquo;aye&rdquo; and &ldquo;nay&rdquo; gives place to Eamon &ldquo;níl&rdquo; and &ldquo;tá.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When you turn to the policy of defence are we not exactly in the same position?  What do we stand for there?  If sense can be made out of what was certainly the long expositions that were given by the President last week, does it not come to this&mdash; that in the last resort the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;if we are being overwhelmed, is our principal line of defence?  Is Great Britain not our ultimate defender and our only enemy?  That is the policy of the Government where defence is concerned.  Our only enemy is our defender.  We have heard &ldquo;the only enemy&rdquo; so often from the front benches of the Ministry! Does the President stand for it, or is he so unacquainted with international affairs in his Presidential capacity, if not in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, as to take it that hatreds and emotions of the kind we sometimes see trotted out here are the things that will determine whether or not this country will be attacked.  He must know perfectly well that any relations we have with Europe, any relations we have with the British, or the absence of any relation beyond the fact that they know of our existence, are things that will not weigh one ounce in the balance if it is in the interests of any European country to attack this land of ours with overwhelming forces. They will do it; they will attack us whether they like us or whether they hate us.  These emotions of like or dislike will not weigh with them.  It is not by these considerations that European nations shape their policy. Then what is our line of defence?  To hope when the catastrophe is on us that we can go to our only enemy and principal line of defence!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Government that preaches excellent maxims when it comes to dealing with international relations between others, but when there is a chance of putting these maxims, excellent as they are, into practice, when we ourselves are concerned, we notice that these maxims are highly honoured in the breach.  Goodwill, but not in <Col N="51" /> the one place where it will count; not in the one place where we could exercise it; not in the one place where we could give any reality to our expressions of goodwill; not in the one place where the exercise of it would be of untold benefit to our own people.  Tá and níl, níl and tá&mdash;yes, I mean no; and no, I mean yes.  That is the policy that is to save this country.  By their policy, as they know perfectly well, and as was made clear to them&mdash;we can judge this at all events by their actions &mdash;economically they succeeded in bringing this country to the last gasp. Then, with their coal-cattle pacts of last year and this year, they tried to give the patient oxygen, and the patient is still breathing and they are satisfied.  And they call that a policy!</P>
    <P>We will admit that the oxygen they gave the patient was necessary, absolutely necessary, and they can at least claim this much credit, that the patient would have died if the oxygen had not been given at the precise moment it was given.  But they are peculiar doctors, because the very same doctors who administered the oxygen were the people who brought the patient to that extremity&mdash;they and their policy.  They are satisfied with keeping the patient breathing, with keeping the breath of life in him; they make no effort to restore the patient's health.  That is having a policy! It is for that the President and his Ministry stand&mdash; nothing definite, unrest everywhere, uncertainty everywhere.</P>
    <P>They know perfectly well that politically they thrive on that unrest and uncertainty.  It is in the hope of perpetuating unrest and uncertainty that they are looking forward to the next five or six months of their political career.  They have thriven upon in. The country suffered severely; but they have thriven upon it, and the policy is to be continued&mdash;no certainty, no coming to rest, the country must be continually whipped up.  Often the very best thing they can do is to boast to their followers of the manner in which they have raised a number of problems which they are unable to solve, raised a number of unnecessary controversies which might much better have been left <Col N="52" /> in the limbo to which they had been consigned in the past.  They have kept alive these controversies, not in the interests of the nation, but in the interests of the political life of their own Party.</P>
    <P>Have they any policy except obstinacy?  The President has boasted again and again that he is not a doctrinaire republican.  If he is not, I should like to know what is a doctrinaire republican?  Is he not sacrificing this country and the interests of this country to things that are as good will-o'-the-wisps as any doctrinaire republicanism? What advantage has he got in honour, in increase of liberty, in the prestige, or the material prosperity of the country by the manner in which this country has been asked to sacrifice practically everything&mdash;its interests, its prestige and its material prosperity?  When he comes forward with a Constitution which may satisfy himself, but that probably, as we warned him before about some of the people that he intended to conciliate, will not satisfy them, he will say that they are unreasonable, that it satisfies him.  He had the same argument when he asked the House to remove the Oath; that he did it to promote the peace of the country.  Henceforth no one would have any excuse for not entering this Parliament.  He was told quite clearly that the argument was not worth the utterance, that the very people who refused to come into this House before would have the same attitude towards it.  Has his experience convinced him that he was wrong?  Does any experience ever convince the President that he is wrong?  I see by his smile that it does not.  He knows perfectly well that it does not.  It is the other people who are wrong.  They ought to come in and be satisfied.</P>
    <P>For that internal peace and prosperity, that gentleness, that acceptance of the rule of the majority that was to follow the removal of the Oath, for everything which did not come, we sacrificed our settlement with our principal customer.  We have not a policy.  We simply have the Executive Council floundering about, trying at the same time to travel in two opposite directions, and expecting applause from <Col N="53" /> the country for so travelling.  This is one of the serious results of the line they have taken.  Just as their actions several years ago caused not merely great material damage to this country, but still greater moral damage, and to a large extent broke the spirit of the people, their policy now is doing the same thing.  It is breaking the spirit of the people, and that damage to the morale of the people is more important even than the great material damage they are doing by their economic policy and their dispute with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>When we look to the economic future of this country we see in future a repetition of the catastrophe that befell us in the past.  Partly owing to matters that were not our fault, but subsequently, owing to things that were purely our own fault, we failed to take full advantage of the boom after the war.  Then, in the end of the 20's and the beginning of the 30's, there was a period of depression. Now, when Europe, and particularly when our principal market is recovering from that depression, owing to the policy of the Government this country is not in a position to utilise that advantage to the full.  Again, we are going to be left behind in the race. Again, the interests of this country are going to be sacrificed to the mere doctrinairism of the political Party opposite.  And all for what?  For what nobody can be clear about, except possibly the Government themselves.</P>
    <P>Again and again we have challenged the President and the Government to give any definite concrete cases in which the liberties of this Free State were interfered with by Powers outside. I have waited for any serious cases of that kind.  The President, in his other capacity as Minister for External Affairs, knows perfectly well what goes on in Europe.  He need only have kept his ears open at Geneva to know the pressure brought to bear on every seemingly fully independent middle-sized and small State in Europe.  Has he ever experienced any pressure brought to bear upon him in the shaping of the internal or external policy of this country?  If he has, then he had a different experience during his four years of office <Col N="54" /> from what we had during our period of office.  Has there been a single interference with our liberty?  Does he not know perfectly well that if he had a republic in the morning there would be such interference, or does he think that we should be the exception to the whole of Europe?</P>
    <P>I remember being congratulated on one occasion, after making a speech in the assembly of the League of Nations, by the representative of a middle-sized Power who said to me: &ldquo;I thoroughly agree with you, and I would have liked to have made that speech.&rdquo;  I thanked him, of course, for his nice words, but I felt inclined to ask him: &ldquo;Why in the world did you not make it then?&rdquo; I knew perfectly well why he did not make it. It is true that we were there as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and that he was, so far as appearances went, the representative of a country that was fully independent. I found in that assembly of the nations that we could take up a line of independence that very few other nations could take up, and I should be surprised if the experience of the President is any different from that. A great deal of the prestige that we did enjoy was due to the peculiar position that we occupied.  I remember, when we were seeking support for our membership of the Council of the League of Nations, that we had to approach the representatives of the different States.  When doing that there was one argument that we did not put forward because we knew it weighed heavily with every person there: the influence that they thought we might exert on the policy of the British Commonwealth of Nations. There was another argument that did appeal to important people in the League and that did help us to get support: that is the unique position that we occupy in the Commonwealth and in the world as a result of the large numbers of our race who have gone to the United States of America. Now you are going to throw away at least one half of that prestige that comes to you owing to your membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  If you are to go on to the Republic under the banner of &ldquo;Eamon <Col N="55" /> Níl and Tá,&rdquo; whatever kind of republic it is, I have no doubt your republic will be quite as characterless and featureless as the banner under which we are asked to advance forward to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine, at a time like this, when the country is suffering from one political shock after another, that the President, in introducing his Estimate, would at least be sufficiently frank and open with the Dáil and the country to give the House some brief outline as to what the Government policy is on any of the matters that are disturbing the country at the present moment.  We have his lieutenants and satellites outside of this Assembly at the present moment urging all and sundry to support the national policy of Fianna Fáil, and inside the Parliament we have the leader of the Government refusing point blank to give any outline or indication as to what his national policy is, or the national policy of Fianna Fáil, on any of the matters affecting the country.  It is rather unmanly and unworthy, and it is certainly definitely discourteous to the members of this House, to have the President's Vote hurled at the Assembly without telling them anything about it.  The last word will lie with the President.  He will outline his policy when nobody can discuss it or follow him, and that, I suppose, is regarded as a piece of national statemanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that there are as many people opposite as there are on this side of the House who do not know under heaven what the Government policy is on any particular point.  They talk and mouth republicanism, and they jail republicans.  They disown and discredit the Irish Free State, sapping and undermining it at home, and jeopardising its position abroad.  With all that destruction, it is replaced by nothing better, and when the President is invited to say what he has in mind to replace it, he blandly refuses and says &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;  We destroy the Seanad one week, and, in a panic the following week, we get together a mixed committee to draft proposals for <Col N="56" /> some other kind of Seanad, and even then there is not sufficient leadership to say to the members of that committee whether there will or will not be bicameral government in this country. Behind that kind of double-shuffle policy, we are asked to vote money on a pig and poke policy&mdash;&ldquo;supply the money and we will tell you afterwards what it is for.&rdquo;  Political business, State business or business of any other type should not be run on such lines. Every member of this House is a representative of the taxpayers outside, and Deputies, each and all, are entitled to know what policy they are asked to subscribe money for before they meekly and tamely troop into one lobby or the other to vote the huge sums of money asked for.</P>
    <P>We have at least this to guide us: that on every matter of major policy during the last 12 years on which the President took any kind of a determined stand, it was only a matter of time until he had to admit that he was wrong and follow the example set by Deputies on this side of the House. There was a time when the major policy dividing and disturbing this country was the repudiation of the Treaty <i>in toto.</i>  Some years later we had the President expressing his amazement at the developments that had taken place within that instrument, and at the potential powers that lay withing it for further extension and development.  The next matter of major policy on which the country was torn and divided was the advisability of elected Deputies coming into this Assembly.  Time and experience showed that the President in that matter also was very definitely and emphatically wrong in the view that he took.  Then, some years subsequently, we had the country again torn and divided as to the necessity for giving very full and ample powers to the Executive Council to grapple with lawlessness outside. We were likened to &ldquo;Bloody Balfour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cromwell,&rdquo; and told that, when the Ministers of the time found it necessary to invoke and to ask for such powers, it was time for them to quit, and that, if the country could not be ruled without such weapons, it was time <Col N="57" /> for those who attempted to rule with such weapons to get out and make way for better men.  On that matter, too, which was one of major policy, time and experience showed that the President was wrong.  We have that instrument now in daily use right through the country, north, south, east and west, the jail gates slamming and clamming on men whose crime is that they have followed the teachings of the President in the past.  And with that to guide us, is it in any way unusual or is it an extraordinary demand that we should expect the President, when introducing his Estimate, to give some outline of Government policy rather than to tell us to wait and see?  There are a number in this House who are sufficiently docile or sufficiently irresponsible with regard to the functions they are sent here to fulfil, to accept that kind of a statement and recklessly to vote, and the only suggestion made is to wait and see.</P>
    <P>The next matter of major policy that divided the country was this question of trade or no trade with Great Britain, this question of retaining the annuities.  When we told the President he would bleed the country white if he persisted in trying to build up any economy here that did not provide money from abroad for our surplus products, we were scoffed at, jeered at.  That was a pro-British attitude, but three years later we had the big retreat sounded and we had a panicky, patchwork deal done between this country and Great Britain, known as the coal-cattle-cement pact, that got a slightly increased outlet for our produce into the British market but in return pawned three-fourths of the trade of this country to the nation that the President habitually describes as our ancient enemy.  Incidentally, within that pact we had a dismal retreat from the originally declared intention of retaining the annuities.  We had, by inter-Government Pact, a decision taken to guarantee to Great Britain every red halfpenny of the annuities previously paid, and still we had the obstacles in the path of trade, still we had a mortgage on the coal trade, on the cement trade, the iron and <Col N="58" /> steel trade and on electrical appliances and we were told by politicians that that is the way to lead the country on to prosperity and that is the way to develop the independence already won.</P>
    <P>Independence is merely a cheap, hypocritical phrase if it does not contain within it fiscal independence, financial liberty.  The fiscal independence that was there before the present Government sat opposite is being rapidly pawned to the only country in the world that the people opposite regard as hostile or unfriendly.  A nation in pawn, with its trade pawned, with its fiscal independence fettered, can never, whether it is a republic or anything else, claim to have within it any of the essentials of freedom.  Doubtless within a year or two we will hear that that was all wrong, that the right market and the only market was the British market.  Then there will be another turn, a reversal of policy, and while the policy is being reversed we will hear declarations that that was what we always stood for. Now when we ask &ldquo;What is your policy,&rdquo; the only answer we get is to &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only policy that I see is the studied policy of providing one political thrill after another, the policy of once or twice a year giving the country a kind of political shock so as to take attention away from the ills and the evils that are gradually eating into this State of ours.  It is like the old plan practised by quack doctors at country fairs.  When a person goes in suffering from a toothache that person gets an electric shock to some part of his body.  The toothache is temporarily cured.  The person has forgotten about the toothache because of the severity of the shock, but when the shock, the excitement, is over, the toothache returns with added force and, in addition, you have a patient with shattered nerves, rattled and undermined by the violence of the shock.  For the last four years we have had that studied, deliberate policy of political shocks once or twice a year, not in order to achieve any result, but merely with the object of giving the <Col N="59" /> public a shock and distracting attention from the conditions that exist and are spreading throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is to take attention away from the fact that any mean robber would never raid the larders of the poor to the extent that they are being raided by the present Government in their frenzied attempt to get more and more millions to splash around. One thrill after another to take public attention off the fact that the whole agricultural community is going rapidly to the point of bankruptcy. One political shock after another to take the public attention off the fact that, far from fulfilling the promises contained in the Fianna Fáil plan, from 100,000 to 150,000 human beings are out of work, unemployed, and sentenced to live and rear families on the bread of charity.  In a situation like that, with circumstances such as those, the President finds nothing to do other than to indulge in Constitution mongering to provide another political thrill, anything rather than get down to the job of work that is there in front of him and still undone.</P>
    <P>It is a modern example of Nero fiddling.  Anything to side-track the hard work, the thankless, unpopular task of administering a country along decent lines.  It is just like the pickpocket gang on a race-course.  One member of the gang creates a disturbance. Everybody looks in that direction.  There is a bit of a crowd around, and the other fellow works the trade on the back pockets.  That is just like the policy of distracting attention by political excitement and picking the pockets of the people while that is going on.  No single piece of construction. University franchise destroyed, the Seanad destroyed, the good relations that existed between this country and Great Britain destroyed; the external trade of the country destroved, the internal activity that was giving work within the country destroyed, and what is constructed? Political theories, political plans, political propaganda; no work, no achievement, no results.  We reach finally the point where all that is admitted and confessed by the Presidential <Col N="60" /> silence in slinging his Estimate at the House.  There was then an ideal and ample opportunity for giving a full and comprehensive outline of Government policy, but it was shirked from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  We will hear it all too late, when nobody can deal with it. When no questions can be asked we will have once again the effeminate trick of getting in the last word&mdash;then out of the seat and out of the House. That is no way to treat a country or a Parliament even in good times, but it is certainly no way to treat a country which is going through the times that this country is going through.</P>
    <P>You are asking the people now and then to continue making sacrifices. To continue making sacrifices, for what?  To be told to wait and see; to continue making sacrifices while politicians parley behind the scenes, and while the results of those parleys are being deliberately withheld from the public.  We have speeches from the President abroad on open diplomacy and open negotiations.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;Practise what you preach.&rdquo;  Have there been any open negotiations or open diplomacy here at home?  We have couriers and ambassadors and intermediaries hopping from here to Great Britain like so many active fleas, but not once since the first sacrifices were demanded of farmers and labourers in this country has there been any frankness, has there been any consultation with Parliament, or has there been any disclosure to the public of what is on offer.  We have a group, a caucus, for political reasons turning down one offer after another. We know that the present Executive is in the main a one man show.  Is this country to continue down the path of poverty because of the will or the theory of one man whose claim to notoriety in this country is the number of major political blunders he has made and the number of times he has had to retrace his steps and recant the doctrines previously preached?</P>
    <P>We have a growing evil in this country which we were told by the President some years ago did not exist, but it is sufficient in volume now to get an open invitation by a Minister of the Government to take to the open platform <Col N="61" /> and spread their propaganda all over this country.  We had an invitation on behalf of the Executive Council, through the mouth of the Minister for Agriculture, to those who stand for Soviet rule in this country to spread their propaganda through the instrument of public platforms in this country.  They are of sufficient importance now to get a special invitation from and on behalf of the Executive Council to take to the crossroads and the open platform.  We have a state of affairs growing up in the country where you have anything from 20,000 to 100,000 credit-bad farmers&mdash;credit-bad farmers in the opinion of a State Department&mdash;whose debts are so high and whose outlook is so hopeless that even a State Department specially established to assist farmers finds them credit-bad.  If we reckon that only one in four of the absolutely-depressed cases seeks assistance from that particular Department, what is the appalling figure we arrive at? Whether the figure is 25,000 or 50,000 or 100,000 credit-bad farmers, what is the outlook for them, what is the outlook for their families, and in what direction are the boys in those houses to go, left or right, with hope stolen from their hearts, with the State's stamp on them as credit-bad, having tried for help locally, having tried for help centrally, branded as credit-bad, and &ldquo;broke&rdquo; to the world?</P>
    <P>Is not that way to manufacture Communists?  Are you not producing them by the tens of thousands?  The way to produce Communism even in a strong man is to break him first and then rob him of hope.  When that situation exists in the agricultural community, and is growing and increasing from day to day, is that the time to invite Communists to step out in the open with their pernicious propaganda? Is that the time for Government Ministers to be engaged in Constitution-mongering and creating more difficulties and more disabilities for 80 per cent. of the trade of this country?  When that is happening, when people are becoming poorer, and when the State machine is becoming more and more extortionate in its demands, is that the time for the President, in introducing his Estimate, to <Col N="62" /> refuse to make any statement of policy?</P>
    <P>In the past we had charges hurled across at members on these benches that the farmers could pay quite well were it not for the political drive of the Fine Gael Party, that failure to pay rates was undoubtedly due to a political conspiracy; that failure to pay annuities was also due to a political conspiracy.  If one or other was due to a political conspiracy, why have you the appalling number of credit-bad farmers?  Why have you stock being sold?  Why have you the whole agricultural community realising at any price anything that can be sold for a few &ldquo;bob&rdquo; or a few pounds? Why have the cattle of the country been reduced in number by 120,000 as against 1931?  Why has the number of sheep been reduced by considerably over 500,000?  Why has the number of pigs been reduced by nearly 200,000?  Why has the number of horses been reduced by 30,000, and why has the number of poultry been reduced by 3,500,000?  Is it not clear that what the unfortunate farmers are doing is selling anything that will produce the money to meet the overhead charges of two Governments&mdash;to pay the annuities to the British Government, to pay half as much to an Irish Government, and to pay the increasing rates year after year?  When the President was on these benches, when prices were better, and when politicians threw no obstacle between the producers of this country and the purchasers abroad, we had the President waxing hot and eloquent with regard to the oppressive and crushing overhead charges on agriculture in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There again, are we to accept his present attitude as another change of policy on a major matter?  Is he now going to admit that, when he spoke from these benches, he did not know what he was talking about, or that he was playing the part of a man talking cheap insincerities for political reasons and that now, when he is over there, he is going, not only to regard those overhead charges as being reasonable, but that, with trade interrupted and interfered with, the community can bear greatly increased <Col N="63" /> overhead charges?  Surely, in introducing an Estimate such as this, we could have some indication as to the President's policies on matters of such grave importance as those?  Is it the position that, after four years of political nonsense, we have now entered into a bond between the Irish Government and the British Government to mulct the farmers of this country for every penny of the money that was heretofore paid&mdash;every fraction of the £5,000,000&mdash;and that, not being content with retreating back to the position of paying every single halfpenny, we mortgage, in order to sweeten the payment, one-third or two-thirds of the import trade of this country?  Does the President hold that that is an advance from the position five years ago, when you paid that £5,000,000, certainly, but when you at least had fiscal independence and bought your goods from any country in the whole world?</P>
    <P>The result of the President's policy is nationally disastrous in so far as it has taught the youngest boy in this country the amount of our dependence on an outside country, and in addition it has taught the people in that outside country our excessive vulnerability on certain points.  As long as our goods were going into that British market day after day and month after month, there was no farmer in Great Britain or no politician in Great Britain that ever paused to think how dependent we were on that market. They were accustomed to it, just as people going around any country never stop to think of the why or the wherefore of the sun that shines above.  They are accustomed to it.  It was there before their time.  They do not puzzle or wonder or consider how it all came about.  They just accept it as a fact. That was the position in Great Britain before the progressive rule of Fianna Fáil.  The position was that both politicians and farmers in Britain had never considered how it came about that we were able to lump and dump an unlimited amount of material into their market, fetch the best price, and get home with the loot.  It remained for the new national policy, which the leader is ashamed now to outline, to teach the people here and <Col N="64" /> to teach the people there how utterly we were dependent and how vulnerable we were on that particular front. What is more harmful still, as time will prove, it remained for that policy to teach the British farmer what a formidable opponent and rival we were in that market and how much better he could do when we were excluded or partially excluded from that particular market.</P>
    <P>Pique and obstinacy are making a position that was bad at the beginning very definitely worse as one month follows another.  Then, behind the lines and below the farmer, we have an unemployment situation of such volume as nobody ever in their wildest moments thought they would ever see in this country&mdash;a long, hopeless, heartbroken queue of something about 140,000 human beings, with no hope of work.  Imagine the man at the end of that queue! He sees more men coming out of work than going into work, and he counts 140,000 between him and the prospect of work.  Where is that man going to go?  Is he going to go Right or is he going to go Left?  Is not that the ideal soil, the fertilised soil, for the seed of Communism?  A man without employment, without wages, without work, without hope of work&mdash;at a time such as that, is it not an invitation to the Communists: &ldquo;Come out with your propaganda; you will get the full protection of the State; come out in the open and approach those 140,000 unemployed men; approach the 100,000 credit-bad farmers and their families; get going strong throughout the State&rdquo;?  We had enough flirting and coquetting with the elements of lawlessness in the past for political purposes.  We are reaping the fruits now.  You cannot sow the seed of weeds in a corn-field and later on hope to eradicate the weeds without injuring the corn.</P>
    <P>We have a belated attempt now to deal with the logical and natural result of the reckless seed that was sown when the President was in opposition.  We have a belated attempt, through the instrumentality of the Public Safety Act, and the ban on certain organisations, to undo the work that was deliberately done, in a spirit of recklessness, for political purposes. <Col N="65" /> We have, even in that, the same vacillation, the same indecision.  Only ten days ago, we discussed that particular thing here on a Vote for the Department of Justice, and we had the Minister coming in and speaking on behalf of the Executive Council, telling us that there was no necessity to ban such organisations because they were, on the face of it, illegal.  Forty-eight hours later we had the ban. What transpired within that 48 hours?  Were there more men murdered about whom we heard nothing?  Why the change of front between the Tuesday and the Friday?  That is the kind of thing that is doing more harm than either the organised criminal or the active Communist.  It is that kind of vacillating weakness and indecision on behalf of the responsible Executive of this country that is doing the most harm&mdash;that kind of reluctance to take into their confidence those whose responsibilities are much the same as those of members of the Executive; that kind of a policy characterised to-day by the attitude of the President &mdash;a failure or a refusal to take anybody, any members of the House, into his confidence; a refusal to tell them what his policy is or where he is leading them; an anxiety to condemn the man outside, whose crime is that he followed your teachings in the past, but a refusal in here to withdraw or repudiate any of those teachings.</P>
    <P>If there is a grave state of affairs, remember that a Government that acts boldly and promptly will get the unstinted support of all; but a Government that hesitates, vacillates, delays, and, in the minds of all, when carefully examined, seems to take action only when that organisation makes it clear that it is politically opposed to the Government&mdash;if there is any suspicion that policy of such an extreme nature is prompted and guided and only taken when it is a case of beating a political opponent&mdash;as long as there is any doubt or suspicion of that, I fear the response to the appeal made by Ministers will not be as wide and as general and as generous as I would like to see it.  I hope, irrespective of who sits over there, irrespective of what personnel fills that Front Bench, <Col N="66" /> or what Party fills that Front Bench, that every time there is an appeal by any Government to come to the aid of the State or the service of the State in grappling with lawlessness or organised crime of any kind, the response will be big and brave and generous.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>On Friday Deputy Dillon <Col N="67" /> invited me to consider the desirability of setting up a Borstal Institution for females and referred to the Children's Court question.  As I am informed that both questions are being considered, and will be reported upon by the commission which was set up by the Minister for Education, I do not think I am expected to anticipate their report.  I am not going to anticipate what their recommendations will be, as I understand the report will be ready in a couple of weeks.  As regards the Borstal Institution for males at Clonmel, I would like to refer the Deputy to an Appendix to the Annual Report on Prisons for the year 1934, copies of which were laid on the Table of the House last summer.  In that Appendix details were given of the system in operation in Clonmel and the arrangements for the after-care of discharged inmates.  In the view of the Department of Justice the system is working satisfactorily, and I am informed this view is shared by responsible people who have made themselves acquainted with details of its operation.  After discharge ex-inmates are kept under friendly supervision for a period of three years, during which reports are obtained as to their welfare from employers, clergymen, the agent for discharged prisoners, etc.  In many cases the ex-inmates write to the governor or to members of the Borstal Association giving accounts of their progress.  During the last ten years the percentage of ex-inmates who are known to have gone on well during the three years following their discharge has been more than 80 per cent.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £25,836 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for such of the Salaries and Expenses of the District Court as are not charged on the Central Fund.  (No. 10 of 1924, secs. 70 and 76; No. 27 of 1926, secs. 49 and 50 and No. 15 of 1928, sec. 13.)</P>
    <P>There is practically no change in this Vote.  The Justices of the Dublin Metropolitan Court have made representations that the efficiency of their staff has decreased to an alarming extent, owing mainly to the fact that as soon as new entrants have had two or three years' experience in the office, and begun to be really useful, they leave the office, either by passing the examination for some higher grade in the Civil Service, such as the Customs and Excise or by getting transferred to some other Department.  This is a very interesting example of a difficulty which is well known in the Civil Service.  On the one hand there is general agreement that the number of different grades and classes in the service should be kept as low as possible, so as to allow of free transfer from one office to another and to reduce the number of recruiting examinations. On the other hand, the free flow of transfers has very embarrassing consequences as in the present case. Pre-war, the Dublin Metropolitan Court Clerks were a separate class recruited by a special examination and when a man got in there he had to stay there until he died or retired. Whatever fault might be found with this system it produced an efficient staff.  Under the Free State régime the theory of reducing the number of separate classes was brought into play and recruits for the Dublin <Col N="69" /> Metropolitan Court were taken from the ordinary examination for clerical officers.  The tendency of men thus recruited to leave the office after a few years soon became evident.  We tried to check it by putting the men on something better than the clerical scale but even then the men continued to go.  Part of the explanation is that a good deal of the work brings the men into contact with a rather unpleasant side of life.  The Department of Finance has now been induced to recognise that this is a case where the lesser evil is to restore the old Departmental class and it is hoped to hold an examination within the next six months under the auspices of the Civil Service Commissioners from which examination the successful candidates will pass into the Metropolitan Court Offices with the knowledge that they will have to stay there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That raise a very interesting point.  Surely if this service is of a more arduous character than service commanding similar remuneration in other branches of the State employment, the Minister ought to consider putting the officials in that particular branch of the Department of Justice on a more advantageous salary basis.  It is all very well to say that there will be more suitable arrangements, such as a special examination, but that is simply reverting to the principle of drawing on an over-stocked labour market to get cheap labour.  While it is quite true that an advertisement inviting applications for that class at 30/- a week would get them and probably from highly educated men who cannot get anything better, surely we ought to have some cognisance of the work to be done. Seeing that persons who have entered the service try to get out as soon as they can and as the Department recognises that contact with the very distressing side of life that it brings people into is a disadvantage, the proper way to meet that is to pay a little more.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the Departmental decision in regard to that matter, and perhaps look into the <Col N="70" /> complaints that these clerks are making. Perhaps he might send for them and ask why it was that they were always so anxious to leave that service and to go elsewhere.  That might help him to understand the situation as far as could be expected in the special circumstances obtaining, as we fully recognise that he is only acting as temporary Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>There is another matter with which I do not expect the Minister to deal now, but I mention it in order that the attention of the Department may be directed to it.  A good deal of doubt seems to exist amongst District Court clerks as to the reason why they are not pensionable officers. Some of them are pensionable.  I would like the Minister to say in express terms if he is prepared to establish any district Court clerks who on their part are prepared to submit to transfer to any part of Saorstát Eireann, as established officers, but, recognising that family circumstances might make it inconvenient for some of them to move about as freely as ordinary Civil Servants would be required, leaving those who did not want to be liable to be moved as unestablished officers on the appropriate scale of pay.  If the Minister makes that offer I think he is putting an end to the legitimate complaint of District court clerks. As long as they are willing to conform to the requirements of Government service, but are denied establishment, I think they have legitimate grounds of complaint.  I would be glad if the Minister could deal with the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there are two ways of dealing with that.  One is the way that has at present been widely adopted, namely, as ordinary wastage occurs and districts become vacant, to amalgamate the districts and make the officers whole-time.  I quite see that in some districts there is not sufficient work for a whole-time officer, and where you have such part-time officers you could not establish them, because it would be difficult to assess their pensions and matters of that kind.  Would the Minister say that it is his intention to amalgamate districts as vacancies arise with a view to making all these officers established officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say on the matter is that it is being inquired into. I could not make a definite statement on that point.  There may be reasons of which I am unaware why that cannot be done.  As to the other point, it is not this Department, as Deputy Dillon is aware, that decides salaries. There will be a scale, at any rate, somewhat different from the present scale, but even where something better than the present scale was offered, it did not succeed in keeping people, who had an opportunity of going into the general service, from doing so.  I expect that in future, when appointments are made as a result of examinations the terms of which have been definitely advertised, the candidates who are successful will realise where they are going.  Anyone who competes will do so knowing what the prospects are, and I do not think they will have very much grievance then.  Those who enter the general service naturally have the right, and will avail of it, to look for advancement to some other branch.  I do not think there is much prospect of getting any very big <Col N="72" /> increase in salaries.  Whatever the Department of Justice may think on that question, there is another Department which has to have a say on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us of his dilemma.  I do not know that this has been given an adequate amount of consideration, because it is an old-standing problem, but it is just possible, in the casual way in which it has been brought forward, that the House can be satisfied that a proper method has been adopted for dealing with it.  The Minister's dilemma is that if you allow movement from one grade to another you deplete these District Courts services of the capitalised value they get after a certain number of years.  Alternatively, if you are going to close down on any Department from which there is no promotion, or no great chance of promotion, you will have the old conditions amongst a large number of people&mdash;that is to say, they will have to remain in touch with a lower type of life.  People have gone into this service in the past, but in the past there was a chance of promotion. Now you are going to close down a man's career to this type of work without any increase of salary.  You are going to close him down for a lifetime to this sordid and rather meaner type of work to which the Minister referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say a mean type of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, a sordid type of work.  They are to be constantly in touch with certain sordid elements of the community, and the persons you are going to recruit for the future will obviously not be as good as their predecessors.  If it were not for the fact that the labour market is over-stocked, as Deputy Dillon stated, that people will take anything, no matter what conditions they are brought in touch with, it would be very difficult indeed to get suitable candidates for these posts.  I suggest to the Minister that if he is taking this step, it should be taken in full recognition of the fact that the result is likely to be the recruiting of a less desirable type of person.  If we get an equally good class as before, it is because that equally <Col N="73" /> good class has no other way of marketing its labour.</P>
      <P>I have often wondered at the attitude shown to this old-time problem.  Right from the beginning of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, there was this tendency apparent everywhere.  One does not mind if the Minister for Finance, in his desire to make certain savings, tries&mdash;sometimes seriously, sometimes not so seriously&mdash;to restrict payments and to bring about conditions which lead to recruitment of a less good type of person.  One does not mind that coming from the Ministry of Finance or from the Executive Council faced with a mass of debt, faced with a decaying trade and an accumulation of payments for services of one kind or another, but one can always be surprised at the Department of Justice agreeing with this tendency.  The tendency to which I refer was that the district justices were always regarded as officers on a very definitely lower level than any of the other members of the judiciary. They are marked out by a distinct name.  They are marked out by having peculiar conditions of tenure, with these peculiar conditions of tenure being carried forward into the new Courts of Justice Bill.  There has been a tendency to regard them and to segregate them as a part of the judiciary which is not protected by constitutional provisions.  I cannot understand that attitude of mind.  Anybody who knows anything about the duties of district justices must find it difficult to follow that mental attitude.  District justices have to deal with a mass of work which calls for the exercise of very special qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as legal knowledge is concerned, there are not a tremendous number of fine points of law to be decided, but the district justices as a whole, and the clerks who attend these courts come into contact with greater masses of the population than either the Circuit Courts, the High Courts or the Supreme Courts.  There is required in the District Court a far greater degree of understanding of the lives of people of a certain type, people, perhaps of a sordid type.  There is required a far greater degree of humanity and a far greater appreciation of the circumstances under which <Col N="74" /> these people live.  There is not one district justice who does not feel called upon to seek advice in respect to the people with whom he has to deal from the clerks who are grouped about him in the District Courts.  I find that so far from their being prejudiced by the peculiar circumstances under which they work, they do rise superior to these conditions, and one finds a very human outlook in all the proceedings in these courts, which adds considerably to the value of the work of the courts.</P>
    <P>I believe myself there is apparent here again the tendency that was observable since 1924, to degrade the standard of these courts and everybody and everything attached to them.  I think it is about time that that should be stopped.  I do not know whether the Acting-Minister has ever seen the report which has been received in his Department of the work of the district justices.  These men were probably the first of the judiciary who had to face out to the old, troubled conditions. They were the people who were first and foremost attacked.  Right through &mdash;there have been one or two exceptions, but these exceptions merely prove the general rule, and are so glaringly few as not to call for comment&mdash; the general conduct of these courts when one comes to look into the matter is beyond any praise which could be given to them.  And again it is to be remembered that these courts deal far more with the masses of the people than other courts.  I do not think it could be good for us, for the sake of saving a little bit of money, to inaugurate this system without trying to attract ordinary individuals by the ordinary invitation of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that the cash paid into the metropolitan courts in fines and the fees are somewhere over 75 per cent. of the salaries of the justices and assistant justices, and pay a particular portion of the salaries of those to whom we are referring here.  These receipts are very big, and there should be some better attitude taken up towards this problem.</P>

      <P>In the old days I am sure there were good types of officials. I do not know whether they were satisfied or wanted to get away from their surroundings.  They were departmental, and unless they have the departmental system they could not be kept there.  The whole question of salaries is not settled yet, but I do not think it will differ very much from the ordinary Civil Service.  I think the difference between district justices and other justices was settled definitely by the Act of 1924.  I quite agree that the district justices are doing good work. We are not responsible for the difference in their status no more than the previous Government.  The system is merely a continuation.  I am not prepared, acting as I am merely as Deputy for the Minister for Justice, to say that any new departure will be made</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceedings in the High Court during the past year show very little variation <Col N="76" /> in the number of actions instituted therein, as compared with the previous year; the number of plenary summonses has increased form 634 to 767, but the number of summary summonses has decreased from 3,913 to 3,613.  A more noticeable decrease is to be found in bankruptcy proceedings, where there has been, during the past year, a fairly steady decline in the number of bankruptcies, deeds of arrangement, etc. This decrease is regarded by some as a favourable sign in trade and business: others hold that where trade and credit are flourishing the number of bankruptcies tends to go up.</P>
    <P>There are no arrears of any note in any branches of the High Court, either on the equity or common law side, with the exception of the number of Circuit Court appeals awaiting hearing.  Even in this instance, however, the list is not as formidable as in previous years: at present there are some 160 appeals awaiting to be heard, the earliest of which relate back to May, 1935, when the appeal papers were lodged in the High Court.  More detailed particulars of the various proceedings in the courts appear annually in the statistical returns published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, which are compiled in the High Court, up to October in each year&mdash;being the commencement of the judicial year.</P>
    <P>In the Supreme Court there is one outstanding case (Erasmus Smith Charities) where there has been unusual delay in the delivery of the judgment of the court.  Otherwise that court is up to date.  Generally, our courts are all very expeditious and up to date with their work as compared with the courts of other States.</P>
    <P>Regarding the staff of the High Court, the Minister appointed in 1935 a committee to inquire and report into the staffing and organisation of the High Court offices.  This committee have not yet completed their labours, or made a final report to the Minister, but it has made several interim reports which have been acted upon and the results have given general satisfaction. As compared with the Estimates of 20 or even ten years ago the cost to the State of the High Court <Col N="77" /> and its staff shows a notable reduction without any corresponding loss of efficiency.</P>
    <P>The business of the High Court has been conducted to the satisfaction of the public generally, regard being had to the convenience of litigants and jurors, as much as possible, but there is a definite necessity for the revision and codification of the Rules of Court. This is in view.</P>

Proceedings in bankruptcies have gone down but he did not give us the exact figures.</P>

      <P>With regard to arrears, we are told there are no arrears of note in any branches of the High Court, and that with regard to appeals awaiting hearing the earliest goes back to May, 1935.  I would have liked the Minister to have dealt more fully with that case because it is likely that it is on cases like that that foolish comments are made upon the length of time that a case is waiting to be heard on appeal.  It is quite possible that that case, awaiting since May, 1935, has been already in the High Court and adjourned possibly on the application of both the parties.  I think the Minister might in fairness to those concerned, in dealing with these appeals, tell us what is the average period of delay in regard to the hearing of those appeals.  It certainly, I suggest, is not as long as a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  This is a matter that can be brought out by <Col N="78" /> parliamentary question.  We have this quite clearly now revealed, that so far as the High Court is concerned, litigation is on the wane.  That is only marked to a slight degree by comparing the present year with last year. A comparison of the average of about four years with 1929 showed a decrease to one-third of the entire business. The cases were down by about two-thirds. This marks a further decrease. There is a decline also in bankruptcy proceedings.</P>
      <P>The new Court of Justice Bill was promoted on the ground that the present system of appeal to the High Courts led to a considerable number of those appeals lying over.  The only argument for the new Courts of Justice Bill was a denial of justice owing to delay in the hearing of the cases so long.  The Minister might give us some further information on that at a later date.  One would be glad to have even a summary of the points that the Committee appointed by the Minister to inquire and report into the staffing and organisation of the High Court offices had before them.  That would reveal what were the matters that seemed to call for inquiry; also a summary of the facts upon which they proceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that stocks everybody connected with the management of the courts arises out of the item of £300 for the stenographer in the Central Criminal Court.  In the central office, stenographers are listed as costing last year £560 and this year £360.  So far as the Central Criminal Court is concerned, the amount down for stenography is the same, but there is a decrease, I suppose, under some other item.  Does the Minister really know the conditions under which stenographers have to work in the courts? Does he know that one man died as a result of over-work?  The men who get this work are supposed to be, and are, in fact, highly efficient people.  I have been told&mdash;I hesitate to believe it because it seems so scandalous&mdash;that if a court stenographer becomes ill he has to pay a substitute, and that he is mulcted more for payment of the substitute than he would himself receive. If that be so, there is something <Col N="79" /> wrong.  That, at all events, is the comment made to me by a stenographer in the courts.  I can understand that payment to be given to a casual man who has not the security of work that the regular stenographers have throughout the year would have to be more than the sum paid to the permanent man.  Looking at the sum in the Estimate, and another sum elsewhere, £300, I should like to find out what the amount paid to the stenographers is supposed to cover.  Is it supposed to cover the taking of shorthand notes in court and the preparation of the transcript for the use of the judge or anybody else who cares to call for it? Judging the work of the stenographer by the time he spends in court, a certain payment might be equitable, but if he has to go home&mdash;he may have other duties, because some of these men are not completely and entirely attached to the court&mdash;and prepare the transcript, the position is different. He may not be a person who can himself do the necessary typing.  Few of the stenographers do that.  He would, therefore, be at the expense of having the transcript typed and got ready for presentation to the court.  The stenographers have, from time to time, received the highest praise from the judges, and if the stories told me by some of the stenographers are correct, there is a matter there which requires some little attention.  This may or may not be one of the matters referred to this Committee which is inquiring into the staffing of the courts.  At all events, it is a matter that should be inquired into.  If the Minister inquires into it, he will find, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that one of the stenographers died in harness and died because of over-work.</P>

      <P>In general, I should like to say that I did not expect to be questioned as regards administrative detail.  If I had expected such questions as Deputy McGilligan put, or if he had given me an intimation that he proposed to raise these questions, I should have obtained the necessary information for reply.  However, as he has said, he can raise these matters by way of parliamentary question.  In <Col N="80" /> former years there was very little debate on this Vote, and we did not expect to have it this year.  As regards the court stenographers, they are paid from £6 to £8 per week, and there is a special fund available to pay for extra help when necessary.  The Chief Justice did say that one of these men died from over-work.  He may have thought that that was so, but I think that it would hardly be correct to say that he died of over-work.  I do not suppose that that was brought out at the inquest&mdash;that over-work killed him. The statement by the Chief Justice may have been an over-statement.  I suppose he does not measure his language on all occasions.  It would be a rather strong thing to say that the man died from hard work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry is mainly a registry of owners of small holdings.  It was established primarily for the registration of purchasers under the Land Purchase Acts, in order to facilitate the ascertainment of the ownership of the holdings purchased and future dispositions by the owners.  Prior to the creation of the Irish Free State there were 239,830 owners registered of land in what is now Saorstát Eireann; 105,569 additional owners have been registered since that date; so that the total number of owners of land registered in Saorstát Eireann is now 345,399.  This is over 25,000 more than the total number of owners of land registered in the whole of Ireland in the year 1919-1920.  It is estimated <Col N="82" /> that 100,000 or more additional owners will be registered on the completion of pending and future sales under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    <P>Recent legislation has increased the purchase of small houses by means of advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  All owners of houses so acquired must be registered. Eight hundred and ninety of those houses were registered in 1935.</P>
    <P>The scheme to vest all labourers' plots in the occupiers will add a large number of owners to the register.  The effect of the proposed Labourers Bill will be to increase the number of registered owners by 50,000.  Having regard to the foregoing, it is expected that the total number of registered owners of land in Saorstát Eireann will be increased to 500,000 in the next 10 years.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of registered owners has increased substantially the dispositions by them that have to be registered.  More dispositions of registered land in Saorstát Eireann are now being registered annually than were registered for the whole of Ireland in the year 1919-1920. The dispositions registered during the year ending the 31st December, 1935, were 25,163.  Legislation has also contributed to this increase.  Since 1929, 8,264 charges have been registered for loans made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation under the Agricultural Credit Acts; and during the same period over 1,400 charges have been registered for loans made under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  The work has been done by a staff whose numbers are 25 per cent. less than the staff for the year 1919-1920, when the work was less. In addition to the normal work of the Registry, the maps of all registered land, which were destroyed in 1922, have nearly all been reconstructed.  It is hoped that this reconstruction will be completed in a short time.  The further increase expected in the number of owners to be added to the register will necessarily involve a considerable annual increase in the registration of dispositions by registered owners.</P>
    <P>The sum of £15,000 given in the <Col N="83" /> estimates as the estimated receipt of fees in the Land Registry for the year ending 31st March, 1937, is probably an underestimate.  The fees actually received for the year ending 31st March, 1935, were £17,066 8s. 4d. A complete return of the fees for the financial year ending 31st March, 1936, has not yet been obtained, but they will be at least £18,000.  There has been a substantial increase in the dealings registered during the year over the dealings registered in 1935, and the fees increased in proportion. A further increase in dealings is expected this year, and the fees for the year ending 31st March, 1937, should not be less than £18,500.  The difference between this sum and the gross total of all estimated expenditure chargeable against the registry including expenses such as accomodation, stationery, superannuation, non-headquarter expenses, which are charged on other Votes, is about £11,000.  At least three-fourths of this apparent deficit on the working of the registry is caused by legislation that requires registrations in certain cases to be made free of charge or for charges less than the cost of the work done, and by work being done in the registry for other Departments without the cost of it being debited against them as part of their expenses of administration, which it is.  Under the Labourers Acts, local authorities must be registered free of charge as owners of all land acquired by them for the purposes of those Acts.  Under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and the rules thereunder, registrations have to be made for fees less than the cost of the work done.  And under the Gaeltacht Acts, charges for loans made by the Board of Works have to be registered free of charge.</P>
    <P>If the cost of registrations and other work done in the Registry for Public Departments was debited against those Departments in the same way as other Departments debit the registry with work done for it, and if credit was given to the registry for work done that it is obliged to do free of charge or for fees less <Col N="84" /> than cost, the estimates would show correctly the actual loss on the working of the registry, and it would appear that, as between the State and registered owners, the deficit now borne by the State but which should be contributed in fees by owners is not more than £2,400, and probably less.  It may be added that the pending Courts of Justice Bill creates an authority for making rules and prescribing fees for the registry, thus filling a gap which has existed since the abolition of the old judicial system in 1924.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said something with regard to the amount required to settle the new proprietors on the land.  I gather that is particularly so with regard to these migrants from the West.  The Minister must realise that every acre of land now divided means a perpetual charge on the State, perhaps I should not say a perpetual charge but a charge for possibly a generation. That will continue as long as the present policy with regard to housing and land division holds.  Perhaps the Minister could give us the average, not dealing with registration alone but with the operation of which land legislation is only a part.  We might get an estimate of this some time or other from the Minister.  If the Minister forecasts 100,000 proprietors in the near future the amount under this head will be considerably increased when it is taken into account that 100,000 new proprietors will have to be registered.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £34,011 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries, Allowances and Expenses of Circuit Court Officers, Deputy Circuit Judges, and certain Local Registering Authorities, the Travelling Expenses of Circuit Judges; and the expenses of Revision of Voters and Jurors Lists (No. 27 of 1926, etc.).</P>
    <P>The gross sum asked for is £83,521 as against which we expect to receive £32,510 by way of Appropriations-in-Aid, making the net demand £51,011. Normally this Vote alters very little from year to year, but during the year now in review and for a couple of years past it has been swollen by two factors, namely, (1) the necessity of providing for salary for a Deputy Judge for the entire year to replace Judge O'Connor, who is whole-time engaged on other public duties.  This costs about £1,350 and we have asked for £2,600 in all under sub-head A (6) to cover the possibility of having to provide deputies for other judges, illness, etc.; (2) the cost of the increased staff and travelling expenses of county registrars in executing warrants under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933 &mdash;that is in the case of annuity defaulters.  This latter service, however, pays for itself (quite apart from the sum of £750,000 which it has actually recovered) in fees received. It adds anything from £10,000 to £20,000 to both sides of the account&mdash; credit and debit&mdash;and just about balances out.  We all hope that it is a transient phenomenon and that the <Col N="86" /> provision which we have thought it prudent to make this year will not be necessary, in fact.</P>

    <P>That makes a total of 136.  I may add that some of the oldest cases mentioned above appeared in the judges' list for hearing some months ago, but on the application of the parties to the actions, who were not ready to proceed, were taken out of the list and re-entered for a later date.  The position, as indicated by these statistics, appears to be fairly satisfactory and no complaints appear to have been made recently.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of arrears, but I want to get at what is the volume of legal work falling to be done by the Circuit Courts as <Col N="87" /> opposed to what fell to be done last year or the year before.  What are the numbers of the civil bills originating in the Circuit Courts of the Free State in the year we are in, as opposed to last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to hear that there is no considerable variation, but I wonder is that phrase not to be taken with a reservation in regard to the Damage to Property Act.  Again, the same tendency I have mentioned as observable, from statistics supplied to me in answer to a question, in the High Court is to be observed in the Circuit Courts.  As far as the ordinary civil bills are concerned for all items other than in respect of the Damage to Property Act, the work was down by more than one-third.  It was, in fact, I think, only raised to the point of showing a decrease as little as one-third because of the impact of the Damage to Property Act in the last couple of years. Of course, that Act gave rise to a big number of cases.  They were very good for statistical purposes, as they seemed to swell the legal work.  They were, of course, a bad type of case from a good many angles.  It was the method of rewarding people for what at one time were considered criminal activities.  Apart from that, it is obviously a passing phase.  There was, as a matter of fact, a time limit for these cases, which was extended by a judicial decision.  Then the Legislature recognised that fact and, I think, extended it a little further.  However, the number of cases that still remain to be heard must be very small.  If, notwithstanding the disappearance of the type of case under that Act, the ordinary work of the Circuit Courts is at the same point as before, it will mean that the ordinary work has gone up.  I very much doubt if that is the case.  I would assume that the Department, in procuring these statistics, would have recognised, as anybody must, that the cases for determination <Col N="88" /> in regard to the property that was destroyed at the time of the civil war must be regarded as abnormal and not likely to occur beyond the second or third sittings after the time when the Act came into operation.  I presume that they excluded that item from their consideration.  If that is so, then the situation is this, that the year we are in shows very little difference from the year before, but that the year before distinctly showed a drop of over 30 per cent. in the ordinary matters falling to be litigated under the authority of the Circuit Courts, whether ordinarily within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts or whether they were cases taken by the consent of the parties. Of course, it has to be added to the statistics given with regard to the High Court as showing that legal work of the civil type is definitely on the decline.</P>
      <P>That is interesting to observe at a time when this House is engaged in increasing the number of judges, the argument for the increase of judges being based on the fact, as it must be based on the fact, that the judges were having too much to do, that arrears were mounting up as far as the Circuit Courts were concerned.  That phrase was always unjustifiable. There never was any great volume of arrears in the Circuit Court anywhere found to be existing, and I think the majority of the cases found to be of that type were the cases to which the Acting-Minister referred, where the parties were not ready to go on, and those were responsible for the delay. There is far too much comment through the country on delay with regard to the hearing of cases.  Dublin, of course, naturally gets a great many more cases than any other part of the country.  A very considerable percentage of all the cases tried in the Circuit Courts are tried before the Dublin Circuit Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, from time to time, a considerable pressure of work in the Dublin Circuit Court.  Nobody can say that the Dublin Circuit Court judges do not get sufficient work to do.  When you swing to the other extreme and say that whatever they get <Col N="89" /> to do they leave a lot in arrears, that is a phrase which is only used by people who have no knowledge of the statistical information provided year by year, and the comment would not be made if the situation was properly understood.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I got the full purport of the remark of the Minister in regard to the moneys expended for the provision of assistants or deputies for the Circuit Court judges.  It is clearly recognised that Judge O'Connor has been transferred temporarily to other work.  If one is to hark to the comments made by people who expect to be the recipients of money under that other work that he is doing, they expect that he will be occupied for at least three years on that.  That may be pessimism.  At any rate, that comment is being made.  I understood the Minister to say that he is adding something in addition to the amount required for the deputy for Judge O'Connor.  That would mean that the Minister is looking forward to some other similar situation arising with regard to another judge or it may be that he is making provision for illness.</P>

      <P>I do not want to introduce the economic war.  The Minister has done so.  Let us draw a discreet silence over the matter, with this comment, that annuity defaulters have put an increased cost on the Courts Vote from £10,000 to £20,000 in the year.  Does that increased cost fall eventually to be borne by the State?  In other words, by sending a sufficient number of bailiffs and people of that type, whom the Acting Minister used to deride and scorn, by relying on them and their efforts the <Col N="90" /> Minister can get in not merely the annuities in default but the extra £10,000 or £20,000 which is the cost of collection.  That, of course, in a situation in which we were to have the land not buzzing with bailiffs, but overflowing with milk and honey, is a very serious change.</P>

      <P>As we have a minute or two before the debate on the Vote that we left over has to be resumed, may I be allowed to make a personal explanation in regard to a matter raised on the Office of the Minister for Justice? In fact, I am craving your indulgence to do something more, as my explanation is not of anything said by me but of a serious misinterpretation of my remarks as made.  I find that I am reported, as far as one newspaper is concerned, with having criticised the person who gives expert medical evidence in the courts.  I have in my hands a transcript of what I actually did say and I find that I passed no such criticism. Indeed it was far from my intention to pass any criticism of such a type that the representation as to what happened would be possible.  The matter arose in this way; that that particular paper left out the praise I gave but published a remark of the Attorney-General in reply.  It is somewhat impudent on my part to praise a person who is an expert and who gives such expert help and the very efficient medical testimony that he gives.  At any rate, I ventured to praise him.  The newspaper left out the things I said by way of praise and gave prominence to a comment made by the Attorney-General that it was not right for me to criticise him.  Three times I reiterated that the country had the security, and <Col N="92" /> indeed was entitled to that security, that, as far as medical testimony was concerned, it was getting very efficient service and that impartial and honest evidence was being given by people of the very highest capacity and experience.  That has been incredibly construed in some way into criticism of that individual.  Lest there should be any doubt about it, and lest any word of mine might be construed as a criticism, I want to withdraw it; but before I do so, I would ask people to read what I said, and if they do they will find that what I said was entirely in terms of praise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote for the Department of the President of the Executive Council, I recognise that we are dealing with it under circumstances of peculiar difficulty. I hope I will not be accused of trying to make a debating point if I say that, as far as I am concerned, I think the President has not merely come to the parting of the ways but has definitely shown a turn that is entirely and completely for the better.  If the President has taken that turn, he must remember that it is very hard to get people who have not had the experience of what demoralisation means, such as he has had, subtly to accept the same swerve, because it is a swerve, and I hope that it will be admitted as a swerve.  It is very hard to get young people who thought that the President was pursuing a particular course, and had read his comments as exhortations and definite praise for them to follow that line with him&mdash;to get them now to recognise that a change has taken place.  The President has been forced by the logic of circumstances and the difficulty of governing to announce a change.  The President must remember that quite a number of comments <Col N="93" /> of his own can be quoted by anybody who cares to search the records, to search the newspapers, and to search the records of this House, comments which would enable those who are now, in the phrase used by a Minister, definitely in league with murder, to show that the President thought fit to praise them at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have the quotations.  It would be interesting to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  When the Public Safety Act was introduced the President spoke in this way: &ldquo;These men were misguided, if you like, but they were brave men anyhow.&rdquo; Remember that we were then dealing with a Bill brought in on the basis that it was against murder.  The President's comment was: &ldquo;Let us have for them the decent respect that we have for the brave.  They have done terrible things recently, I admit, if they are responsible for them, and I suppose they are, but let us appeal to them and ask them in God's name not to do them.&rdquo;  Now, faced with murder, because the President admitted that it was murder, he said: &ldquo;These were misguided, if you like, but they were brave men anyhow,&rdquo; and his resort then was to appeal to them in God's name not to carry on in this way, and to appeal to this House to have for them the decent respect that we have for the brave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume that the men of whom the President was then speaking, the people whom we must have in our minds now, were the very salt of the earth.  I said at the time, that &ldquo;if the salt loses its savour there is no use for it except to be thrown out and trodden under the foot of man.&rdquo;  The President at that time did not think it his duty to take a line against these people, and if they were misguided then they can say that they have been much more misguided since.  I put that to the House as the pivotal comment of the President when speaking on the 15th October, 1931, when Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill was before the House, or, as it was called, the Public Safety Act.  If at this moment anybody in these benches stood up and alluded to these men as misguided <Col N="94" /> young men, as people who are brave and people for whom we should have the decent respect that we have for the brave, I do not think the President would consider that comments of that kind were likely to help him in the difficult and dangerous situation with which he is now dealing.  But these were his comments in those days.</P>
    <P>I do not think they are decent and brave men, and I think the President, through his Ministers, has recently said that they are neither brave nor decent men.  The unfortunate situation is that the speech made by the Minister for Finance the other night at Balbriggan could easily have been made ten years ago and, if made ten years ago, it would have met with objection from the then Deputy MacEntee.  In 1931, apparently, the Government that brought in Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill was right; apparently, at that time also, the Bishops who proclaimed that particular organisation were right, and the Seanad that passed that Bill was right, and the only thing that has happened since is that the President has learned how right they all were and has decided to follow them.  As long as the President follows them and pursues the big line of establishing law and order in the country, and recognises that these men, no matter what their past record was, whether they were decent or brave, are engaging in a course of conduct that every citizen must be against, he will get the full backing of the whole House.  The President must appreciate that he praised some people to that extent.  If he says that is not the case, let him explain what has changed the situation to enable him to condemn these people.  He certainly forbore to condemn them at the time I speak of. As long as the President has turned and is at the parting of the ways, as long as he turns his back on his past, there will be nothing but help for him in the new effort that is going to be made for the future.</P>
    <P>The President should remember that he has left many points upon which he can be countered in his activities against these people at the moment. He must remember that in the most general terms he criticised the introduction <Col N="95" /> of such measures as were found to be necessary in almost every State in the world: measures against treason and measures for the preservation of the public safety.  The President classified these generally, and, particularly when he came to deal with any one of them, as measures of the British type. There are quotations scattered through this debate of October, 1931, in which the President again and again referred to the fact &ldquo;that the British had tried methods of coercion against the people of this country and that methods of coercion were of no avail.&rdquo;  The President did say immediately after what I have quoted, that the result of measures such as had been alluded to, would be to drive people underground instead of their being an open organisation having, as he thought then, a good viewpoint&mdash;that there would be resort to secret societies and to machinations of the underground type.  The President must not now believe in what he then said.  It is good that he does not any longer believe in it.  The President should remember that when dealing with these people and the suddenness with which his change was announced, that previously, in 1931, and prior to the application of the Act passed in that year, a warning was given and time was allowed to people to clear out of certain organisations.</P>
    <P>I do not understand&mdash;and I think it is a point that the House is entitled to some information on&mdash;why the attitude the President has recently found it wise to adopt towards the I.R.A. was adopted at the particular moment.  So far as the 1931 episode was concerned, that measure was brought in with a full documentation. It was revealed to this House, presented to this House, with statements as to organisations and any proof of evidence that could be adduced with regard to the danger of certain organisations.  The matter was in that way disclosed to the House, and all that came after certain murders which had shocked the community.  People who even welcome the change in the President's attitude are somewhat bemused by this.  What happened to make the proclamation and the banning a good and a wise move on the date of <Col N="96" /> a certain event very near us, and the non-happening of which prevented that banning and that attitude being adopted some time earlier?</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Finance the other night at Balbriggan, in a rather incautious speech&mdash;one no part of which would have been repeated by any man who had any appreciation of what a judicial trial in this country means&mdash;that there was evidence to connect somebody, whom the Minister purported to know, with the murder of Admiral Somerville, and that was followed up by the grim comment that when that evidence was produced it would be the last shooting for somebody. When did that evidence come to hand?  Was it that evidence which connects up somebody apparently in the banned organisation with the murder of Admiral Somerville that led to recent events?  When did that information come into the possession of the Government? If they thought it fit on the eve of the Bodenstown celebration to ban the I.R.A. and prevent a certain march, which they did not interfere with previously, did they do it the moment certain information came into their hands connecting some member of the organisation with the murder, or am I wrong in thinking that the Minister had any background when he threw out these incautious remarks of his at the public meeting the other night?</P>
    <P>We know that after one murder there was a certain amount of police activity, but no result.  We know that after a further murder definitely prearranged, and a more revolting crime, there was considerable police activity which produced nothing in the way of a good result.  There was an attempt made to round up a certain number of people and, in the face of the most serious crime that could be committed in any country, all that happened was that this group of people were paraded before the Military Tribunal on charges of refusing to answer questions.  When these questions were investigated, the sole object of the questioning appeared to be that they asked those people did they know who committed these murders, and could they implicate anybody.  Of course they got no answers to these questions, at least so <Col N="97" /> far as the public have been allowed to peep behind the scenes.  In the matters that have been brought before the Military Tribunal there has been no evidence produced to connect any of the people raided and arrested with either of the two crimes.  The only thing is that there have been produced before the Tribunal a certain number of suspected people who, I suppose, can definitely be placed with the I.R.A., but no evidence was produced against them except that they refused to answer a question, the answer to which was going to implicate themselves or somebody else.</P>
    <P>So far as the two murders are concerned, we were met after the death of Admiral Somerville with the view that the police knew nothing and, I think the public, who had believed that there was something successful going to be produced with regard to the second murder, were rather shocked by what appeared in the main to people to be rather light-hearted proceedings at a time when the gravest of all crimes had been committed.  We were told by the Minister for Finance that the Government have information and proof, and that the proof is going to lead to the charging of certain people with one or other of these murders, and when that particular proof is produced it is going to put an end to shooting on the part of people who are going to be accused and, presumably, convicted.  The public are somewhat in the dark about what the Minister means, and they are in the dark as to the information that came into the possession of the Government.</P>
    <P>The public are aware of this, that if the Government had been wise in moving at a particular time, they had been unlucky in the opportunity presented to them.  There was this organisation continuing its activities for a long time, so far as the public know, not aggravated, not increasing, no evidence produced that there was any close connection.  There might have been suspicion, but there was no definite, clear-cut connection.  Being left in that state of doubt, they do find the banning of a particular organisation and the proclaiming of a certain event somewhat puzzling.  If the Government were wise in doing this <Col N="98" /> at the time, or were forced to do it, and if they can produce evidence to that effect to the country, there will be relief, but they were unlucky in their opportunity because it has been stated by one of the people involved in that particular organisation, whose arrest was attempted, that on previous occasions the Party to which the President belongs had backed the Irish Republican Army going in the Bodenstown procession and had said that they were solidly behind them. There must be some explanation of the change and, when the President sets out to give any explanation, I hope he will address it not merely to this House, where Deputies will be willing to support him in his attitude along the line he has adopted, but that he will address some phrases particularly to the people whom he now describes as misguided while previously they were in the category of brave, decent young men.  Let me emphasise that these same young men, according to the President, are now misguided and are potential criminals.</P>
    <P>The President also knows that the municipal elections are on. The President knows that, for the first time, these people, whether for the purpose of afterwards decrying constitutional methods, have at any rate adopted a policy very like one he adopted at a particular time in his history.  They have decided to use the machinery of election, even if it is for the purpose of destroying the machinery of election later and, having emerged in that way, they were holding public meetings in the city and were getting people to listen to them, getting audiences to listen to them.  The President decides at this juncture to take a step which he must know gives them, however unjust the accusation may be, the right to say that the President's action indicated a desire to stop them in what were legitimate activities.  If they are illegal, if their whole basis of operations is illegal, the President is even entitled to stop that part of their activity which has a legal gloss put upon it if he thinks in the end the whole aim of the organisation is the destruction of the Constitution by <Col N="99" /> force of arms.  But he has been unlucky in that he has given that argument, an argument that he, when in Opposition, often stressed in similar circumstances.  That action has been taken against these people whom he then befriended and now disowns.  He gives those people the right to use that argument and to put it, if they care to get quotations, in phrases taken from his own utterances.  These are the immediate events leading up directly to this particular banning.</P>
    <P>I do not care how much he may argue that his words were misinterpreted or even distorted, the President knows that certain phrases of his were only accepted as meaning one thing.  As I said before, the President did not approve of a measure being brought into this country which had been found necessary by nearly every State in the world.  A measure prohibiting treasonable activities was derided by the President.  The President thought, speaking of that particular measure, that it was a continuation of British Government and British methods in this country, a continuation of political unrest, as a result of which unrest this country has suffered for centuries.  The President has not in words given the people to understand how much he has changed from that mental attitude towards that measure, and why?  I say he has not put it in words, because, judging from his conduct, we all know he has changed.  I remember a time when we were threatened with an immediate repeal of that measure.  The President has now been in office for some years, but he has taken no steps, and I hope will never take any steps, to repeal it.  I hope he will have courage and conscience enough to declare that the measure is a good measure; that it is necessary for the State, and that anybody engaged in any way which would leave him open for charge and conviction under the Treason Bill will be dealt with under the provisions of it.  Its practice has been good, but people are confused by seeing a person who phrased that type of activity as British coercion suddenly adopt a changed attitude without explaining why he has <Col N="100" /> changed.  Even some of his followers are disposed to be querulous as to why he acts in this way; a word of explanation might pacify them, as well as a general explanation of the new activity.</P>
    <P>This measure of 1931 was definitely described by the President as being the worst type of continuation of British coercive measures.  It was not merely that according to the President; it was impregnated with the wrong British psychology and the mistaken British attitude towards this country.</P>
    <P>Describing this measure, the President said that he could not believe that the people of this country were so vicious as to require extraordinary legislation; he believed that they were orderly minded people who could be governed by the process of ordinary law, and that this extraordinary type of tribunal and those extraordinary measures that were taken against what was admitted to be a small group then described as irresponsibles were a mistake&mdash;a mistake which was a continuation of British coercion based upon British view that those people were so vicious that this extraordinary measure was required.  He has since in this House said&mdash;I think I phrase him correctly here&mdash;that if he had to draw up a permanent Constitution for this country, he is now convinced that for some years at least a measure such as that which instituted the Military Tribunal will be a necessity.  Presumably, now that he is discussing a new Constitution, he is pinning his efforts towards getting a Military Tribunal installed for the trial of those so-called extra vicious people by extraordinary methods.  One hears rumours that the President has already consulted with one Party in the House as to whether an agreed report could not be brought in, backing his viewpoint that such was necessary.  The President, at any rate, has indicated his viewpoint quite clearly, and I think he has made no withdrawal of that second and better thought of his.</P>
    <P>The situation then is that the President has made a sudden swerve.  Now, in the year 1936, he retraces his steps and pretty nearly swallows all that he said in 1931.  The President surely must <Col N="101" /> realise that when he has taken this line in law and order he must justify it. Ordinarily it requires no justification. Ordinarily he would only have to say: &ldquo;There are certain people here engaged in illegal activity.  That illegal activity has gone to the length of arrogating power over life and death, and that has got to be put down.&rdquo;  But the President must remember that he had not always that clear-cut view, or, if he had, he succeeded in deceiving quite a number of people in the country with regard to it.  I think the President would be well advised to give as clear a documentation as is in his power as to what is the connection of the I.R.A. with crime in the country.  He should give an indication, such as was done in 1931, as to what are the activities of those people that have been under review, and what are the changes in their activities now in the year 1936 that we, at any rate, did not phrase to be treason in 1931.  To what point does the President consider that this new policy of his has got to be pushed?</P>
    <P>He will get from this side of the House unqualified approval of his attitude in this matter.  I do not care whether he phrases it to be his old attitude or his new attitude; as long as we know that the particular policy now inaugurated is going to be pursued ruthlessly the President will get our full support.  I think we ought to know whether he has the full support of his own Party in this matter.  We should also know&mdash;the Labour Benches are empty to-night&mdash;whether the President has thought fit to query what would be the attitude of those who sit here representing Labour in this House towards the 1936 attitude adopted by him in regard to this particular organisation. I do not want to say that the President ought to shrink even in the slightest from the fullest possible activity, the use of force, the use of courts machinery, even of extraordinary courts machinery, to put down whatever danger there may be apprehended by him from this organisation, but would the President just think over this&mdash;that there is a new situation in the country?  He always derided the thought that there may be <Col N="102" /> Communism growing up in this country but at any rate there is a new situation.  The people here cannot be completely divorced from public opinion.  They do not fail to read the newspapers.  They do not fail to see what disorder&mdash;even disorder of an organised type&mdash;there is on the continent quite close to us.  The President in his speech in 1931 said that to seek out what was the reason for certain unrest and to try to deal with that was a better method than a merely blind blow struck by certain people.  Will the President tell us what he has thought of the serious unrest in the country at the moment and whether he is satisfied that everything is being done to remove the cause of that unrest?</P>
    <P>There is a material side to that and there is another side to it.  On the non-material side, will the President regard it as mere argumentation in debate if I say this, that when he seeks to apply force to the I.R.A., who have decided to take the law into their own hands as far as life and death are concerned&mdash;that, we are told, is the reason for the banning&mdash; he has decided that they are in breach of one part of the positive law of this country?  They say they can take the lives of certain people because of certain political views that they hold, and I think they can get grounds for that argument in the President's own statements of some years ago.  But they do not need to go back to the President's statements of years ago; they can point here and now to the President's attitude towards the same positive law which makes the taking of life by them, unauthorised so to do, a crime.  They can point to breaches of that same positive law by the President himself, and they know that the President defended those breaches by him of that particular law of the country by political arguments.  There is a vast difference in degree between the arguments that the President used on his attitude, say, towards the Seanad, towards the Governor-General, towards the whole system of the Oireaehtas, towards the Constitution, and the same mistaken principle which actuates these men in saying that, because people are not going <Col N="103" /> to operate with them in certain lines of activity, they are entitled to take those people's lives.  But they do get the bad example from the President and his attitude towards what is, at the moment, the law of the country; and it is no great excuse for him to say: &ldquo;Wait a bit; have patience and bide your time and these particular parts of the law which remain here as law for the moment are going to be changed.&rdquo;  The I.R.A. might easily answer: &ldquo;Wait still a further time and our policy will win through, and activities which are now classified as criminal because we do them will cease to have that criminal taint just as the President himself experienced in his old political history.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the non-material side.  There is another side to it.  The President knows well that he flattered the people of this country that there was a problem awaiting solution here which did not require any great degree of statesmanship to settle.  He had the phrase that there was a cure for unemployment staring us in the face such as no other country had, and he promised the people of this country work, more production, wealth.  He detailed that over industry and over agriculture.  He promised that there was to be more money for spending, and he promised that the money that was going to to be spent by the State was going to be better spent, and that that better spending was to be accomplished without in any sense economising on the salaries of people who were serving the State.  In addition to these promises, there was no threat held out of any increased taxation on the people of this country.  The President, and his Ministers, if they were here, may counter what I am saying by pointing to social services.  This country was not promised free beef or dole, unemployment assistance or public relief works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not promised these things.  They were promised work, as the Deputy probably knows.  They were told that the unemployment situation here was <Col N="104" /> such that we had a cure for it that no other country had.  I need not repeat the figures again in detail&mdash;the numbers of thousands who were to get work that were flaunted before the eyes of the people.  Now, receipt of public money in order to ward off destitution is no substitute for the work that was promised, and the President knows well that, if the building activity that is going on at the moment were stopped, there are less people in insurable occupation than on the day when he took office.  There is only one activity that has helped to swell the number of insurably occupied people in this country beyond the figure that was added in 1931, and that is the activity of building&mdash;a passing phase and an activity that is provided for, not out of revenue, but out of borrowed moneys; an activity, therefore, that means that the country is going&mdash; it may be for a good purpose, but very definitely going into debt.  If anybody steps back from the picture and looks at it, all they can see is a very big exhaustion or drawing in of resources and nothing that holds any promise for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no line of activity that is likely to be permanent, no line of activity that can be pointed to at the moment as providing more in the way of occupation than previously.  I am speaking of this in net terms.  There are certain lines of activity that have provided more people with work, but their impact has resulted in more people losing work in other occupations. In the net, however, the figure of those employed in industry in this country is down, saving for building operations.  Now, people are not always flattered, to their own later discomfiture, by promises.  A promise does attract for a time, and the nonperformance of a promise may be excused for some period on the grounds that there is not enough time to have the result seen or appreciated. However, after four years that sort of an excuse wears thin, and people at the moment are beginning to wake up to the fact that costs of living are being increased on them; that taxes are being imposed on the necessities of their lives; that, apart from the building activity, there is no increase in <Col N="105" /> employment in the country; that any increase in employment that there is in the country is not of a productive type; that it is costing money and that the money is being found, first, by the taxation of necessities, and, secondly, by going into debt, by raising the national and local debt; and that there is not much hope that anybody can see in their operation being continued at the moment.</P>
    <P>The President bound economics together with politics when he was speaking in 1931.  Speaking chiefly, as I say, on the political situation, he said that, undoubtedly, among the causes of unrest there were in the background economic causes, and the chief economic cause was unemployment, and that the chief remedy for that was not relief, not provision of more roads, not the cutting of corners or the provision of sewerage and other schemes, not building&mdash;that it was work in productive industry; and that work, of course, was promised, in amazing terms, to the people of the country.  The President, in those days, thought that if unemployment were to continue violence would become more widespread, and if violence were to be met by such provisions as were contained in the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, the only result would be, not to quell violence, but to drive it underground.  His mood at the time was, more or less, that these people were misguided, if you will, but that they were brave men, for whom, at any rate, we should have the decent respect one has for the brave.  I do not know if the President now thinks that the economic situation is so much bettered that that side, at any rate, of the argument has weakened or disappeared.  I do not know what the President is going to say about the political side, but at that time we were told that there was a reason for disturbances in 1931.  We have got to presume either of two things now: either that the causes have been removed or, alternatively, that there is such a particularly vicious conspiracy on foot now that the President, despite his principles in 1931, is going to use force, even though he has before him his own warning that force may result only in driving underground <Col N="106" /> and not in quelling a particular outbreak.</P>
    <P>Then, in all these circumstances, the President must surely realise that it is, at least, not tactful, not political good sense, to have Ministers of his Government addressing meetings throughout the country and advising people and putting into the heads of people this particular idea that if folk approve of a form of government such as, say, there exists in Russia, those people should promulgate these views on their platforms openly and the Government would see that they were protected, or at least would feel bound to recognise an obligation to protect them.  The President must know that people listening to the Minister for Agriculture speaking in that way must remember what was said in connection with other people.  They will remember that it is not so long ago that the President, when asked to protect certain property against raid and attack, said that the Government could not make unpopular people popular.  These were decent citizens in the country.  They were rather people threatened with arrest &mdash;people who had occupied important positions, the most important political positions that could be held in this country.  However, there is evidently to be one type of attitude towards such people and another type of attitude towards others, and the Minister for Agriculture could even say that if it were thought that there was a line of argument agreed upon by certain people to the effect that the form of government in, say, Russia was good, then the people who believed in that argument should mount their platforms and give it voice and the Government would protect them.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who believes that even those who at the moment preach Communism ought to have bottles thrown at them.  The kind of person that you attempt to put down by throwing a bottle close to his head is not going to be put down unless he is physically knocked out and overwhelmed by that particular type of argument.  I do not care what his cause is.  At any rate, if the Government stands for constitutional rights, <Col N="107" /> freedom of association and freedom of speech, they must remember there is a reservation in the Constitution Articles with regard to such activities as are lawful and in accord with public morality.  As long as the Government allows it to be thought, and by positive law have it, that the preaching of doctrines of this type is in accord with public morality or with the law, they are bound to protect people who take it that way, and in the present circumstances that prevail, say, in the City of Dublin, the Minister for Agriculture, via Wexford, in inviting them to preach these doctrines publicly, and promising the full support of the Government when they so preach them, is certainly not marked by any great sense of responsibility.  The President must remember that in 1931, when speaking against the Act on which he now relies so much, the Deputy who is now Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a Bill, we are told, to safeguard the rights of the people. We have the most glorious and democratic Constitution in the world, and in order to preserve it we are going to abolish it....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is in regard to the measure that the President is now calling to his aid:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order to safeguard the rights of the people we are going to take their rights away! What are the rights of the people?  The right of free speech, the right of free assembly, freedom of the Press, the right to be allowed to go at liberty until a charge can be brought and proved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are still the same constitutional rights that the President is now turning against people who can argue, as Deputy Lemass did then, turning the measure against those for whom the Deputy was making the argument. The President knows that a particular measure, the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, was described by a man who is now Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry as a Bill which would degrade this country as a Catholic country in the eyes of Spain.  He made a junction of a particular phrase, in which he said this measure in Ireland would be like a lance in the side of the <Col N="108" /> Catholic Church in Spain.  The President is going to use that particular measure and is correct in using it.  The President must definitely realise that he will not get the unqualified approval of the good action he is now taking until he makes it clear to his own Party, to the Labour representatives, and those sitting with us, what has happened to make him change his mind so suddenly.  What happened at any rate to make so sudden a change as this?  Certainly within about seven days we got disapproval of the phrase that an organisation had not got to be banned because its activities were illegal, as it banned itself, so to speak, but there was a definite declaration of the ban and the proclamation.  Has it anything to do with the comments of the Minister for Finance at Balbriggan, that proof had come into their hands to connect some members of that organisation with one of the two crimes, and when the evidence came to their hands?  Because all that is a reason why the President is now adopting as sound what he previously thought to be vicious, and he is now accepting as a permanent feature of the Constitution, what he thought were British coercive measures and bound to fail.  The President has got to explain the change even on that, because the people will wait with interest to hear why the President has definitely taken the correct turning, and when he came to the parting of the ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should refer to is that which is made here constantly whenever I have to introduce an Estimate, the complaint from the opposite benches that I did not make a statement.  That complaint, of course, was made here by three or four Deputies to-day, and in particular by Deputy O'Sullivan, who has been in the habit of making it in the past, and who, as long ago as 1933 was challenged by me to show a single instance in which the President's Estimate was introduced by a statement of policy in general.  Everybody who knows the procedure in the House knows why such a statement is not made, and was not made in the past, unless on some particular occasion, when there was something immediate and pressing, on <Col N="109" /> which no information had already been given to the House, which might be used to give that information.  For example, I suggest that if the Vote for External Affairs had not been taken, this Vote might have been used by me as a suitable occasion to indicate what was the attitude of the Government with regard to an immediate question on which a decision had to be taken. But every question which is before the public, as far as I know, has had Ministerial policy in regard to it indicated. Why then should I at the start make a statement?  As a matter of fact, everyone who is acquainted with the procedure of the House knows that the opportunity is taken on this Vote to give a field day to the Opposition. This is the Opposition day, the day on which every aspect of Government policy can be criticised more freely than on Estimates for other Departments. If there were some changes in regard to the organisation of the Department, or something of that sort, that had to be explained, the Minister for Finance, in introducing the Vote, might possibly have made reference to them, or I might have made reference, if questioned about them, but ordinarily this Vote is used as an occasion to enable all members of the House who have any questions to ask with regard to general policy to ask them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a convention here&mdash;at least there used to be a convention&mdash;about this Vote.  Seeing that on each of the other Departments an opportunity was given, except in so far as projected legislation was concerned, for discussing and criticising the Administration, in order that there might not be a repetition of that on this Vote, and in order, further, that the discussion might be confined to some particular major points, there was a convention that arrangements were made with the Opposition in advance by which they would indicate what was the particular subject they wanted to discuss so that the President or members of the Ministry, who might speak in the debate, would be able to make full replies to the questions raised.  Instead of accusing me of not treating the House properly, I think that the Opposition have indicated very clearly themselves that they have not any <Col N="110" /> definite matters to bring forward which have not been already dealt with on other Votes.  As to the points that were raised here to-day, there was the question of unemployment. That has already been dealt with, not once but many times.  The question of the farmers' position has been raised constantly and the Government's answer has been given many times. There has practically been no question brought up here to-day on which the answer has not been given, many, many times.</P>
    <P>The question of the proclamation and banning of the I.R.A. has been raised but on that, too, the Government's policy has been made quite clear by the Acting-Minister for Justice, so that this debate, in fact, is nothing more than a rehash of all those debates which we had constantly day after day in regard to the other Estimates.  In replying, in the main I must give a reply that has already been given many times both by myself and by Ministers in dealing with their several Departments.  Deputy McGilligan says that a very sudden turn has been taken recently in regard to our attitude towards the I.R.A. organisation. He wants to know in particular why the formal banning of the organisation and the declaring of it an unlawful association took place at this particular juncture.  The attitude of the Government has been all the time consistent, that an organisation which relies on force is by the very terms of Article 2A an illegal association. That was held constantly in other cases.  It was precisely because it was questioned by members of the Opposition, and so as to make quite clear what the attitude of the Government was, that the formal proclamation was issued.  It has no special effect but was issued lest anybody might be deceived by the statements that were made on the Opposition Benches.  It was issued in order that everybody might clearly know that it was an illegal organisation, an unlawful association, and that members of it, therefore, were open to the penalties which attach to membership of such an organisation.</P>
    <P>Where was the sudden turn?  Deputy McGilligan has taken a passage out of <Col N="111" /> a very long speech on the occasion of the discussion of the debate here on Article 2A.  If you take a single passage out of a very long speech, it is quite obvious that it can be misread. We have that happening constantly when a phrase is detached from its context and is made use of for political purposes by those who want to misrepresent what has been said in that matter.  If the Deputy cared to give the substance of the speech on that date, he would find that it was made quite clear in that speech that we did not stand for crime of any sort. It was made quite clear in that speech that in every organised community there had to be an authority to enforce order.  It was made quite clear in that speech that if there was not that authority here it did not exist anywhere in the country.  If Deputy McGilligan were anxious that the authority, which he says exists here, should be respected, I think that, on an occasion like this, he might at least have given some balanced extracts from the speech.  If I did say, giving the history of the whole situation as it had developed at the time, that there were brave men in that organisation&mdash; as I did say&mdash;I was speaking of the organisation as a whole, as it had come down to that time.  No word of mine at any time is, or was, open to the construction that I was defending people who had committed murder.</P>
    <P>As regards the attitude of Fianna Fáil and my own attitude in particular, from the beginning it has been this.  When the &ldquo;cease-fire&rdquo; order was issued we attempted to get a basis on which we could have an acceptance of majority rule here in this part of Ireland.  In order that that might win the broadest acceptance, we put it forward as a condition that every citizen in the country should be free to advocate his particular principles and that he and his representatives should be free to go into the people's Assembly without any political test being imposed upon them.  I believed in a policy of patience.  I believed in removing from everybody any possible excuse that might be put forward for the non-acceptance of the authority of the people's representatives elected <Col N="112" /> freely.  Our whole policy as a Government, our whole policy as a Party, was based on that thesis.  That was why we faced, and told the people we would face, whatever risks were involved in the abolition of the Oath.  If there had not been crimes of violence committed, I, at any rate, had intended to urge that our Party as a whole should have as part of its next election programme, that under no circumstances would any organisation that had as its aims the use of force or that proposed to use force as one of its methods, be permitted to exist in the State.  Of course, there are people who are such that unless you do everything they want, they will never be satisfied. There are such.  You cannot possibly please them.  What we regarded as our duty, in the political circumstances in which this country was, was to reduce that number just to those who wanted everybody, no matter what their views of the circumstances, to have their views and who were determined that until everybody conformed to their views there should be no peace and no order.  I think the numbers are reduced to very few to-day. I confess&mdash;and I am quite willing to admit it, as I admitted it before&mdash;that I am disappointed that there are even so many, and not only the few I had always to bear in mind.  But that there are so many as there are makes my disappointment the greater because I had the hope that those who were in that organisation, and who might have continued in it from the older times, would see that, though they had reason in the past for their attitude, any reason whatever for the maintenance of an armed organisation had disappeared.</P>
    <P>Do I regret the policy we have adopted?  If that policy has led in any way to the murder of individuals in this State I regret it.  I cannot say whether it is that policy that has done it but, if it has, I must regret it.  Otherwise, I would have held that our policy on the whole is justified, and that the people could not but realise that the reason we were taking strong measures is because no other way whatever is left open to us.  We have taken these measures, not for political purposes, <Col N="113" /> but because we regard them as absolutely necessary unless great evils are to follow.</P>
    <P>It is said that we came into office with the pledge that we would repeal Article 2A of the Constitution.  One of our first acts on coming into office was to put it out of operation, and it was out of operation for more than a year.  The first occasion it had to be brought into operation was when we had an organised semi-military force using a certain occasion to concentrate large numbers of people, some 20,000, in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Assuming the leaders of that organisation indicated that they were much stronger than they were, I cannot help it.  But of this I am certain, that we issued that ban at a time when the Executive Council were convinced that to permit that assembly would mean bloodshed.  It was the only legal weapon we had to stop that mobilisation.  We had this position in the country: We had two organisations, each of which was ready to use the existence of the other for intensifying organisation on its part.  It was in the presence of such organisation, with the example of the Continent before us, which shows quite definitely that if you are to have contests of this kind only one form of government can result, and that is dictatorship and the depriving of the people of their liberty, that we brought into force Article 2A of the Constitution. I repeat, in that connection, what I said on a previous occasion, because Deputy McGilligan referred to it.  I say deliberately that in the present condition of the world as a whole, and with examples such as there have been in other countries, as long as there are organisations prepared to band themselves in a military way with arms and capable of intimidating ordinary witnesses and carrying on their activities under secret machinery, with which the ordinary law is incapable of dealing, so long as such a situation continues you will need to have such special machinery to deal with them.  And one of the <Col N="114" /> things that will be provided in the new Constitution is some means by which such a situation can be dealt with by the Executive Council of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when I sat on the Opposition Benches, and saw the Ministers who introduced that measure, and when I looked at it, I came to the conclusion that they were incapable of carrying out such a measure without making it a measure of pure vengeance and not something that would create for the Executive popular support in order that it should be successful.  I have been accused of not having chosen an appropriate time for doing these things.  We did not stage it.  We took this course because we were presented with circumstances that made our action inevitable.  We did not stage a situation in which we had a chief of police going round the country and telling the country that the evils of Communism were such that the action the Government proposed to take was necessary to deal with Communism.  We said that Communism had no roots in this country and would not take root in this country. Not only did we say that, but the moment we came into office we proved definitely that that was so.  I gave figures on previous occasions to show what the position was in the year 1933 or 1934.  I have not those figures by me at the moment but they can be found in replies I gave to all those allegations about Communism. I showed that the votes cast for Communistic candidates here in Dublin demonstrated that they were dwindling here.  In the present municipal elections not a single person has dared to go up for election as a Communist, because in the past they got no votes. Why, therefore, try to manufacture Communism? Why make it appear that people with legitimate grievances had to be classed with those calling themselves Communists?  Our attitude is this: that there is nothing in this doctrine of Communism that is likely to win any acceptance from our people.  If then it is put forward it can be refuted and it is better that it should be put forward as a policy by those who believe in it, in order that it may be refuted, rather than that people who <Col N="115" /> are agents for those theorists should go around in private propagating this doctrine and pretending that the only reason why they do not do it publicly, as a policy, is because they are prevented by the Government for political motives from explaining their position.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  We have got to say to every section of the people in the country, &ldquo;If you have any policy with regard to economic requirements or any policy with regard to national matters that you want to put before the people, you have a free platform to do so.  Because you have a free platform and because there is no restriction on your right to send representatives into the national Assembly, you are not entitled to organise yourselves for the use of force.&rdquo; When I was dealing with this matter in the speech to which Deputy McGilligan referred, speaking of the situation at the time, I made quite clear what our aim was.  I stated that our aim was to open the door, so that every person who had a national programme to put before the people would have liberty to do so, and that if they got a majority of the people to accept their policy, then all the instruments of government would be handed over to them.  In the past, there was in this country a doctrine called the &ldquo;physical force doctrine.&rdquo;  What was called at the time &ldquo;constitutional activity&rdquo; was not regarded as sufficient.  It was considered that Britain would not release her grip and would not cease to govern here until methods other than those described as &ldquo;constitutional methods&rdquo; were adopted.  The basis for that theory was that, in the British House of Commons, Irish representatives were outvoted and there was a number of other theories, every one of which has now ceased to be applicable.  If physical force has ever to be used by this nation to advance its liberties, it is there to be used by the party that is returned by the people to use it, but not by anybody else.  It is quite clear that anybody else attempting to use it would, as I pointed out in that speech, be, in the first place, up against civil war.  I repeated on that occasion the <Col N="116" /> speech I made at Thurles&mdash;a speech which has been misrepresented on both sides.  I pointed out that the moment you had set up and established here a Government consisting of representatives of the people, with the obligation to rule and maintain order, and having at their disposal arms&mdash;the moment that situation was completely established, if any other body than the State relied on physical force to advance any of their ideas, it would, in the first place, necessarily mean a civil war, a war in which there would have to be killing of brother Irishmen.  I pointed out that that was such a horror that it ought to have been sufficient to deter those who were being fooled by members of the Opposition at the time of the Treaty as to what would be the conditions when the Treaty was accepted&mdash;that that was such a horror that it ought to make them pause before they would bring about such a situation.  It was being held at that time that, under the Treaty, the old methods of the I.R.B. and what was called at the time the &ldquo;physical force method,&rdquo; would still be available. They did not point out, as I pointed out or tried to point out, the situation that would have to be faced if anybody other than those elected by the people tried to use physical force.  I pointed out that they would, first of all, have to face the forces at the disposal of the responsible Government elected by the people.  If, in such a contest, the physical force party were successful, I pointed out that the circumstances would be such as to make it extremely likely that the next step would be to face an outside force if they wanted to make good and secure their objective.</P>
    <P>Since the time of the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order, I have said constantly in private and in public that, if you think force is necessary to secure this nation's independence, the one way you can get it is to get the confidence of the people and get them to put you into office. That was the position when we were successful from 1919 to 1921.  We were successful then, or rather, we owed whatever extent of success we had, mainly to the fact that throughout that period we were able to speak as the Government of the Irish people, freely elected by them, entitled to their <Col N="117" /> allegiance, entitled to use any force at hand and to organise the nation to use any force that might be necessary to preserve the independence which had been declared and to secure the recognition of that independence which was being sought.  Undoubtedly, those who have listened only to the propaganda from the opposite benches, where for years they were interested in trying to represent us as standing for things we did not stand for, feel that a very sudden change of front has taken place.</P>
    <P>That is one of the difficulties we have got to contend with now. Deputies opposite pretend that they want to help us, that they want to help to put public opinion behind us in order that the least possible amount of disturbance will be caused in carrying out our duty.  While they so pretend, practically every paragraph of their speeches and practically every word of theirs is designed with a different purpose.</P>
    <P>We, on these benches, are not approaching this matter with the idea of having vengeance on anybody.  We want to maintain public order.  It is our duty to do so, and whatever steps are necessary in order to carry out our duty, we give due warning to everybody, will be taken.  We say there is no possible excuse for anybody advocating the methods that are being advocated by certain people.  We say that it is only people who have not given any thought to what they are after who give countenance to these methods in the present conditions.  It has been suggested by Deputy McGilligan that some political purpose is involved in our action and that we have chosen a bad time.  In other words, if he and his colleagues were in office, they would manæuvre very much better as regards this proclamation, in view of the general circumstances. As I said before, there is no manoeuvring whatever about it.  The time was chosen, not by us, but by those, whoever they were, who showed by their actions that they were capable of committing murder, and claimed that they had authority&mdash;if they thought of the matter in that sense&mdash;over the lives of Irish citizens. It is those&mdash;whoever they are&mdash;who have been the occasion of it, and not <Col N="118" /> the Government.  All the time our attitude has been clear.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any other point has been made which calls for comment. What our programme is has been made clear by me here time after time to the Dáil and to the country as a whole. On each occasion I had only to take the manifesto issued in the 1932 and 1933 elections and read it out paragraph by paragraph.  I showed that we were systematically going through that programme&mdash;the political programme and, in its main terms, the economic programme.  The Constitution which it is proposed to bring in in the autumn has been mentioned. Deputy O'Sullivan criticised proposals which, I believe, were given by some individual somewhere.  They were of so little importance that nobody seemed to think it was worth while to bring them to my notice.  I must say that I was not aware that there had been any supposed disclosure of what the Constitution was likely to be, and I do not think that anybody could, in fact, make a full disclosure of the constitution as it is intended to be, because it has been decided in certain main principles, but obviously, if you are going to have a discussion of the Constitution you are to have it as a whole, and the Dáil and the country are in the autumn to be given ample opportunities for discussing it.</P>
    <P>I have said that the intention is something like this: that we would bring in the measure, debate it here, pass it into law with a suspensory provision so that it would not actually be effective until it is referred to the people.  It can be referred specifically to the people by way of referendum if that is found convenient, and possibly apart from any election if that can be done, or with an election if it cannot be done.  When the people have indicated their acceptance of it, the Constitution would formally be brought into law by a resolution of the new Parliament when it assembles. That will make it clear that everybody in the country will have a say in the matter; that it will not be as it was in 1922, that is, published on the morning of the polling, when nobody in the country would have <Col N="119" /> an opportunity of criticising it.  Then the Party which gets the majority would be able to say that the people had approved of the Constitution.  No such tricks as in 1922 will be tried on the people or on the Parliament.  The fullest possible opportunity will be given to everybody to discuss and criticise it, first, as I have said, here in this Parliament&mdash;assuming that we are in existence, and I have every reason to hope that we will be in existence unless an earthquake or something like that comes along&mdash;when the Autumn Session begins.  You will, therefore, have a full opportunity of dealing with it, and I suggest it is very much better that we should postpone criticism of any parts here and there of the Constitution when such an ample opportunity for considering it in full is promised.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are Constitution mongering, fiddling, I think somebody said, while Rome is burning. As a matter of fact, every other Department is at its own work carrying out its part of our general programme as hard as it can and the amount of time that Ministers will have to devote to this part of the work is not very great.  Has anybody, I wonder, looked at a copy of the Constitution and tried to bring it up-to-date or tried to know exactly what is the Constitution at the moment? There are certain people I see who not long ago have been through a course of constitutional law under the able guidance of Deputy McGilligan. I should be rather interested to know how clear they are in their minds as to the Constitution at the moment. There is no place to which you can refer anybody.  I have here a copy of the Constitution, which I got specially marked for myself, and there are far more lines erased in it than lines left whole.  I had promised, when we were bringing in the amendment about the Seanad, that I would get a revised version of this Constitution.  Let nobody get away with the idea that it is we who have been tinkering with the Constitution.  We are, I am quite ready to concede, responsible for five or six rather sweeping amendments, but the greater part of the amendments <Col N="120" /> to the Constitution were introduced by our predecessors.  While every amendment of ours was in the direction of trying to make the Constitution fit in with the aspirations of our people, the people on the opposite benches, when tinkering with the Constitution, were working in the opposite direction.  When we came here with a motion to enable the people to pronounce on the question of the Oath, the people on the opposite benches by virtue of their majority changed the Constitution.  They did the same thing as a man would do who, when he goes, say, before a court, in order to prevent the other litigant from getting his rights according to the existing law, makes the law different.  That is Constitution mongering, I think, and if there is tinkering there it is in the wrong direction.  If we changed the Constitution we did it to make it, as far as we could, agreeable to the wishes of the Irish people so that they will feel that it is their own Constitution, that every syllable and every bit of it will be their own making and that it will be a guarantee to the people of their rightful liberties and not an attempt to hamper them in exercising liberties previously given them and acknowledged as theirs.</P>
    <P>We will then have a Constitution, and I do not propose here to outline it in advance.  It will be necessary for me, in view of the Vote for the Governor-General's establishment, to go into one particular part, but I propose to confine myself to that.  I would not go into that point were it not necessary to explain what I said last year when the Vote for the Governor-General's establishment was under consideration. What I said at that time has not been fulfilled to the letter.  I said that probably it was the last time that Vote would be before the House and that I had hoped before we came to such an Estimate again that there would be no need for the Vote.  The reason why that statement has not been fulfilled is because I had intended when I made that statement to have the Constitution brought in during this session.  But there has been such pressure of work that I did not think it right to bring in a constitutional matter, important as it is, and take <Col N="121" /> up the time of the House when the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Finance and the other Departments wanted to get urgent measures dealing with the immediate needs of the people through the House.  So that all these charges that have been made from the opposite benches are without any foundations whatever.  Deputy McGilligan kept at the old tune again.  That is the old charge that has been, time after time, exposed.  He said that more people were not put into employment by the present Government.  That is not true.  A considerable number of people have been put into employment in industry and on the land.</P>

      <P>The fact is that there are more people put into employment in agriculture and put into employment in industry.  That is the fact. When you consider that that is so at a time when the great danger was that there would be less employment, even to have kept things in the circumstances at the previous level would have been in itself a big achievement.  Not merely have we done that but we have given extra employment.  It is obvious that these are the facts.</P>

      <P>The next big aspect of our policy that might come under criticism was that of our relations with Great Britain.  Deputies on the opposite benches talk as if we had only to go over to the British and say: &ldquo;We wish to be good friends with you,&rdquo; and the moment you did that you were going to get the British immediately to agree to your proposition.  That is quite clearly not likely to be the case.  Our position is that we hold that these moneys are not legitimately due, and that we can only do that which any person who felt the same in private life would do, and that is, to retain them to the best of his ability&mdash;to retain these sums anyhow.  If the person who claims these moneys from you is in a position to try to extract them otherwise <Col N="122" /> from you, that is part of the situation that you have to deal with&mdash;to do your best about it; to try to prevent him from extracting these moneys, if you are able, and, if you are not, at any rate to make it clear that that pressure is not going to get you to admit that he has a right to them.</P>
      <P>We do not admit that the British have a right to these moneys.  We have entered into negotiations a number of times, and these negotiations did not result, as I pointed out here, in our getting farther than the British saying to us that, if we admitted they were entitled to these moneys, then there might possibly be some mitigation. Deputies opposite pretend, of course: &ldquo;If the people only elected us what a wonderful chance we have now.&rdquo; Deputy Hogan does not happen to be here, but if he were here, I can imagine him standing up and saying, as he stated on many occasions in the past on a Vote like this: &ldquo;If you had only the courage you have a wonderful opportunity for making a great bargain.&rdquo; That is what he would say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why is the feeling abroad that there is an opportunity of making a great bargain.  If it is simply their personality is concerned with it, the Deputies opposite had many an occasion in the past.  For several years they were in control of the Government of this country and were in a position to make this bargain.  Why was it that when we came into office there was an opportunity for making bargains which did not exist before?  I know of none in reality except this, perhaps, that we have made it quite clear that if there is to be any settlement, so far as this Government are concerned, it can only be on the basis of that which we think our people as a whole are going to accept.  We do not want to pretend to anybody that you can make settlements of a political character at any time, and our policy as a Government has always been that we will make no bargain with any Power, that we will enter into no obligations of any sort, except those which we think, as a Government, we will be able to carry out with the support of our people; and not merely that we, but <Col N="123" /> that any Government that we can reasonably expect to come after us also will be satisfied with the political arrangements that are made.</P>
    <P>In view of the history of our country, I think it is quite clear to everybody that until the unity of this country is recognised, and until the right of our people as a whole to choose for themselves whatever form of government or governmental institutions they wish is freely acknowledged, no settlement that can be made by a Government for anything less than that can last.  That is a fact.  We stood to that firmly and we stand to it to-day. I say that if there is any other section of the people who are prepared to underbid us and say they can make a settlement like that, let them get the support of the people for it.  I believe that the people will not support anything else.  I believe that the only way in which the people might be got to support it, perhaps, is on the same basis on which they were got to support the Treaty and that is: &ldquo;We will use it as a stepping-stone; we will not regard it as being of value; we will regard it only as something imposed upon us under duress which we will have the right to get out of; something we will have the right to get out of the moment an opportunity offers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the people of this island are satisfied that their rightful aspirations are admitted and that their right to freedom is acknowledged, I believe that the great thing that has hampered us in the past and prevented good relations between the people of this island and the people of the neighbouring island will be removed; that co-operation and goodwill will result from it; and that there will be a readiness to consider questions that are common, interests that are common, and to deal with them on the basis that each party is going to be served by any arrangement which may be made.  I think it is good policy both for our people and for the other people who may be involved to have a settlement on such a basis, because you have the foundations on which there can be goodwill, and there can be faithfulness to the contracts which are made.  If <Col N="124" /> you have it on any other basis, you have the basis of want of settlement in the future, you have the basis of fear of deception and want of confidence. You will have all these interfering unless you get it on the basis I have been stating.</P>
    <P>It is not going to be easy.  It requires courage to face it.  When Lord Derby was over here in 1921 he asked me on what basis co-operation and goodwill could be got between the peoples of these two islands, and I pointed out to him that it was on that basis.  If I remember correctly, his answer was that he did not think the British Ministers would have courage enough to face a solution on that basis.  They have been accustomed to come along and look for courage from us.  I think the courage ought to come from those who are doing something that they are not legitimately or rightfully entitled to do.  We have the courage to do what we have a right to do, but we have not the courage to go beyond that which we have a right to do and to pretend that you can get faithful co-operation, or co-operation of any kind, from the people of this country unless the things which the people of this country have a right to have are admitted.</P>
    <P>That has been the basis of our policy &mdash;the policy of fair play for everybody in this country, fair play for every political institution and every political organisation.  We are not trying to prevent any other republicans who may believe that they have a better plan than we have from going ahead. The last thing in the world that would cross our minds would be to prevent them from having a free field.  If anybody asks what is the difference between ourselves and them, I would say that the big difference, if we could have it out in public, between the two is that question of method.  I hold that our method makes for the unity of our people.  It helps to knit the people together in a disciplined body, strenthens them to withstand any efforts to coerce them, whereas the other method, in the present circumstances, is bound to lead towards disruption and can never succeed.  If there is anybody who genuinely wants to see a republic established here, in <Col N="125" /> whatever time it may be possible to establish it, I will say he will do what we are doing and not do what those are doing who say they are faithful to the republic proclaimed in 1916 and declared in 1921.</P>
    <P>We are working towards it.  I am asked why I do not declare it immediately. For the simple reason that I know that I cannot make it effective over the country as a whole.  Our aim is to work towards a situation in which it will be possible for those in the North also to come in and join with us.  We are told by the people on the opposite benches that we have that if we accept the Commonwealth.  My answer to that is: let them get Lord Craigavon and the people in the North to admit that they are prepared for the unity of Ireland, to accept the unity of Ireland, and then they can go to the people with their policy and we will fight them on ours.  But let them get it and let them not be saying that if they accept the Commonwealth they are going to get it.  Lord Craigavon and those with him were against Home Rule in the past, and there has been no indication, as far as I can see, that they are prepared to accept the programme put forward from the opposite benches any more than we are.  We are going to move ahead on the lines that we indicated to the people when they first put us into office, and that we repeated we intended to continue on when they gave us a further term of office and renewed their confidence in us.</P>
    <P>I have nothing new to say whatever. If anybody is interested in the policy of the Government and of our Party he can go back to the manifesto that we issued during the campaign in the 1932 and 1933 elections, and if in the near future we have to go to the people it will be on the completion of that programme, because, in its nature, it is a programme that requires a number of years in order to completely carry out.  We did not say to anybody that we were going to cure unemployment in a couple of years.  We were most careful not to say that.  We pointed out then, and I still hold it is true, that we had better opportunities for dealing with unemployment than had countries in which there was overproduction, <Col N="126" /> with massed industries built up for world markets which were rapidly declining, countries such as America and Britain.  That was the position that we had to deal with.  I am quite willing that we should be judged on the basis that, on account of our comparative backwardness in the industrial sense, we had a virgin field to till.  I am quite prepared that that should be taken in as an element in calculating what progress has been made.  I give anybody a free present of the fact that we had a better position in that respect than most other countries.  In so far as we have not been able to avail of that position and have not shown results, then, I think, we can be justly held to account.  But I did not say that we were going to cure unemployment in a couple of years.  Because of the position in which we found ourselves when we came into office, industries had to be built up here, and I believe that we have done enough to justify our policy and to show the people that what we said could be done in relation to industry has been done.</P>
    <P>If we have to go to the people again it will be for a renewal of their confidence to continue and consolidate that position, to try to make this country, not one depending solely on the production of agricultural produce, but a country very much better balanced economically, better fitted to stand the strain of critical times, economically or otherwise.  I think if it should happen that the present situation generally in the world should develop in a worse direction, everybody here will bless the fact that we have made progress in the direction of making ourselves less dependent on foreign peoples than we were when we came into office.  As I have already said, I have nothing new to say.  I am tired of saying these things.  No matter how many times I say them I find Deputies getting up on the opposite benches and saying that we have no policy, that we do not know where we are going, that we are going backwards to-day and forwards to-morrow, and that we are always changing our direction.  That is not so.  The main aims of our policy have been set out, and we have no excuse to offer for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill, which is coming to the Dáil for Second Reading, contains a number of provisions, the principal one of which aims at giving the Minister power to purchase oats and barley.  The reason why this power is being sought is that for the last three years there have been difficulties in getting oats and barley cleared at harvest time and it is found necessary to give the purchasing merchants a certain guarantee that if they would purchase oats and barley at a certain fixed price the Government would relieve them of any corn they might have on hands in the month of June following.  For two years the merchants would appear to have made a certain profit, and this year it is possible there will be a small amount of barley and oats left at the end of June which it will be necessary for the Minister to purchase under the agreement made, but it is not likely that the loss this year will be very large.  It is, however, not a satisfactory scheme and it is felt it would be better if the Minister were given power to purchase oats and barley if the necessity arises in future.</P>
      <P>Another matter with which this amending Bill deals is a more rigid control of the sale of maize.  In effect, the change made is that a maize miller who has a licence to mill maize will also require a licence to purchase maize, so that the amount he can purchase over any period may be controlled. It has been extremely difficult in some cases to find out whether or not certain maize millers are obeying the regulations and it is considered necessary to have this power in order to tighten up the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the question of a certain undertaking.  When the first Cereals Bill was passed in 1933 provisions were contained in it to deal with home-grown wheat.  It was provided <Col N="130" /> that each flour miller would be obliged to purchase a certain percentage of his total quota for the year of home-grown wheat according to the amount of wheat grown within the country.  It was thought at that time, the percentage being small&mdash;in the first year it was only 3½ per cent.&mdash;that it was unnecessary to compel millers who had their mills a distance from where the wheat was grown to purchase the wheat, and it was felt it would be more convenient if the millers in the wheat-growing areas would be permitted to mill more than their quota.  It was arranged with the distant millers that the millers in the wheat-growing areas would undertake to mill the wheat for them.  Now the percentage has been largely increased and there is no longer any necessity for that provision, because every miller, whether at a distance or not, is obliged to mill the amount prescribed, and it would make the measure more easy to administer if this undertaking provision is withdrawn. There is also a provision in this Bill giving power to prescribe different classes of maize meal mixture. It has been felt at times that if we had power to prescribe that all oats or barley should be incorporated at a particular period or in a particular district it would have been easier to deal with the grain situation, and powers are being sought in this Bill for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Those are amongst the principal objects for which this Bill is brought in, but as the Bill is largely one of reference to previous legislation, I think it would be well to deal with some of the sections and to say a few words as to their meaning and necessity. The first seven sections do not call for any comment, as they are the usual sections in any such Bill.  Section 8 makes it impossible in future for one person to be both a miller and a wheat dealer.  There was the position in the past where one person could purchase wheat, and if asked to make a return by the Department or asked to account for the wheat by an inspector visiting his premises he could, as the occasion arose, say that it was for his flour mill or as a dealer that he had <Col N="131" /> purchased it.  That made it difficult in some cases to trace certain lots of wheat to their ultimate destination.  It is considered much better that one person should not be allowed in future to be both a flour miller and a wheat dealer.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the question of registration.  In the Principal Act it was laid down that the Minister could refuse a person a licence to commence business on maize milling on the one ground only, and that was that he considered that the district was being adequately supplied without the addition of that particular applicant.  It has been found in practice that there are other reasons why it would be well at times to turn down an applicant, particularly, I may say, a person who has had a shady reputation on some of the other registers or on that register for making rather constant infringements of the regulations.  Section 10 provides that in regard to the keeping of records maize millers will also keep a record of the amount of oat kernels that have been taken off the oats.  That was omitted from the original Act and should obviously have been always included. Section 11 provides that where the Minister buys oats or barley as laid down at the end of the Bill under Part V he shall not be required to be registered as a merchant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the section ending with the words &ldquo;or is the Minister&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Section 12 deals with this question of undertaking of which I have already spoken, that is that every miller in future will be obliged to mill the percentage as prescribed, and that he cannot get another miller to undertake to mill either all or part of that quantity.  Section 13 prescribes that if a wheat miller buys wheat, and if during the month part of that wheat is transferred to another miller, it is the net amount that will be taken as his purchases. Under the legislation so far, technically a flour miller could buy, say, a thouhand barrels of wheat, put that down as his purchases for the month, re-sell 500 barrels, and still claim that he had purchased a thousand barrels under the Act.  That was, of course, a defect <Col N="132" /> which should be remedied.  Section 13 also prescribes that the weight of the wheat will be taken as at the time of purchase.  Some millers have contended that they have to buy wheat which has been dried down to a low percentage of moisture, and that they should be permitted to regard their purchase as if it had contained the amount of moisture that was there at harvest time.  That has not been allowed, of course, and sub-section (2) is put in here to make the matter clear.</P>
      <P>Section 14 deals with the moisture in offals.  Complaints have been received by the Department that offals sometimes contain excessive moisture, and do not keep well.  There is no power at present to deal with that situation, and this section is being inserted for that purpose.  Section 15 deals with a contingency which has not yet arisen but is rather an obvious danger, and that is that a wheat dealer might possibly purchase a very large amount of wheat and hold it against the millers for a very high price knowing that the millers would have to fill their quota whatever they might have to pay for the wheat.  This gives the Minister power to interfere and to oblige the dealer in such cases to sell at a reasonable price.  Sections 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 are consequential on that.  Section 22 deals with the restriction on the sale of maize by maize importers.  Under sub-section (1) a maize importer cannot sell maize to a maize miller unless the maize miller produces a licence enabling him to purchase such maize. Sub-section (2) prevents the maize importer from selling maize to himself if he is a maize miller unless he has a licence to purchase as a maize miller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 is the same as Section 22, except that it is in regard to dealings between maize millers.  Section 24 deals with maize meal.  Section 25 deals with the restriction on the purchase of maize except to an importer who has a licence as an importer to purchase maize.  Section 26 deals with the conditions that may be attached to a maize purchase licence, and also with maize meal.  Section 27 is reviving a provision that was in the original Act of 1933, under which the Minister may prescribe that whole oats must be <Col N="133" /> used or that dehulled oats must be used, as the case may be.  Section 28 largely re-enacts the provisions contained in Section 82, which is now being repealed, of the original Act of 1933.  It enables the Minister to prescribe the maximum quantity of maize that may be incorporated in maize meal mixture. I should say that Part 6 of the Act of 1933 is being repealed, and that is why a number of these sections are being re-enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the question of whether oats or barley or rye, or oats and barley, may be incorporated in the maize meal mixture.  Deputies know that, up to this, when a percentage is prescribed, a miller is free to use any home-grown grain of the varieties that are in the Act&mdash;oats, barley, rye, wheat&mdash;that he can use those at his own discretion.  Now, this section gives the Minister powers to prescribe oats alone, or oats and another home-grown grain, or another home-grown grain without oats; in order words, oats or barley or a mixture of both. Section 30 re-enacts Section 83 of the 1933 Act and deals with the sale of maize-meal mixture.  There is nothing changed here, and neither is there anything changed in the next section, which was Section 84 of the original Act.  Part 5 deals with the powers conferred on the Minister to purchase oats and barley, and Section 3 gives the Minister that power.  Section 34 compels the Minister to pay the minimum price, at least if the minimum price is prescribed.  Sections 35 and 36 are the usual sections which accompany such powers.</P>
    <P>Then, the enactments which are repealed are, as I have already said, Part VI of the Agricultural Cereals Act of 1933, which was the part that dealt with the maize meal mixture, and as so many changes were being made in this Act and previous Acts, it was thought better to repeal that part entirely and retain the part that required to be retained and leave out the parts that required to be left out. Section 34 of the Act of 1934 is also being repealed.  It dealt with the sale of maize which was irregularly acquired.  That is now no longer necessary on account of some of the <Col N="134" /> new sections contained in this Bill. Sub-section (4) and sub-section (5) of Section 6 of the Act of 1935 was the section which dealt with the undertaking of one wheat miller for another. That provision is now being removed entirely from the legislation and these two sub-sections, therefore, are being repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, we oppose the motion that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  I think I am correct in saying that this is the fourth Cereals Bill that has been brought before this House.  Picture the feelings of any unfortunate man who is trying to carry on a milling business in this country and who has to consult four Acts of Parliament and all the statutory Orders that have been made under them before he knows, from day to day, whether he is breaking the law. The logical conclusion of a series of enactments of this kind is to nationalise the whole milling industry, and I have not the slightest doubt that if this House sanctions a continuation of the follies that have been perpetrated by the present Minister for Agriculture in connection with cereals and the milling business since he came into office, nationalisation will certainly become inevitable, to the material loss of the grain growers of this country, of the feeders of this country, and of the consumers of flour of the country.</P>

    <P>Now, when this cereals legislation was first introduced, we warned the Minister that the result of it would be to place a very great burden on the live-stock feeders of the country. A lot of Deputies in this House, of the more thickheaded variety, began to shout about the ranchers immediately.  These gentlemen have never bothered to buy the Pig Tribunal report and read it.  If they had bought it and read it, they would have found therein a map describing the distribution of pigs in this country and they would have found that the pig-producing areas of this country were West Cork, parts of Kerry, Clare, Mayo, parts of Galway, North Longford, Cavan, North Leitrim and North East Donegal. Now, I ask the House to bear those districts in mind and then to throw <Col N="135" /> back their minds to the day on which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance hung up in the hall at the foot of the Lobby stairs a map showing where unemployment, poverty and destitution was most prevalent in this country&mdash; showing where the holdings were smallest and most uneconomic&mdash;and those districts were West Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, North Longford, Cavan and North-East Donegal. This cereals legislation now saddles the people of that area with a burden of 3/- per cwt.  on every cwt. of maize meal mixture that they buy.  If any benefits accrued from that, they would accrue to the farmers of Kilkenny, Leix, Offaly and Tipperary&mdash;Kildare, perhaps, but anyway to the richest counties in this country.  However, if somebody were getting some benefit out of it, the money would pass around, it would circulate; and even though we felt that it was a hardship to subsidise the farmers of that area at the expense of the farmers in the poorest areas&mdash;and I think it is a very great hardship&mdash;even thinking that, if we felt that the farmers in the Midlands were getting a great benefit out of it, we might have some satisfaction and we would be able to feel that the money would circulate and that, perhaps, in the long run, the community generally would get some benefit out of it.  Nothing of the kind has happened, however.  The price of oats is nothing better than it was.  The price of barley may be 1/- a barrel more, but very little more; and in order to get that, we are paying 3/- a cwt. on maize meal.</P>
    <P>Now, maize meal is one of the constituents of a balanced ration for pigs, and home-grown cereals is another. Barley and maize meal are well-nigh interchangeable in any mixture that may be provided.  Oats and maize meal are not interchangeable, and oats is no substitute for maize meal. In the Department's own pamphlet describing the ideal mixture for a pig, there is a special note of warning that not more than 25 per cent. of oats or oatmeal should be included in any mixed ration for the fattening of <Col N="136" /> pigs.  At this moment, however, 33? per cent. of dehulled oats is included in the maize meal mixture at the Minister's order and you cannot buy pure maize meal.  Now, the Minister has made the calculation that taking all the foodstuffs used to fatten a pig from the weaning stage until it weighs I cwt., 1 qr. and 14 lbs. dead weight, about 6 cwt. of meal had to go to the mixture the pig would consume.  If that calculation be true, on every pig fattened by farmers in West Cork they lose 18/- on foot of the maize meal mixture scheme, and admittedly those farmers are living on uneconomic holdings and have the greatest difficulty in getting along.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to discuss legislation of this kind without discussing other Statutes of this House which have relation to the legislation under consideration.  Supposing the Minister comes back and says: &ldquo;Yes, I admit it is a bit of a burden on pig feeders but, through the Pigs and Bacon Act, pig feeders get ample compensation for any contribution they make under the cereals legislation,&rdquo; knowing of course that nothing could be further from the truth, and that the unfortunate pig feeders are in the position that they get it fore and aft. They are robbed when they go to buy meal and robbed again when they bring a pig to the factory.  If the matter is raised by way of Parliamentary Question we are told that the Minister has handed over the administration of live pig marketing and bacon marketing to the Pigs and Bacon Boards, and that he has no responsibility for these boards.  But it is under the powers conferred on these boards by Acts of this House that farmers can get 63/- per cwt. for a pig weighing 1 cwt. 14 lbs. dead weight, when the price is fixed at 63/-, but if it weighs 1 cwt. 13 lbs. he is paid at the rate of 48/-. I saw a farmer going to a factory three days ago with five pigs.  For one weighing 1¼ cwt. 2 lbs. he got 63/-; for others weighing 1 cwt. 13 lbs., 1 cwt. 12lbs., 1 cwt. 9 lbs. and 1 cwt. 7 or 8 lbs., after they had been killed and eviscerated, because they were two or three pounds below the figure fixed by the board, he was paid at the rate of 48/-.  I have no hesitation in <Col N="137" /> saying that these four pigs were as good or better than the pigs for which he received 63/-.  He had to take the money and go home.  There was no remedy.  The bacon manufacturer was in a position to say: &ldquo;There is no use asking me to exercise discretion in your case.  There are rules laid down by the Marketing Board and I have no power to pay you any more.  I would break the law if I did.&rdquo;  I say that that man in rearing pigs was robbed of 15/- on each pig under the cereals legislation, and when he brought them to the factory he was robbed of at least 15/- more on each so that from that unfortunate man £6 was taken by codology representing the administration of this cereals business and the pig marketing business.</P>
    <P>God knows how the farmers of this country hold their patience.  It is a source of astonishment to me.  Just imagine buying a bonham last February and the owner looking forward to the day it was sold as a pig to get household articles, and then having to go home with just enough in his pocket to pay for the feeding stufls, and four more bonhams, with four months' hard work gone for nothing, and no remedy.  These are the people who are going to be saddled with this Bill in order to make the screw tighter than before.  We were told by the Minister when this legislation was passed that he could not by any known chemical tests ascertain what percentage of barley or ground oats was contained in the maize meal mixture. He said that was perfectly easy to-day and that he had a whole string of samples in the Department.  It was with amazement that they discovered to their horror that they could not ascertain how much home-grown grain was contained in it.  Everyone could tell them that there were maize meal millers grinding practically pure maize and charging £7 16s. 0d. for what cost £4 14s. 0d.  The wise gentleman in Merrion Street could not make head or tail of it.  This Bill is supposed to remedy that position and I wish them luck.  The maize meal mixture scheme is a rotten scheme, rotten root and branch.  It is extravagant, improvident, futile, ineffective and a hardship on those least able to bear it.  It is a <Col N="138" /> legislative absurdity to have grain grown in Kilkenny, carted to Sligo, milled there, and sold in Queen's County, and that is what the Minister proposes to be in a position to do in this Bill.  If he has to get a certain quantity of home-grown grain he has to buy it where he can get it.  The miller often finds that he cannot get enough in the neighbourhood but, as he has to get it somewhere, it sometimes happens that it is carted to the North of Ireland, milled there and shipped back to the parish in which it was grown, the only people to get anything out of it being the railway company.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there will be a surplus of oats after the harvest this year. Upon my word one would want the patience of Job to listen to the Minister. If there is going to be a surplus of oats why has the price of oatmeal gone up £3 a ton in the last month? The Minister is flopping and floundering about in the morass he made in the last three months.  He allowed the millers because they have dehulling machinery to use oats almost exclusively in the maize meal.  Millers boycotted barley and put in oats, with the result that at the end of the season, in June and July, oatmeal had gone to £16 10s. 0d. and the 10 stone that cost 14/- now costs £1, but the farmer who produced the oats does not get 1d. more, because the mills and maltsters' houses in the midlands had stocks of oats.  The intelligent Minister we have will be promptly coming to the House asking us to vote money to repair the losses made on the deal. Job's dunghill was nothing to this country.  Now we come to bread. What has the Minister done for us with regard to wheat?  Futility is pitiable but hypocrisy is disgusting.  The Bread (Regulation of Prices) Bill, 1936, has been produced for the benefit of the Dublin municipal elections.  Fianna Fáil candidates going around, whether at the corner of Fenian Street, York Street, or the Gloucester Diamond will assure the people that they are going to regulate the price of bread and are going to deal with people who charge too much.  Not one farthing has gone on the price of bread that the Minister for Agriculture is not <Col N="139" /> directly responsible for.  This legislation that we are considering has increased the price of flour to the people by 11/- a sack and that represents 1½d. on the quartern loaf, and that 1½d. has been put on with the connivance and with the consent of the Minister.  It is fraudulent and shameless to pretend that somebody else was responsible for the situation at present obtaining.  Who is benefiting by the growing of wheat?  Nobody.  I know that there are many farmers who have grown wheat and have made money out of it, but I say that those who have made most out of wheat have benefited least.</P>
    <P>I know men who, when this business began&mdash;some of them the finest farmers in this country&mdash;made up their minds that the Minister for Agriculture was so futile and helpless a person that the whole agricultural industry would come to ruin under his administration.  They were perfectly right and, having taken time by the forelock, they bought machinery, went in and ploughed up every acre of land they had, planted it in wheat and sold the wheat in the course of the three splendid harvests which we have had during the last three years at the subsidised price and put the money in the bank.  Being prudent and good farmers, they roped in so much every year for the depreciation of their land. They made up their minds that farming as an industry was destroyed in this country, and that any person who had invested his money in land would have to mind the land if he was to get out of it.  Accordingly they went in and proceeded to take the heart out of the land through subsidised wheat and to put the money into their banks.  When the time comes when that land has no heart left in it, they will sell the land for whatever they can get for it or they will go and leave the land.  They will have got out of it, by way of subsidised wheat, the price of the land.  In that way they will disembarrass themselves of something which, before the Minister came into office, was a valuable asset but which, since he came in, is a liability for anybody who has the misfortune to be left with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Take the vast majority of the remaining farmers who are growing wheat. In the past they were growing some other cereal or maybe some other root crop, or they were making the land pay in some other branch of agriculture that was profitable before the Minister came into office.  I do not blame these men who went in for growing wheat in order to get the subsidised price.  Who could blame them?  I do blame the Minister who is so short-sighted as to burden the bread consumers of this country with a sum not less than £1,500,000 per annum in order to grow wheat where wheat was not wanted, in order to force the farmers to indulge in an agricultural economy that is going to bring nothing but disaster and misfortune to this country.  Remember when this cereals legislation was first brought in, we were told by Senator Connolly, who was one of the spokesman of the Government in the plan of campaign the Government had embarked upon, that it was intended to pull down in 100 days the live-stock industry that it had taken 100 years to build up and that what we were going to substitute for that was wheat, beet, and peat&mdash;and tobacco as a sop to Deputy O'Reilly. Tobacco has gone out of favour and we are not free to refer to beet and peat.  We do know that wheat was to be the remaining leg upon which agriculture was to stand.</P>
    <P>Who will say after the experience of the crop this year that the agricultural industry of this country can securely rest on this foundation?  Suppose we had 600,000 acres of wheat last winter and spring to sow, and one-third or one-half of it failed, what would happen to agriculture in this country? Suppose we get an autumn similar to the spring we had, that we get damp foggy weather in the months of August and September, what will happen to the 600,000 acres of wheat and to the unfortunate agricultural community who are depending on that for their income?  I say that agriculture is an industry that can be carried on in this country without subsidies or doles from anybody if the Government would do its duty and secure for the farmers <Col N="141" /> the markets to which they are entitled. I say, furthermore, that agriculture could be the source from which we could derive that surplus income which would make it possible for us to provide a higher and a better standard of living for everybody in this country. I say that under this cereals legislation and the general Fianna Fáil policy, the farmers are being turned into paupers. Deputy Mrs. Concannon deplores an analogy being drawn between free beef and the free milk that is being distributed by the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should have said that in consequence of this Bill it is in order, but if you, Sir, take a different view, I am not prepared to question the matter.  I must only leave it to Deputy Mrs. Concannon to visualise the close connection between the cereals legislation and that other intervention of the Government in our daily lives.  I look forward to another opportunity of explaining to her more fully the connection between the two. I do want to emphasise that this cereals legislation, so far as I can see, has benefited nobody in any part of the country.  It has put a burden on the backs of those sections of the agricultural community, least able to bear it, of £3 per ton on the feeding stuffs which they use for their pigs and their fowl.  It has put a tax of 1½d. on the quartern loaf which is principally paid by the people of the cities.  I ask Deputies to remember that food statistics the world over prove in every country that the poorer the individual is, the larger bread <Col N="142" /> bulks in his diet.  The more affluent a family is the more they turn to cakes, biscuits and substitutes which they can afford.  The simpler a person's diet, the poorer the person's household, the more he depends on bread as the principal comestible.  On every loaf of bread going into every tenement house in this city, there is a tax imposed by the Minister for Agriculture of 1½d.  Every time a child from a tenement room goes down to a baker's counter to buy two loaves, it might as well pay for its bread at the counter and, as it comes out, pay 3d. to a tax collector at the door. I said once that so long as that situation obtains I want no wheat on my land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this clear.  The agricultural labourers of this country are earning 20/- per week, many of them less.  The farmers of this country have been reduced to destitution.  I sympathise with many of them who have had to learn to grow wheat in order to get money to pay for the urgent necessities required for their families.  As to the farmer, who can afford to drag on without growing it, I sympathise with him when he says: &ldquo;I will not grow any crop which means that when I give my agricultural labourer his 20/- at the end of the week, and, when he goes to buy six loaves, I shall have to take 9d. out of his pound to put into my pocket.&rdquo;  It is the agricultural labourer who is earning 20/- a week, it is the tenement dweller living on the dole, it is the person who is at his wits' end to know where to-morrow's meal is coming from, who is paying every penny of the expense of this Bill.  I think I know the agricultural community of this country well, and I know that they do not want to earn their living in that way.  They are prepared to earn their living, to work hard for it and give value for the money they receive. They do not want to become parasites. So long as they are left to hoe their own row they will never ask anyone to contribute to their upkeep.  But there, again, they are being slowly manoeuvred into the position of being pensioners and dolees, dependent on the Party of Fianna Fáil.  The greatest crime <Col N="143" /> against the agricultural population has been the policy that has degraded them to the position of being dependent upon free milk, free beef and doles from the Government.  That is the greatest crime committed against this country. It makes one long for the day when we can form a Government under which the farmer will be able to hold up his head and feel that he and his family are upright, hard-working people and not parasites upon the poorer sections of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We were opposed to the original Bill, and we criticised it in its different Stages in this House. Being opposed to the original Bill, I do not think we have any inducement to vote for this addendum.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, the series of Acts passed in the last few years have made it more and more difficult for the livestock farmers to carry on their industry and particularly those engaged in the pig-rearing industry.  The cost of food for pigs has gone up by anything from 3/- to 4/- per cwt.; the average is 3/-, but in some cases it is more than that.  Each of these difficulties is to run contemporary with this Bill which is to make regulations as to the buying and selling of pigs.  Deputy Dillon gave the case of someone of whom he has knowledge in connection with the reduction of prices because of selling either over or under the weight.  There is a combination amongst the bacon factories to extract from the pockets of the farmers every possible shilling, and by extracting I mean paying the farmers the least possible amount. There is a tendency to do away with the competition that exists amongst the factories.  I could give particulars of a large breeder of pigs who lost a considerable amount of money in the rearing of pigs.  His loss was £20 or £30 on one lot because some of them were over or under by a few pounds in weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this Bill going to make it any easier for any fattener of live stock? There is not one section in it that will help the ordinary small farmer or labourer who rears pigs.  On the contrary it is going to add to his difficulties and expenditure.  The Bill teems <Col N="144" /> with sections making the miller arbiter if he incurs extra expense.  There are various activities also that are to be restricted, some of them perhaps rightly so.  All these restrictions will make business more difficult for the miller.  If the miller is going to lose something he will pass on his loss either to the person from whom he purchases or the person to whom he sells &mdash;either to the grower or to the consumer. The miller will take care that any little expenditure he incurs under this Bill will be passed on.  All the time we have regulations which are going to mean an extra 11/- or 12/- on the sack of flour which will have to be borne by the poor.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend time going over a Bill that I have not a shred of intention of supporting in any of its sections.  But there is one section which is going to make it obligatory on the maize miller to show the amount of kernels he has on hand.  I would like a section that would compel him to show the amount of hulls he has on hands.  Some of us get the hulls and some again get the kernels.  If the Minister made it obligatory on some millers to keep the amount of hulls there might be some sense from the farmers' point of view.  There is not one solitary sentence in this Bill from beginning to end that is going to ease the situation one bit for the farmers. The tendency is all in the other direction. It would be idle for me to spend any time in discussing this Bill.  It is no more advantage to the farmers than the original Bill was.  In fact, it imposes additional charges no matter how the Minister may attempt to explain it away.  The whole principle of this cereal legislation is unpopular with farmers in most of the live-stock feeding counties.  The sooner the whole thing is scrapped instead of amended the better it will be for the great bulk of the farmers in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, this is the fourth Cereals Bill which has been introduced in order to try to do something which cannot be done.  I venture to suggest that if the Minister wants to put in force the regulations under this Bill he will have to <Col N="145" /> introduce another Bill.  If legislation could remedy everything&mdash;the farmers' position, the millers' position and the position of the country in general&mdash; there would be no ills in the world to-day.  The Minister is trying to do by legislation what should be left to the ordinary business man's intelligence to do as best he can.  I understand it is the intention of the Minister to require the miller to buy all his oats.  I think it is only extra folly to be discussing legislation of that kind. We do not know where it is leading. Deputy Dillon spoke a good deal about the good farmer and the growing of wheat.  I know a great Fianna Fáil advocate of wheat-growing in my county.  He trots up and down the county advocating the growing of wheat and beet.  He has grown it and he is giving a present of it to the Government now, while they are planting him down in Meath, where no wheat was ever grown and where he will not grow it.  It is no wonder that farmers like that should advocate the growing of wheat&mdash;people who have no intention of staying on their holdings.  I have had a little experience of the Government's legislation and I know what it tends to.  It would not be relevant for me to relate my experience on this Bill but I know that the Government's legislation tends to restrict the individual, while a certain amount of dishonesty creeps into transactions. Under this cereals legislation I heard of licences being taken from millers and of Government inspectors by the score travelling up and down the country inspecting this mixture.  I know that there is not much use in trying to induce the small farmers who, generally speaking, were the best farmers, to feed stock, whether pigs, young cattle or anything else, because they will tell you, and it is well known, that feeding stuffs are too dear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may fix a price for barley or oats.  What is either of these but raw material.  I suppose the farmer who gets a good price for his barley is delighted but, at the same time. it is rather unfair that another farmer should be expected to buy back that grain and not get a decent price for his product.  That is the kernel of the whole situation.  If there was a levelling <Col N="146" /> up and if the finished article, whether bacon, beef or poultry, was fetching a price commensurate with the cost of production, the Minister would have no trouble.  If the Minister thinks that, by giving a good price for oats or barley, he can meet the situation, it is all very well.  I understand that a certain quantity of these crops will be left on the Minister's hands.  I could not be expected, and no farmer could be expected, to analyse all the legislation and regulations in connection even with cereals. There is one regulation to-day; to-morrow, it is cancelled and a new order or something like that is issued. No ordinary people could be expected to be conversant with all these regulations. I shall not prolong this discussion, because I think it is idle to point out the difficulties arising out of the Government's legislation.  As in the case of other Bills, the Minister, with his majority, will simply make this Bill law.  I noticed while the Minister was speaking how few Fianna Fáil Deputies who are conversant with the farming business were in the House.  I noticed Deputy Tom Kelly and Deputy Mrs. Concannon while a few more Deputies have now come in.</P>

      <P>My views are already known with regard to this policy of the <Col N="147" /> Minister.  I represent a constituency which purchases a greater amount of feeding stuffs than any other constituency in the Saorstát and I must again protest against the Minister's policy. Passing through Ballingeary last Sunday&mdash;Ballingeary is in the Gaeltacht and is one of the poor parts of the country&mdash;I was informed that, at a meeting of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour supporters held recently, a resolution was passed protesting against the policy of the Minister with regard to this admixture.  I do not know if the Minister has, so far, received that resolution.  I have not received it but I expect it at any moment.</P>
      <P>A year or two ago the Fianna Fáil supporters in that area were misled. They got it into their heads, when Senator Connolly went down there, that he was going to provide the Gaeltacht part of the district with meal at a reduced price.  They hoped to have meal supplied to them at 5/- a sack less than it could be supplied in other parts of the country.  Of course, I was not one of those people who were carried away with an idea like that. It would be a joke to think that the like of that could be done, because as a farmer's son said to me: &ldquo;If that policy were given effect, we would be out with ropes every night dragging sacks of meal across the Border.&rdquo;  The people of that area very soon discovered that they were not going to get that advantage.  They now realise that the whole scheme with regard to the admixture has imposed a very great burden upon them.  Some of the small farmers in that constituency whose annuity might not be more than £5 would, in normal times, use half a ton of meal in a week.  Taking four sacks at 5/- a sack, that would be a burden of £1 on these unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>I have often asked to have a commission set up to inquire <Col N="148" /> into this matter.  There is no use in Deputies opposite smiling about it. Deputy Murphy comes from the very area which is suffering and knows the position.  I took a figure of 5/- a sack and I say that that would be a loss of £1 per week to these people owing to the policy of the Minister.  I challenge the Minister to contradict that statement. As has been pointed out by other speakers, this policy imposes such a burden upon the poor people living amongst the rocks and the furze that it is a crime.  I think the Government should set up the commission I have been demanding in this House and find out the manner in which these people manage to carry on.  That would be an education to people in other parts of the country.  The whole policy of the Government has at last been found out by the people; it has been found out even by their own supporters who are crying out every day in the week against it because of the burdens imposed on them.  Their own supporters are also crying out with regard to the wheat policy.  Everything in connection with the wheat policy has imposed a burden on those people, people who cannot in any way grow even one-half acre of wheat because of the quality of their land.  These people live on holdings the bulk of which has been reclaimed by themselves or their fathers out of bogs and mountains.  Such land is unsuitable for wheat-growing.  The people of this country consume 3,000,000 sacks of flour per annum.  The Government policy on wheat and flour has imposed at least a burden of 10/- per sack of flour on the consumers.  That means that a tax of £1,500,000 a year is placed on the backs of the people of this country.  What do the people get in return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the total of the additional employment given through flour-milling and the wheat policy?  That is a question that should be reopened at once. When the Tariff Commission some years ago investigated the case made for putting a tariff on imported flour they made a calculation and reported that if all the flour consumed here were milled here only 153 extra hands would be put into permanent employment in <Col N="149" /> addition to the people already on temporary employment.  Deputy Mulcahy told the House that there were 481 additional people in employment as a result of the wheat policy of the Government. Very well.  Say we put it at 500 people.  Suppose you pay a pension of £3 a week to these 500 people it would mean a total sum of from £75,000 to £77,000 per annum.  Anyone who looks at those figures would see that it would pay the Government to burn those flour mills, give pensions to all the people employed in them and save the people of the country this heavy burden of £1,500,000 a year.  Is there any business man who in his own business would, in order to gain say £77,000 a year, spend £1,500,000 a year?  I have always treated public business and Government business as if they were my own business.  I have never departed from that principle. Anybody who would depart from it is not fit to represent the people of this country.  I have given the House my views on these things because I could not let the occasion pass without again offering my protest against the policy of the Minister in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that in the operation of the scheme to which this Bill relates there are in some cases at least small mill-owners whose licences have been withdrawn by the Government.  The number of such cases is not very large. I do not want to exaggerate the number. Some cases have been brought to the Minister's notice.  These have arisen to a certain extent through ignorance or let us say neglect to comply with the law.  The thing was not wilful.  Now the passage into law of this Bill provides the Minister with an opportunity of restoring those licences. For one reason I am glad that the Minister is obtaining in this measure powers to purchase supplies.  I am glad of that for perhaps a different reason from those advocated in other quarters.  I am aware of the fact in regard to the operation of the admixture <Col N="150" /> scheme that certain hardships have very definitely arisen from small millers.  These hardships arise because these men find themselves from time to time in the grip of the large mill-owners, people who are able to store in large supplies, and who can extract from the small mill-owners the price that they desire whenever they find the small men in difficulties.  I hope the Minister will bear that matter in mind and that he will be able through the operation of the powers he has got to see that the person in a small way in business is not squeezed out by more powerful financial interests, by the strong combinations that grip him at the present time.  I do think that in certain areas there has been considerable hardship in regard to the operation of the admixture scheme.  Deputy O'Leary has referred to one area and there are other areas of which I know. I do not want to make any pronouncement on this matter now but I think the Minister will find in his Department material enough to give him an opportunity of testing this problem. There is very little land fit for tillage in some areas that I have in mind. I suggest to the Minister that before this Bill is operated it would be advisable for him to consider the needs of special areas such as those of Ballingeary referred to by Deputy O'Leary and similar districts.  I regard this measure as a reasonable attempt by the Minister to deal with the difficulties that arise.  There must be difficulties and difficulties very often arise that are not obvious until a measure is put into operation.  These difficulties should be remedied when they arise.  My criticism of the measure has reference to what I have seen as to the defects arising out of previous measures.  I hope the Minister will go carefully into the matter and that he will receive, as I have always found him ready to receive and deal with objections that are reasonably made.</P>

      <P>I said 5 cwt. should finish a pig.  Some do better and others worse.  Deputy Dillon is doing worse. He said it took 6 cwt.  It was on the figure of 6 cwt. that he made his calculation <Col N="152" /> as to the amount of the maize mixture.  That is why I say that he ought to learn the fundamentals of farming before he talks about this matter. There is no man who knows anything about farming who would feed his pigs on maize alone.  It would take 7 cwt. of maize to finish a pig.</P>

      <P>It would not take that much at all with a proper ration.  If a farmer is making up a mixture he knows he must put a certain amount of carbohydrates into it.  Our farmers have got very intelligent in regard to these matters in the last 25 or 30 years. They know they must put in a certain amount of carbohydrates, fats and nitrogen.  The usual thing they do is to find out the price of maize meal, pollard and bran.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so long since I did chemistry that I could not say.  The carbohydrates can be converted into fats in a physiological way.  But pigs require 60 per cent. carbohydrates and a percentage of fats, perhaps 5 or 6 per cent.&mdash;generally the pigs get too much fats&mdash;and a certain amount of nitrogen.  I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle would allow me to give a long lecture on the subject for the benefit of Deputy Dillon.  I should like very much to do so, but I am afraid it would be in vain, because he would get up the next day and say the same thing again.  He talked of 6 cwt. of maize meal mixture being required and about the price of the mixture.  He multiplied that by six and said the pig was costing 18/- more than it would cost otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not try to put me off this.  It is most important that he should know this.  An ordinary intelligent farmer who goes in to buy meal for a mixture for a pig inquires the price of maize meal mixture and of pollard and bran.  These are the things available at the moment.  Then he orders a certain amount of pollard and bran as well as maize meal and meat meal in order to make a good mixture. Taking the mixture here as compared with Liverpool, there is nothing like 3/- per cwt. of a difference, because bran and pollard are cheaper than they would be if there were no such scheme as this.  Before we brought in this scheme, pollard and bran were 15/- per ton dearer here than in Liverpool, because the price here was regulated by the Liverpool price, plus freight. Now our price is much lower than the Liverpool price, instead of being 15/- higher.  Under our scheme for the destruction of old cows, the price of meat meal is £5 or £6 per ton less than in Liverpool, or in any part of England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the ordinary balanced ration that an intelligent farmer would give to his pigs, I say that in all probability the mixture is not more than about 10/- per ton dearer or thereabouts.  The last time I spoke on this matter, I gave the price of pollard here and in Liverpool and the price of maize meal mixture and of meat meal here and in Liverpool.  At that time the difference was 10/- per ton.  I do not know whether it has varied very much in the meantime, but I take the chance of saying that there is not more than £1 in the difference.  That is why the <Col N="154" /> farmers are not troubled so much as Deputies think over this matter.  They are not troubled over these things, because they have intelligence and know how to balance the ration.  They make up the whole thing and they see that they can get meat meal, pollard and bran much cheaper, and if they pay a little more for the maize meal the whole mixture is not more than it would be, as they say, if Cumann na nGaedheal came back.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Dillon talked about pigs and told of a farmer who brought in pigs and got 63/- per cwt. for one and 48/- per cwt. for others.  The reason why these different prices are fixed is that, according to the bacon curers, with a certain weight of side and a certain depth of fat they can get the ideal combination, and they give a higher price for such a pig sold deadweight to the factory.  If the side is too light, if it is too lean, or if it has soft fat upon it or several other things specified in the orders which deal with prices, the bacon is not as valuable.  I think that the Bacon Board would not be doing their duty if they did not try to induce farmers to produce the best type of pig, the bacon from which will get the highest price.  I am quite sure that even Deputy Dillon, if he had thought over this, would agree with me that the curers ought to try to induce farmers to produce the best possible type of pig to give the best possible type of bacon in order that we may get the highest price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same with barley. If the Deputy looks up the price of imported feeding barley in England during the last two or three years, he will find that it has been coming in at between 10/- and 11/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the price of feeding barley coming in.  If we did not introduce our cereals legislation to keep out the imported barley and try to maintain a price for our own farmers, the price would now be down almost to that of the imported price which is between 10/- and 11/- per barrel.  The Deputy objects to barley that is grown in Kilkenny being brought to Sligo to be ground and then sold, as he says, in the Queen's County.  I do not think that is nearly so objectionable as having maize that was grown in the Argentine being brought to Sligo to be ground and sold in the Queen's County. From the point of view of distance the objection surely is not nearly so great as Kilkenny is within a reasonable distance of Sligo.  The Deputy became indignant because, he said, I did not compel the millers to use barley instead of oats during the year, and now that the oats is all gone, the millers having used it up, it is getting dear and people who want oats from the oat millers have, as he says, to pay too much for it.  That is one of the things that I am going to remedy under this Bill.  I am going to compel millers to use oats if the Order says so, and to use barley if the Order says so.  In that way the situation which the Deputy says has arisen here cannot occur again.  I would like if the Deputy would go back and look up some of the questions that he addressed to me during last October and November when he talked about the futility&mdash;he also used a number of the high-falutin phrases that we are so accustomed to hear from him&mdash;of <Col N="157" /> absorbing all the barley under the scheme in operation.

That was a strange statement coming from a Deputy who belongs to a Party which has wheat growing as one of the planks in its programme.  The Deputy is quite prepared to give soup in the form of wheat growing to districts down in Leinster, even though he does not believe in the wheat-growing policy, but he is prepared to do that in order to get an extra few votes for his Party. <Col N="158" /> That shows the depths to which that Party has descended.

      <P>I was sorry to hear Deputy Curran make some very exaggerated statements, because I think he is an honest Deputy, even though he is sitting on the opposite side of the House.  He said that we make one regulation to-day and rescind it to-morrow.  The Deputy was guilty of terrible exaggeration in saying that. We made a regulation last December on the maize meal mixture and it has not yet been changed.</P>

      <P>It is true that it gives us power to make regulations, but we do not act as the Deputy said that we do. making regulations one day and rescinding them the next.  I would advise the Deputy to be a little bit more careful in future before he makes exaggerated statements of that kind. Deputy O'Leary said that when the Party opposite were sitting on these benches they refused to put a tariff on flour because, as he said, the tariff <Col N="159" /> would mean that only 150 extra hands would get employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that was the opinion that was expressed by the Tariff Commission in their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, we have the statement from Deputy Mulcahy that it did have the effect of giving employment to 500 additional hands.  I was sitting on the opposite benches at that time, and I remember distinctly describing the statement that the tariff would only give employment to an additional 150 hands as nonsense.</P>

      <P>The Minister had better conclude as soon as possible because <Col N="160" /> we intend dividing the House on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that the point that Deputy Murphy made about the small millers who are off the register can be considered.  I would like to indicate now that on the Committee Stage of the Bill I propose moving one amendment dealing with the scheme which is under consideration for the provision of seed-wheat for spring sowing. The amendment will be to the effect that millers who adopt the scheme, if they keep the home-grown wheat for seed and sell it as seed, will be permitted to replace it by imported wheat.</P>
