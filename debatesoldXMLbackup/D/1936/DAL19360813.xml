      <P>Eleven pensions have already been sanctioned.  Owing to the difficulty of procuring accurate information from the records in Limerick, some time elapsed before definite proposals could be made.  To obviate hardship, interim payments were authorised last January. This arrangement will come to an end on 30th September.  Before that date all the remaining cases will, I hope, be disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will set up machinery whereby the volume of emigration from the Saorstát to Great Britain and other Commonwealth nations can be ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics are available showing the numbers of emigrants to Commonwealth countries other than Great Britain.  There are very considerable difficulties in the way of obtaining corresponding particulars of emigration to Great Britain on account of the large volume of regular passenger movement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>While it is possible under the Statistics Act, 1926, to make an Order requiring every person entering or leaving the Saorstát to fill up a form or card, or to give replies verbally to a series of questions, it is considered undesirable to require all persons arriving at or leaving the Saorstát to have to submit themselves to statistical interrogation.  Notwithstanding the desirability of having accurate and complete statistics showing the extent and nature of the inward and outward passenger movement, care must be taken not to impose any vexatious or irritating requirements on tourists and other persons visiting the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics have for some years past <Col N="2727" /> been compiled and published regularly in the Statistical Abstract (see 1935 edition, table 23, page 15) from returns showing passenger movements inwards and outwards by sea distinguishing:</P>
    <P>(a) Countries out of Europe and not within the Mediterranean Sea.</P>
    <P>(b) Other countries, excluding Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and</P>
    <P>(c) Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The collection of statistics of the inward and outward movement of the population over the Northern land border, which has been under consideration for some time, presents some difficulty.  Returns are being received each month showing the net inward and outward movement by rail as ascertained from the numbers of passengers purchasing single tickets as distinct from return tickets, but a system for obtaining returns for movements by road has not yet been organised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not a knowledge of the volume of our emigration to Great Britain a matter of vital importance to this country in view of the possible implications of Government policy?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the withdrawal of the bounty it has been extremely difficult to dispose of the moderate-priced thoroughbred stock, and that British purchasers at the Horse Show exhibited no great desire to purchase horses of a medium price, which were largely purchased in previous years, and which, in a great measure, enhanced the reputation of Irish stock, as they often proved in their subsequent careers very successful horses on the racecourses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Northern Ireland horses which were admitted to the Royal Dublin Society's Show by special permit, for exhibited there, and which subsequently came to be sold, had a brisker demand and fetched a higher price than Saorstát Eireann horses which were of superior quality, but which were, for the purposes of export, known to be Saorstát Eireann horses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

As we understand it, the Opposition and the Government Party are prepared to adjourn to-night, and afford the Minister answering for the Government three-quarters of an hour or a full hour if he so desires it in which to reply, it being clearly understood that if at 9.30 other Deputies in the House desire to partake in the debate both the Opposition and the Government are prepared to carry on the debate to-morrow morning, but no member of the Opposition Party will offer himself to speak after 9.30 unless Deputies in other parts of the House desire to do so.</P>

      <P>I am not an expert in the use of the English language, but I thought I was using a word which I myself understood in relation to what I have been listening to here for several days.  However, if it is considered to be a reflection on the Chair I certainly do withdraw it.  I do not know, unless Deputy Dillon enlightens me, how long his party is going to continue to take part in the discussion on the Fifth Stage of <Col N="2732" /> the Land Bill, and, therefore, I do not know at the moment how long has been allotted for the adjournment debate.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon, who appears to be in control of the business of the House, will give us some further information on the matter. Members of this Party do intend to take part in the adjournment debate, and we want the necessary facilities to enable us to do so.</P>

      <P>I quite see that, but I am at one with Deputy Davin in seeking information.  I want to know what is the position of independent Deputies who had no hand, act, or part in making those arrangements. Deputy Dillon graciously concedes us less than an hour, that is to say he gives the President one hour to reply, and in his generosity he may grant us perhaps a half hour.</P>

If the arrangement is that the House is to adjourn at 10.30, it only gives the President an hour in which to reply.  Where do the rest of us come in?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of this Land Bill, Sir, have been exhaustively discussed on the earlier stages.  It, however, enshrines one principle in defence of which, I think, every Deputy of this House should be prepared to record his vote, and in defence of which this House will be divided and an opportunity afforded to those Deputies who believe in fixity of tenure on the land for the farmers of this country of going into the Lobby on its behalf.  I ask Deputies who find it tedious to partake in parliamentary government to learn the lesson that, if they would open their ears and their minds and try to understand what they were doing in this House, instead of trotting like sheep after an oriental shepherd, they might not find the work of parliamentary government as tedious as they do.  On this issue this House has got to make up its mind whether the Land League was right or the Land League was wrong.  Now, the whole of this country, the whole of nationalist Ireland, supported the Land League, and they did so because they believed in the three F's.  There were no mental reservations about that belief, and there was no trotting in silence after a leader of whom they did not know whither he was going. They knew what their leaders were out for.  They understood all the implications of the three F's, and, understanding them, showed themselves to be ready to make any and every sacrifice to preserve those three things, fixity of tenure, freedom of sale, and fair rent, for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2737" /> The Land Bill of 1936 constitutes a demand that that fixity of tenure should be for ever abandoned by what used to be the tenant farmers of Ireland and what are now the tenant purchasers of Ireland.  There may be those who, desiring to rob the farmers of what they so hardly won from the landlords of this country, will try to make the case that Michael Davitt, the father of the Land League, believed in land nationalisation.  There are landlords in this country&mdash;foolish old men who carry in their hearts some of the bitterness of the land war still&mdash;who have never learned that those of us who fought them hardest for the land, value them most highly now that they have become ordinary citizens like the rest of us, claiming no lordship over the land of the people and claiming no lordship over the people themselves, and there will be found in their ranks men who will use the words of Michael Davitt in an attempt to persuade this House that we ought to take from the tenant farmer what the tenant farmer took from the landlord.  We wanted to destroy the security of tenure of any man who claimed to be a lord over the land or a lord over the people's lives, and we wanted to give that fixity of tenure to men who were living on the land, by the land, and for the land. We gave it to them.  Is this Parliament going to take it away?  It is true that, by taking words from some of what Michael Davitt wrote in his earlier years, those words might be twisted to represent the advocacy of land nationalisation.  Those who had the honour, however, to know Davitt, to work with him, and to read what he wrote, know well that when Davitt joined his colleagues in the Land League he did not bring into that great national movement a cranky mind that was sticking to some foible that attracted him in his earlier youth. He carried into it the whole-hearted enthusiasm of a man who was working with his colleagues for a common object, and that object was fixity of tenure for the small farmers of the land, unqualified by a right of the State to take that land from them if and when the State wanted to do so. I ask the House to bear that well in mind, and to remember that there is <Col N="2738" /> no doubt in the mind of any rational man who was brought up in the Land League and who understood that fight and all it meant, that, without mental reservation of any kind, the farmers and their leaders fought for fixity of tenure, and they got it.  I want them to keep it.</P>
    <P>The case has been made on an earlier stage of this Bill that fixity of tenure was taken from the farmers by the Land Act of 1923.  Let us face that question first because it is not true. An attempt has been made to confuse the minds of the people by drawing an analogy between the procedure of resumption and the procedure of compulsory acquisition.  Resumption is a procedure available to the Land Commission in respect of land that has not been vested, and there is no analogy whatever between the procedure that may be adopted by the Land Commission in the interval between the time when a man is pointed out as the ultimate owner of the land and the period when he is actually made owner of the land, and a quite new procedure which gives the Land Commission in perpetuity the right to take from a man the land of which he believed himself to be the owner.  The Land Act of 1923 provided that compulsory acquisition of land vested under the previous Land Acts could be done, provided that land of equal value and equal suitability were given to the man from whom land was compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>Those words &ldquo;equal suitability&rdquo; were interpreted by the courts of this country to mean that where a farmer came into the Land Court and said: &ldquo;I admit that the alternative holding with which it is proposed to provide me is of equal market value, and I admit that the land is quality for quality just as good as the land I am on; but my father was on my farm and my grandfather was on it; we were evicted from it and we got back into it; all our family ties are with that land on which I am living.&rdquo;  If he could satisfy the Land Court that he spoke honestly and truly when he said that, the Land Court was entitled to say: &ldquo;No compensation will compensate this man for being removed from his homestead and put elsewhere; he is entitled to the benefits conferred by <Col N="2739" /> the land legislation of this country, fixity of tenure; no man may move him; no Land Commission may move him; and no Government can move him either.&rdquo;  So long as that was the case, there was effective fixity of tenure in this country and all was well with the tenant purchasers on the land.  The 1933 Land Act swept that away and placed no obligation on the Land Commission which took land off tenant purchasers in this country other than, if he had less than £2,000 worth of land, to offer £2,000 worth of land somewhere else.</P>
    <P>This House is too often prone to confuse the intention of doing something with the power to do it.  I do not make the case that the present Minister for Lands is a diabolical creature who longs for an opportunity of going in and persecuting the tenant farmers of the country; I do not make the case that he has the intention at present of revolutionary movings of the people from one part of the country to another; and I do not aim my remarks primarily against the present occupant of the position of Minister for Lands; but I say that no Minister for Lands, no Land Commission, should have the power, never mind the will or the intention, to take the tenant purchaser off his land and to give it to his neighbour. It is because I do not want that power placed in the hands of the present Minister, or any successor in office, that I object to the Land Bill of 1936.  There are Deputies in this House who forget that the Land Bill of 1936 is not going to be operated by the present Minister for Lands for ever. Some day he is going to have a successor; some day somebody else is going to occupy his place; and I do not want either the present occupant or any successor to have that power over the land of the people.</P>
    <P>The 1933 Land Act gave the tenant purchaser the right to claim £2,000 worth of land in some other part of the country.  I put it to any representative of the County Donegal to-day: If a small farmer, a Donegal man, is going to have his land compulsorily acquired and to be told that he will be given land in exchange for it of equal <Col N="2740" /> market value in South County Carlow, does any rational Donegal Deputy think that that corresponds even remotely to fixity of tenure for the tenant purchasers of this country? What consolation is it to a man to know that if he is prepared to leave his neighbours, to leave the countryside he was born in, the countryside he loves, and go to another part of the country altogether, he can do so if his land is taken from him?  I say that it is nothing.  I say that it is less than nothing, and I say that it is a jibe in that man's face and it operates to put that man in a false position.  He does not want to trail all his personal sentiments, all his family feelings, all the sentiments that all of us know, before the eyes of everybody in the country. He cannot answer the challenge: &ldquo;Are you not being given land of equal value somewhere else?&rdquo; And he cannot get up and say in public: &ldquo;I love the parish where my father was born and the district my mother came from.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is ashamed to say it because he does not want to be dragging his personal relations under the noses of people who have no personal interest in him to be laughed at and to have them canvassed up and down the whole county where he lives.  He is obliged to sulk as the unreasonable person who was not prepared to co-operate with the Land Commission in what they wanted to do for the common good. So I say that this offer contained in the 1933 Land Act, far from being something better than no compensation at all, is worse because it operates to suggest that an evicted man is no victim of injustice, but rather a person who is sulking against a perfectly equitable and reasonable arrangement.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies find it hard to believe that the Government they are supporting could be responsible for a proposal to abolish fixity of tenure.  I ask them to apply a test.  The 1936 Land Bill provides that the Minister may compulsorily acquire land vested under any previous Land Act, the 1923 Act included, but the lands of tenants vested under the 1923 Act may not be compulsorily acquired for seven years after the date of vesting.  I ask Deputies to compare in their minds the position of a vested farmer in the seven years after <Col N="2741" /> the date of vesting with his condition in the years that follow after the seven years have elapsed.  Is there not some difference between his tenure?  For seven years after the land is vested, nobody can touch it.  When those seven years are over, where does he stand? Is there not a difference, and is that difference not the difference between fixity of tenure and being a tenant at will of the Government in office at any given moment?  Let me recall again the words quoted in this House by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney from Arthur Young's &ldquo;Tour in Ireland&rdquo;: &ldquo;Give a man a lease of seven years of a golden garden and he will turn it into a desert; give a man a lease in perpetuity of a desert and he will turn it into a golden garden.&rdquo;  Does not the tenure in land provided by the 1936 Land Bill for the 1923 Land Act tenants amount to a lease for seven years, and a tenancy at will thereafter? Do Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party believe that it is the will of the small farmers that such an arrangement should be made?  I ask the Minister for Lands when answering to compare the position of farmers under the 1923 Land Act with tenant purchasers after the passing of the 1936 Land Bill, and to compare the position during the seven years after vesting with their position in the years that will ensue and to tell the House what is the difference between the two positions in these two relevant periods, and to explain how it is that the difference does not make manifest, that one is a period of absolute security and the other a period little better than tenancy at will.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on another point. An attempt has been made to confuse the mind of the people upon another question, and that is as to what is really meant by tenant purchaser. Let us see if we can get common agreement on this.  A tenant purchaser is a farmer living on his land, by his land, and for his land.  We see perfectly clearly, from our knowledge of the land situation during the last 70 years, that there is not enough land to provide full economic holdings for all the people living on the land, and, therefore, this community is bound to say to those of our citizens <Col N="2742" /> who elect to live on the land, that they must make up their minds to this fact that taking the geographical size of Ireland into account, if a citizen desires to live as a farmer he must understand that he cannot hope to attain as high a standard of living on the farm as if he pursued some other avocation in life, and must be content on a modest holding with the standard of living that such modest holding will provide, and that fixity of tenure cannot be given to individual citizens on anything greater than a holding of moderate size. When it comes to determine what the actual size of the holding will be, it must be a matter of protracted investigation and most careful consideration, because circumstances alter according to the district which one might have under review.  The acreage that will provide a living in Meath will not provide a living in Connemara.  The acreage which would be the minimum necessary to provide a living in Gweedore would be grossly excessive in the Golden Vein, so that to arrive at the exact nature of the holding in which the State will be prepared to give fixity of tenure will have to be a matter of inquiry.  It could be and it ought to be ascertained, if the land of the country and the community are not to suffer gravely from the consequences of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The third and last point upon which it has been sought to create confusion in the public mind is this, that the case is made that the compulsory acquisition of land is a reserved service, that the Minister for Lands has nothing to do with it; that it is purely a matter for the Land Commission.  But the compulsory acquisition of land under the existing Lands Acts, as amended by the Act of 1933 and by this Bill, provide that one of the relative considerations that the Land Commission must take into consideration, when it comes to examine the acquisition of land, is whether it is used in the interests of the public.  It is the Ministry of the day which has to prepare and to certify what in their opinion is the best interest of the <Col N="2743" /> country.  The Minister for Lands speaking recently at Enniscorthy said that if there were many people like Deputy Dillon, who would decline to adopt the agricultural theories of the Fianna Fáil Government they would seriously have to consider what measures would have to be taken against them.  Are we to have a situation in this country that when there is legitimate and bona fide differences on agricultural economics between citizens and the Minister for Lands, as to what is the best thing to do in the interest of the community, that the Minister for Lands for the time being shall be entitled to take a man's land from him, and that in five years time, if that citizen becomes Minister for Lands, and if the then Minister for Lands becomes a tenant, the process can be reversed?  Can the one-time citizen who has become Minister for Lands go to the one-time Minister, who is now a citizen, and take his land from him and put him out on the side of the road?  If that is the theory on which land tenure is to be followed in future there is going to be chaos and pandemonium.</P>
    <P>Remember that chaos and pandemonium do not go on for long.  Something comes out of that situation.  If we get chaos and pandemonium there may come out of it savage reactions to the right, or savage reactions to the left.  Whatever comes, the end will be that tenant purchasers on land at the present time will cease to be tenant purchasers, and will become either the slaves of the dictatorship of the right, or the paid slaves of the dictatorship of the left.  I do not want Collectivism, Sovietism, Fascism or Nazism.  I do not think there are two straws difference between them.  Nazism is Communism turned inside out, and Communism is Nazism turned inside out.  Either may turn their coats to-morrow morning.  I want to see neither system obtaining here.</P>
    <P>I want to see the people who live on the land constituting a bulwark for freedom and democracy, and as owners of the land, having something of their own.  I do not want to see them either <Col N="2744" /> the paid or the salaried servants of any Government in this State.  I do not want to see the Fine Gael farmer ever having the right or the hope of grabbing the land of his Fianna Fáil neighbour, and I do not want to see the Fianna Fáil farmer ever having the hope that he will be able to grab the land of his Fine Gael or Republican neighbour.  I want each member of the community, and the tenant purchasers who are living on the land, and by the land, to feel that for all time, whatever political views they may have, they are fixed securely there, and that they have as much right to their property as a man who holds shares in a bank, or in any other kind of tangible property. This State, in any case, has never yet attempted to challenge that.  The matters I have discussed have induced me to use trenchant language.  Let me here and now disown any intention whatever of implying bad faith to the members of the present Government. I think they may very well be attempting to achieve something of the same kind as we have in mind, but I feel most profoundly that they are walking dangerous paths, paths to which there may be only one end, and that is disaster which, in all human probability, I do not think we want to see coming upon us.  I fully recognise what difficulties lie in the way of a satisfactory and permanent land code in this country.  I fully see the urgent necessity of having machinery for ever there to prevent speculation in land and the appearance in this country of a new tribe of landlords.  Nobody wants that.  Anything that requires to be done will be done with the consent of all to prevent that.  What I am afraid of is that, by acting precipitately and without due reflection on the evils that are long abated in this country, few people in this country with the exception of veterans in the fight, such as Deputy Tom Kelly, or those who were acquainted with the conditions before the land agitation was launched, remember&mdash;that never having seen these evils and never having understood them, they may not realise how these evils could manifest themselves again if mistakes analogous to the rotten land system here before 1881 <Col N="2745" /> were repeated in our generation.  I think that those Deputies of our Party and of the Fianna Fáil Party who understand what immense evils were ended once the idea of fixity of tenure was got into the minds of the people, believe with me that if you destroy, in the minds of the people, that fixity of tenure on which they so greatly depend, the self-same evils may manifest themselves again.  If they once do that, and if the people once learn that a Government in this country could destroy fixity of tenure, that an Oireachtas could be found to wipe out fixity of tenure, you never can give back to the people the same confidence in their title to the land that they had heretofore.  It takes that fixity of tenure and that confidence of title years to produce good effects on the land.  It takes years to improve the land and to build up a national savings bank in the land.  Destroy it and you never can replace it.  Maintain it and let the people understand that all parties in this country, no matter how we may differ on other questions, are agreed on that fundamental&mdash;that those who live on the land, for the land and by the land will be entitled to keep it as their own for all time&mdash;and this country will have a better future.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a long argument about the obligations that title to property carries with it.  That is more a moral than a legislative argument. Every man who believes in Christian morality knows that the blessing of property carries with it grave obligations in justice and in charity.  Legislation in this House is going to make nobody good.  That is a problem for quite another body.  Every man who owns property, whether it be land or anything else, has obligations under the moral law to use it in accordance with the provisions of that law.  That is not our business.  That, in my respectful submission, belongs to another sphere.  I am discussing only fixity of tenure and the right to own land, in so far as it is the function of this House to pass judgement on the matter, and I confidently ask Deputies who understand this question to help us in preserving a thing for the winning of which great sacrifices were made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have not been able, owing to the labours of the Second-Chamber Commission, to take part in, or to be present during, the earlier proceedings on this Bill, I have read the report of these proceedings with some attention.  I think that there is a better case to be made against this Bill than has yet been made in the course of these proceedings.  I think that there is a serious case to be made against any Bill for speeding up the distribution of land so long as the state of things which is described as the &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; continues.  I think that so long as land is artificially depressed in price and so long as farmers are hampered&mdash; and very severely hampered&mdash;by having to use up their capital in payment of rates, annuities and other obligations, it is not fair to them that officials should judge of their capacity as farmers and of their title to continue in their holdings on the basis of what they are able to do, with these handicaps weighing upon them.  As against that, any Deputy who might be disposed to object to any land division Bill during the continuance of the so-called &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; has to ask himself whether, from the point of view of public order and social justice, it is possible to hold up land distribution for a period of years.  On no subject have I personally had a larger mail ever since I came into the Dáil than on this subject and I imagine that the experience of other Deputies is the same.  The number of people clamouring for land all over the country is enormous.  One of the first letters, if not the first, I ever got from a constituent called upon me to go into the Land Commission &ldquo;like an angry lion&rdquo; and hasten the division of a particular piece of property.  I hardly <Col N="2747" /> believe it is feasible to hold up land distribution for a period of years even because of the economic war.</P>
    <P>Leaving that matter aside, I want to turn to the case made against this Bill. I have approached the subject in as impartial a spirit as I possibly could, and I have been perplexed, firstly, by the difficulty of reconciling the utterances of different members of the Opposition in connection with this Bill, and, secondly, by the difficulty of getting a clear idea of the solution advocated by any single member of the Opposition.  The Opposition started badly.  They voted against the Bill before a line of it was available for their information or the information of anybody else.  That, of course, tends to put one on one's guard against the statements that they subsequently made in justification of their action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seems to be living in a dream-world of his own if he imagines that security of tenure, in the sense he conceives of it, is possible. I do not think that it is possible anywhere, and I am sure that it is not possible in a country where we are committed to the principle of the compulsory acquisition of land, for, if we get down to bedrock, the policy of compulsory purchase and the policy of fixity of tenure are in the last analysis, irreconcilable.  There cannot be absolute fixity of tenure where there is a policy of compulsory purchase and where all parties are agreed&mdash;as they have been agreed up to the present&mdash; in advocating the acquisition and distribution of land on a large and increasing scale year by year.  In one of his more lucid moments, Deputy Dillon said that he did not believe there was really very much difference in practice between Parties in this House as to what was wanted.  I do not think there is.  I think that everybody in this House wants as much fixity of tenure as is compatible with the carrying out of the land purchase schemes.  How are you to get that? Let us realise, in the first place, as the late Deputy Hogan realised and stated in this House, that there cannot be absolute ownership of land in the same sense that there is absolute ownership <Col N="2748" /> of a chattel, in the same sense that there is absolute ownership of a watch or of a radio set, or any such object.  I am the son of a landlord, and I was taught, even in my boyhood, by my father that there could not be such a thing as absolute ownership of land in that sense.  The community, as the late Deputy Hogan said, must have in theory the right to see that land is well used.  It is a limited commodity.  It is not a thing that citizens can be allowed to claim absolute ownership of.</P>
    <P>There has always been, so far as we can remember, compulsory purchase of land for some purpose.  Land could be compulsorily taken, for example, for railways, before the Land Purchase Acts were passed at all.</P>

      <P>Certainly, I am not denying that.  Since 1923, since the late Deputy Hogan's Land Bill of 1923, we are committed in the most definite way to large-scale compulsory purchase of land.  The position of Deputy Belton, who opposed that Bill, is, of course, more easily understood and a more logical one than that of anyone who did not oppose it, but it seems to me extremely difficult for those who accepted the policy in that Bill to argue now in favour of fixity of tenure in any such sense as Deputy Dillon apparently understands it. According to him, a man should be absolutely immovable in his land.  He is not even to be subject to the ordinary economic stresses to which other lines of economic activity are subject. If he does so badly on his land that he goes hopelessly into arrear in his annuity, and that he cannot pay off his arrears, Deputy Dillon actually says that what should be done is that the land, although it must indeed be taken from him, should be handed over to some relation whom he designates, thereby obviously opening opportunities of collusion and of deliberate nonpayment on the basis of some arrangement with that relative.</P>

      <P>There has been none cited in the course of these debates.  There has been certainly unsettlement of mind created by inspections. That I admit.  There has been unsettlement of mind created by the fact that the Land Commission have offered less money for a particular piece of property than it is worth. These things seem to be inevitable.  I think, as a matter of fact, that the Land Commission are to blame for offering such low prices as they are in the habit of offering.  I think it is a form of meanness that is against the public interest and the fact that lately on appeal the prices have been immensely increased&mdash;two or three times&mdash;suggests that the Land Commission have been following a wrong policy in these matters.  These things are very annoying.  It is very annoying when a man's farm is inspected that should not be inspected.  It is very annoying when Fianna Fáil clubs or some other organisation send in demands to the Land Commission to interfere with a man in his holding, but I want to know to what extent have actual injustices been perpetrated. They have not been brought to my attention in my own constituency. If they have been brought to the attention of other Deputies in the House, they have not been ventilated in the House.  I think they ought to be.</P>

      <P>If they have been, I have failed to find them in the columns of the Dáil reports.  My belief is that the trouble with regard to fixity of tenure is 90 per cent. mental. The speeches of members of the Government have been partly to blame for it.  The speeches of members of the Opposition have been partly to blame for it.  The activities of Fianna Fáil clubs have been partly to blame for it.  I do not believe that, in actual fact, the Land Commission are committing injustices to any substantial extent.  There may be some injustice in distribution.  It may be that in dividing an estate somebody gets more than he ought and somebody else gets less than he ought but that is another point altogether.  As far as fixity of tenure is concerned, I have had no adequate evidence presented to me that injustice has been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what are the real safeguards at present.  The first safeguard, I think the greatest safeguard, is public opinion.  Public opinion in this country will not stand for wholesale upsetting of fixity of tenure.  The Land Commission would be loathed and the Government of the day would be swept out of office if there was any real interference with practical, as distinct from theoretical, fixity of tenure throughout the country.  People would not bear to see a man who was honestly working his farm to the best of his ability turned out of house and home and his land divided amongst other people.  That could never be popular in this country.  Secondly, there is this £2,000 limit, the necessity for the Government, if they acquire the holding of a man who has not more than £2,000 worth of land, to give him that amount of land somewhere else. Deputy Dillon thinks that that is of absolutely no value.  He says it is of no value because it means that the Land Commission are going to be constantly whisking people away from one end of the country to another.  On the contrary, I think it is of great value to these particular land-holders.  I think the nuisance of finding an alternative holding elsewhere for the man who has to be disturbed is so great that it is a tremendous argument for the <Col N="2751" /> Land Commission not to disturb him if they can possibly avoid it.  I should like Deputies to tell me how many cases they know in which there has been compulsory disturbance of men with £2,000 worth of land or less.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that the &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; safeguard in the 1923 Act was absolutely swept away.  That is not true.  I myself put down an amendment to the section as it originally stood and that amendment was accepted by the Minister for Lands and the Attorney-General, an amendment by which the duty was imposed on the Land Commissioners to consider the suitability of the alternative holding provided as well as its value.  It is true that the word &ldquo;equally&rdquo; was removed.  It is no longer compulsory that the holding should be, in the opinion of the Land Commission, &ldquo;equally suitable&rdquo; but suitable it must be.  Therefore, that safeguard, for what it is worth, has not been completely swept away, as Deputy Dillon suggested.</P>
    <P>The third safeguard is one that I also claim to have provided in the Land Bill of 1933.  I drafted an amendment to the Land Bill of 1933 on the lines of the sub-section actually put into the Bill in the Report Stage by the Minister for Lands.  I think it is sub-section (3) of Section 32. It provided security for the man who is giving adequate employment on the land.  Under that sub-section such a man's land could only be taken for the relief of congestion in his immediate locality and for certain other purposes therein specified, such as playing fields and so on.  I think that in so far as fixity of tenure can be preserved by legislative provision that sort of provision is the best to preserve it, and if we want to strengthen fixity of tenure I suggest that the best way to strengthen it is by strengthening that provision and it can be strengthened. Personally, I should like to see anybody, who is giving an adequate amount of employment on his land&mdash; whether he is a large or small holder&mdash; protected from being deprived of his land for any purpose, to the extent that if he is deprived of it, he must be given, elsewhere an alternative holding <Col N="2752" /> of equivalent value suitable to his needs.  I agree with Deputies Belton and Bennett in not liking this business of a limit at all, neither a money limit nor an acreage limit.  Once again I would like to quote the late Deputy Hogan who said in this House or in the Seanad when the 1923 Land Bill was going through, that if democracy meant anything it meant equality; it meant that, as between owners in fee simple, there should not be a distinction between the large and the small holder but that they should be treated alike on one principle that applies to all of them.</P>
    <P>These are the views that I hold with regard to fixity of tenure and the way in which it is, in fact, defended against attack at the present moment.  Let us try to examine what the alternative methods for defending fixity of tenure are.  I trace them from an examination of the speeches of the opponents of this Bill.  Let us begin with Deputy Dillon.  He wants an acreage limit which is to enable not only the small holder but the middle-sized farmer and the landlords living in their demesnes as he calls them&mdash;though the name seems obsolete now&mdash;to be absolutely immovable provided that they have not got more than a certain amount of land.  What is that certain amount of land to be?  The Deputy gets up to-day and is unable to make a suggestion as to what that certain amount of land should be.  He says the proper amount of land can be ascertained.  How can it be ascertained and on what principles can it be ascertained?  He points out himself that what is adequate to give a man a good living in one part of the country is hopelessly inadequate in another part of the country.  I say that you cannot fix an acreage limit that will be acceptable. If you cannot fix an acreage limit, are you to fix a money limit and if this money limit is to take in the landlords as well as the small-holders it has got to be more than £2,000.  That sort of limit is open to two serious objections.  It is open to the objection that the man who is near the border line knows that if he improves his farm so as to make it worth more than the limit that has been fixed he runs the <Col N="2753" /> risk of being thrown out of his holding. Are the Deputies who are so anxious to see a desert turned into a garden going to explain how a limit of that sort will work?  Will a limit of that sort encourage a man to improve his holding, to work it to the best advantage, to put up the best buildings and introduce the most valuable innovations?  It seems to me that a limit of that sort would put a premium on bad farming.  It is open to the further objection that it is sure to be changed.  It is not being fixed on any intelligible principle, whether it is £2,000, £4,000, £6,000 or £8,000. You may set up that limit to-day but another Dáil may upset it to-morrow and lower the limit.  It does not give the owner any rock on which to anchor himself.  That seems to rule out the limit as to acreage and the limit as to value.</P>
    <P>Deputy Holohan I understood to make another proposal.  I understood the Deputy to take a certain view and I am not sure that Deputy Bennett did not share the view.  That was that the Land Commission should acquire all the land they needed in the open market, that there was an adequate amount of land available and that the Land Commission should touch no other land.  If that were so there was no excuse for the 1923 Land Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is another story, but a very important story, and if the thing is feasible it ought to be proved in this House that it is feasible.  Remarks of the kind I have mentioned have been thrown out by Deputies Holohan and Bennett, but they have not found any support on the Front Opposition Bench.  Therefore I cannot, up to the present, take them seriously, though I quite admit that if they establish a substantial case to consider; it is worth talking about. It would not be on the same plane as the vague language in connection with <Col N="2754" /> fixity of tenure that we have been hearing in this House.  If it is feasible for the Land Commission to get all the land they want in the open market, that is a matter that is well worth going into.</P>
      <P>Should the Land Commission be prevented from giving land to landless men?  Should they be compelled to give the land only to congests?  If there are responsible Deputies who hold that view in this House, they should say so more plainly than they have said it up to the present.  It has always been a principle, and it was the principle laid down by the late Deputy Hogan, that congests should come first, evicted tenants second, and landless men third.  Personally, if it were not for the question of law and order, my feelings would be all in favour of satisfying every congest in the country before I could agree to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, Sir, but in considering the grounds on which this Bill has been debated, it is essential to arrive at some understanding of the principle.

      <P>At bottom we all do want the same thing, and in spite of the surge and thunder of the by-elections and the speeches made in the by-elections, I cannot believe that in the long run the Opposition themselves would wish that the land question should be turned into a Party matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been made of the fact that the 1923 Act tenants are to be put in the same position as purchasers under other Acts as soon as their first seven years have elapsed. There again it seems to me the Opposition are arguing in favour of a sort of class legislation.  Why should there be a distinction between purchasers <Col N="2755" /> under that Act and under other Acts, especially when we have the particular argument in this case of the 1931 Act, for which Deputy Roddy was responsible, that it caused an enormous amount of vesting to be done holusbolus without inquiry into the desirability of each particular instance, or into the question of whether a particular bit of land was or was not needed for the relief of congestion?  The fatal effect of all these proposals to protect one particular class, then another particular class, and then another particular class, is that the more you protect these people the more you leave others naked.  You cannot have equity without equality in this matter. You want some principle that will apply all round, and I know of no respectable principle except the public good.  I know of no respectable principle except that the land should be well used.</P>
    <P>I am an individualist in spite of all I have said, and I do not believe it is a good thing that this Government, or any Government, or any official, should be constantly interfering in the way that a man is working his land.  I believe that in 99 cases out of 100 the man knows best himself.  Nevertheless, you have to have some rock-bottom principle to resort to.  The rights of the State must be founded on something, and the rights of individuals must be founded on something. I maintain they can only be founded on duty&mdash;duty to do the best you can with the land that is in your possession. Deputy Dillon himself admits that in a sense.  He admits it in a most curious way.  He says that a man has a duty to work the land according to his own conscience, and nobody else, apparently, is to be the judge as to whether he is working it according to his own conscience or not.  I am perfectly certain that Lord Clanricarde and every other holder of land in this country who used it badly since the beginning of time, or nearly every one of them, had a perfectly easy conscience all the time.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we can get anywhere on the lines of leaving things to a man's conscience.  It is not practical politics.  If we are going to have compulsory <Col N="2756" /> purchase we have to have some principle to go on.  If we are going to secure fixity of tenure, as we all want to secure it so far as practicable, we must secure it on some principle that will commend itself to the Irish people, that will be obviously just and intelligible, and not on arbitrary clauses protecting one class, then another class, and then another class, leaving a whole lot of people naked to the winds of heaven.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Opposition, I think in particular Deputy Dillon, have been threatening us with civil war and revolution if this Bill goes through.  I wonder if Deputies remember that when the 1923 Land Purchase Bill was introduced the Dáil and the Seanad were threatened with civil war or something like it if it was not expeditiously passed.  I wonder if they remember that it was actually certified, I think by ex-President Cosgrave, as being immediately necessary for the preservation of peace, so that it should go through more quickly than it would normally have gone through.  It must not be forgotten that if land purchase is to be stopped there are dangers to peace that may arise from the fact of having it stopped.  I quite agree that if there was to be wholesale injustice to the holders of land there would be disorder. I do not anticipate that injustice.  I do not think it has taken place during the administration of the present Government. I do not believe it will take place in the future.</P>
    <P>The 1933 Bill was bitterly opposed on Second Reading.  I was one of those who opposed it.  I think that, as originally introduced, it was open to very grave objections which were subsequently removed.  Ex-Senator Brown, for example, said in the Seanad that he did not know of any Bill within his recollection that had been so much improved in the Committee Stage as that Bill had.  We have to remember that the fears which were then entertained that the Government was asserting a supremacy over the Land Commission which no Government had asserted before were dispelled, and amendments were accepted which made the Land Commission independent of the Government in all the <Col N="2757" /> things that really mattered.  Amendments were accepted to prevent the Land Commissioners from being removable at the will of the Government and gave them the status of judges, only removable by resolution of Parliament.  As I have already mentioned, amendments were accepted with a view to guarding fixity of tenure that very greatly improved the Bill.  So far from being indifferent to fixity of tenure, I glory in the fact that I had the responsibility of introducing these particular amendments into the 1933 Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill seems to me to introduce no novel principle.  It seems to me to be a Bill legitimately brought in for removing obstacles to the smooth working of the Land Commission machinery.  While it is only with great reluctance that I support any Land Distribution Bill during the continuance of the economic war, yet I feel myself obliged to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot commenced his speech by stating that he approached this subject in a spirit of deep humility and, after listening to his speech, I can quite understand why he used those words, because it is perfectly clear that he understands very little about the practical working of the Land Acts or about the manner in which these Acts affect the owners of land away down the country.  Before I proceed to deal with Deputy MacDermot's remarks in detail, I should like first of all to correct him about a remark which he made in connection with the Land Act of 1931.  He stated, so far as I understood his remark, that wholesale vesting took place under the Land Act, 1931, without any inquiry or investigation whatsoever.  The actual position was this: provisional vesting did take place, but the Land Commission had a perfect right to make all the inquiries that ordinarily should be made subsequent to the provisional vesting.  The powers of the Land Commission in regard to investigation and inquiry were not interfered with in the least by the passing of that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of compulsory acquisition was known in this country before the passing of the Act of 1923.  It is true that the Act of 1923 did extend that principle considerably, but even though the principle did exist prior to the passing of the Act of 1923 that Act did not interfere in any way with the security of tenure which the tenant-farmers, whose holdings were vested, enjoyed.  Now, it is true that you can always set a theoretical limit to security of tenure.  Deputy MacDermot has surrounded the discussion on this subject of security of tenure with a tremendous lot of theory, and it is some what difficult to understand clearly what he means.  I do not think there is any misunderstanding whatever in the minds of farmers down through the country as to what <Col N="2759" /> security of tenure actually means to them.  They understand it perfectly well.  Deputy MacDermot has tried to explain that the Government have undoubtedly the right to direct farmers in certain respects as to what they should do with their holdings, and as to how they should work them.  The Department of Agriculture intervenes from time to time and insists on certain regulations which it makes being carried into effect.  That is clearly understood, but farmers down through the country are under no misapprehension whatever as to what security of tenure means to them.  The point that Deputy Dillon made was this: that this Bill and the Act of 1933 do definitely interfere with the security of tenure which farmers hitherto enjoyed, and that is a point which Deputy MacDermot did not attempt to deal with.  It is true that the Deputy tried to draw a theoretical distinction between security of tenure and compulsory acquisition.  The distinction was not very clear to me, and I doubt if it was clear to any other member of the House.</P>
      <P>I come back now to the point that I was making at the outset of my speech: Deputy MacDermot's ignorance of the working of the Land Acts. The Deputy asked &ldquo;In how many cases have farmers been turned out of their holdings.&rdquo;  I answer by saying, that farmers have been turned out of their holdings in very many instances. I could quote at least half-a-dozen instances from my own knowledge, and I am quite sure that there are other Deputies in the House, whether they sit on the Opposition Benches or on the Government Benches, who could quote quite a number of similar instances from their own constituencies.</P>

      <P>During the last two or three years, and they are still going on.  If the Minister cares to look up the files in his office he will find the particulars.  I have written at least scores of letters to the Minister's Department protesting against the action of the Land Commission in acquiring certain of these farms. I would draw Deputy MacDermot's attention to this: that while you have undoubtedly in the 1933 Act the £2,000 limit the commissioners in effect ignore that £2,000 limit and proceed to acquire land as if it did not exist.  I have known of at least half a dozen cases in which the owners of the lands were not asked whether they wanted an exchange or not.  The question of an exchange is never mentioned.  Their lands were compulsorily acquired, and the only ground on which they could appeal was on the question of price.  They did appeal in every case, and I think that, in almost every case, they succeeded. That is the procedure that is going on all over the country at the present time.  Surely, Deputy MacDermot does not pretend that he is ignorant of what is happening in this connection.  If the Deputy were in touch with his constituents he would know that it is happening.  He would know that the acquisition of land is proceeding on those lines at the present time.  He should know also that small farmers all over the country have been served with notices to the effect that an inspector will call on them to report on the suitability, or otherwise, of their holdings for acquisition.  These notices were broadcast throughout the State after the passing of the 1933 Act, and they are still hanging over the heads of the unfortunate tenant farmers.  In some cases where notices have been served, the Land Commission have gone a stage further in the acquisition proceedings, and not one word has been said about an exchange of holdings.  It rests with the lay commissioners to say whether or not the lands have been worked in accordance with proper standards of husbandry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, who is to set the proper standard of husbandry?  A small <Col N="2761" /> farmer may have two holdings.  There is one holding on which he resides and another holding which he probably uses for grazing or fattening purposes. The Land Commission may decide that the holding on which he resides is quite sufficient for his purpose, and may say that the other holding is not being worked according to the proper standards of husbandry, and then proceed to acquire it as they have done in two or three instances of which I have personal knowledge myself.  Deputy MacDermot made another point.  He asked this question: how many cases of compulsory disturbance for the purpose of migration have taken place throughout the country?  It is a well-known fact that many farmers throughout the country have been compulsorily migrated.  This is not a new thing.  They were compulsorily migrated under the Act of 1923, and have been compulsorily migrated for very many years past.  Again, I say that shows Deputy MacDermot's ignorance of the actual working of the Land Acts.  Farmers are being compulsorily migrated to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers, as I have said, have been compulsorily migrated for a great many years past.  During the discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill, I asked the Minister if he had taken the trouble to find out what use the new allottees were making of the land distributed amongst them since the passing of the 1933 Act.  Surely, before the Minister proceeds in this Bill to take the extraordinary and additional powers that he proposes to invest the lay commissioners with, he should, first of all, satisfy himself that the land which is being distributed under the 1933 Act is being properly used, and that the right class of people are getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that land is being taken from farmers who ordinarily work their land to the best advantage, men who are a real asset to the country, and that some of it has been given to people who are not making a good use of it, <Col N="2762" /> to people who, under a proper system of investigation, should not get land at all.  Men who were using that land for the purpose of enhancing the wealth of the country and managing it according to the very highest standards of cultivation, have had it taken from them.  Some of it has undoubtedly been distributed to the proper class of people, but other portions of it have been given to people who are not making good use of it.  Some of them are letting it in conacre or on the 11 months' system.  That is happening throughout the country to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not wonder that the Minister and his predecessor in office have boasted over and over again about the rapid rate at which land is being distributed. It was the ambition of the Minister's predecessor to establish a new record in land distribution.  I repeat the statement that I made previously in this House that you cannot proceed with land distribution beyond a certain figure if you are going to ensure that land is to be distributed to the right class of people.  If there is to be a proper distribution of the land of this country, it is the duty of the Land Commission to see that the right class of people are selected for it.  It is a scandal, a disgrace, and an abuse of the authority vested in the Land Commission to take land from a farmer who is making the best use of it, who is working it in the best interests of the country and to give it to people who are not likely to use it either to the advantage of the State or of the country.  But that is the kind of thing that is happening throughout the State.  From my own experience, and from conversations that I have had with Deputies sitting on the Opposition Benches and on the Fianna Fáil Benches, I know that the class of people to whom I have referred are getting land all over the country, and I submit to the House that that is a scandal, a disgrace and an abuse which the Minister should see is remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill I invited the Minister to make a statement as to the nature of the problem of congestion which he has got to deal with.  On several occasions, in the <Col N="2763" /> course of the discussions on this Bill, the Minister has stated that he wants the additional powers set out in this measure in order to enable the Land Commission to proceed more rapidly with the acquisition of land and to remove administrative difficulties.  If the Minister wants these additional powers, then I think the House is entitled to have a statement from him as to the extent of this problem of congestion which he has got to deal with.  The Minister has in hands some hundreds of thousands of acres at the present time which are in various stages of acquisition.  In the normal course of events it would take probably ten years or longer to distribute the whole of this land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with some hundreds of thousands of acres which it would take at least ten years to distribute.  If that is so, why does he want all those additional powers?  If he wants those additional powers he should give the country clearly to understand why he requires them and the extent of the problem with which he has to deal.  The measure of the land problem was taken by one of the Minister's predecessors in office.  Since Fianna Fáil became the Government they have not attempted to measure the problem or to give the people in the country to understand the nature and extent of it, according to their standards of measure.  The Minister may proceed to acquire land and he may even take in later legislation newer and more extraordinary powers for the purpose of enabling him to proceed even at a greater rate with the acquisition of land, but when he has all the available land acquired, what impression will he have made on the problem, and to what extent will he be able to deal with it?  If he is able to <Col N="2764" /> make only a faint impression and to touch the mere fringe of the problem, why should he proceed in this fashion to upset security of tenure and make every farmer feel he is in the position that he does not know when his turn will come?  Is it not due to the farmers that the Minister should make some statement so that they will be able to glean some impression as to the extent to which the Minister may proceed in his policy of land acquisition?</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over the points made during the Second Reading debate or on the Committee Stage, when a very lengthy and exhaustive discussion took place; but I invite the Minister to give the people some indication of his intentions in regard to land legislation, to give them some indication of the problem which confronts him, so that they may be able to appreciate his motives in introducing legislation of this kind.  A statement of that type may have the effect of allaying to some extent the feeling of insecurity which he has engendered by the 1933 Act and which is intensified by this Bill, which aims at removing the last vestige of security which the tenant farmers enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my surprise that Deputy Roddy, who is, I suppose, one of the experts among the Party opposite on this question of land legislation, had no more effective answer to the speech of Deputy MacDermot than that to which we have just listened.  He made an appeal to the Minister to make some statement as regards policy in order to allay the feeling of insecurity and the fears engendered by the 1933 Act and this Bill.  I imagine that it would have been much more important that Deputy Roddy should make an appeal, even a belated one, to Deputy Dillon to do something to allay the feeling of insecurity which he has attempted to arouse by the speeches which he delivered during the recent by-elections, and which I understand he repeated in the House to-day.  I did not hear the whole of his speech and, like Deputy MacDermot, I was unable to be present at the discussions on the earlier stages of this Bill, but I did read what he said throughout the <Col N="2765" /> country in connection with this Land Bill.  It was apparently considered a strong point in his Party's programme to make an attack on it as undermining the security of tenure of the farmers.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot very modestly, in his opening speech said that he was not familiar with the intricate provisions of the land laws of this country; he said that he was not an expert and he offered his views with some diffidence.  He asked to be corrected on the interpretation which he placed on this Bill and on the 1933 Act and in that connection he had no answer from Deputy Roddy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy has not questioned Deputy MacDermot's explanations of the principles underlying the 1933 Act and this Bill.  Deputy Dillon left the House before Deputy MacDermot had concluded his speech.  I must say that I do not think there could be a more effective or deadly answer to the rubbish we have been listening to from Deputy Dillon than the speech delivered by Deputy MacDermot. He took an active part in the discussions on the 1933 Act.  I was in the House with the present Minister and on that occasion the Deputy adopted precisely the same attitude that he has adopted here to-day.  A good deal of what he said to-day, he said on the 1933 Act.  He particularly stressed the necessity for taking this land purchase business out of the realm of Party politics. He pointed out that he was quite certain&mdash;he repeated it here to-day and with absolute accuracy&mdash;that, taking the House all round, there is probably complete agreement as to the fundamental principles which should guide the Land Commission in the acquisition of land for distribution in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to go over his arguments, but I will say this, that I agree with practically every single word he said, both as regards his attitude towards land legislation and his explanation of the effect of the 1933 Act and the likely effects of this Bill.  He wound up by pointing out that this Bill merely rounds off the 1933 Act and it gets rid of some obstacles which the Land Commission found in their way when carrying <Col N="2766" /> through the policy in the 1933 Act, and some obstacles embodied in the 1923 Act.  It is unnecessary for me to point to the various decisions as regards land policy embodied in the 1923 Act and express my agreement with Deputy MacDermot that this Bill is an attempt to do equity amongst the holders of land and put all on an equal basis.  We had wild talk from Deputy Dillon throughout the country to the effect that something radical and revolutionary is being attempted.  The Deputy does not seem to understand the meaning of the terms he uses.  He talked about tenant purchasers and, to a man like Deputy Roddy or anyone who is acquainted with land legislation, it must have been laughable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use the words &ldquo;tenant purchasers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy heard Deputy Dillon's attempt to define &ldquo;tenant purchasers.&rdquo;  I am sure if he did he would have to laugh at it. A number of other persons in whom land has been vested under the Land Act were not tenant purchasers at all. They were a number of persons who were in possession and ownership of land&mdash;even landlords&mdash;and they became beneficiaries under the Land Act and had the benefit of conditions enabling advances to be made to them for the purpose of acquiring their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot pointed out that under the 1933 Act an inroad was made on the law as it stood at that time; that the Land Commission were given power in certain circumstances to acquire land which had been vested under earlier Acts, and that what was intended to be done under the 1933 Act was to extend that provision to purchase under the 1923 Act, but owing to difficulties having been experienced it is not clear that the intention in the 1933 Act&mdash;and which everybody in the House understood was there&mdash;was effectively embodied in the Act.  This particular Bill is merely an extension of the principle which the late Deputy Hogan embodied in his 1923 Act, and I do think it is very unreasonable and unfair for a responsible Deputy of the <Col N="2767" /> Opposition Party to go about the country attempting to shake the confidence of the people, and to do the very thing which he protests that he wishes to avoid, that is, to weaken the feeling of security which the persons who purchased land under the Land Acts did feel, and in practice have obtained.  Deputy MacDermot, with deadly force, asked why this discussion should have taken place through four stages, and no list, no names, no particulars to justify the wild charges that have been made by Deputy Dillon and others have been produced here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy apparently thinks that already security of tenure has gone. He proceeded to go into the history of the activities of the Land Commission under the 1933 Act.  I am not going to accuse Deputy Roddy of drawing on his imagination.  I am quite satisfied that, when he stated in this House that he has come across half a dozen cases in which he felt that hardship was imposed on certain persons by reason of the fact that the Land Commission acquired their land, he quite honestly believed that to be the case. But in the last analysis the Land Commission must be trusted in this matter, and has been trusted for years with regard to the exercise of powers which were similar to a large extent.  I might differ with a particular inspector; I might have my own view as to whether it was proper that a certain man's land should be acquired, or whether it was probable that the persons that were to get it on distribution would make better use of it than he did.  But one must only trust the judgment of the officers who, as Deputy MacDermot pointed out, are in an independent position, and who are entrusted with this very onerous and very difficult work.  They may make mistakes; they are only human.  I can quite conceive that in certain cases mistakes have been made, but mistakes, when they are made, are made along the lines of the policy laid down in this House time and time again, and enshrined in those Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has pointed out the various safeguards in the 1933 Act. I remember that when it was going through this House here, a Bill never <Col N="2768" /> had a smoother passage.  At that time there was no by-election in the offing; there was no excited atmosphere.  A lot of members on the Opposition Benches&mdash;including Deputy MacDermot &mdash;and ourselves combined to insert in that Act such safeguards as we thought were practicable, and, as he said, compatible with the achievement of land purchase, and in the public interest. There was general agreement that those provisions which he referred to to-day did so far as it was practicable&mdash;keeping in mind the already accepted policy with regard to land purchase, the already enacted provisions of the 1923 Act&mdash;achieve that object.  We did achieve more or less unanimity on the terms which were to be embodied in the 1933 Act.  We did, at that time in any case, keep the business of land purchase out of Party politics, and I think, if I recollect aright, all the parties who took part in the discussion thanked the Minister and myself for the attitude which we had adopted throughout the whole discussion.  Now, we have it suggested that the 1933 Act and this Bill are really the forerunners of what one might style Bolshevist legislation. Deputy Dillon, if he knows anything about the Land Acts, if he has taken care to study them, if he has watched their actual operation, must know that that is an absolutely outrageous mis-statement.  He must know that we feel, just as much as he does or just as much as Deputy MacDermot does, how essential it is that those farmers who work their land and are making the best use of it should feel security in possession, and that such interests as banks and others should realise that if they want to make advances to them on the security of their lands that security is there as a backing for any advance they make. I think it is the very worst form of pretended friendship for the small farmer in this country that anybody can indulge in to suggest in the wild way in which it has been suggested that this Bill undermines his security.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon flung down a challenge to the Minister that if he discussed this Bill here in the House he would prove to demonstration that it conferred greater power on the Land Commission than ever Clanricarde <Col N="2769" /> possessed.  I do not know if he repeated that challenge here in the House.  I understand he did not; he did not even carry out his threat or his promise.  I do suggest that you cannot compare the powers of a body like the Land Commission, charged with the more equitable distribution of land among the people of this country, with the powers of the landlord who only utilised his powers of taking up holdings in order to widen his ranches, and for the purpose of depriving people of land and owning it for his own selfish interests.  It is childish nonsense to compare the powers of the Land Commission in connection with land which must be distributed amongst the people with the powers of the old landlord. I am sure it hardly impressed any of the electors to whom it was addressed in County Galway.  I myself imagine that instead of its being, as Deputy Dillon thought it was, a bull point in his Party's programme, it was a very dud shell, and in fact had quite the opposite effect to that which he intended it to have.</P>

      <P>It is a certain amount of satisfaction to those of us who foresaw for 12 or 14 years the danger of attacking the fixed principle with regard to land tenure, to find all Parties in this House now trying in varying degrees to subscribe to the principle of fixity of tenure.  No purpose will be served by going back to the 1923 Land Act or to the time when that was a Bill, but I have a distinct recollection of upwards of 1,000 delegates of the unpurchased tenants meeting in the Mansion House 13 years ago, and one of their protests was against the section of the Bill which attacked fixity of tenure.  I have not seen dealt with by the Minister or by the Opposition in this whole controversy here on this Bill, or for that matter on the 1933 Bill when it was before the House, what is going to be the end or what is the goal of land distribution. Where is it going to stop? Is it the idea of the Land Commission, or is it the policy of the Government or of any Party in this House, to divide the land, and when you have gone over dividing it, break it up into still smaller fragments&mdash;when you have gone <Col N="2770" /> over it and have the farms reduced to a certain size, that you pass over it again?  Is it the intention of the Government that reasonably good holdings should be there&mdash;that they should be economic holdings?  If it is, then that policy is not being carried out.  What is the use of calling holdings of ten and 15 and 20 acres economic holdings?</P>

      <P>The thing I have been looking for in the whole debate&mdash;and I have been watching it very carefully from both sides&mdash;is to try to get a policy; but I see no policy.  The nearest approach was a vague statement on a very vague and contentious matter&mdash;the proper use of the land, and that nobody, no matter what powers were taken, who was properly using his land would be interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2771" /> It is a pity that the definition of a policy was not further defined, and, of necessity, defined as to what the proper use of land is.  Does the Minister suggest that wheat ranching is a better use of land than cattle ranching? We have wheat ranching to-day. Would be accept this as a principle of the proper use of land&mdash;and I challenge him to refute it when he gets up to reply&mdash;that any man who is growing corn and has more than two acres of corn for every acre of manure land is not properly using his land? I challenge the Minister to refute that on sound principles of agriculture. Wheat ranching is robbing the land, and I am quite sure, from the mentality disclosed by the Minister here, that a farmer who robs the land by wheat ranching is, in the opinion of the Minister, using the land according to the best principles of husbandry. According to my opinion, however, that man is as much a robber and a plunderer of property as the man who goes into a bank, holds up the bank manager at the point of a gun, and takes money.  That, however, is the kind of wild mentality disclosed by the Minister and the Government in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree generally with all that has been said about the value of fixity of tenure.  I agree with Deputy MacDermot in his analysis and castigation of the principle of fixing the size of farms according to the acreage for valuation, as advocated by Deputy Dillon.  The machinery of government is so intricate, particularly the machinery of taxation, that if sound principles of agriculture were being carried out here, we might not trouble about the size of a holding, because the larger the holding the dearer it was on the individual who held it. Taxation works so, with large owners of property, that a point is reached&mdash; and you have not very far to go until you reach it&mdash;in land-owning in this country at the present time, when it does not pay a man to own any more land.  Those circumstances will automatically regulate the size of a holding. Now, what objection is there to buying land when it comes into the market?  Generally speaking, land <Col N="2772" /> comes into the market when the farmer or the landowner fails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or when he dies, and when nobody survives him who wants to work the land.  However, is not the type of farmer who has failed on the land the type to eliminate?  In this Bill the Land Commission is taking power to charge to the local authorities the arrears which accumulated while that man was failing and which that man should have discharged, or which the farm he held should have discharged.  Are not these people the weeds among the farmers, and should not every opportunity be availed of to get rid of the weeds?  There is no doubt but there is a cloud of fear over fairly-sized farmers in this country at the present time, and the value of land has gone down.  Even in this Bill, land, the purchase price of which has been over £3,000, will not get the advantage of the halved annuities except for that portion that exceeds £3,000.  That relates to certain types of farms&mdash;I think ordinary agricultural farms.  In the case of stud farms, £5,000 is the limit on the purchase price, beyond which the annuity will not be halved. Well, I am not the owner of either of these classes of farms, or farms of that size, but the Minister should bear in mind that farms of that size used, as they ought to be, according to the proper principle of husbandry, ought to be encouraged under a proper agricultural policy.  As I have said before here, and the Minister should get it into his head, the running of farms in any country properly governed is in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, if he puts over a proper agricultural policy on the country, and he should put it over in such a way as would pay the farmer to carry on a certain type of farming, and that type of farming should be, in the opinion of the Government of the day, the best type of farming in the national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister for Agriculture who does not set out to achieve that does not know his business and the success of any Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2773" /> who sets out to achieve that depends on his success in achieving that ideal.  It is not an agricultural policy to say to a man &ldquo;If you do not work your land in this way, you will lose it.&rdquo;  You should not have to say that.  Your policy should be such that the farmer will see it himself.</P>

      <P>The one safeguard for fixity of tenure which has been put forward is the use of land in the national interest.  I want to show that the use of land in the national interest is not a matter for any farmer, but for the Government of the day.  I do not see why there should be a limit to any holding if agriculture is administered on the lines I suggest and on the lines which are most successful in every country. No man could farm 1,000 acres without employing a large amount of agricultural labour and the more agricultural labour he employs the surer it is that he will have to pay a decent wage.  If he fails in that, he has to get out or he sells.  The Land Commission can come in and buy out the man who fails.  I see no half-way house or no intermediate landing stage between allowing a man to own all the land he can buy and work, and division and sub-division and sub-division again until we are all down to four or five acres.  Anybody who has studied agricultural economics at all knows that there is nothing as bad for agriculture as all small holdings and that there is nothing as dangerous to the national economy of a country and the stability of a country as uniformity in one main industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to this Bill is that it is an extension of a bad principle. Fixity of tenure is gone long ago <Col N="2774" /> and the only fixity of tenure we have now is fixity of tenure provided we use the land in the best national interests.  Again, I ask the Minister to refute, if he can, the point I make as to whether working the land in the manner I have indicated is not in the best national interest.  I would go a long way to agree with him if fixity of tenure was assured to people who would work their land in the best national interest, provided they did not rob the land, and that year after year they were accumulating fertility in the land, or, at worst, maintaining the same standard of fertility which it had a year before.  That, however, is a theoretical position.  If the Minister could define how that theoretical position could be maintained in practice, and, as fixity of tenure in the ordinary sense is gone, if it could be re-established on the basis that every farmer who works his land within wide limits of an agricultural policy, the main feature of which from the national standpoint would be that the fertility of the land is maintained, if not improved, is protected by law, in present circumstances I would accept that as a good enough fixity of tenure.</P>
    <P>Long before to-day, I believed that it is a national obligation on the national authority to prevent any individual or number of individuals from impoverishing the land year after year. I cannot develop that on the Final Stage of the Bill because it is more a matter of agricultural policy than land policy, but I always thought it was a disaster to have separated them, especially now when land acquisition has become such a problem, and when more and more it is dawning on those responsible for the acquisition and sub-division of land that there is need for some anchorage.  They are drifting out to sea and do not know where they are going to land.  They want some anchorage and the Minister is hanging on to the anchorage of using the land in the national interest.  That shows that the Minister has found it necessary to have some anchorage.  If fixity of tenure on any size of holding were assured, provided that the land was worked in the national interest, <Col N="2775" /> and if the ordinary methods of farming were good enough, provided there was no robbery of the fertility, I would vote for this Bill because it is the nearest practical approach to fixity of tenure we can get now.  As it is, I see that the Minister is aiming for that, and that must be so.  We know that there are many farms in this country which are not worth £2,000 to-day, but which would be worth £4,000 or £6,000 if agriculture were normal. The man who wants to cling on to his farm will lose it if agricultural conditions improve because the value of his land will go up.  Agricultural conditions can hardly decline any further and land is at the lowest ebb as regards price.  I suppose that for the last 40 or 50 years it was not so cheap as it is now.  I want the Minister to define more clearly what the use of land in the national interest is, and particularly I want him to attack the statement I have made and on which I would go so far as to dogmatise. This is an old country.  The land has been tilled for centuries.  It has been burned and brought back to fertility again.  It was in a good state of fertility a few year ago.  I go as far as to say that no land can be farmed to produce grain crops, unless the ratio of manure is that for every two acres of grain there must be one acre of manured land in that season.  Old meadows would require top dressing. If that is not done the land is not worked in the national interest because it is losing its fertility year after year, and the country is being impoverished. If the Minister's definition of &ldquo;work in the national interest&rdquo; is somewhat akin to that with assured fixity of tenure or approximates to that ideal in agriculture, I will support the Bill.</P>

      <P>As the details of the Bill have been discussed at length, I do not intend to delay the House.  I should like, however, to refer to the speeches of Deputy MacDermot and the Attorney-General.  If there were any doubts in my mind about fixity of tenure being endangered by this amending Bill, and by the Land Act of 1933, they were enhanced by these speeches.  Deputy MacDermot was at <Col N="2776" /> great pains to keep away as far as possible from the Bill.  He did not pretend to know what was in the Bill, but said that the Land Commission would not be unjust to anyone.  The Attorney-General proceeded on the same lines when he said that we must trust the officials to administer it properly; that they were not going to do anything unjust, but he admitted, as Deputy MacDermot did, that that possibility was there.  They did not say that the Bill did not give power to the Land Commission to be active in the taking of land, or that there was not power to take purchased land, but that they were satisfied it would not be done.  That is what I object to in this Bill.  It was what I objected to in the Land Act of 1933 that the powers were given, whether they were to be exercised or not.  If they were not meant to be exercised they should not be given.  I do not intend to say a hard word against the Land Commission. The Land Commission is like any other body of officials who are there to operate Acts passed by this House.  It is their duty to operate them, just as the Revenue authorities exercise the powers given them by this House.  The Revenue Commissioners may seem hard at times, but as they are only doing their duty I do not blame them.  Similarly I do not blame the Land Commission if they operate Acts under powers given them by this House.  But I blame this House if it gives power to the Land Commission to operate this Bill in a manner that might be unjust to farmers.  Every Deputy who has any right to speak for farmers should object to this Bill if it contains such powers.  The Attorney-General referred to the question of security, and I hope the Minister in charge will also do so.  He said that the banks, in view of the speeches of Deputy Dillon and other Deputies, had been induced to refrain from lending money, because there was a danger to the title of land when there was no such danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the borrowing powers of farmers had been reduced by the Land Act of 1933 and by this amending Bill. I say so still.  If the Attorney-General can assure banks and lending bodies that any money they lend on land is <Col N="2777" /> secure and that the borrowers will not be disturbed in possession that will go a great length to satisfy me that the Government are not going to operate the powers contained in the Bill.  Is the Minister going to give the assurance that the Attorney-General hinted at, that where advances are made the land will not be taken from farmers, and that their title in it is secure? Possibly the Minister will argue, as Deputy MacDermot argued, that there never was any fear of farmers being dispossessed, and that men with land worth less than £2,000 would not be disturbed.  All the Minister need say is that the owner is not working his land to the best advantage and this provision lapses.  Who is to be the judge as to whether or not a man is working his land to the best advantage? The proof in the case of a farm as in a business lies in the success that is attained, and in the manner in which it is worked.  The measure of success or failure is proved by the way a man fulfils his obligation in the running of the farm, the rearing and the education of a family, the amount of his savings or debts.  Undoubtedly the man who misuses land must fail.</P>
    <P>Only two classes of people can hold land if they farm improperly, the wealthy man who keeps a bit of land as a hobby, or some wealthy lunatic who has money enough to spend on land of which he makes no use.  Any other type of farmer must of necessity work his land to the best advantage, if he is going to continue in occupation for any length of time. If any Minister or anyone else could come along to interfere with that man's economy it would possibly make his position worse than it was. This Bill, whatever anyone else thinks, is, in my opinion, a guillotine held over the heads of the farmers, creating in their minds the fear that any moment the button may be pressed and the knife dropped.  Such a fear is harmful to agriculture generally, and will destroy any initiative or anxiety amongst farmers to improve land.  It will undoubtedly create a slump in the value of land, and will lessen its worth from the borrowing point of view.  If the Minister could give an assurance that <Col N="2778" /> none of these things could happen perhaps we might not offer opposition to this Bill or to the Land Act of 1933.  Until the Minister can say, somewhat on the same lines as the Attorney-General, that any bank that lends farmers money on the security of their land can feel satisfied, and that it has his assurance that people to whom money is lent will not be disturbed, then there is no security in land in this State.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately a couple of by-elections broke out when this Land Bill came before the Dáil and it was discussed by members of the Opposition, not on the merits, but from the point of view of the political capital they could make out of it&mdash; how far they could by means of criticism scare a number of voters into voting for them.  The members of the Opposition have long since dropped any hope of inducing people to vote for them on their merits and they are relying on threats and scares and prophecies of evil.  The principal prophet of evil in the Fine Gael Party is Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon informed the House and informed me that he was not accusing me or the Government of bad faith.  That does not tally with what he has been saying down the country for the past three or four weeks.  He has been going down to Galway and Wexford picturing me as a sort of ogre who was entering into a conspiracy to throw all the farmers of the country on the road and take over their land.  He said in Galway that I took powers in this Bill that Lord Clanricarde never sought. Here, to-day, although he disclaimed any imputation of bad faith, he got up and said that the question was whether the Land Leaguers were right or whether the Land Leaguers were wrong, trying, thereby, to convey to the people that he stood for the rights for which the Land Leaguers stood and that we stood against those rights. He went on to say that the Bill would rob the farmers.  Deputy Dillon was the protector of the farmers and we were the robbers of the farmers! He said that the Bill would destroy the fixity of tenure for which the Land Leaguers had fought and which they obtained.  For what did the Land <Col N="2779" /> Leaguers fight?  They fought to destroy the fixity of tenure which the landlords claimed.  They sought to destroy the fixity of tenure and the rights claimed by 4,000 persons over the lives of the people of the country. They were successful in destroying that fixity of tenure.  I have stated, and I repeat that what we tried in 1933 to do and what we are trying in this Bill to do, is to destroy the fixity of tenure of the ranchers&mdash;people who make the same claim as the old landlords made, that they have the right to do what they like with their own. That principle cannot be defended on its merits by anybody.</P>

      <P>I maintain that that is so and I warn Deputy Dillon that, if he continues on the lines on which he is going, he will be a member of no national party, and that he will be repudiated in regard to his land policy by the members of his own Party just <Col N="2780" /> as he has been repudiated in his Commonwealth policy in Galway by Professor Hogan.  I warn Deputy Dillon that, if he continues on those lines, he will get no backing in the country, that he will never be leader of any Party and that he will not be for long vice-leader of the Party to which he at present belongs.  For six or 12 months Fine Gael have been more busy repudiating Deputy Dillon than they have been in attacking us and they will have that job in front of them for some time longer.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan part company on the principle to which the Deputy has referred.  Deputy O'Sullivan, speaking on the Committee Stage of this Bill, enunciated principles in regard to the tenure of land with which I agree.  Speaking on the 28th July he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless a very great social evil is proved, unless something threatening the whole welfare of the nation is shown to exist, there ought to be some security for the ordinary farmers as regards the holding of land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also said on the same occasion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I can imagine, in a time of great crisis, political and social developments of such a character as might justify serious interference with property, even property of this kind, but it cannot be alleged that such a crisis exists.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and I agree on the principles as to the tenure of land. Mentally, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon have parted company long ago on that question.  I warn Deputy Dillon that he will part company physically with his Party if he does not change his tune.  A couple more by-elections or general elections will make him advance much farther towards our policy than he has advanced up to the present.  He has repudiated himself in the country with regard to the growing of wheat and beet.  He has, by his amendment, repudiated himself in regard to the land question, and he will repudiate himself still further before he is much older, if I am not greatly mistaken.  It is really <Col N="2781" /> stupid to search for too much simplicity in regard to life.  Life is a complex matter and, when Deputy Dillon gets more intelligence in regard to it, he will find that he cannot enunciate principles that govern human action in a very simple fashion.  It is impossible to do that because the matter is too complex.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot alluded to subsection (3) of Section 32 of the Act of 1933.  There it is pointed out that if a man is producing an adequate amount of agricultural produce and is providing an adequate amount of employment, the Land Commission cannot remove him for any reason other than the relief of congestion in the immediate locality.  If they remove him they must give him an alternative holding of £2,000 market value.</P>

      <P>One of the things we did in that section of the 1933 Act was to establish more firmly a number of men who were rendered insecure in their title by the 1923 Act.  Congestion in certain parts of this country is the greatest social evil that has to be dealt with.  In the 1923 Act, the late Mr. Hogan attempted to get land for the relief of congestion, and he took power to migrate even purchased tenants.  Section 24 of the 1923 Act gives the lie to the allegations that Deputy Dillon has been making throughout the country.  In Section 24 of the Act of 1923, the Act which was <Col N="2782" /> passed by the late Mr. Hogan, power was taken compulsorily to acquire the holdings of tenants who had been purchased and to migrate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suppressing it. I can only answer one point at a time. That power was given to the Land Commission and, in order to operate it, these tenants had to give back all their land if the Land Commission wanted them to do it.  The Land Commission did not desire to be moving purchased tenants around unnecessarily and we took power in the 1933 Act to take off a tenant his surplus land, the land surplus to £2,000 worth and to leave him in his own district with £2,000 worth.  That is a point with which Deputy MacDermot would not agree but Deputy Dillon if he were treating this matter on its merits would agree with it.  The 1933 Act had the effect of leaving a man more secure in his own district than he was left under the 1923 Act.  Another point about the 1923 Act is this.  Deputy Dillon said that the farmers of this country had fought for fixity of tenure and that they got it. Deputy Roddy, when Deputy Dillon was out, said that we had power over hundreds of thousands of acres of land and asked why we sought further powers.  He alluded to the fact that in the 1923 Land Act there were powers for the compulsory acquisition and resumption of land.  The 1923 Act gave the Land Commission power to take every sod of land, even off a small farmer&mdash;a man who had four, five, ten or 20 acres of land&mdash;if his land was to be purchased under that Act.  The Land Commission had power to resume <Col N="2783" /> it without any obligation to give him an alternative holding even of equal suitability.</P>

Instead of leaving the tenant in that insecure position, without any right even to retain a sod of his own soil, we vested the land in him and gave him this security: that if ever the Land Commission touched him again they would have to give him an alternative holding of a market value of £2,000.</P>

Another feature about the 1923 Act was that whereas it gave the Land Commission complete and absolute power over the lands of a man who had only four, five, ten, 20 or 30 acres&mdash;gave them power to resume such lands&mdash;it left them without power to interfere with ranches that had been purchased under the previous Acts.  We remedied that position under the 1933 Act or at least we thought we did.  The courts' decision reversed what we thought was the situation.  We are merely confirming in 1936 what we attempted to do in 1933.  That is, that where a man is a rancher or sets himself up as a new landlord &mdash;not working his land, but just hiring it out to other people&mdash;we are taking power to take over that man's land instead of being compelled to use the powers in the 1923 Act to take over the land of small farmers when land is needed for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments Deputy Dillon is very fond of using is that we want to encourage the people of the country to envy their neighbours and give them the power to grab, as he calls it, their neighbour's land.  What is the traditional meaning attached to &ldquo;land-grabber&rdquo;? The worst of Deputy Dillon is that he was trained up to sit, act and <Col N="2785" /> talk in another assembly, and he has been forced to come in here instead. &ldquo;Land-grabber&rdquo; meant that the landlord encouraged some envious person to take over the land of a good farmer when the landlord wanted to kick that farmer out.  The land grabbers throughout the country were taken on by the landlords to consolidate the small holdings from which people had been driven.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but to inhabit the evicted tenant's holding, and we put the grabber out of every such holding in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only did the grabber take over one evicted tenant's holding but he took over several of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And we put them all out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Dillon got his political education down in Galway, he would have secured the rancher in the grabbed holdings.  The Deputy probably came across one or two cases down there in which at present there is a land grabber in control of several farms from which the tenants were evicted and under Deputy Dillon's dictum we dare not touch such a man. But Deputy Dillon, with the political education he has got in the last few weeks, has come to the point that he will only give security below £2,000 worth, market value, of land.  Above that £2,000 worth he is prepared to take over the land compulsorily.  These are his views here, but I do not know what he will say when he goes down the country again.  He put in an amendment to that effect, the limitation of acreage or value, and, therefore, he has, to a certain extent, committed himself to that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I would not put it down because I do not stand for that principle.  I stand for what is written into the 1923 Land Act, and I stand for what is written into this Bill. Whenever there is a social evil arising out of the use of land, I maintain that <Col N="2786" /> the people have a right to interfere in order to destroy that social evil.  In that I am sure I am supported by everybody who ever taught or wrote about the rights of public property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote for Deputy Dillon a document I have here.  I do so because I wish to refer him to that document which was written by His Holiness the Pope.  In that document His Holiness uses these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However, when civil authority adjusts the ownership to meet the needs of the public good, it acts not as the enemy but as the friend of private owners; for thus it effectively prevents the possession of private property, intended by nature's Author in His wisdom for the sustaining of human life, from creating intolerable burdens, and so rush to its own destruction.  It does not, therefore, abolish, but protects private ownership; and far from weakening the right of private property, it gives it new strength.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again in another passage His Holiness says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It follows from the twofold character of ownership which We have termed individual and social, that men must take into account in this matter, not only their own advantage, but also the common good. To define in detail these duties, when the need occurs and when the natural law does not do so, is the function of Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried in the Land Act of 1933 to help to put private property in a secure position here in this country. I refer, of course, to private property in land.  The worst defender of any cause is the man who takes up an absolutely impossible position.  The worst defender of security of tenure in the land of Ireland is the man who takes up a position that can never be admitted&mdash;for there is no moral justification for the principle that a man's land is his own to do what he likes with it.  That was the principle that the land leaguers destroyed in this country.  The reverse is a principle which I hope will always remain <Col N="2787" /> in this country.  Deputy Dillon speaks of our policy bringing about a state of chaos and pandemonium that would either lead to savage reaction to the right or savage reaction to the left. You have here in this country, and particularly in the West of Ireland, tens of thousands of small holders living on uneconomic holdings.  At the same time there exists a small number of large land-holders with over £100 to £200 poor law valuation, there exists a certain volume of unemployment in the country.  There are 30,000 people added to the population of this country every year.  If we cannot get a livelihood for them here, they must emigrate or they must disappear in some way or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister describe a farmer with a valuation of £100 as a rancher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some farmers with a £5 valuation who are ranchers, and there are farmers with £300 to £500 valuation who are working their land properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These £5 men will have the land taken off them if they continue to work the land as they are doing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I say this much: if a man works his land and the Land Commission are satisfied that in the working of his land he is producing an adequate amount of agricultural produce and is providing an adequate amount of employment, they cannot put him out except for the relief of congestion in the immediate locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And if they are not satisfied, be he big or small, off he goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not satisfied, if he is not living on the holding, if he is setting that land, not working it in the national interests, they can take it.  Deputy Dillon can go down to Wexford and make what he likes of that.  Deputy Belton alluded to wheat ranching, and asked me to define what was working land in the national interests, and so on.  In Section 32 of <Col N="2788" /> the 1933 Act we gave a definition of that, and I cannot do any better than that.  I no more look upon wheat ranching as the proper use of land than I look upon cattle ranching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What has Deputy Gibbons to think of that, I wonder?  The Minister says that if Deputy Gibbons puts all his land in wheat, he is a rancher and off he goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon need not think that he is at some corner down in Wexford where we will not hear of it.  I said no such thing.  I said if a man was a wheat rancher&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The unfortunate thing about Deputy Dillon is that most people do not know as much about him as we do, and seeing that he is the son of his father, think he should know something of what he is talking about, particularly about land.  We have to educate them into the fact that all he is concerned with is how much political propaganda he can make out of any issue and not about getting at the truth of the matter.  When it is all boiled down this present Land Bill of 1936 is largely intended to dot the i's and cross the t's of what was attempted to be done in 1933.  The extensions of these powers are by way of giving increased facilities to a certain class of tenants who were outside land purchase.  Perhaps the biggest number of these cases are the tenants created since 1923.  No matter how high the <Col N="2789" /> rent was which they undertook to pay back in those days they had no way of getting their land purchased.  We have taken powers in this Bill to fix a fair rent in regard to these lands and give the tenants the right to purchase, so that their annual payment instead of being a rent for ever will help to make them owners of the land.  Several other sections will make it easier for people who have long leases of land or fee farm grantees to come within the provisions of land purchase.  Apart from the provisions making it easier for people to purchase land, the other sections of the Bill are, as I say, largely designed to make the law what we intended it to be in 1933.</P>
      <P>The Land Act of 1933 was in operation for two or three years before the courts stopped the Land Commission's activities under the sections of that Bill which were most criticised at the time and have been most criticised since.  Deputy Roddy and others, who were trying to create a scare about the operation of the 1933 Act and about this Bill, were challenged several times to mention any case where an injustice was done.  I agree with Deputy MacDermot in one thing, particularly, and that is, that public opinion will always govern the land laws of this country in regard to land.  Even if public opinion does not happen to be written into the land laws, it will be the effective law.  If the law does less than public opinion wants to do, public opinion will soon secure that the law will be changed and enlarged.  If the law does more than public opinion wants to be done, the people will prevent any Government or any Department from carrying out an unpopular law, a law that is altogether against the interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that in the present Bill and in the 1933 Act what we have done is, written in effective legal language, the opinion of 99.9 per cent. of the people of the country.  They want to see as large a number of people as possible established on the land. They want to see land purchase completed. They do not want to see a number of people crowded into slum holdings, either in the West or in the East, while the best lands in this country are given over to ranching.  The <Col N="2790" /> late Deputy Hogan started out to complete land purchase and to acquire land for the relief of congestion.  He went as far as he could in those days. He left some things undone, which I think should have been done, and which we are doing now.  As I say, I think that the Bill, as it stands, represents the opinion of 99.9 per cent. of the people of the country and, when their opinion changes in regard to the land laws, the land laws will be changed also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister when he was speaking if he would be good enough to compare the tenure of the 1923 tenants under the 1936 Land Bill, during the first seven years after vesting, with the period that will ensue thereon.  There is a difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A tenant purchaser under the 1923 Act will be in the same position seven years after vesting as any other tenant in the country.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister, having answered two questions which I did not ask him, will now answer the question which I did put to him. It was this: What is the position of a 1923 purchaser under the 1936 Land Act in the first seven years of his tenancy, as compared with his position in the years that will ensue thereon?  There is a difference, is there not?</P>

      <P>I doubt if the House, within the last couple of years, has ever been asked to adjourn in a period of greater uncertainty.  The adjournment will be for the space of some months, months that in many ways, as we are led to believe, may be decisive for the future of this country. There is uncertainty in practically every sphere affecting the lives of citizens; uncertainty as to the future national status of the country; uncertainty as to the economic prospect that faces the country and, if possible, more uncertainty than usual on the fate of the principal industry of the country. It seems to have been the deliberate policy of the Government for a number of years to foster such uncertainty.  I will admit that before they came into <Col N="2793" /> office, and also during their tenure of office, as a political Party they have battened to a certain extent on it.  It seems to have been their policy to do nothing to allay but to do everything to increase that uncertainty.  It is an uncertainty that is extremely unhealthy.</P>
      <P>If you turn your attention to the economic war, if you read the statements recently made by the Vice-President and by his nominal chief, who really is the one man in the Government so far as these things are concerned, namely, the President, can anyone tell the policy of the Government? I know the Vice-President on all occasions, especially for the last couple of years, has encouraged the idea that there is going to be a settlement.  On the other hand, except the facts have become definitely established, and the people can physically, so to say, see the negotiations going on, the President denies the existence of any negotiations. What is the present position so far as that most important of all problems for this country is concerned? Members of the Government challenge other Parties on their policy, but they are the Government and they refuse to give any indication of their policy in any of the vital issues that confront the country.  You cannot judge what their policy is either from their statements or from their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vice-President, as usual, hints, almost states, that we are on the eve of a most magnificent settlement.  We have had that type of statement for nearly four years.  That statement is immediately blown upon by the President, who, at the most, asks the people to be satisfied with a vague promise that he will make a good settlement. When?  Surely the time has come, now that this war has been on four years, to let the people know on what lines he intends to settle, to let the people know what are the obstacles that prevent him from settling, why it is that he is apparently unable to meet the desires, not merely of the country but of people high placed in his own Party, for a settlement. I am there assuming that the statements of the Vice-President, if they do not represent fact, at least <Col N="2794" /> represent good will on his part on this question of a settlement.</P>
    <P>Turn to their agricultural policy and you have the same uncertainty. What is the attitude of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;I mean the present Minister for Agriculture and, perhaps, even still more correctly I could say the Government, speaking through the Minister&mdash;what is their policy as regards the cattle industry?  At one period we were told they stood for an increase in the number of cattle and, a short time afterwards, we were told that that was the wrong policy, that we must have less cattle.  Now, we have a statement from the Minister boasting that he is exporting more cattle than ever.  What is the policy? Is it not the deliberate tactics of the Government to play fast and loose, not merely with the resources, the prosperity and the safety of the country, but with the credulity of the country? Again and again with cynical indifference, with cynical contempt, they have dangled the carrots before the Irish people.  That is the way the Government Party at least look at it&mdash; dangling a carrot; that is the way they regard the Irish people.  We have promise after promise in all these major issues, but no effort to fulfil them.  All this policy is supposed to be subordinate to their great policy of establishing the national status, but can anybody tell what their policy even in that connection is?  What do they want for this country and how are they going to achieve it?</P>
    <P>I admit that the present Government can go to limits which we would hardly expect even from them.  I think it was last week-end I saw in the papers that the Minister for Finance challenged the republicans as to what they wanted. Did they want a republic for the twenty-six counties?  Was their policy a republic for the thirty-two counties, and if so how were they going to achieve it?  Were they going to make war on Ulster in order to achieve it?  From his military knowledge, he demonstrated the futility of a policy of that kind.  Remember, this is a question being put by the body which claims to be the Government, by a Minister of the Government, an important member of what claims to be the <Col N="2795" /> largest Party in this State, to what they regard as an unimportant faction. Those are the very questions which have been put up to themselves again and again and which they have always refused to answer.  A couple of days after the Minister for Finance flung that challenge to the republicans of Wexford, a question was put to the President in this House about what his policy was as regards the status of this country in the future, and the only answer which could be got from him was &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;  Yet, the Minister for Finance could challenge the republicans to answer those questions which he himself and his chief refused to answer.  There is deliberate uncertainty. There is refusal to let the people of Ireland, whom they pretend to serve, into whatever secrets they have-if they have any-about the future status of this country.</P>
    <P>What is to be our attitude towards the Commonwealth?  They have been asked that question again and again. They have been asked it by the members of this Party, and by other members of this House who do not belong to this Party.  The same question in a different form, approached from a different angle if you like, has been put to them by the Republicans. They refuse to answer.  Their policy is: &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;  They can challenge the unimportant faction which has the impertinence to oppose them in Wexford, namely the Republican Party, as to what the Republican answer is to those questions.  But they themselves, even though they are the Government, even though it is their business, before it is anybody's business, to formulate a policy, have refused to formulate a policy.  No matter where you turn, in all the principal items of policy you have nothing but uncertainty.  If the question is plainly put to them whether they intend to avail of the advantages that ought to be got from membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations no answer can be got.  The Republicans can get no answer; Fine Gael can get no answer, and of course they would not think of answering the Labour Party.  They know there is no necessity to do that. The most they would get from the <Col N="2796" /> Labour Party is a friendly warning, as Deputy Davin on one occasion gave them.</P>
    <P>But have they a policy?  If they have a policy, do they think it in keeping with their new professions of democracy that they should conceal that policy longer than is necessary from the people of this country?  We all read, with a certain amount of satisfaction from one point of view, a statement made by the President of the Executive Council some days ago in Galway.  May I say straight away that I regard that statement, the mere issuing of that statement, the sentiments conveyed and the principles laid down in it, as important, and it was well that these principles have been laid down.  I think that the State&mdash;perhaps even the Party in the long run-has reason to congratulate itself that at last that statement was made.  I do not criticise it on the grounds that it could have been put together, every single sentence of it, by the use of the scissors and the paste, from the speeches made by the members who now sit on this side of the House when they were members of the Government.  I do not think there is a single paragraph, a single sentence, in that statement of the President that could not have been taken, word for word, from the statements and from the enunciations of policy of their predecessors in office.  I hope that the fact that that statement is made, not so much by the President of the Executive Council as by the head of the Fianna Fáil Party, even in the year 1936, is for the advantage of the country.  But if I look upon that statement as an important statement, and if I welcome it as an advance, surely it is all the greater criticism on that Party and on the leader of that Party that we had to wait until 1936 for this excellent enunciation of those excellent principles.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with what I consider an important contribution to the political life of this country.  I cannot misinterpret the Deputy in the rather ludicrous fashion in which the Minister for <Col N="2797" /> Finance misunderstood his interruption yesterday evening, but I cannot take his interruptions too seriously. It is important that that statement should have been made, but I repeat that I know no more severe criticism of that Party, and of the head of that Party, and of his leadership in politics in this country, than we are able to greet the statement as an important contribution, that we have to wait until the year 1936 for that particular enunciation of principles. I am taking it at its face value.  The testing time will come for that Party and for the man who made that enunciation of principle&mdash; not when he himself has the majority, but when other people have the majority.  Let us hope that he will then have the same reverence for those principles which he has for them now that he has the majority and now that he is head of the Government. If we could be sure of that, there would be a tremendous advance made in the political life of this country.  But I am just a bit uneasy, and for this reason: I remember in a debate in this House, when he was President, the same leader stated from the Front Bench opposite that he was in favour of and stood by the principles of democracy and majority rule.  That was a statement which I was remarkably glad to hear on that occasion, but it made me very uneasy when he followed up that statement with the further statement that he had always stood for that principle of majority rule.  Well, if he is going to honour those principles enunciated two days ago in the same way as he had frequently honoured majority rule, then the statement has not the full value that I should like it to have.  Still, taking the statement as it is, it is now laid down&mdash; and I attach the greater importance to it precisely owing to the extraordinary history of that particular Party in this matter&mdash;that resistance by force of arms to the lawfully established Government here has no justification.  In the matter of inflammatory speeches, in the matter of carelessness of words which may mislead the youth, the enunciation that no body of men have a right to <Col N="2798" /> use force against the lawfully established Government of this country we have a statement of sound principle, and the fact that that statement comes from a Party that for so long had scant respect for these principles makes it all the more important. &ldquo;The sad thing,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;about the present position is that people who may be regarded as responsible and who are old enough to have experience and sense come out on public platforms and, in the most irresponsible manner, use language the effect of which must be to incite young people to a course of action that could have no other end but that of bloodshed and anarchy&rdquo;&mdash;a perfectly sound piece of advice, and all the more telling, coming from the quarter from which it comes; all the more telling and valuable when we remember the number of times we had cause to complain that, however logically certain language might be explained away, the effect on the young could have been only one thing, and that is the actual thing that had occurred&mdash;bloodshed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, as I say, a position of uncertainty. There is one&mdash;just one&mdash; slight solace in the mass of uncertainty that the country is facing at the present moment, and that is the uncertainty that the Government itself is facing.  From the point of view of the country that is, if I might quote from a statesman whom the Government seems now to honour by copying the author of &ldquo;Wait and See&rdquo;&mdash;the one bright spot&mdash;the uncertainty as I say&mdash; the more than uncertainty, if that is a permissible expression&mdash;of the Government position itself.  There is uncertainty created everywhere.  There is uncertainty in business as a result of this continuous interference; an interference that has grown by leaps and bounds; that has increased, so to speak, with compound interest since the Government came into office.  So far as the business of this country is concerned, whether it be agriculture, horse-breeding, manufacture, salesmanship, and so on, the one idea of the Government is that they are not doing their duty unless they interfere. The very challenge they sometimes issue to their opponents&mdash;&ldquo;What did <Col N="2799" /> you do for so-and-so when you were in power?&rdquo;&mdash;betrays their type of mind. They cannot let things alone.  They think they are neglecting their duty if they are not interfering.  We see that everywhere.</P>
    <P>This afternoon we were dealing with the Fifth Stage of a Bill, and, with all respect, despite the different statements I have heard, that Bill does create uncertainty so far as land tenure is concerned.  Not merely does that Bill do it, but the statement made by the present Minister for Lands increases that uncertainty.  I ask the members of the House, when the country sees certain powers taken by the Land Commission, powers which undoubtedly, whatever may be said about it, do interfere and do trench upon fixity of tenure in a way that has not been done before, or, to avoid controversy, to a greater extent than has been done before&mdash;when they see that and connect that up with statements made again and again, not on one occasion merely, not in a mere burst of eloquence such as one might expect from the Minister for Finance, but apparently a deliberate statement made time and again by the Minister for Lands, the man who is responsible for lands at the present moment, about taking land from the people if they do not work it properly&mdash;how can there be anything except growing uncertainty in the minds of the ordinary farmers of this country in that respect? They say they need these powers in order to deal with some abuses that they say are present, but what they do not realise is that they are undermining a principle that is more important than the remedies that they themselves are suggesting.  That is a thing they never can grasp either here or in anything else.  In order to have an immediate gain, or, if you like to put it from their point of view, in order to remedy an evil that is obvious for the moment, they will undermine a principle the undermining of which will mean a tremendous amount of damage and loss to this country in the long run.  That is what they are doing as regards the land.</P>
    <P>It is not a question as to how much has been done up to the present.  It is <Col N="2800" /> the question that, as a result of what is now being done and as a result of the statements made by the Ministers of the Government, you have, naturally, a fear as to where it is going to stop.  Even a Deputy this evening who defended that policy said that there was no other question on which he got so many letters from his constituency. What does that prove?  It proves the very danger of opening the gate. Everybody who is familiar with life in this country knows perfectly well that it is the very land scarcity and the very land hunger evidenced by these letters, to which a reference was made even by a Deputy defending the Bill, that in itself is a proof of the danger of interfering with the principle at all.  Once start interfering with that principle and you cannot stop.</P>

      <P>They interfered under the 1923 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not. Excuse me, Deputy.  The 1923 Land Purchase Act did what all other Land Purchase Acts attempted to do, and it had the purpose of definitely saying that when a man had his land vested he was secured in the ownership of that land.  The Land Purchase Acts were the culminating point of a long attempt to settle the land question in this country, and the basis of the settlement&mdash;the fundamental principle of the settlement&mdash;was that once land was vested the farmer was the owner of that land and he could not be disturbed. The principle was not disturbed in 1923&mdash;the principle that once the land was vested the farmer was the owner of the land and could not be disturbed.  The 1923 Act had the same fundamental principle as all the other Land Acts, and it is a great mistake to hint, as was partly hinted this evening, that even landlords recognise that there is no absolute right in property. To equate the system of landlordism in this country, which was inherently vicious, and proved itself in practice to be particularly vicious, with ownership by farmers is completely unsound.  When such a comparison is even hinted at, no wonder the farmers grow uneasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2801" /> As I say, we have this interference everywhere.  I understand that there is a little controversy going on at the present moment between the Labour Party and the Government.  It generally occurs only at by-elections, so possibly we need not attribute too much importance to it.  We, on this side of the House, have often had to call attention to one particular fact, and that is that no matter what the intentions of the Government were, no matter what the individual views of the members of the Government were, the policy that they were adopting was, or at least &mdash;shall I put it more accurately&mdash;portions of their policy were, if not leading to Communism, at least making smooth the way to Communism.</P>
    <P>I think that is clear.  It has always been clear to me, especially so far as their policy in the opening years is concerned. Their statements are a little more careful now; I am not aware, however, that their action so far as land is concerned has improved.  But we were always scoffed at by the President when we pointed out that danger. I think the scoffing was joined in by the Labour Party even.</P>

      <P>I might as well, because the Labour Party never does.  We now have a member of the Government and the leader of the Labour Party at loggerheads as to which of them is the Communist.  The Attorney-General warns Deputy Norton, and I presume he knew why he thought it necessary to issue a warning. We must assume that the Attorney-General of the Government so loyally supported by the Labour Party, with which the Labour Party has been in such close touch for a number of years, knew what he was talking about. He warns the Labour Party of the dangers of Communism and of the path they are treading towards the united front.  What is the challenge thrown out by the leader of the Labour Party who ought to be in a position to know since he has been in close touch with the Government Party for a number of years, giving them advice and friendly warnings occasionally?  What is his answer?  That he knows as a fact that <Col N="2802" /> members of that Party have trucked with the Communist Parties in other countries.</P>

      <P>All those years with that knowledge in their possession they supported that Party.  It is a pretty controversy.  Let them decide it between them.  The Attorney-General has his opportunity this evening and Deputy Norton has his of meeting the Attorney-General here where they can have it out between them. We are waiting to know whether they will avail of that opportunity.  There is plenty of time for that to be decided by the two Deputies who can make the charges facing each other.  On the economic war all the country is asked to do is to solace itself with the prophecy that there is going to be a good bargain.  Are you making it?  &ldquo;No!&rdquo; When are you making it?  &ldquo;Wait and see!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are going to have a Constitution. Is it going to be Republican? &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;  Is it going to be within the Dominions?  &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;  Every other Party must have definitely made up its mind, but the only Party that refuses to give any information to the country is the Government Party.  The Vice-President is here.  In the goodness of his heart, having the welfare of the country at heart, he was apparently misled into a statement that we were on the eve of a good bargain&mdash;negotiations were going on and should not be interfered with.  I have excused that statement on his part, because I recognise that he realised that such a bargain is necessary to the country.  I think the Vice-President, although he occasionally waves the Republican as distinct from the Dominion tricolour&mdash;and it is not easy always to know which particular <Col N="2804" /> one he is waving&mdash;does recognise that a settlement is necessary.  Any statements he has ever made seem to show that, and any statements he has ever been asked to explain away seem to show that.  He is in charge of the House this evening.  Are we to take his view that we are on the eve of that settlement, and that steps will be taken to lead to that good settlement immediately, and is the President completely ignorant of what is going on?  Those are questions on which he ought to enlighten the mind of the country.  After all there are few things in which the country is more interested.  I firmly believe that the bulk of the people at the moment are much more interested in this than they are in the Constitution-mongering with which the Minister's Party are trying to befool the country.  But not even in the Constitution situation will they give any lead or will they tell the country what their policy is.  Is that sound?  Is it wise at a time of unrest in the country, unrest with which they themselves have had to deal, to keep the country in that position?  There was a statement made yesterday by the Minister for Education, acting for the moment as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  &ldquo;Public psychology,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the most important element in insurance.&rdquo;  Deputy Flinn finds it apparently difficult to understand it, but I can assure Deputy Flinn that that is the statement.  I agree with it.  Confidence, that feeling of confidence which the people ought to have, is of great value.  Can anybody say that the Government is promoting that feeling of confidence in any important sphere of public life in this country at present?  Is it not doing the very opposite?  Here are a few of the main questions the country is faced with; and only a few.  I mention them merely because I think they are indicative of the policy of the Government in every sphere.  I ask members of all Parties to consider, not what I have said, but to consider these questions, because they are the questions in which I believe the people are interested and about which the people ought to know the mind of the Government.  After all this is the place to find out the views of the Government on any of these <Col N="2805" /> important matters, but in all of them we have failed up to the present to find out what their views are&mdash;if they have any views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with a certain amount of concern, and I am sure other <Col N="2806" /> Deputies are in the same position, the recent rather hysterical speeches made by the President, and by some of the Ministers, in connection with matters on which I would like to have more information, and which, I think, are pertinent to the discussion on the Motion for the Adjournment.  We all read with a great deal of regret the sensational speech, or as it was described to me by some Fianna Fáil supporters, the Hamar Greenwood speech, made by the Minister for Finance in Balbriggan during the course of the recent City and County Dublin municipal elections. The part of that speech that I want to refer to is a statement that I think was never previously made by any Minister in any Government in this or any other country, in which he dealt with the pending trial of a prisoner, then in the hands of the Government, and prejudged, apparently correctly, the decision of the Military Tribunal concerning that prisoner.  We also had threatening speeches made by the President.  The people were threatened with a general election if they did not maintain for him the clear majority in this House which he held up to recently, but which he lost as a result of the resignation of one Deputy in his Party.  In some of the speeches made by the President he referred to the Constitution which he said would be produced to this House during the autumn session, and submitted to the people at the next general election.  In the course of another speech concerning the Constitution the President said it was likely to be referred to the people by way of referendum.  I am just mentioning these two rather conflicting statements of the President, for the purpose of ascertaining from whoever replies, what the present policy of the Government is in connection with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Government made up its mind to restore the referendum machinery in the Constitution?  We all remember that on one occasion, shortly after the Fianna Fáil Party entered this House, they rightly endeavoured to make use of the referendum machinery then in existence for the purpose of ascertaining the views of the <Col N="2807" /> electorate upon an important question. The then Government Party, now the Opposition, took the necessary steps at that time to remove the referendum machinery from the Constitution, and we had very strong protests from Deputy de Valera, as he then was, and a very definite assurance, on many occasions, that if he was in office the referendum machinery would be restored to the Constitution.  I want to know quite definitely whether it is the intention of the Government to refer the Constitution, when it passes through this House in the autumn, or during some coming Session, to refer it to the people by way of referendum, or whether it is the intention to mix up such an important question with many others that have to be referred to the people during a general election. Although my colleagues may not agree with me, I think one of the greatest blunders that was made was that the Treaty was not referred at a particular period to the people, and their wishes on it taken.  I dare say that if the Treaty had been referred to the people at the time, we would have avoided the consequences of the terrible civil war that followed. At the time the majority of the members of the Dáil decided to accept the Treaty.  I am very definitely in favour of referring all major political matters, and particularly a matter which only arises once in a generation, to the people, to enable them to say yes or no on big political issues of that kind.  I wonder do the President and his colleagues think it is necessary that the Fianna Fáil Party, as a Party, should maintain a clear majority over all other Parties in the House, in order to complete their political and economic programmes.</P>
    <P>As far as I could read from recent speeches of some of our new political leaders, there is very little difference between them.  If one takes up the speeches of Professor Hogan in Galway and the speeches of Fianna Fáil speakers, or of the Minister for Local Government, there is very little, if any, difference between the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil Parties on some big political issues that are now being discussed.  From statements <Col N="2808" /> made yesterday by Professor Hogan&mdash; made I am sure with the authority of his leader, Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;he welcomes the coming together of the two main Parties.  May I express the hope, which I am sure is the hope of a big section of the electorate, that that very desirable coalition will take place in the near future.  There are many things in common between those who sit on the Government and on the Opposition Benches.  Many things promised the people by both Parties were never fulfilled.  The old Sinn Féin Party of which all front bench Deputies on both sides were members promised town tenants when we got freedom that they would get everything they were looking for.  Deputy Cosgrave was head of the Government for ten years, and during his term of office nothing was done for the town tenants.  When in opposition, members of the present Government promised to do for town tenants what Deputy Cosgrave was not then willing to do.  We had a remarkable statement from the Minister for Finance some time ago, definitely stating that it was not the intention of the Government, during its term of office, to bring in any measure making provision for the purchase of their houses by town tenants, and a majority vote to back that was secured at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  There are many other matters, affecting the well-being of sections of the people, on which both Parties could agree, and the sooner they come together and do many of the things they promised in the past the better it will be for the electors as a whole.  Personally, I welcome some of the statements made recently by some of our new political leaders, and I hope it is an indication of a change for the better on the part of those who have been pretending to speak&mdash;Deputy Dillon for instance&mdash;for the Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>Before the Government took office they promised that they had a very definite plan which they were prepared to put into operation for the purpose of solving the unemployment problem. I want to know from whatever Minister replies on behalf of the Government, if they are satisfied that they have made any progress along the <Col N="2809" /> lines which they said they had for solving this problem before they took office.  On March 24th of this year there were 140,000 persons registered at the local labour exchanges.  Speaking at Enniscorthy the other day the Minister for Agriculture said that the Government had done its best to try to find employment for the people who were willing to work.  He went on and made the remarkable statement that while waiting for employment they saw to it, to use his own words, that anybody who could not find employment was not left in want.  I wonder was the Minister for Agriculture conscious of some of the things that he voted for in this House during the last three or four months.  He voted for a period Order, made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce some months ago, and as a result of that Order coming into operation no less than 72,000 persons were removed from the list of those entitled to maintenance under the Unemployment Assistance Act. On May 25th the number on the register, as the result of the operation of the First Period Order, was 109,000, and on August 4th that number was reduced to 69,000.  I want to know from the Minister, or from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who was once described in this House as the Minister for Unemployment, whether the 72,000 persons who have been removed off the register as a result of the two Period Orders, have found useful work, and if so, for how long?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in defending the bringing into operation of the two Period Orders definitely expressed the opinion here that all those who were being struck off the maintenance list were in a position to secure work, and he indicated that £2,500,000 had been set aside to provide work for some or for all of those struck off the register.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how much of the £2,500,000 has been allocated to the various local authorities, or to different Departments of State, for the purpose of providing work, and how many people are actually at work as a result of the spending of that money?</P>
    <P>I want to see how many of the 72,000 <Col N="2810" /> persons struck off the register are actually working at present as a result of the provision of £2,500,000 this year for the relief of unemployment.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give us figures which will enable us to arrive at a fair conclusion as to the merits of this important matter.  Apart altogether from the suffering and want which exist, notwithstanding the statement of the Minister for Agriculture, there is considerable criticism and complaint in connection with the miserably mean way in which the Unemployment Assistance Act is being administered so far as those now entitled to receive unemployment assistance are concerned. The means test, which has been applied very rigidly, has made it utterly impossible for many able-bodied men with dependants to secure the necessaries of life with the small amounts they are granted under the terms of the Act.  The evidence is there for anybody who wants it.  The various boards of health are compelled to supplement the miserable sums provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act for many of the 69,000 who are still on the register and entitled to assistance.  The President, in making his policy-statement in this House shortly after he took office, promised that he would either provide work for the unemployed or provide them with a decent standard of maintenance.  Is it suggested that, even now, with the amount paid to those still in receipt of unemployment assistance, it is possible for an able-bodied married man to maintain himself and his dependents in decency and comfort?  If so, why should it be necessary, as it is necessary, for these people to fall back on the local authorities and the ratepayers in order to have supplemented the miserable sums paid under the Act? If there was any meaning to be taken from the pledge given, it was that those for whom it was not possible to find work would be maintained by the State and the taxpayers and not by the local authorities and the ratepayers. They were to be maintained in a decent standard of comfort while waiting for work to come along.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister for <Col N="2811" /> Agriculture write to the secretary of the Wexford Board of Health or somebody else in authority and find out whether the statement he made in Enniscorthy on Sunday night week&mdash; that they saw nobody left in want&mdash;is accurate?  The minister does not appear to know the facts in regard to his own constituency.  Innumerable cases have been brought to my notice where people were struck off the register and told to travel three or five miles and perform a type of work to which they had not been accustomed.</P>
      <P>I have sent these cases to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  On appeal, some of these cases were allowed by the officers appointed by the Minister.  But, while these complaints were being investigated and while appeals were pending, the people concerned in Wexford and elsewhere were in want.  The statement made by the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that they saw nobody in want&mdash;would not be made by any Minister or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party or any member of the House who had knowledge of existing conditions.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to most of the discussion on the Land Bill, which passed its final stage to-day.  I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Land Bill.  I supported it in silence with greater enthusiasm than those who supported it by speech.  I heard the Minister for Lands repeatedly make the statement that it was the intention of the Government to give land to those able to work it and to take it from those who refused to work it. Does the President or the Minister for Agriculture know the reason&mdash;I think the Minister for Agriculture knows&mdash; why many large and small farmers are unable to work their land to the best possible advantage even in their own personal interest, apart from the national interest?</P>

Deputy Belton ought to know that as well as anybody else.  Deputy Belton knew when he was representing a rural part of the country something about the condition of the farmers, but since he came to represent the North City of Dublin he has got a purely city outlook, and I do not think that he is competent to talk in the same manner about the present condition of the farmers. I admit that Deputy Belton is a good working farmer and a good employer, but he has absorbed the city outlook since the north city adopted him as one of its representatives.</P>

      <P>The present Government is responsible for the setting up of a Banking Commission.  That Commission consists of a pretty large army of bankers and was set up about two years ago.  I wonder could we get anything from the Vice-President, or some of his colleagues as to the present position in regard to that particular Commission? Have they so far submitted an interim report?  If so, will we be furnished with particulars as to the nature of the recommendations made by the Commission?  When is the report of the Banking Commission, interim or final, likely to be published? Whether this country is associated with the Commonwealth, or is an independent Republic in future, it is not going to help the farmers of the country one iota to work their land more profitably or to get better credit facilities for the working of the land.  The future prosperity of the farmers, the workers, and <Col N="2813" /> indeed the whole of our people, is bound up with the future of the banking system and the extent to which this Government or any future Government will provide better facilities for the farmers of the country to work their land to better advantage.  Does the Government believe that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for instance, serves that particular purpose or that the granting of loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation on an annuity basis at the rate of 5 or 6 per cent. interest is a proper way to meet the reasonable needs of the farmers of this country in regard to applications for loans?  The Government is able to borrow, and has borrowed money from the people at the rate of 3½ per cent., and a State institution like the Agricultural Credit Corporation insists on getting 6 per cent. from some of the same people, on money borrowed for agricultural purposes on an annuity basis.  I think some profit must be made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in carrying on operations under these particular conditions.  I notice the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is smiling.  I know he is an expert in finance and an expert on other matters such as income-tax. I should like to know whether he is of opinion that the Agricultural Credit Corporation meets the reasonable needs of the farming community, or whether the farming community are being provided with loans under reasonable conditions by that particular body as at present constituted.</P>

      <P>The same thing applies to the Industrial Credit Company, which is responsible to some extent for financing some of our industrial concerns. I should like to see these two bodies, as at present constituted, scrapped.  That is the reason that I am asking for some information in regard to the report of the Banking Commission.  I am wondering whether the Banking Commission, referred to by some people as the Bankers' Commission, have made any recommendations in connection with the existing constitution of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company.  I have had cases brought to my notice where the Industrial Credit Company refused to underwrite shares for purely Irish companies that were established under the auspices of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Norton asked a question about four months ago in the Dáil as to whether a certain firm had complied with the conditions laid down under the Control of Manufactures Act before the Minister sanctioned the issue of a licence to that particular firm.  Deputy Norton was told quite definitely, after putting several supplementary questions, that the firm had not complied with the conditions of the Control of Manufactures Act, that, in other words, it was given a special licence.  That particular firm composed of a number of foreigners&mdash;and by foreigners I do not mean Englishmen&mdash;got a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. They applied to the Industrial Credit Company to underwrite their share and the Industrial Credit Company agreed to do so.  Later on an Irish firm, whose board consisted of a number of well-known Irishmen, applied to the same concern to underwrite their shares in the same way and they were turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the point that there is something radically wrong with that concern, which has some responsibility to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2815" /> and the Minister for Finance for its administration.  I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance have the right to nominate some of the members of the Industrial Credit Company.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce issued a licence for the establishment of a certain Irish industry, the board of which consisted altogether of Irishmen. The representatives of the Minister on the Industrial Credit Company, which is a semi-State concern supposed to be set up for financing our new industrial concerns, refuses to underwrite the shares in the case of the Irish concern and actually agrees to underwrite the shares of the foreign firm that came in here under a special licence.  There is, I submit, something radically wrong in the constitution or control of the Industrial Credit Company when a thing like that can happen, and I should like to see it reorganised or scrapped altogether.  If we are going to have Irish industry and have it financed by Irish citizens, let us have a clear-cut policy defined for the Industrial Credit Company. One would at least expect that they would treat an application from an Irish firm as favourably as an application from a foreign firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Control of Manufactures Act professes, as it does to me, the industrial policy of the present Government, I think in the first instance the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not issue a special licence to foreigners who were not prepared to comply with the conditions laid down in the Act.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce sanctions and gives every possible assistance to the establishment of an Irish industry, he should have sufficient influence with his representatives on the Industrial <Col N="2816" /> Credit Company to make that company underwrite the shares of an Irish company.</P>

Cases have been brought to the notice of this House on the Estimates for the different Departments in which it was shown that the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance were responsible and accepted responsibility for lowering the rates of wages previously paid to persons employed on afforestation, peat development schemes, land improvement schemes and arterial drainage schemes.  I brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary for Lands in this House, and so have Deputy Pattison and other Deputies here, cases where the rates of wages paid on afforestation schemes have been reduced during the last two years.  I want to say quite emphatically that we do not stand for lowering the rates of wages paid on State-aided schemes particularly when the cost of the necessaries of life has gone up so enormously as it has in the last few years.</P>

If this Government passes a Conditions of Employment Act for the purpose of improving the conditions of the workers employed by private employers in the country, they should at least give good example themselves and conform generally to the conditions laid down in that Act.  It is a bad thing for any Government to dictate to outside employers as to the conditions that have to be given to their workers and at the same time seek to obtain a release from the responsibility of doing the same or better for their own employees.  I think the Government should be the best employers in the country and should give good example with regard to the conditions of employment and wages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government promised that they would bring in an amending Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill which would relieve the ratepayers of the country of their obligations of maintaining widows and orphans who were deprived of their breadwinners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That Act in its working has disclosed the fact that thousands of necessitous widows and orphans have been completely cut out from any consideration under it.  The application of the means test has resulted, in hundreds of cases, of widows and orphans being obliged to go back to the boards of assistance to get a supplementary payment in order to maintain themselves in decency and comfort. The main reason why I raised this question on the Adjournment Debate is this&mdash;the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in a speech in the country and also in the course of a subsequent statement in this House promised to introduce an amending Widows' and Orphans' Bill. I want to know from him if it is intended to bring in such a Bill and pass it during the coming Autumn session?  It is for that reason that I have referred to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter of national importance.  We have all read with horror some of the reports received with regard to conditions in Spain.  There have been allegations that during recent weeks priests and nuns and religious communities generally have been massacred by the Government and the citizens of that country.  We have diplomatic representatives who are supposed to be in touch with Spain and with the other countries of the world.  When the Vice-President is replying, I would like to hear from him whether any inquiries have been made through the diplomatic channels as to what grounds there are for the blood-curdling reports appearing in the English and Irish papers with regard to outrages and massacres in Spain, which appear to be specially directed against the Catholics of that country?  If so, <Col N="2821" /> whether any protest has been made by this Government to whatever Government, if there is a Government at present, who is responsible for the conditions that are supposed to exist in that country.  I am not quite sure whether there is a Government in control of any part of Spain at present. But if the conditions which have been reported in the English and Irish papers are anything like correct, I think it is the duty of this Government to make a protest to whatever Government is responsible for such atrocities as have been reported to have been committed in Spain during the last few weeks.  I should like, at any rate, to hear from the Vice-President whether any inquiries of any kind have been made, or any action taken, or any protest of any kind made regarding the reported atrocities in Spain.  I think it is a matter upon which the people of the country are entitled to receive some information and I hope the Vice-President will say something on the matter when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Very remarkable developments have been taking place in our political life during the last month or two.  Like Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, I want to take the opportunity of asking a few questions and making a few comments with regard to the matters of high policy that have been canvassed in County Galway, County Wexford, and elsewhere.  They will be addressed not only to spokesmen of the Government but to the spokesmen of the Opposition.  I have read with great interest the suggestion that a coalition between the two big Parties was something that we may look for.  I certainly think it is something greatly to be wished for.  But if such a coalition is to take place, it is all important that it should take place upon principles and upon a policy that will be of benefit to the country, and not the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has announced that if the result of the Galway and Wexford by-elections is such as to give him a shock, he proposes to force upon the country an early general election.  The first remark I want to make is to suggest that if he does receive a shock <Col N="2822" /> from the results of the County Galway and County Wexford by-elections, it will be because the people of the country want to see the financial dispute with Great Britain brought to an end.  The lesson he ought to draw from any such result is that it is his business to get down to the question of effecting such a settlement.  There is no disguising the fact that he could do it better than anybody else.  If another Government comes into office and makes a settlement with Great Britain, that settlement will be denounced by the members of the present Government Party as a betrayal of the interests of the country.  If, on the other hand, the settlement is made by the present Government, I am sure that they can rely upon that settlement being accepted by the members of the present Opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that any sort of reasonable offer would probably be accepted.  I think it would be greatly to the advantage of the country if that was done by the present Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the recent speeches on the Opposition side about the way the question of the financial dispute with Great Britain ought to be tackled, it occurs to me as very doubtful whether a good way to get a satisfactory settlement with Great Britain is to say: &ldquo;We admit we owe you this money, but you did not pay your war debt to America and therefore we are not going to pay you.&rdquo;  I question very much if that method of approach would be at all more hopeful than the very bad method of approach followed up to the present by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I have always held, and still hold, and it was often strongly expressed by the late Mr. Patrick Hogan, that there is a very big difference between a commercial debt and an inter-governmental debt, and that essentially the land annuities debt was a commercial debt rather than an inter-governmental debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British would obviously reply to any such arguments as those recently suggested in Opposition speeches, first, that our debt was a commercial <Col N="2824" /> debt; secondly, that they had only stopped paying their war debt to America because other countries, owing them very much more than they owed to America, had stopped paying them, and that they regarded the whole war debt question as an indivisible question; and, thirdly, that the Americans had, in effect, made it impossible for them to pay the debt because they refused to take any British goods, because they put on a sky-high tariff.  A creditor country on the scale on which America was a creditor country after the War cannot expect to be paid her debts if she puts up sky-high tariffs and prevents a fairly free flow of trade.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if Deputy Cosgrave returned to office he would set himself vigorously at once to make a settlement of this financial dispute and that he would make some sort of settlement.  But I think it would be for the benefit both of Ireland and Great Britain and the relations between the two countries that a settlement should be made by the Government at present in office, if they can be at all brought to make one.  I accuse President de Valera of running away from his responsibilities if, after receiving a clear indication from the electorate in these two by-elections that they want the question settled, he proceeds to a general election in the hope that all responsibilities will be taken off his shoulders and put upon the shoulders of Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed that attacks have been directed upon the President from various quarters, including Labour quarters, for trying a political murder case before the Military Tribunal.  I want to say here that if the Military Tribunal is not to be used for trying political murder cases there is no use <Col N="2825" /> in its existing at all.  That is exactly what it is most needed for, because there is not one of us here who does not know that you cannot get a satisfactory trial of a political murder case before a jury in this country owing to the amount of intimidation that there is.</P>

Those who have spent a large portion of their time educating public opinion denouncing crime, denouncing the use of arms against the State and denouncing violence, such people might be entitled to object to the use of such machinery as the Military Tribunal, though I should think them wrong in doing so.  But people who have never stirred a finger and who have sought popularity by conniving at everything the I.R.A. did, who never denounced anything when it needed denouncing, those are people who cannot be listened to when they come to complain of the use of special machinery such as the Military Tribunal for dealing with political crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I now turn to the question which I regard as the paramount question of all others, the question of the unity of Ireland.  It is a subject that has become lately the height of fashion.  In theory, we are all agreed that it is the thing that matters most.  It is figuring prominently in the by-elections and an enormous amount has been said and written about it during the last few months.  All this would be very satisfactory if we were facing the realities of the problem, but unfortunately it seems to me, at any rate, that most of what is being said is either futile or actively mischievous.</P>
      <P>I propose to ask the House to analyse the points of view on this subject of three Parties.  Take the I.R.A. Party to begin with.  They aim at shattering the authority of this Assembly and the authority of the Belfast Parliament, and of reducing the country north and south to a state of anarchy.  If Great Britain, as they hope, is involved in a foreign war there is to be a period of frightful disorder.  There will be a liquidation of the more conservative parties in all parts of Ireland, and a dictatorship of an all-Ireland proletariat.  I imagine there are few members of the Dáil to whom that programme makes any appeal.  We do not want a unity in ruin or a unity in Communism or a unity in the extinction of everything that is decent and of good report in the country.  One thing, and one thing only, can be said in favour of the I.R.A. policy on this, and that is that it is intelligible, and that the deeds of those who advocate it are consistent with what they say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, stand for order; there was a time when they did not, but now they do, and they not only stand for order here in the Free State but they are against, as I hope and believe, the incitement of disorder in the North.  They have admitted that physical force exercised upon the majority in the North is not the proper road to unity.  They have <Col N="2828" /> stated that, in the event of a European war, they do not propose to endanger this country by allowing a foreign power to use it as a base for attacks upon Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, therefore, they can only look for unity on the basis of goodwill, and how do they go about obtaining this goodwill.  First, by consistently proclaiming the ideal of a thirty-two county republic, by calling themselves the extreme republican party and by claiming to be clear-cut separatists&mdash;according to a recent speech of Deputy Cooney &mdash;and by teaching the people to believe that republicanism and freedom are interchangeable terms, that sovereign independence is impossible within the British Commonwealth and that Australia, Canada and South Africa are on a lower plane, with a status less free and less dignified, than say, Austria or Portugal or Peru.  Secondly they seek to gain the goodwill of the North by preaching the gaelicisation of Ireland in defiance of Davis's doctrine that we should aim at an Ireland neither Gaelic nor Saxon but Irish.  Their third happy thought for the conciliation of the North is to carry on and promote continual anti-British propaganda not merely as regards our own past and present relations with Great Britain, but as regards British policy and influence in every part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond these things I cannot find that they have any policy at all for working towards unity except it be the administration of our own affairs here to the best of our ability so that the northerners may come to look upon us as a prosperous and well governed community.  I am prepared to admit that the proofs recently given by the Government of their determination not to tolerate political murder and the claim to use arms against the State is an advance towards unity. If every important Party here is firm <Col N="2829" /> about these matters, the northerners will certainly think better of us than they have done hitherto.  But that is not enough.  It is not enough to counterbalance the separatism, sincere or insincere, about which I have just been talking.  No substantial headway can be made towards winning over the North until every important Party in the Free State, besides being firm about murder, has clearly and boldly discarded separatism.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the policy of Fine Gael.  They, at any rate, are anti-separatists and, I think, anti-republican; but some recent utterances have seemed to suggest that they wish to substitute some other link for the link of the Crown.  If so, they also, in my opinion, are setting their backs upon unity.  I believe the sentiment of the North about the Crown is immensely strong.  Deputy General Sean MacEoin described it as &ldquo;hog wash&rdquo; two or three days ago and, in support of that, he cited a famous remark of a Northern clergyman about kicking the Crown into the Boyne.  I wonder if he remembers on what occasion that remark was uttered?  It was a protest against the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland.  Well, the Church of Ireland was disestablished and the Crown was not kicked into the Boyne. A few wild and whirling speeches of that sort cannot outweigh the actual events.  I quite admit it is not always easy to disentangle loyalty from self-interest and that, in particular, the proceedings of Lord Carson and his friends in the few years preceding the European War cannot be brought within any definition of loyalty that I, personally, would accept.  But the Orangemen always had this excuse, an excuse which has been given the colour of justification by the Sinn Féin movement, that Home Rule or any form of self-government within the Commonwealth was alleged to be merely a stepping-stone to separation and the renunciation of allegiance to the Throne.</P>
    <P>If I were to use such an expression as &ldquo;hog wash&rdquo; in connection with the arguments of any member of this House, I should apply it to the arguments of those who seek to <Col N="2830" /> prove that no important part is played by sentiment in determining the attitude of the Northerners to ourselves. Sentiment has been immensely powerful with us and we see it at work all over the world, even causing men to do things and to maintain loyalties that are in conflict with their material interests.  Why should the Northerners be different from all other men?  Until other Irishmen take into account the sentimental attachment of Northerners to the Crown, they are not facing realities.  If what Professor James Hogan calls our ideology prevents us from recognising the Crown, then our ideology is irreconcilable with unity.  The Northerners have their ideology too, and they will have to sacrifice a good deal of it to come into even an all-Ireland Dominion. Nobody who knows them and is honest with himself can believe that they will sacrifice the Crown.</P>
    <P>Supposing, however, that Fine Gael are still, as I think, anti-republican, what else can we glean of their views on the subject of obtaining unity?  We heard some months ago from Deputy Cosgrave that this would be one of the subjects that he would raise with the British when he came back into power, and we have lately had information as to the manner in which it would be raised.  The British are to be told that partition is being maintained by them in defiance of the spirit of the Treaty, if not of the letter, and that we expect them to hand over to us at once all powers at present exercised in respect of Northern Ireland by the Imperial Parliament.  I believe that I feel as passionately about Irish unity as any man in this country and no one could condemn more severely than to do the part which several British statemen played in the past in bringing about partition.  Nevertheless, I can only describe this proposed demand on the British Government in one way&mdash;it is a summons to them to commit a gross betrayal on the basis of a manifest falsehood.</P>
    <P>So long as we maintain the separatist ideal, to hand over their friends in the North to our military and financial control would be regarded all over the world as a gross betrayal.  To compel the Northerners <Col N="2831" /> to adjust themselves to the Commonwealth framework of Dominion self-government is one thing; to expose them to the certainty of separation from the Crown and from their kith and kin whenever the Party which stands for a Thirty-two County Republic comes into power, is quite another thing.  I stood for a compulsion of the North in 1912, but I certainly could not stand for it in the circumstances of to-day.  I believe that such an act would cover Great Britain with dishonour, and that any British Government that proposed such a thing would be swept out of office.</P>
    <P>I said a betrayal based on a falsehood. What is the falsehood?  The falsehood is the statement that the British are now maintaining partition, in the sense, of course, not merely of defending Northerners against attack, but of actually putting pressure on them to stand aloof from us.  Once again let us face the realities.  The majority in the North are dead-set against an Irish Republic.  They value the British market for their ships and for their linen; they realise that we have no alternative market to offer them.  They are proud of the Commonwealth and their connection with it. They are attached to the Crown.  They believe themselves, quite falsely, to be a superior race to us, and, on top of all their very real motives for valuing the British connection, they have raised a huge superstructure of prejudice and bigotry.  If a British Government were to desert them and take the troops out of the country, I believe that they would fly to arms in their own defence hoping, not unreasonably, that British public opinion would rally to their aid.</P>
    <P>This is something that cannot be too much emphasised&mdash;the beginning of wisdom in regard to the North is to realise that it is the Northerners themselves whom we have got to persuade. There are those who say that it is unreasonable to expect us, the great majority of the Irish people, to sacrifice our wishes to a minority, even if we knew that we could win them over by doing so.  My answer to their argument is that it represents the outlook of the leader of a faction and not of a <Col N="2832" /> statesman.  If we look at the interests of Ireland as a whole, if we take into account all the facts, and not only some of the facts, we shall not need to sacrifice our wishes; we shall form our wishes in such a way as to achieve a peace without victory and to make a harmony out of discords.</P>
    <P>And sometimes we are told, &ldquo;Prove to us that the North will come in if we drop republicanism and then we will think about it.&rdquo;  Of course nobody can prove that; we can only, as rational men, form our conclusions as to what is probable.  It is said that even when nothing more than Home Rule was in contemplation, the Northerners refused to touch it.  That is quite true, but why?  Their constant cries were, &ldquo;Home Rule means Rome Rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;Home Rule means Separation.&rdquo;  The first of these we have proved to be unfounded.  Not only does the Church not attempt to dominate our counsels in this Assembly, but there is no country in the world where there is less religious intolerance, and responsible representatives of the Protestant community in the Irish Free State are eager to testify this to their Northern co-religionists. There remains the second cry, that Home Rule means separation. We can show that to be unfounded, too.  It is entirely up to us.  Bigotry and prejudice die hard, but they must die in time if all foundation for them is removed.  There would be a psychological revolution in the Free State if it were realised, as it ought to be realised, that we are free to secede from the Commonwealth; there would be a psychological revolution in Northern Ireland if it were seen that, being free to secede, all important Parties in the Irish Free State were agreed on the desirability of not seceding, and were prepared to accept the responsibilities and the loyalties of the Commonwealth partnership as well as its benefits.</P>
    <P>In all relevant senses the Northern question is a racial question.  Deputy Cosgrave denies this, but I submit that it is superficial and misleading to deny it.  It is very possible, if a chemical analysis were made of an Orangeman's blood on the basis of race, if such a <Col N="2833" /> thing were conceivable, that that analysis would reveal a very similar mixture of elements to what an analysis of the blood of an average member of this Assembly would show.  But that is not what matters.  The Northern Unionist feels himself kith and kin with the British.  He shares, as a general rule, their religion, and he is proud of their history.  He feels himself to be of a distinct race from us, and we confirm him in his opinion by our anti-British propaganda, and our extravagant craze for Gaelicisation.  Therefore, for all practical purposes, the problem is a racial problem, and we shall never solve it until we realise that it is a racial problem.  There was a racial problem in Canada; there was a racial problem in South Africa.  Look at these countries and see how they have dealt with it.  The Dutch are more numerous than the British in South Africa; they are brave; they are determined, and they have a long republican tradition.  But they want to see their country flourish materially and spiritually.  They have seen a way to do it without sacrificing an iota of liberty; they have taken over the King as their own King and not as the King of a foreign nation.</P>
    <P>I believe that would be the solution here.  It is we, and not the Orangemen, who seek reunion.  It is we who must take the first step, and must sweep away the foundations of their fears and suspicions.  The year 1937 will offer exceptional opportunities.  If we play a free and equal part at the Coronation, and at the Imperial Conference which is to follow it, we shall not only make a more dignified figure than hanging about on the back stairs, but we shall take a big step forward towards Irish unity.  The Egyptians are in the act of making a Treaty of External Association with the British Commonwealth.  We might, perhaps, satisfy our ideology by doing likewise &mdash;and I imagine that the Government, in spite of being such clean-cut separatists, have something of the sort in mind, but if so, partition must continue. The Northerners will see, if we can not, that we shall have less freedom, less power, and less prestige as a satellite State than we could have as a partner in the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2834" /> The late Mr. Patrick Hogan once said that the one sort of person whose mentality was unintelligible to him was the person who wanted to be in the Commonwealth, but drew the line at saying so.  I echo his words, and I only regret that such a mentality is so common in this country.  We want British markets; we want Commonwealth openings for our young people; we want the services of British diplomatic representatives all over the world&mdash;say in Spain at the present moment; we want to strengthen, not to weaken, our associations with the Irish communities in Australia and Canada.  We want these things and many others that flow from the British connection, but we want at the same time to go on pretending that we are under duress. What was good enough for Sarsfield, Grattan, Tone, O'Connell, Davis and Parnell, is not good enough for us.  We prefer to see our country cut in two rather than sacrifice our shibboleths, rather than lose the cherished sensation of grievance, rather than stand upright in the world, free from all stigma of oppression.  When is this country going to show itself fit for self-government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could congratulate Deputy MacDermot on the speech which he has just made if it were not that there pervades that speech a defect which pervades every speech which Deputy MacDermot makes in this House, and that is the fact that Deputy MacDermot has not his roots here, and has not had his roots here for years.  He does not speak with either the sincerity or the material practical mind with which a man will speak who knows that, whatever mess this country gets into, he has got to stay here and make his life and his being here.  The Deputy came here suddenly, and a constituency elected him.  The Deputy will, I am sure, stay here as long as that constituency continues to elect him, and then will we hear or see anything more of Deputy MacDermot?  I doubt it.  The Deputy announced in this House that he would prefer experimentation to go on.  I criticised him on that occasion, saying that the man who would like to see experiments going on was not always <Col N="2835" /> the man who would suffer if the experiments proved unsuccessful.  The man who could clear out, the man who could avoid the mess, the man who had no stake in the country, was going to be more careless about seeing that the experiment was properly conducted with a view to its success than the man who was going to live here whether the experiment was a success or a failure.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot to-night voted for the Land Bill&mdash;the Bill which gives the Government, as Deputy Dillon says, more power than the ancient, bad, hated, detested and shot landlords.  He does that because he will not be affected by it.  This may seem personal.  I thing that personalities in politics are a good thing.  If we find that people are playing around with politics in this country, and can see the reason for it, it is surely right to say so, so that the people can understand who are the sincere persons in this country, who actually feel that the policy they are putting forward is good for the country, or who are in an experimental humour, ready to trifle with and traffic in the lives and property and good repute, and even the sentiment of the folk in this country.  Hence I am going to pass over anything that Deputy MacDermot has said with regard to the viewpoints of this Party on a settlement with England. This Party has made settlements before.  This Party, if called on, will make them again.  This Party will stand the test of public opinion with regard to them.  This Party has been honest with regard to what it has done. This Party has never attempted to promise more than what it thought reasonably it could perform.  This Party is not now engaged in running away from the electorate whom they intoxicated with promises, and the effect of whose intoxicated delirium they are now afraid to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one question that is worth considering at this time, and that hinges around the name of, up to very recently, an unknown citizen of this country, one Michael Conway. Michael Conway might have been hanged yesterday.  Michael Conway would have been hanged only for the cowardice of the Executive Council. <Col N="2836" /> If he had been hanged, the Executive Council could have been hanged, because it was the Executive Council that brought Michael Conway to the course of error which they afterwards set up a tribunal to inquire into, and it was one member of the Executive Council who went out on a public platform to give a lead to the tribunal that was going to try Michael Conway. If that man had died yesterday the Minister for Finance ought also to have died.  The Minister for Finance is lucky that he was not haled before a court for contempt of court.  The Minister for Finance has the weakness and characterlessness of his own Attorney-General to thank for that.  The Minister for Finance in any ordinarily governed country would certainly have been made leave politics.  The Minister for Finance in no ordinary democratically governed community would have been able to find a bunch of people to sit with him as his colleagues on the same bench after his scandalous attempt to do what was never attempted to be done in this country before.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he had the evidence, which would be produced, and that that would be the end of the man who did the shooting.  I said a moment ago that nations do not poison the wells.  The wells of justice ought to be kept clean also.  I want to know if there was ever any case in this country in which, when a man was about to stand his trial, a responsible member of an Executive Council said &ldquo;You will get the proof and it will be a sorry day for those responsible.  It will be their last shooting.&rdquo;  I said on a previous occasion that if that statement is analysed it comes down to this: &ldquo;I am here, Minister for Finance, speaking as a member of the Executive Council.  I have had put before me the evidence on which <Col N="2838" /> Michael Conway is going to be haled before the Military Tribunal.  I have read it.  It connects him with the crime and it connects him with the crime so well that he ought to be found guilty and it connects him so well with the crime that, when found guilty, he ought to be hanged.&rdquo;  That is said before the trial comes off, and the Minister is still the Minister and the Attorney-General is still Attorney-General and has not thought that that is worth while mentioning as a matter of as bad a contempt of court as ever was committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knew what he was speaking about.  The Minister had previously, in 1931, queried what the Military Tribunal was going to consist of&mdash;&ldquo;Officers&mdash;officers in the pay of the Executive Council; officers selected to do the dirty work of the Executive Council.&rdquo;&ldquo;Bloodhounds&rdquo; was the phrase he used&mdash;&ldquo;the seven bloodhounds of the Executive Council.&rdquo; And he is the Minister who pays the salaries.  He is the man who, for some reason not known to this House, has been selected to fill the responsible post of Minister for Finance.  He is the head of the establishment of the Civil Service.  He pays the salaries, and yet this is the man who, in 1931, before any officer of the Tribunal was named, could describe these officers as the bloodhounds of the Executive Council.  He is the Minister who holds the purse-strings and on whom these men's careers depend, and he is the Minister who thinks it proper, as such Minister, to come out on a platform at a public meeting and to say, when a man was on trial for his life: &ldquo;You will get the proof and it will be a sorry day for those responsible. It will be their last shooting.&rdquo;  And that is regarded as fair-play, even for a murderer, and for a man who, under the conditions that hold in this country, is supposed to be innocent until he is found guilty.  When that man, with the suspicion of murder against him, is about to be brought before this court&mdash;not independent, according to the Minister; not surrounded by all those helps and all those aids which ordinary communities have given to judges so as to make them independent in their conduct; not speaking to <Col N="2839" /> judges who may not be removed from office or whose salaries may not be interfered with; but to men easily amenable to pressure in the circumstances of their position, he says: &ldquo;I have seen the evidence and I am a member of the Executive Council.  It is good enough for me.  You will find that evidence produced and it will be a sorry day for those responsible.  It will be their last shooting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the culminating scandal of a career indulged in by all the members of the present Government&mdash;duplicity and hypocrisy, the prostitution of patriotism, a leaning towards the weaknesses of men, the harping on sentimentality, and an attempt to disrupt anything that was being built here in the way of fair institutions for this country.  The Minister whose tongue wagged so furiously on that occasion did not let it fail to wag on other occasions.  The President could speak to one of his, up to recently deluded, followers in Galway the other night. He can criticise that lady about doctrines that she holds.  Who briefed her I do not know, but if she had been made go through a course of the debates in this House she could not have been well advised to have taken a course more likely to embarrass the President than the course she did take. The President arrogates to himself the power to put questions to her&mdash;she who was his disciple, she who was more than his disciple, she who, learning from him, taught a lot of others and brought others to a particular point. The President is keen against murder. The President is keen against anybody condoning murder.  The condonation of murder that is alleged against Miss MacSwiney is that she said: &ldquo;If anybody was shot by the I.R.A. he was shot as a spy.&rdquo;  Is that condoning murder?  If that is a condonation of murder, then listen to this from President de Valera.  In the month of November, 1931, he was not content with speech-making.  He gave an interview to a representative of the United Press of America in October of that year, which was released for publication on the 12th November, 1931.  He said that the politicians of the Cosgrave régime were <Col N="2840" /> then feverishly trying to work up a scare.  What was the scare founded on?  &ldquo;Certain recent happenings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had provided them with just the opportunity they had been seeking.&rdquo;  Now, remember Miss MacSwiney's phrase: &ldquo;If anybody was shot by the I.R.A. he was shot as a spy.&rdquo;  Here is what the scare was founded on, according to the President on that occasion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certain recent happenings have provided them with just the opportunity they have been seeking.  Last January a young man was shot for being, it was said, a Government <i>agent provocateur</i> acting amongst the I.R.A.  In March a police officer was shot in Tipperary.  In July another man shot, who, it was said, had been led by the police into giving information concerning his comrades.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that condonation?  If Miss MacSwiney is condoning and attempting to justify the murder of Egan at Dungarvan, was that an attempt to justify and condone the murders of Carroll, of Curtin, and of Ryan? &ldquo;In July another young man shot who, it was said, had been led by the police into giving information concerning his comrades.&rdquo;  If Miss MacSwiney, as I say, had been briefed by people reading these debates she could not have used, for President de Valera, a phrase more ugly than that of saying that that man was shot because he was an informer.</P>
    <P>In the year 1928, there was a debate in this House on the review of prisoners' cases, and in the course of that debate I asked the then Opposition if they would give information, if it came into their possession, likely to lead to the arrest of the murderers of Kevin O'Higgins.  What was the answer?  Deputy Little thought it was unfair to try to put a whole Party in a position in which they are required to give a certain undertaking. It was absurd to say to any Party that they were to act as if they were officers of the police or the Government.  Deputy Cooney was not pleased with that.  It seemed to be leading too near to assent to what I was asking.  I retorted to Deputy <Col N="2841" /> Little: &ldquo;He does not admit it is his duty to give information,&rdquo; and Deputy Cooney said &ldquo;To become an informer.&rdquo; So that if knowledge of the murderers of Kevin O'Higgins came into the possession of Deputy Little, he had his doubts whether he would reveal it to the police, but Deputy Cooney had none.  Deputy Cooney thought that to pass on that information to the police was to put himself in the position of an informer&mdash;an informer about a murderer, an informer to the police, an institution of the State.  And then the President can wax eloquent because Miss MacSwiney talks about a man being an informer.</P>
    <P>One of the things Michael Conway did was to refuse to recognise the court, a practice lauded by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, speaking on the Juries Protection Bill, 1929, said it was a procedure that had been sanctified by all the martyrs in Irish history.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce thought that this method of arraigning a man, getting him to refuse to recognise the court and sending him away for six months was a farce and likely to bring the law into disrespect.  He said that such a law never could have respect, that one man with any strength to stick that out could bring the whole State into contempt and could bring the whole administration of law and justice into contempt.  &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;that if this measure passes such a man will be found.&rdquo;  He was questioned by Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald afterwards and he said &ldquo;I hope somebody will be found to fight that section.  I would be prepared to do so myself.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance lauds the practice of standing mute and refusing to recognise the court.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks the section can be brought into disrepute and the whole of the law brought into disrepute with it, and, if nobody else will do it, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared to do it. And men have got their six months recently for doing what these two Ministers asked them to do.  &ldquo;A practice sanctified by the example of <Col N="2842" /> good and noble men&rdquo; was the phrase of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Michael Conway was tried, and, in the end, the tribunal found that he was on a certain road, that a certain car passed along that road, that he had an opportunity of joining that car and that there was the mark of his finger-print on the panel of the door.  There was no allegation made against Michael Conway that he drew a revolver on anybody.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say that the tribunal were not justified in everything they found.  It is necessary to see what they did say. They found that the Chrysler saloon was the car used; that the finger-print found was that of the accused; that the accused could not have had access to the car until it was seized; and that he was on a particular road and so could have joined it.  That was what was proved against him.  That is the proof which the Minister for Finance thought was sufficient to justify his hanging, and the Minister for Finance announced that beforehand. I want to go to another case&mdash; the case of a man who went to a house with a weapon, who drew that weapon, and who was shot by the person who defended the house.  The Attorney-General paraded him for what?  For murder or attempted murder?  For entering a house to commit a felony? Not at all.  For having arms without a permit.  The Attorney-General will <Col N="2843" /> remember the case of McWalter, without a doubt.  It has been discussed here often.</P>

Here is a man to be hanged, on a lead given by the Minister for Finance, and there is what the Tribunal find about him.  Take the other case.  Of course, the thing about it is that it happened only in 1932, whereas this is 1936.  In 1932, there was this man, MacWalter, who went to the house of another man, who had a weapon on him and ammunition, and who was shot.  Here is what the Attorney-General, in 1932, said about him:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, as regards McWalter himself, he was so seriously wounded in the attack upon that house that he nearly died in hospital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The man who, so far as we can make out, went with murder in his heart to another house, and because the defender of that house shoots him, the Attorney-General takes pity on him. The Attorney-General continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He was under arrest in hospital. The moment that he was well enough to be arraigned before a court, that the Guards reported that he was well enough to be brought before a court, I had him brought before a court. Having regard to the evidence before me, and to the whole situation, weighing it up as carefully as I could and without the slightest sympathy for McWalter, I decided that the best and wisest course was to bring him up on a charge for the possession of firearms.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For that, he got six months, and &ldquo;as far as I understand,&rdquo; said the Attorney-General, his heart still bleeding for this man, &ldquo;his six months in prison have been spent between life and death in hospital.&rdquo;  He did not even spend the full six months in hospital.  He was released before his time was up.</P>

      <P>The context is this, that Martin Conway is mentioned by the Minister for Finance on a public platform when he is about to be tried. There is no question of his shooting anyone.  There is a question, apparently, of being in the company of people who shot murderously and foully.  But when one went to a house with arms, and in making an attack shot himself, the Attorney-General though it was fit to let that man off with six months.</P>

      <P>I am not going to yield to the Attorney-General unless there is a point of order.  He can make his speech later.  Deputy Finlay said in that debate:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I understood, the offence was breaking into a house, or attempting to break into a house, with intent to commit a felony.  The matter is entirely one of inference for a jury to draw from the surrounding facts in connection with a particular crime. In connection with McWalter, the position was this: The evidence showed that he attempted to break into a house.  He was found outside in possession of firearms, and surely any reasonable person would come to the conclusion that there were facts established there, and that it was for a jury to say whether there was intention to commit a felony.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General would not let that man go to a jury.  He took him up for having a gun without a permit and he was given six months.  That is the only difference.  That was in 1932. The Attorney-General is correct there. The mood was to play with these people, to pretend that they were fine fellows, and to encourage them in crime.  In 1936 the mood is different. It took more assassinations of a foul type to bring the Attorney-General to the point of view that he apparently has now, and that he would be rather ashamed to hear that case mentioned.</P>

      <P>Withdraw what?  I made the statement that it was not properly done.  The Attorney-General said it was not of his doing.  I withdraw one to make another.  Did the Attorney-General think it was part of his duty to make a public apology for what happened in the McWalter case? Did he make a protest that his office had been scandalously abused in his absence?  Did he ever say a word to any one that he thought it might be even a question of resigning? Never.  The Attorney-General has been threatened recently, according to the newspapers.  Why?  I can see a great deal of reason for threatening very many people in this country who are in sheep's clothing, as the Attorney-General is.  That it would be thought worth while by any one to threaten passes my comprehension.  The Attorney-General spent a good deal of time recently trying to suppress a paper called <i>An Phoblacht.</i>  He appeared <Col N="2847" /> in the columns of that paper on one occasion when he sent a subscription to the Party that he is now trying to put down, with the phrase that, he at least, would never serve the Irish Free State.  I can imagine people who thought the Attorney-General sincere feeling annoyed that the paper in whose columns he proclaimed himself as never likely to serve the Irish Free State, is now being suppressed by him, when he is in the service of the Irish Free State.  It is one of the ill-memories of this country that people who from time to time have taken particular lines in politics said goodbye to them when position and preferment were offered.  Poor Michael Conway, the dupe, could go very near the scaffold. Where will the man who said he would never serve the Irish Free State go eventually?  I have talked of condonation of murder.  It is a good thing, even in 1936, when the year is more than half gone, that we should get definite and clear-cut condemnation of murder.  We have not got it yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about condemnation.  The Minister is hard of hearing as well as hard of understanding. I am talking of condemnation of murder.  When did we get a clear-cut, unreserved condemnation of murder?  Is it on any date from August 11th?  It is certainly not earlier. I remember that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, when only about a year in this House, was asked by a member of the Labour Party as to whether his was a constitutional Party or not.  What was his answer? &ldquo;A slightly constitutional Party.&rdquo;&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;coming into this House to pursue certain tactics, but we are first and foremost a republican Party aiming to be a republican Government, and if those tactics do not succeed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; At that point he was <Col N="2848" /> interrupted by Deputy O'Connell, the leader of the Labour Party, who said, &ldquo;It took you five years to find that out.&rdquo;  What was his answer?  &ldquo;For five years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we were on the defensive.  Now we are recruiting our strength, and if we get strong again, we will see whether we shall take the old offensive once more.&rdquo;  He was speaking in this House as a member of a &ldquo;slightly constitutional Party,&rdquo; and his colleagues used the same phraseology. They said, more or less&mdash;I am quoting now a mass of things in the gist&mdash;that they accepted majority rule, not because it was something sacred, but because there was a law of order about it; they said that they did not accept this House as having a proper title to govern; they said that the title to govern lay outside this House, and that the people helping to maintain that Government outside this House were the men who were best carrying on the old and honoured traditions of Irish nationalism.  That persisted up to the year 1931.</P>
      <P>Remember, Miss MacSwiney is held up to public odium and scorn because she talks of the I.R.A.  We are told to make a distinction between the old I.R.A. and the I.R.A. that now exists, and we are given certain distinguishing signs.  Miss MacSwiney is implored not to use the word &ldquo;spy&rdquo; against every member of the police or every agent of the police.  Miss MacSwiney is implored not to try to create against the forces of this country the odium bound to be created by calling them &ldquo;Imperial,&rdquo; or British troops or forces. Who started all that?  Who are the first people to call and persist in calling the men recruited here to uphold our institutions &ldquo;colonial troops&rdquo; except the people opposite?  Now, Miss MacSwiney is asked not to bring this odium on these &ldquo;decent, young Irishmen.&rdquo; That is what they have now become.  The I.R.A. are now to be crushed.  They are people who must be condemned.  They are now a murder gang.  What were they in 1931?  Here is what the President said on the 15th October, when the Constitution (Amendment) Bill was under discussion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It was only men who had been inspired with the principles which <Col N="2849" /> drove them to face the odds in 1916, and who made them a part of their faith, who would have attempted it (a forlorn hope).  These are the men who we want to crush now.  These are the men who are represented as terrorists, those who never thought of themselves.  They are simply the rats that are to be squelched.  These are the people who were ready to give everything they had for Ireland, and well we know it, and now they are being deserted by the majority of their people; they have been deserted by old comrades who can no longer see any hope of success in the line they are adopting, by people who were with them originally, but are so far away from them now that the road which they are following is leading diametrically in the opposite direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President asks Miss MacSwiney to condemn murder.  What did he say of the people guilty of those three murders in 1931, to which I referred earlier?  Here is what he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These men are misguided, if you will, but they were brave men anyhow; let us at least have for them the decent respect that we have for the brave.  They have done terrible things recently, I admit, if they are responsible for them, and I suppose they are.  Let us appeal to them and ask them in God's name not to do them.  You sneer at that.  It would be more effective, probably, than all your coercion and all your threats, all the shame and slime that you tried to pour upon them to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These men were misguided, but they were brave men, anyhow, men for whom we were to have the decent respect we have for the brave.  Now, in 1936, they are the rats to be squelched.  Is not the President pouring to-day the &ldquo;shame and slime&rdquo; on them to which he objected in 1931? Why the change?</P>
    <P>One of the changes is supposed to be that the I.R.A. won respect and its title when it functioned as the Army of the people, acknowledging the authority of and obedient to the control of the people's elected Parliament and Government.  Did they always <Col N="2850" /> behave in that way?  In a recent case before the Military Tribunal, a prisoner brought there was able to show that the instructions he was acting on and which brought him before the Tribunal were the very instructions given him by the man who is now Minister for Defence&mdash;Deputy Frank Aiken.  The President thinks that the I.R.A. won respect and its title when it functioned as the Army of the people, acknowledging the authority of and obedient to the control of the people's elected Parliament and Government.  Will the President search the records got in the dump at Kilakee?  If he looks there, he will find a communication for which Mr. Frank Aiken, then Chief of Staff, was responsible.  Apparently, the situation was that the I.R.A. were not satisfied with the lump of government they had&mdash;the people outside this House who were pretending to function as a Government.  Apparently, they wanted to act on their own.  The Chief of Staff, poor man, had to steer between the horns of a very ugly dilemma.  He could not repudiate his Government.  At the same time, he could not tell these people that they must be subservient to them.  What did he say?  He said: &ldquo;A dangerous and undesirable isolation of the Army from the people is coming about.&rdquo; Having addressed an exhortation to them on these lines, he wrote on the 18th July, 1925, as Chief of Staff:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Army has given allegiance to the Government as the Government of the Republic.  If, at any time, the Government took action inconsistent with its status as the Government of the Republic, the allegiance of the Army would automatically lapse.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister is in a mood in which he will probably have to deny everything I say to-night because of that statement at Lucan.  That is what was said and written and that record is in the possession of the Government.  The I.R.A. were not always obedient and subject to the control of the people's elected Parliament. There was their reason for diverting&mdash; if at any time the Government took action inconsistent with its status as the Government of the Republic.  Then, the allegiance of the Army was automatically to lapse.  These misguided youths say now that the action taken by you, people, is inconsistent with the status of the Government as the Government of the Republic.  They now claim that they have Deputy Frank Aiken's authority for saying that the allegiance of the Army has automatically lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could give thousands of these quotations.  One would only have to go back over the old debates from 1927. Right on from 1927 to 1931&mdash;this cannot be denied&mdash;the present Government, then the Opposition, persisted in one course of conduct.  They were out to destroy the institutions of the State. They asked people to try to break down the administration of justice. They applauded them for standing mute in court and refusing to recognise the court.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that, if nobody else could be found to break the law, he would break it and bring the whole administration of justice into contempt.  The I.R.A. were kept in the background.  Men who are now Ministers played up to them and, further, sought to get sympathy for them and sought to get their support.  The President says it is impossible to have certain trials run before juries because juries were being coerced by the gun. <Col N="2852" /> A paper called <i>The Nation</i>, which Deputy O'Kelly, as Deputy O'Kelly, used to publish, put in a notice from a correspondent applauding the fact that a certain juror had been shot and was lying in Steevens's Hospital.  The Minister for Finance said in this House within the last 18 months that there was a time when he thought it was proper to intimidate juries, but he did not hold that view now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>That statement is as untrue as most of the other statements made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the people who are responsible.  They connived at and encouraged these people. They did more than encourage; they helped in every material way the people attempting to break down all these institutions.  It was they who placarded the forces of this country as &ldquo;Imperial troops.&rdquo;  It was they who tried to create the atmosphere that everybody who was a police agent or spy should get what spies ordinarily get, and tried also to encourage the belief that any man who gave information about any crime to the police of the State was an informer of the old type and suitable for the treatment meted out to informers of the old type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The I.R.A. have now got to be treated like rats, to be squelched.  Any why the change?  Why has there been a diversion of policy?  Have the I.R.A. changed or have the Government changed?  Why was the shooting of a certain juryman given publicity to in the columns of <i>The Nation</i> and not condemned then?  Why is it now a matter to be referred to by the President in his speech in opposition to Miss MacSwiney, in stating that, of course, these people could not be brought before a jury because the jury could be easily intimidated by the gun?  Where has the change come? Deputy MacDermot was able to refer here to certain other changes.  There used to be a phrase mouthed by people, who had very little sense and certainly no understanding of the change in political relations that had taken place, that England's difficulty was always Ireland's opportunity.  That Party <Col N="2853" /> when it was in opposition was brought up on that slogan and some of them have not even forgotten it yet.  Suddenly the President made a change, out of the blue, no consideration for the change, no negotiations that one can hear of, no special benefit accruing to this country from the change.  The President announces that he can say for his Government, and that he thinks he can speak for any other Government that would be likely to follow them, that no Government here could ever think of having the coasts of this country used for aggressive action against England.  That was certainly a reversal of the old form of that Party.  Possibly it went too far.  The Vice-President went to Donegal and spoke there as reported on the 20th July.  He believes that England should still quail a little at the thought of what the Vice-President would do if Partition is not ended before the next European War comes along.</P>
    <P>If we take the President as spokesman of the Party for the time being, the President has announced that big change in international politics as between this country and the ancient enemy, England.  The Vice-President told us at the Galway election that there were important negotiations going on.  What about we do not know.  The President has got over his horror of being associated by personal proximity with British ministers.  At Geneva and elsewhere he can meet them and be on friendly terms with them.  He can proceed to settle the affairs of half the world in association and on friendly lines of agreement with the British.  In a variety of ways of which these are only a few outstanding examples it looks as if the President is beginning to see that there is more reason in some of the things he used to condemn than possibly some of the I.R.A. would yet see in these things. The I.R.A. were to be tolerated and were tolerated, were petted and pampered by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice, who had it in their power to bring them to heel, as long as they were useful.  But at this moment when it looks as if the President is likely to make a swerve one way or another we have this policy suddenly announced and harshly and <Col N="2854" /> peculiarly operated against the I.R.A. They are no longer friends of the Government; they are enemies to be put down and squelched.</P>
    <P>What is the President doing?  What are the negotiations that the Vice-President spoke of?  Has the Vice-President taken any steps to perfect the defence policy he laid down in this House?  It was very sketchy but the orientation was good.  It was peculiar, coming from the President.  It was good to see at any rate that he had some line of policy.  Whether the details are good or not we cannot say until we see them.  He gave us some hint of a policy and briefly it was this: We cannot enter into an alliance with any other country.  There is no country that wants us except one.  We will arm Volunteers here.  They are not of much hope in the case of a world war and an attack on our shores but it is the best we can do.  After that, we will live in this comforting hope, that there is one nation that has more interest in seeing that no other nation attacks our shores than any other nation.  Let us get that in concrete. We will not make an alliance with any country.  We will rely on the British, whose interest it is to see that nobody attacks our shores.  That is the defence policy but it is not the defence policy that most of the members opposite were brought up on.  It is not the defence policy the President ever gave a hint of having prior to the autumn of last year.  But there are negotiations going on about something according to the Vice-President.  He had been asked about what and he has refused to say, but they are important enough to be trailed as a red herring before the people of Galway.  It is possible that the I.R.A. were anxious to know what the negotiations were about.  It is possible also that the President and his associates felt that it was better to prevent the I.R.A. from becoming too inquisitive before some bigger swerve, some more violent change took place, and so driven by circumstances, mysterious because the reality of them we do not know, the President comes to this decision, that he is not merely against murder but if a man is suspect of it, he is going to allow a Minister to go on a public platform and prejudice <Col N="2855" /> the case.  He is going to see that if any man is put before the Tribunal that he previously thought was not independent by reason of its position under the Constitution, the case will be irregularly referred to in public beforehand and if there is anything in the intimidation of language from a man supposed to be cognisant of the evidence in a particular case, then that will be slapped down heavily in the balance against the unfortunate who comes before that Tribunal, long before he is brought there.  That shows that the capacity of the present Government for blundering has not been exhausted.</P>
    <P>We naturally welcome the change of mind even though one might deplore the tragedies that have been necessitated to bring about that change of mind on the part of the Government. The Government now are stern and definite in their repudiation of murder and murder gangs.  At any rate the people of the country should be satisfied that if men are going to be sent to their trial and death for murder there will be this public security that they will get a fair trial.  If there is not such security the hanging of men charged with murder will do more harm than good.  The thought of the whole world has combined in this&mdash;that judges must be made independent in their functions before they can command respect; these judges must be made independent in two ways&mdash;they cannot be removed from office and they cannot have their moneys taken from them while in office.  While you have such independent judges there is a well-recognised rule with regard to contempt of court which forbids any man to say prior to the trial anything calculated in any way to interfere with a fair trial.  If that is so in the case of independent judges how much more so must it be in the case of men who hold office under the Executive Council and whose moneys come under the control of the Minister for Finance?  How much more reason is there, therefore, in the latter case for putting a bridle on the irresponsible tongue?  What absolute need is there when trials of this sort are going forward that men who cannot <Col N="2856" /> control their tongues should be locked up along with the prisoner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is what the man said.  Let the Minister look it up.  If there is going to be any more of these trials we must remember that the phrase did not apply only to the Egan case.  These men will be brought forward.  That speech is still there.  The Attorney-General has done nothing to clear people's minds of distrust and anxiety as to how these trials are conducted. One can, at this time, let one's mind run back for quite a number of years, in fact over the whole period since 1921.  During that period there has been nothing in this country but division and strife.  That was caused, maintained, encouraged, developed and <Col N="2857" /> continued by the men who have now recanted through the mouth of their President in Galway the other night all that they did and stood over in the last 14 years.</P>

      <P>Since 1921.  That recantation does almost apologise for every crime that that Party allowed since 1921.  These &ldquo;bloody instructions&rdquo; we have been taught, &ldquo;always return to plague the inventor.&rdquo;  We saw the inventor squirming at Galway. These people had taken him seriously. They believed him when he said they were decent, brave young men. Because people believed him when he said that they thought he was going to allow them go to any extreme.  The people who followed him felt that they had as good a right as he had to say when the time had come to stop shooting. He says &ldquo;at a particular moment I withdrew the Oath.&rdquo;  At that moment all the guns should have dropped from their hands.  These people have always said that they were taught by him to say that this Parliament was a British institution and never would they enter it.  They heard him say that they would all be in their graves before he would ever take the Oath and they saw him taking it within a week.  These people were deluded, but they had their own views as to when matters could be brought to a conclusion.  He thought the time had come.  They thought the time had not yet arrived.  He thinks it has arrived; we thought so in 1922.  He told them they were decent, brave, young men, and they believed that when they had crossed the line there was no reason why they should stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President is not obeying the law even at the moment.  The I.R.A. objects to this institution because it is founded on the Treaty.  The President himself taught them that phrase, but he has now founded himself on the Treaty which he taught these people to condemn, he has set aside part of the law himself, while he condemns these people to death for breaking another part of it.  The President knows he has set aside the law.  There is a certain <Col N="2858" /> situation here with regard to the Governor-General and with regard to Association.  The President thinks that can be put on one side.  But the I.R.A. think other things can be put on one side.  The President thinks they are committing crimes at a particular time. They think he is committing a crime now; he taught them to think so himself. I would rather have their verdict than his anyway.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, your ruling has permitted what might be a discussion on the whole history of this country since 1922.  That discussion having been permitted to Deputy McGilligan, I may be permitted also to refer to the matters the Deputy has brought into the discussion.  But first before going to any other topic I want to challenge Deputy McGilligan and to say that at no time, anywhere, did President de Valera or any of his Ministers condone murder or condone those who committed murder nor were they a party to murder like the members sitting opposite me now.  Their hands have never been stained by murder&mdash;stained by the blood of their countrymen.  We are charged over and over again with that in this debate.  President de Valera is charged with it and Deputy McGilligan knows it is a lie and that there is no foundation for it.  The Deputy had better look into the history of himself and his Party, not himself because he never had the courage to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a sorry business when Deputy McGilligan has to go back to 1920 and 1921 to rake up slime.  Every phrase of his was casting odium on the man who is now his leader and sits beside him, and on many of his colleagues for their acts in 1920 and 1921.  President de Valera talked, and would talk to-day, of the brave men of the I.R.A. There were brave men, and there are brave men, probably.  I do not know them as I used to know them. Ex-President Cosgrave does not know them as he used to know them.  But he was one of them, and Deputy McGilligan was not.

      <P>No, but the President's is.  It is a thing of value not alone to the President, but to this State.  The President at no time stood for murder or condoned murder or encouraged people to murder either before 1920, that Deputy McGilligan referred to, or at any time afterwards. I hate to go back.  I used when in Opposition often remind the House, and I am often twitted with it since, of the awful things that happened here and that the members of the late Government were primarily responsible for from 1921 onwards.  I often did that. I was told often that it was unwise to do it, but I felt very keenly the horrible crimes that blackened our nation and our race which were committed by people in responsible positions or that were condoned by people in responsible positions in this State.</P>

      <P>He stood behind and used the vile tongue which the House knows he possesses to blacken the character of a decent man, such as the President is.  Nobody is better fitted to do it; nobody is usually paid for doing it.  The President at no period of his career ever poured slime &mdash;to use the Deputy's word&mdash;on the I.R.A.  I have often listened to him since we came into this House in 1927 discussing these matters about the I.R.A. and their records and doings, and he pleaded with the then Government, up to 1932, to be forbearing and patient with these men, to give them time.  It is always in my mind that he often stated that we cannot in five years, or maybe in ten or 15 years, get away from our history from 1918 or 1919 to 1923 in a hurry.  We should realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot forget the teachings of all of us on both sides of the House, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald as much as anybody else, all of us on that side of the House as well as on this, what we taught and what we stood for and what we condoned.  We cannot forget <Col N="2863" /> these things, and even if we tried to forget them, as we ought to do, we cannot induce all the country to do it, much as we would like to do it, I think, on every side of the House.  We will never do it as long as the slime of Deputy McGilligan is allowed to percolate around&mdash;never if he has a chance to keep the dirt and filth and horrors of that period still before the minds of the young men of the country in particular. We cannot, as the President often stated here, much as we would like to, get all the country simply to cut themselves off from that past that is not all full of honour and glory for us.  And, therefore, he pleaded as we plead.  We pleaded as a Government, and have done so ever since we came in here, for forbearance and patience for those whom I regard and the President regards and has always regarded, in regard to certain actions, as misguided young men.  For four years we practised that forbearance.  We were challenged time after time in debate here by ex-President Cosgrave and his colleagues to denounce the I.R.A., to proclaim the I.R.A. and to use the full measure of the law against them. We practised what we preached when we were in Opposition.  We practised forbearance.  We said to the House and we acted on it &ldquo;We will take our time, we will try and teach these young men what we think they ought to know, the line we think they ought to follow, and we will be patient.&rdquo;  Things have happened, things will happen and may happen again because of the teachings and the example of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy and of President de Valera and of Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh and of all of us at a certain period.</P>
    <P>Things will happen.  We cannot shut our eyes to them.  There are people who will believe these principles.  They will try to put them into practice, not taking into account the big fundamental changes that have taken place, but we think, and we have acted on it, that forbearance, patience and quiet example was the best line to follow with those people.  The Deputies opposite would appear to be quite annoyed and quite discontented now when we have not continued to follow <Col N="2864" /> that line.  From one point of view they seem to be pleased that we have brought upon ourselves the wrath of those who remain, a small number I think, as adherents and supporters of the Irish Republican organisation.  I think they rushed these two by-elections in Galway and Wexford because they thought that they could use the I.R.A. for mean political Party purposes and to defeat us, hoping that those people would in their wrath be against us for doing what they have been clamouring for so long that we should do.  Now, we have done it for certain good reasons.  Our patience became exhausted, and we had to take certain action when the lives of citizens were taken.  We could not any longer show any tolerance or forbearance when the lives of citizens were taken as they were taken by, as we believe, members of an organisation.  The Opposition used that opportunity for mean Party political purposes, and if there is any man who dictated the mean part of it. I think it is Deputy McGilligan.  I believe that, because, whatever may be said of others, I believe that, like the I.R.A. men whom I have known, they have courage anyhow.  Usually they will not squeal.  They will face the consequences, but Deputy McGilligan would never put himself and never did put himself in the way of having to face any risk.</P>
    <P>It was amusing to hear a man with the slimy capacity of Deputy McGilligan talk of putting a bridle on tongues.  No wonder the House laughed.  No wonder they enjoyed the joke.  Was there ever a person in this House or outside of it who has a greater capacity for slime, for filth and dirt than he has?  He is no credit to his Party or to the House.  I admire people who can say hard things.  I have said them myself.  Others, on the other side of the House, have said them, and said them to me.  I enjoy the man who can get a hard blow in. I do not mind how hard it is.  I will try to get my own back off him, but mean personal slime and abuse is something that I think there is no value in to any individual or to any Party. Deputy McGilligan wallows in it up to his chin, and I am sure he enjoys it. He quoted, he did not quote as far as <Col N="2865" /> I remember, but he referred to instructions issued by the present Minister for Defence to the I.R.A.  The present Minister for Defence was Chief of Staff to the I.R.A.  Is there any disgrace in that?  He was Chief of Staff even after this Free State was established. He was in a very important position in the Republican Army before the Free State was established, a very important position in which he risked his life every hour of the day over long periods, a thing that Deputy McGilligan never did.  In the 1920-21 period we did not start the fight against the State, to tear down the State, and Deputy McGilligan knows that well.  Between the Parties that had been in the Dáil up to the time of the Treaty there was a Pact arranged on both sides.  We arranged the Pact with the Treaty Party, and while we were waiting for the new Government to be formed, and the Dáil to be assembled, the civil war started.  Those of us who took the opposite side on the Treaty did not start the civil war.  We repudiate the suggestion that we were responsible for starting the civil war, but at any rate when it did start some of us took our part in it and took the risks.  We fought and lost.  We were beaten.  That is the plain fact, that we were beaten and we acknowledge it. During that period some of us tried to end the régime that was then in control because we believed that they were illegally in control.  They had seized power and were not the real Government authority.  We believed that, and, even after the civil war ended and for some years, we tried hard to bring down that Government and we failed.</P>
    <P>It is no disgrace to own up that we were beaten.  We went to the people and asked the people to back us in the fight against recognising that Government as a proper Government, and we were beaten by the people. Then the murder of Kevin O'Higgins occurred&mdash;the Lord rest his soul. President de Valera, and several of those who are now with him in his Executive Council, realised that that condition of affairs could not go on, and what was to us an important decision was arrived at.  We came into this House and recognised it, protesting <Col N="2866" /> as we did against the oath of allegiance. We took the earliest opportunity of abolishing the oath of allegiance. That is all ancient history.  But, while we broke away from our colleagues and came in here and recognised this House&mdash;it was a big break with us, a very big and important break with us and with our past&mdash;we have to remember those we left behind.  We have to remember those whom Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy left behind; those who did not make the break that Deputy Cosgrave or that we made.  They were just as much republicans as we were and swore an oath to the republic.  Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Mulcahy and the others&mdash;they made their break; we made it later, in the meantime having fought all we knew how and having been beaten.  We had not the money or the arms of the State or of England behind us to beat our opponents.</P>

But we must rememer those we left behind and we cannot expect everybody to make the same change at the same time.  I do not know them, but there are, I am sure, men amongst those who do not see as we see now or as Deputy Cosgrave saw earlier that certain actions that were taken were wrong, imprudent, misguided.  We have been forbearing, we have been patient, and we hope still to show patience and forbearance, but not with murder, and never was there any forbearance or patience shown with murder, at any rate, since we came into office or before it.  It is no discredit to the Minister for Defence, Mr. Aiken, to issue orders as he did issue orders.  Thanks be to God, he was man enough to issue his orders at times when there was risk, when there was danger in it, as Deputy McGilligan well knows.  He was not there to back up even the men who founded this State.  He was always on the safe side, where his tongue was the only risk that was involved.  It is extraordinary, after all we have listened to since we <Col N="2867" /> came into this House in 1927, to find, now, Miss MacSwiney taken into the arms of the Opposition.  She is now the hero of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Opposition are going to get a very serious disappointment with regard to the elections.  They believed in acting with indecent haste, as their friend the <i>Irish Times</i> said to them&mdash;indecent haste rushing these by-elections before the bodies of the two Deputies of their Party were cold in their clay.  They rushed the by-elections because (1) Michael Conway was being tried, and (2) the Government had denounced the I.R.A.  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Deputy McGilligan, probably, &ldquo;is our chance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Now is our chance,&rdquo; they said.  &ldquo;We will rush this, and the I.R.A. situation is bound to swamp the Government.&rdquo;  You are going to get the biggest drop you ever got in your political life, and I am no prophet.  In both Galway and Wexford you will get a drop.  I do not like wallowing in the slime, so I will leave Deputy McGilligan's speech.  We were asked by Deputy O'Sullivan about the Constitution.  That matter has been referred to a few times in the House and a few times in the course of the by-elections.  The President has promised to bring in a Constitution Bill in the autumn, and he has promised to give ample time to the Dáil and to the country to know the contents of that Bill and to discuss it. When ample time has been allowed for the Constitution Bill to be known in every detail, he has promised to have a General Election in which that will be a main item.  I think the House and the country may hold their patience until October to see the contents of that Bill, and I think no useful purpose could be served by discussing it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that was discussed by several speakers was the economic war and the prospect of settling it.  We are as anxious to settle that economic <Col N="2869" /> war as anybody.  We are just as anxious as anybody in the country to have a satisfactory settlement, but we will not settle until we get what we regard as a settlement satisfactory to this country and to this Government. When we reach that, when we are near reaching it even, the country and the Dáil will be fully informed.  We are not blocking the road to a settlement by what we would regard, at any rate, as any condition which this country has a right to put down before a settlement is reached.  We are told we could make a satisfactory settlement.  I have yet to learn that a settlement satisfactory to the Government and to the country could be made on terms that this country could accept with honour. We are told that the Opposition could make a settlement in very quick time. We are told by many of their speakers here and outside that if the people would only give a chance to Deputy Cosgrave again, what a magnificent settlement he would make.  I think the answer to that is &ldquo;Once bitten twice shy&rdquo;.  We know the damn bad nought settlement he made before, and I do not think the country is prepared for a second chance at the same price.</P>

      <P>A number of small points were raised by Deputy Davin about widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance.  With regard to widows' and orphans' pensions, Deputy Davin knows that were it not for the existence of this Government you would not have widows' and orphans' pensions now.  I have said here in the House, not at the inspiration of Deputy Davin or anybody else in his Party or any other Party, that as soon as we could possibly do it, with the legislative programme we have, we hope to introduce an amending Bill making arrangements for extending the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act so that a much greater number of widows and orphans would benefit.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else that I need refer to, except to say that the Act under which Michael Conway was tried was brought in by the late Government, and was condemned by us because, as the President said here in reply, I think, to the leader of the Labour Party, we did not trust the Opposition to use such a machine when they were the Government.  We did not trust them, knowing their record, knowing their history.  We did not trust a machine of that kind into their keeping.  We put that machine out of operation when we took office.  We were optimistic enough to believe that the necessity for its use had gone for good, but, as the House and the country knows, within a year or two we had to invoke that machinery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Who cared anything about you?  There was no risk so far as Deputy Belton was concerned. <Col N="2872" /> Deputy Belton would never menace anything worse than a beefsteak. During the period when Deputy Cosgrave was only vice-president of his organisation, there were hundreds of grievous illegalities committed by the Party of which he was a vice-president, and I think Deputy MacDermot was another, if I mistake not.  During that period, in December, 1933, alone, five members of the League of Youth were convicted of unlawful possession of firearms.  In 1934 over 350 members of the League of Youth were convicted of offences such as treefelling, road-blocking, and interference with railway lines.  In 1935 there were some hundreds more.</P>

      <P>On the 29th of last month, Sir, I addressed a question to the President of the Executive Council in connection with the trial and sentence of Michael Conway, and on that occasion I received a reply from <Col N="2873" /> the President in which he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Executive Council is satisfied that Michael Conway was given a fair trial and that every opportunity was afforded him to submit evidence on his behalf, had he so desired.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I asked the President, in a Supplementary question, if he would say why he now believes it is right and proper to arraign a man on a capital charge before the Military Tribunal, seeing that in 1931 he was opposed to this tribunal being given any such powers in respect of life or death over a prisoner.  The President, in reply to that Supplementary Question, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My view in 1931, I think, was quite clear from what I stated at the time, that I did not trust the Executive Council of the day with these powers, that I indicated that another line of policy was possible, and the change is due to the fact that that line of policy has been tried.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In going on further, the President, in a later supplementary, said, when he was asked whether any persons with legal qualifications constituted the tribunal:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That court has been trying various cases for a considerable time, and any unprejudiced person looking at the conduct of that tribunal in the cases submitted must come to the conclusion that if a person is not guilty of an offence he certainly will get before that tribunal as good a chance of acquitting himself as he will get before any court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, Sir, we had a declaration by the President of the Executive Council which seems to me to constitute a declaration of repentance by the Executive Council for having opposed the Constitution (Amendment) Act (No. 17) of 1931.  The President in 1936, after his justifiably bitter and fierce denunciation of that Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1931, says now that he is satisfied that a person will get a fair trial before this Military Tribunal, and the President now definitely declares in this House that, <Col N="2874" /> five years after the tribunal was established, he for one is perfectly satisfied, not merely with the manner in which the tribunal is constituted, not merely with the qualifications of those who constitute it, but that he is satisfied that any person can get a fair trial from that tribunal even if the person is arraigned on a capital charge.  In my opinion, that is a most amazing declaration from the President of the Executive Council.</P>

The Dáil has no judicial functions, is not a court of appeal, and has no right to review the decisions or the transactions of that or any other duly constituted court.  As to the personnel or the constitution of the court, that also is established by law, embodied in the Constitution, can only be changed by rescinding the Act which constitutes the court, or by express motion tabled for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, Sir.  I am perfectly clear as to that, and I have not said anything at all about the kind of trials persons got before the Military Tribunal.  All I have done is to quote from the President where he said that the Executive Council were satisfied that Michael Conway was given a fair trial before the Military Tribunal. That is the only evidence we have of what kind of trial, in the opinion of the President of the Executive Council, can be got before this Military Tribunal.  But I, Sir, am not passing any judgment on the Military Tribunal in his particular case or any other particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the President did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President did.  He is the only person who has done so. Not merely has he given his own opinion on it, but he invited the public generally to look at the cases that went before the Tribunal and to feel convinced&mdash;apparently, by his assurance&mdash; that if a person is not guilty of an offence he will certainly get before that Tribunal as good a chance of acquitting himself as he would get before any court.  These declarations are not made by me.  I have not at all introduced the question of the kind of trial people get before the Military Tribunal.  If I wanted to do that, Sir, I might only quote some speeches made by members of the present Executive Council, but I do not even propose to do that&mdash;&mdash;certainly, not at any great length, Sir.  The answer by the President to my question on the 29th of last month is a definite declaration that whatever reservations the President of the Executive Council had in accepting the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act, he certainly has none now.  We may take it, therefore, that the President to-day warmly embraces that Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1931 as an <Col N="2876" /> instrument under which a person can be tried, not by judges, but by military officers who constitute the court, and that that person can get a fair trial. That is the declaration of the President to-day, and this declaration comes after a bitter denunciation by the President and members of the Executive Council, that this particular piece of legislation, before it became an Act, and while it was passing through this House, was the most abominable piece of tyranny that the House was ever asked to pass.</P>

      <P>On any legislative measure passing through this House very strong opinions are often expressed quite legitimately by Deputies.  Once a Bill becomes an Act, however, these opinions may not be repeated.  The Act in question is an Article of the Constitution and is not now open to criticism.  The Deputy is out of order in criticising the Act as there is not before the House any motion to repeal or partially rescind or amend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But, Sir, I am not criticising the Act.  What I have said is that the President, who now warmly embraces the Act of 1931, which he then described as a Coercion Act, is now, apparently, wholeheartedly in favour of the administration of the Constitution (Amendment) Act, and, in my opinion, the Act is being used with all the rigour and all the severity with which the President forecasted in 1931 it would be used by the last Government.  We were told then that the legislation passed was undesirable legislation, that it gave to the Executive Council of that period powers greater than were possessed by any European dictator.</P>

I am not criticising the legislation.  I have so far definitely refrained, because of the line taken by previous speakers, from making any comment on the Constitution Amendment Act.  What I have said is that that Act, when it was passing through the House, was denounced by the members of the present Executive Council who are using it to-day and using it with such thrilling satisfaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to say that the whole administration of this Act by <Col N="2879" /> the present Executive Council is in strange contrast with their views on the equipment which was being given to the Executive Council in 1931.  In that year we had declarations by the President and by the Minister for Finance, who mustered up all the fury he possessed to declare that this was a fiendish piece of tyranny which ought not to be passed, and when the Minister said that, and when the President said something similar, I believe that both of them were right in 1931, but to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising the Act as administered.  What I am saying is that the very Ministers who said that in 1931 have now given us a certificate that this Act is a satisfactory Act, and that you can get a fair trial under it, and the public generally are invited to observe the impartiality of the tribunal.  That was the atmosphere in which the 1931 Bill was passed.  The House will note the strange change of attitude on the part of the Executive Council since then.  On that occasion, they did not want any Executive Council to get the powers which they now have under this Act.  At that time, they did not want to be armed with the dictatorial powers which are in the Act.  They said &ldquo;The normal law of the country is good enough for us and we do not need these extraordinary powers to carry on the administration of this country.&rdquo;  That was the attitude in 1931.  In 1936, we were told not only that the Act is desirable, but that it is a good Act, and that everybody charged before the tribunal, no matter what the type of offence with which he is charged, can feel sure of getting a fair trial there.  I want to say I do not believe that these statements by the President of the Executive Council represent the position.  I want to say that I am not satisfied that it is necessary for the Executive Council to have these powers and I want to go further and say that these <Col N="2880" /> powers are being used with a severity and ruthlessness which is not justifiable.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot, of course, this evening availed of the motion for the adjournment to deliver one of his supercilious and patronising speeches, in the course of which he delivered the usual sermon on British Imperialism from prepared notes. Deputy MacDermot, who is not too long acquainted with recent political happenings in this country, discovered that the Labour Party did not condemn political murder.  Let me tell Deputy MacDermot that the members who constitute the Labour Party in this House have lived in this country since 1916.  They have gone with the nation through the travail since that period.  Many of them have fought in the National movement.  They know this nation, they know its people; they know what political murder is; and when Deputy MacDermot was enjoying the snug comfort of another country, the members of the Labour Party were here sharing the trials and tribulations of the people, which Deputy MacDermot took good care to avoid.  Speeches of that kind, from one who looks at Ireland from Paris or some other part of Europe, are altogether out of place here.  If Deputy MacDermot still feels that he must deliver Imperialistic, supercilious, and patronising speeches here, he ought to try to import into them, at least, a little knowledge, even if he cannot import into them a little modesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with a matter of this kind, I want to say that, so far as political murders are concerned, they have always been condemned by the Labour Party.  Whether they were political murders of 1936 or political murders of any other year, the Labour Party has, in my opinion, rightly and justifiably condemned political murders of any kind.  In respect to the political murders which were committed in Cork and Dungarvan, the Labour Party has condemned them, and I condemn them again, as unjustifiable, as diabolical outrages on two citizens, and as something which cannot be justified on any pretext whatever.  It seems to me to be nothing short of amazing that you <Col N="2881" /> can find in 1936 any group of men who can imagine that they are serving any good cause or promoting the cause of this country by murders of that kind. That declaration by me is not different in substance from declarations which were made from these benches many years before Deputy MacDermot came to Ireland.  There seems to me to be a strange inconsistency in the whole attitude of the Executive Council to-day compared with the attitude they adopted when in Opposition.  The Vice-President said this evening that they wanted to act with restraint and forbearance, yet we find the Attorney-General formulating charges against men that are not known to the ordinary law; charges which, in the main, consist of artificial offences created by the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1931.  The Attorney-General knows perfectly well, and ought to know better now, after having listened to the Vice-President's speech, that these people who have been arraigned by him on alleged offences under the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1931, are persons who will not answer the questions which have been addressed to them, because the purpose of the questions has been to felon-set these people.  Yet the Attorney-General very definitely makes the charge against them of refusing to answer questions, knowing that in that way the felon-setting kind of arrangement means that these people can be tried by this Military Tribunal, of which the President of the Executive Council now thinks so much.  We were told in speeches made in the Wexford and Galway by-elections that trial by jury is impossible in this country.  I ask the Attorney-General when was trial by jury given a chance since 1932.  Will he tell us one case since 1932 where a person was arraigned before a jury, on a charge which ought to have justified his being condemned, where the jury refused through fear or intimidation to convict the accused? Mention one case since 1932 where you have tried to work the system of trial by jury.</P>

      <P>We were told that trial by jury has failed; that it is not possible to get convictions by juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that by a Government which has not produced a single case to show that trial by jury has failed during their period of office.  Will the Attorney-General tell us of a single case where a person has been tried by jury, and has been acquitted, when, in his opinion the facts of the case were such as justified the conviction of the prisoner?  Can we be told that by the Attorney-General?  Then we will be able to ascertain whether this ramp, that there cannot be trial by jury, is not just an excuse by the Executive Council to use the Constitution (Amendment) Act which was passed for them by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  One would think, judging by the rantings one hears from some political platforms that the only task of a jury was to convict.  One would imagine that a jury had only one function, and that that was to satisfy a thirst for vengeance on the part of an Executive Council.  The function of a jury is to try a man and to ascertain his guilt, and, if not guilty, to acquit him.  If the jury has any reasonable doubt of his guilt, they must give the accused person the benefit of the doubt.  One would imagine from speeches made by members of the Government Party that a jury had only one function, unless, according to these hysterical speeches, there was a thirst for vengeance running right through the speeches made in the recent <Col N="2883" /> municipal elections in Dublin by the Minister for Finance.  I do not want to refer, although I wish it was in order to do so, to the trial of Michael Conway before the Military Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am.  While this man was on trial for his life before this Tribunal, we had the Minister for Finance, holding an important office in the Executive Council, using the local elections in the City of Dublin as an excuse for taking the platform to indulge in most reckless and wanton comment upon a case which was then at hearing before the Military Tribunal. It is strange that although other Ministers participated in the elections and made speeches, it was left to the reckless-minded Minister for Finance to come out and to unburden himself of his views on the guilt of the man before the Tribunal.  I never witnessed a more outrageous performance while a prisoner was standing trial for his life.  A Minister for Finance, in a democratically governed country, where there was proper respect for the majesty of the law and the rights of prisoners, who made an utterance of that kind would be compelled to resign.  The retention of the Constitution (Amendment) Act, and the manner in which it is being administered are utterly unjustifiable in the circumstances of to-day.  We have not had a single attempt made by the Attorney-General or by any member of the Government to show that trial by jury has broken down.  In any event, I want to say definitely that even if trial by jury has broken down in cases where a fair trial cannot be got before a jury, there should be some machinery established, consisting of persons with legal knowledge and qualified to weigh evidence, to try any prisoners arraigned on the charge of murder.</P>

      <P>The whole attitude of the Executive Council in connection with the administration of the Act is an attitude of panic, which would be justified only in the gravest possible emergency.  The panic-stricken manner in which the Military Tribunal is being <Col N="2885" /> used shows that the Executive Council do not appreciate the harm they are doing to the country.  The attitude of the Executive Council seems to be&mdash;&ldquo;when in doubt do as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party did.&rdquo;  The Constitution (Amendment) Act and the Military Tribunal are being used in a manner worse than they were by the last Government.  One would imagine that the Attorney-General, at least, would try to preserve a balance in all this welter of panic and confusion.  But even the Attorney-General seems to have been inoculated with the hysteria which, apparently, radiates from the Minister for Finance.  The Attorney-General, who holds an exalted legal office, seems to be in a state of panic and nerves these days.  Taking a rest from trying people under the Constitution (Amendment) Act, the Attorney-General went down to Wexford on Sunday.  Seeking recreation from the laborious task of bringing persons before the Military Tribunal, he talked learnedly about Communism and the dangers of &ldquo;united fronts.&rdquo;  He proceeded to warn the Labour Party about the dangers of Communism.  That was the role of the Attorney-General on Sunday.</P>

      <P>The laborious task of bringing people before the Military Tribunal preyed on the Attorney-General's nerves.  He went down to Wexford and got some kind of comfort for his ragged nerves by talking learnedly to the people of Taghmon on the danger of Communism and &ldquo;united fronts&rdquo; in France and Spain and a lot of other irrelevancies which had nothing to do with the people of Wexford, with the by-election or with <Col N="2886" /> the agricultural, industrial or social life of the people.  The Attorney-General warned the Labour Party of the danger of association with Communism.  This from an Attorney-General in a Party which, not so many years ago, sent a delegation to Russia while the Communist Party was in control there!</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I inquire from the Chair if Deputy Davin alleges that a member of the present Executive Council was partially responsible for sending a Commission to Soviet Russia, presumably for the purpose of collaborating with the Government of that country, is it not relevant, when discussing the stewardship of the Executive Council, to point out that it includes a person who has been in direct or indirect contact with the Soviet Government of Russia and is, therefore, an unfit person to be a member of the Executive Council?</P>

I should like, however, to warn the Attorney-General&mdash;to adopt his own word&mdash;that when he purports to warn the Labour Party about the dangers of Communism, he ought to look around and see whether he, as a member of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2889" /> Party, is associated with members of a Party which sent a delegation to Russia.</P>

      <P>Another matter I want to raise in connection with this motion concerns the allegations which have been made by persons incarcerated under the Constitution Amendment Act, that they are being unfairly treated, that they are being kept in solitary confinement and that the worst type of military prison life is being made applicable to those people.  Statements have been circulated to members of this House by persons who have been detained in Arbour Hill to the effect that they were kept in solitary confinement, occupying each alternate cell so that they might not be able to establish, even illicitly, any kind of communication with the prisoner in the next occupied cell.  Allegations have been made that these prisoners are there being compelled to withstand the worst rigours of military discipline.  I want to know from the Executive Council whether there is any truth in these allegations?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's tongue was bleeding at one time for them.  We all know what he is capable of in his moments of exaltation, but he does not mention them in recent years.  I submit that the allegations which have been made that prisoners have been kept in solitary confinement are matters of the utmost importance to the members of the House and of particular importance to anybody who wants to see that every type of prisoner, no matter what his offence is, is treated in accordance with some humane standards.  Allegations have been made that these prisoners are detained in circumstances which impose solitary confinement on them, and that the worst rigours of military prison life are made applicable to them. I understand that while ordinary prisoners in the ordinary jails of the country are liable to have their cells and places of detention inspected by persons described as visiting justices, in Arbour Hill, the military prison, no outside person is allowed to enter it for the purpose of investigating the conditions there.  We cannot, therefore, judge by the evidence of any independent person whether these allegations are true or untrue, but, whether they are true or untrue, there is sufficient public interest in the whole question to ensure that we ought to have an authoritative statement by some independent body other than those who are holding these prisoners in captivity.  The House or the country has no information as to what the position or the conditions of these prisoners are.</P>
      <P>There have been allegations that one prisoner has been driven mad.  We have no independent evidence from anybody to show whether a statement of that kind is correct.  We should have a statement of that kind from some independent authority whose integrity is such that the House can know what the precise position within the prison is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may, of course, be thought as something inconceivable that prisoners in this country can be ill-treated but we have it on the authority of the members of the present Executive Council <Col N="2892" /> that prisoners were ill-treated in that place of detention.  If they were ill-treated before, in the view of the present members of the Executive Council, it is not unreasonable to assume that there is a slight possibility that they might be ill-treated and kept in solitary confinement to-day.  These are matters about which the country requires some information and some assurance, I should say a very definite assurance, from somebody or some authority, who having investigated the matter in an impartial way can give the House and country generally, an assurance that this condition of affairs is not as it is alleged to be by those making charges of this kind.</P>
    <P>I pass from that to the serious question of unemployment and say, not withstanding the putting into force of two Employment Period Orders, one of which is reckoned to have deprived 20,000 small farmers of the unemployment assistance benefit and the second Employment Period Order which is reckoned to have deprived 40,000 or 50,000 people of the unemployment assistance benefit, we still have registered at the employment exchanges, approximately 70,000 persons who have satisfied the rigid test imposed under the Unemployment Assistance Act that they are genuinely unemployed.  These are 70,000 persons who have survived the rigorous tightening up of the administration of that Act.</P>
    <P>Deputies here must be familiar with this question from the many letters they receive from persons who have been deprived of the benefit of the Act under the Employment Period Orders and under the still more unjustifiable and rigorous tightening up of the administration of that Act.  It may be said by the Minister that the fact is that the unemployment has been reduced by 70,000 persons by reason of the working of the Employment Period Orders and that that is evidence of another 70,000 people having got work. Those Deputies who know the country and know the towns and the rural areas will have no difficulty in realising that the reduction in the number of persons registered is explained solely by the two Employment Period Orders and the tightening up of the administration of the Act which has deprived <Col N="2893" /> approximately 70,000 persons of the benefits which they normally would receive.</P>
    <P>We were told, recently, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that immediately on the issuing of the Employment Period Orders heaps of work would be found in the rural areas. Anybody who comes from the rural areas knows perfectly well that there is very little work to be got there.  An effort was made recently to pretend that £2,500,000 had been provided to deal with unemployment over a wide area.  Well, at least in the constituency I represent, there is no evidence that any of the £2,500,000 has found its way there.  I imagine that the same story can be told by members of the other Parties.</P>
    <P>Last week claims were made by the members of the Government Party and by the Minister for Agriculture down in Wexford that the Government was providing work or maintenance for all. But the unemployment figures as revealed by the Government's own returns show a different tale.  These returns tell their own story as to the absence of employment throughout the country.  Before the recent Employment Period Orders there were 144,000 registered at the exchanges as unemployed. We were told then that if these people were not provided with work they were provided with maintenance. We ought to see what the maintenance is.  This maintenance so glibly talked of is 20/- a week to maintain a man and wife and five or six children in the City of Dublin with the cost of living here gone up as it is; or to maintain the same number of human beings in a town with a population of over 7,000 on 15/- a week; or to maintain in the bulk of the towns throughout the country, in the villages and in the rural areas, a man, a wife or five or six children on the miserable allowance of 12/6 a week.</P>

      <P>Neither matters of administration nor legislation should be discussed on this motion. The custom now more honoured in the breach than in the observance, was that the Ceann Comhairle was given in writing by the different Parties in this House notice of the two, or at most three, subjects which it was decided to raise on the adjournment motion. The Chair on this occasion received no information.  It seems, as Deputy Norton said earlier to-day, to be free for all Deputies on all sorts of issues.</P>

      <P>Yes, and on the Attorney-General and on his colleagues, and he knows it.  I am discussing the figures here and I want the House to get this picture, that we have 144,000 persons registered as unemployed and that when considering their position we ought to remember that the Unemployment Assistance Act is being worked so that a man and wife and five or six children in the City of Dublin are given £1 a week to maintain them and that in towns with a population of 7,000 or over they get 15/- a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And that in the other areas such a man and his family get 12/6 a week.  That is the low standard at which we are paying our unemployed population.  It is because of that appallingly low standard that I want the Executive Council to tell the House on the Motion for the Adjournment what they are going to do towards solving the unemployment problem.  That problem cannot be solved by means of Employment Period Orders and a tightening up of the administration.  I am aware that these allowances are statutory but that does not make them any more helpful.  We are entitled to ask the Executive Council what they propose to do to grapple with the problem of unemployment which at one time looked so easy of solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the export of <Col N="2896" /> £5,500,000 from this country to Great Britain is an appalling burden on our resources.  With that viewpoint I am in the most hearty agreement.  But there is an equally appalling burden thrown on the productivity of this country, and that is to be found in the fact that there are 144,000 persons in idleness and denied any opportunity of working.  What is the Government doing to create work and try to pool the common resources of productivity?  We will not export £5,500,000 to Great Britain because that is a heavy tax on our productivity, yet we tolerate in silence keeping 144,000 people unemployed and feeding them out of the common pool of productivity to which they are contributing nothing.  The appalling waste caused by that unemployment problem is a matter upon which we should have some declaration from the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>A few months ago we listened to a declaration from the Minister for Finance deploring the corporative and totalitarian States; pinning his faith in private enterprise which thrills the Minister's mind so much.  Will he now tell us what private enterprise is going to do to absorb these 144,000 unemployed?  Will the Minister tell us what private enterprise will do in this respect and how he will utilise and develop private enterprise so as to get these people something more than the low statutory rates which they are being paid under the Employment Assistance Act?  An allowance of 12/6 a week to a man, his wife and five or six children is all that is being given under this Act while the State pays 12/6 a week to maintain one child in an industrial school.  We think it necessary that 12/6 a week should be paid for that child to maintain it properly.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with this problem of the Military Tribunal and with the unemployment question.  The only thing I have to add about the Military Tribunal is that the sooner the Government revoke the proclamation bringing it into operation the better; and the sooner the Minister for Finance refrains from commenting on cases that are <i>sub judice</i> the better it will be for the Minister, for the Government and for the country. The Minister for Finance in 1931 when the Public Safety Act was being passed told us that the people who would constitute that tribunal were bloodhounds and then he became lyrical with a quotation from Shelley.</P>

      <P>I would not intervene at all, or take up any time of the House, but for the serious allegations made against me by the last speaker, the leader of the Labour Party.  As I listened to Deputy McGilligan, and to Deputy Norton afterwards, it struck me that by-elections, particularly when held under proportional representation, make strange bedfellows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was invited by the President on the 29th July to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining but I think I am entitled to reply, and I am going to elaborate what my complaints are in a moment. When one finds Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Norton following on much the same line, attempting to fish in troubled waters, one begins to wonder how the strange association comes about.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy McGilligan denouncing the Government, raking up the past, distorting and perverting quotations from the President and Ministers, seeking by every means in his power to arouse old feelings of anger and hatred.  And all to what purpose?  As the Vice-President said, it can only have been directed to one purpose, and that is to bring some grist to the Party's mill at the present by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2899" /> Deputy McGilligan singled me out for attack, and attempted to compare my attitude towards certain offences some time past and my attitude towards them at present.  The burden of his song seems to be that we had trifled with crime, that we had been too tolerant, and deserved no credit for what he styled the belated action which we had taken.  He sought to make as much capital as he could out of the quotations which he picked out from speeches delivered years ago and which, I submit, he distorted and perverted in a most dishonest fashion. That was the burden of his song&mdash;that we had been too tolerant.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the leader of the Labour Party.  Having announced in the opening of his speech, with a great flourish, that the Labour Party always stood against political murder, he charged me with being inoculated with hysteria&mdash;the hysteria, I think he said, of the Minister for Finance.  He charged the Government as a whole, and me in particular, with acting in a panic.  Apparently these two Parties, both with their candidates seeking votes at the present by-elections, seem to think that they are going to get some additional votes by drawing upon the present situation and attempting to make more difficult the very difficult task which this Government has, and which any Government would have, which had to grapple with a situation such as the Government has been faced with in this country in recent times.</P>
    <P>Taking Deputy Norton's charges in their order, he stated that the severity and ruthlessness of which he said we have been guilty were not justifiable. It certainly amazes me when I am charged with being severe and ruthless, hysterical and panic-stricken, and, on the other hand, charged by Deputy McGilligan with being a characterless sheep.  How the two things could fit the same person I do not know.  Apparently the object aimed at is the same, but the methods of approach are different.  This Government is faced with a very difficult situation, demanding the most delicate handling.  When the task of <Col N="2900" /> the Government is an extremely delicate and difficult one, and we are faced with a critical situation which has to be handled with firmness and, at the same time, with skill, we should at least expect from the Opposition, which has behind it 10 years of responsibility as a Government, some more consideration than we have got in recent months&mdash;the climax being, as the Vice-President said, the indecent rushing of these two by-elections in the hope that we had suffered some weakness by reason of our actions in the recent past.  In the same way, I think we deserved similar consideration from the Labour Party,</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has, through its leader, just now denounced political murders.  Deputy Norton then went on to criticise me.  Deputy McGilligan has made the bullets for the I.R.A. Party in the by-elections and Deputy Norton comes along to his assistance, both, I suppose, angling for second preferences.  It is extraordinary that Deputies should use such a situation for a political purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I did.  I merely felt that the point I was making should be emphasised. Deputy Norton, as I say, went off with a flourish condemning political murders. Then he dealt with our methods of dealing with the present situation, and charged me with bringing people up on artificial offences&mdash;in fact, he referred to them as alleged offences&mdash;refusing to answer questions.  He styled the questions felon-setting questions.  I do not think it is necessary at this stage to go into a defence of the provisions of Article 2A, even if the Chair would allow me, as I am sure it would not.  I certainly think that at this hour of the day there is hardly an intelligent man in this country who does not realise that extraordinary methods have to be used to deal with certain situations and that the Anglo-Saxon method, shall I say, lauded so much by the Labour Party of trial by jury has failed.  It failed in other countries besides Ireland. It is very easy to hold up the fact that prisoners have been charged with refusing to answer questions, parade it as a tremendous grievance, and attempt to make capital out of it and charge me, as I have been charged by Deputy Norton, with being guilty of unnecessary severity and ruthlessness when I put prisoners forward on such charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is it really necessary to go over the ground and take the concrete facts of the situation as we know them in certain counties and districts.  Does not everybody realise that certain crimes have been committed by organised groups of armed men, whose powers of intimidation are so great that it is impossible to induce persons who are in a position to give evidence to come forward and give evidence before any court?  Deputy Norton must know very well that, not only have witnesses been intimidated, but that jurors have been intimidated.  Deputy Norton asked me to give some <Col N="2902" /> examples.  Now, I do not believe that the Deputy lives in the moon as much as he would like to pretend.  I do believe that he is quite conscious of the fact that, in certain cases, jurors have been intimidated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>And shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going back at all to the time when a juror was shot, but I am aware of this fact, that in certain cases recently in this country jurors have been intimidated. I am also aware, and fully believe, that in certain cases verdicts would have been the other way if jurors had the pluck to reach them.  I may be wrong in that, and Deputy Norton may possibly be right.  The Deputy thinks that I have been seized with unreasonable panic.  I wonder if any ordinary, sober citizen believes that, and if it is not fully realised that, instead of rushing to panic measures of this sort, no Government could have been more patient than we have been, or could have given trial by jury a fairer chance.  I submit that no Government ever gave the ordinary methods of administration a fairer chance than this Government, and it is in the light of the history of its administration of the law generally during the last four years that it has been hauled over the coals by the malicious and bitter-minded Deputy McGilligan. Deputy Norton, at least, should give it credit for having tried, in every way possible, to rely solely upon the ordinary methods of dealing with crime before it had to resort to extraordinary measures.  The concrete cases that I have given from the recent past ought to be sufficient to bring home to anybody who is not virtually blind to it, that if you are to grapple with organisations which organise crime such as the crime of murder and other crimes&mdash;crimes of a somewhat similar type which if they did not eventuate in murder were of a very serious kind, and resulted in men being kidnapped and taken away&mdash;you must resort to extraordinary measures, because every one, who knows anything about the recent past in this country, must be aware that it is impossible to get a hold of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2903" /> Therefore, it became necessary to alter the law here so as to allow questions to be put to persons: to ask them questions about their movements.  The questions upon which it is suggested by Deputy Norton that I have sent people wrongly to trial and to prison are merely questions which enable the Guards to ask a man, when a crime has been committed in a particular locality, to account for his movements, or to give such information as is in his possession about the incidents which surround that crime.  It is not asking the House too much to believe that when the Guards decide to ask persons questions about these things that they have at least some inkling and some reason for thinking that the persons whom they interrogate are in a position to give information about such matters.  I do submit that, despite the fact that it is a principle of English law, a principle which applies here in this country that all persons are presumed to be innocent until proved guilty&mdash;and this method of interrogation is not allowable at the present time here in the case of the ordinary courts &mdash;that excellent as that principle may be, and well though it may work in ordinary times: that when you have a situation such as we had recently down in the County Waterford and in Cork where men have planned coolly and deliberately and carried out deliberate murder; when they have shown by their attitude, by their daring and their coolness that they are ready to go to any lengths to carry out their purpose, and by the very deeds which they have committed intend to convey to persons who may come forward either as witnesses or to act as jurors that they will have to be prepared to meet the same fate: when you have a situation such as that, is there anything unjust or unfair in going to such persons and asking them: &ldquo;Where were you on that night?&rdquo; The Dungarvan crime was committed, I think, on the 27th of April.  When men were asked: &ldquo;Where were you on that date&rdquo; the reply given was: &ldquo;I refuse to answer.&rdquo; When asked: &ldquo;Where were you at such a time?&rdquo; again the reply was: &ldquo;I refuse to answer,&rdquo; and so right down along through the list of settled <Col N="2904" /> answers to interrogatories supplied from the headquarters of the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>All the replies are of a piece, and then we are told here that we are guilty of some outrage upon justice for bringing these men before the tribunal. Is it fair to a Government dealing with a situation such as we have had to deal with, is it fair to me to charge me with trying people for alleged offences when the law and the Constitution say that the Guards are entitled to ask people about their movements? There is the same provision in several other countries, and yet we have all this clap-trap from Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin is not going to succeed in putting me off by dragging a red herring across the trail.  Then we had Deputy Norton accusing me of a thirst for vengeance. Is it necessary for me to defend myself or the Executive Council against that charge because of the recent steps taken for putting Article 2A of the Constitution into operation?  Deputy Norton said that was absolutely unjustifiable on my part, and was merely an exhibition of my thirst for vengeance.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan, on the other hand, gets up and charges us with failing to carry out our duty, with being lacking absolutely in courage to carry the thing out with the severity with which it should be carried out, and with failing to do it in time.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  Apparently, what I said at Taghmon hurt Deputy Norton very much.  If I recollect what I said there it was this: that I suggested to the Labour Party that, in certain countries on the Continent in <Col N="2905" /> recent times, organised labour had become the victims of Communist strategy and that they had been lured into becoming members of what had come to be known as the Popular Front: that there was the example in Spain and in France, and I warned the Labour Party that I thought they should be careful.  I had read some of their pronouncements down in Tralee where they talked about tearing down the present system: that there would never be any happiness in the country until the present system was destroyed.  I suggested to them that they ought not to go on making wild statements of that kind lest use might be made of them by others.  The reason why I mentioned that was because I felt that certain members of the Labour Party had been coquetting with certain extreme parties in this country, and because I knew, as a matter. of fact, that one leader of a certain group here in Dublin had asked for a United Front.  I warned the Labour Party about the danger of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I so far wrong that Deputy Norton should get so wildly excited about it?  What about his own recent action in connection with the commission that we had to ban?  Was not that coquetting with certain people? Why has the Deputy not had the courage, if he believes in the recent complaint which he voiced about the treatment of prisoners, to put down a motion in the Dáil about it?  First of all he allowed himself to be associated with that commission which he must well know was going to afford comfort to those people at a time when the Government was forced to take drastic action in order to restore ordered conditions. I do not think that was a proper proceeding on the part of a leader of a constitutional Party in this House.  When we declared that commission illegal, and when the Deputy raised a question about it in the Dáil, he was invited by the President to raise it in the House, but he has not done so.  Perhaps I am confusing one thing with another, but at any rate before the commission was banned a straight invitation was given to the Deputy to raise the matter in this House.  It was intimated to him that if a substantial number of Deputies <Col N="2906" /> wanted to have a commission to investigate the treatment of prisoners, that would be gladly and readily granted.</P>
    <P>What has happened?  There was no step taken in regard to that until to-night, at the end of the debate and, as the Ceann Comhairle said, without any notice, we were charged, for the purpose of the by-elections, with the ill-treatment of prisoners.  I do not think that is fair or proper and we have a right to resent that.  I am not in a position to deal with the treatment of prisoners, but I do not believe there is any ill-treatment.  There have been complaints.  There are always complaints.</P>

      <P>There are other Deputies who want to speak and I have no desire to take up the time of the House.  I do not want to say very much more.  Deputy Norton seemed to think I ought to have kept my head in a crisis.  He charged me with suffering from ragged nerves and he said that I went to recreate myself by making speeches in County <Col N="2907" /> Wexford.  I do not think I am suffering from ragged nerves at all.  I think the history of the recent crisis and its development step by step has been plain and open to everybody and everyone who has followed the attitude of the Government towards this organisation during the last four years and has witnessed the manner in which the Act was administered since the I.R.A. was banned, must admit that, despite the indications given that the Government intended to be firm and drastic in this matter, they nevertheless tempered justice with mercy.

      <P>I am not making any charges against Deputy Davin, but I will repeat what I said at the beginning.  I feel the brunt of this complaint has been directed to a particular piece of legislation, and the putting into operation of that legislation has been an unpleasant and a difficult task, and, when Deputy Davin makes clear the attitude of himself and his Party towards political <Col N="2908" /> murder, he ought to follow that up by considering carefully the attitude he adopts towards the measures which we feel forced to take to cope with it and he ought to be prepared to indicate in what other way we could have dealt with it except the way we did, or get out of office. While I sympathise with Deputy Davin's feelings that something I have said may possibly have hurt him, I think at the same time there is on the part of the Labour Party a slight inconsistency between profession and performance.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy looks up any report of my speech, he will find that I did not call them Communists.  The paraphrase I gave was almost word for word what I did say.  The Deputy apparently did not take any exception to what I indicated to-night I did say.  I did not charge the Party with being Communists.  I warned them of the danger to which other organised Parties, organised on somewhat similar lines to this Labour Party, laid themselves open in other countries.  It was not intended to carry the implication that the Labour Party are Communists; it was to warn them that there is a danger in making wild statements and that there are dangers which may arise which have arisen in other countries.</P>

      <P>This debate, which has lasted six or seven hours, has taken <Col N="2909" /> many turnings.  It opened with the suggestion that there was going to be a coalition between the two principal Parties.  As a matter of fact, it was suggested that the coalition had already taken place, but as the debate proceeded there were signs that that coalition was not in existence and, as it proceeded a little further, not only were there signs that the coalition was not in existence, but there were signs that the old coalition that has existed for four years between the Fianna Fáil and the Labour Parties seemed to have been smashed to smithereens.  In fact, the debate for the last couple of hours has been a duel between Fianna Fáil and Labour.</P>
      <P>Had there been time, there is a great deal of ground that could be covered in a debate of this kind. An adjournment debate of this type is one of the rare opportunities that Deputies get of dealing with matters that are agitating the country.  There are a few subjects that I had intended to deal with at length but, owing to the short time at my disposal, and my anxiety to leave a little time for my friend and colleague, Deputy Anthony, I will deal with only a couple of matters and I will deal with them briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic was has been in existence for four years and no attempt has been made to settle it.  All kinds of hypocritical statements are made about our not paying the annuities and other payments to Britain.  Well, they are being paid.  Surely the present Government ought to have learned a lesson in the last year, a lesson in honour, and it is time that we cultivated some code of honour in this country.  Within the last year, the Government introduced a Bill giving them power to impose sanctions on foreign countries in certain circumstances. That Bill was given to them by this House.  Under that Bill they had power to make an Order imposing sanctions on the particular country that they had singled out for that purpose.  They imposed sanctions on Italy, a country that never did any harm to this country, and a country that we were not in a position to do any harm to.  But by our shortsightedness, <Col N="2910" /> by our want of vision, we showed a great foreign friendly nation what we would do to them if we had the power to do it, and we did that at the dictation of other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know now why the Government, before the Recess takes place, does not withdraw the sanctions and, in fact, repeal that Act.  A situation arose in Europe when the Germans reoccupied the Rhine Province.  The Locarno powers were convened to consider what steps would be taken to deal with the German breach of the Locarno Treaty. Italy signified her willingness to attend but said: &ldquo;We will not be a party to sanctions on Germany or any other country while sanctions are being imposed on our country.&rdquo;  Why was our country so shortsighted, so bereft of honour, as to impose sanctions on Italy while Britain was imposing sanctions on us by way of economic tariffs? Now our Government is going for a three months' holiday and it still has the power under that Act to impose sanctions on any nation it so thinks fit. I am glad the Vice-President is here. On a motion which Deputy Kent and myself had down here to annul the Order imposing sanctions on Italy, I made reference to what I read in an American paper to the effect that the Italian Government, at a critical time in our history, was friendly to us.  The Vice-President denied that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

I am not suggesting amending or new legislation, but I take it that this debate is an opportunity to criticise what the Government has done in the last session or what it has refrained from doing.  A situation has now arisen in Spain, a country which at the present time appears to be ruled by priest murderers and church burners.  Our Government has a trade agreement with those people.  Those people do not control half of Spain at the present time.  They are being condemned all over Europe.  They are not only attacking Catholicity, but they are attacking Christianity.  It is Communism in its worst form.  But this Government, which claims to be not only Christian but Catholic, persists in a trade agreement with those scoundrels.</P>

Even the clearance machinery in Spain has broken down, and that notorious scoundrel of a Jewish adventurer, that curse of Hungary which gave us inspiration 30 years ago, that same Bela Kun is reputed to be in Spain for a number of months, organising and fomenting Communism in that unhappy land.  We know the condition <Col N="2912" /> it is in to-day.  It is a shame and a disgrace to this country, which at least is Christian and, I hope, Catholic, that the Government is going into Recess now for three months, leaving behind it sanctions on the Catholic Christian nation of Italy, while maintaining trade relations&mdash;and not only trade relations but a most-favoured-nation agreement&mdash; with Spain.  The country is already manifesting its hostility to that line of conduct on the part of the Government, and I think, by the time we reassemble in three months, the country will have manifested in a more pronounced manner its hostility to that action on the part of the Government on the one hand, and that inaction on the other. In all probability there will be organisation around that, and it is a pity that the Government did not see its way to take action before it went out of office, or rather before it went into Recess.</P>

      <P>I do not know; the signs seem to indicate that there might be an appeal between this and November. To deal with the many matters I intended to deal with would deprive my friend, Deputy Anthony, of an opportunity to speak.  I would just conclude by making reference to a matter which I consider very important.  During the course of this debate some speakers have waxed very eloquent on the Commonwealth; and showed every sign of wanting a show-down between the Commonwealth versus a Republic. There is one thing which I appreciate in regard to the present Government during the last three or four years, and that is that it has side-tracked that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes, when we are talking politics rather than policy, some of us will upbraid the Government for talking less of a republic and advocating a republic not so strongly now as they have done in the past; but in office, and here in this House, we should not talk politics or think politics.  We should talk statesmanship if we can, but we should think in terms of policy rather than of politics.  I am glad that <Col N="2913" /> the Government has seen fit not to obtrude the policy or the ideal of a republic by looking for a show-down on it immediately by featuring it here in this House and endeavouring to get a decision on it here in the House.  On the other hand, I should be glad if other Parties talked less of the Commonwealth, and if we talked less or if we featured both the Commonwealth and the republic less and considered the interests of the country more and the building up of the economic life of this country more as an independent nation, we would be doing more good for what will ultimately be best for the country.  What will be ultimately best for the country may not be in our hands to decide.  It may be another generation of Irishmen and Irishwomen who will decide what is best for the country, and if we have done our bit in this country we should hand it down to the next generation, not as a bone of contention but as a foundation on which to work for the development of the Free State.  If we do that we will be going a long way to bridge the difference that exists between the Free State and the North and a long way to obliterate the present boundary.  It does not matter who put it there.  The boundary is there and the more we build up on our side of the boundary, the nearer we will be getting towards its obliteration.</P>
    <P>I have many other points to make, but I have not time.  Deputy Davin was very keen about the Banking Commission. Well, I said a moment ago that I complimented the Government on not featuring the question of a republic.  Of course, the very terms of reference of the Banking Commission breathe anything but the spirit of Separatism that we have heard so much about here.  It leaves the golden link of the £ sterling still the link binding this country to Great Britain, and there is no link as strong as a money link.  The question of credit facilities not being available to farmers now may have some bearing on the fact that we have not a central bank here in this country; but what is more important than any central bank is that the main industry in this country is showing no margin of profit.  We have no profit on agriculture because <Col N="2914" /> we are engaged in an economic war, paying a debt that we are trying to fool ourselves we are not paying.  Not only is the Government responsible for the situation, but its allies, or its former allies, if we are to take at its face value the more or less of a dog fight that has been going on here to-night between the two Parties, are also responsible.  Whether they are the Government's allies now or not, they were, at any rate the Government's allies in doing the damage of destroying agriculture and depriving it of a profit, and when agriculture shows no profit income, it cannot have credit.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Sir, I would draw the Vice-President's attention to the fact that the Government failed to show the world that this country will terminate the special trade agreement that it has with Communist Spain, and perhaps the Minister might also tell us, by way of an answer to this question, when he is going to take notice of the Communist propaganda that is being preached every night in Cathal Brugha Street.  It is time that we should take notice of the dangers that are lurking ahead, because Communism, it must be remembered, had a similar beginning in other countries to what is going on here, and that kind of thing ended in the burning of churches and the murdering of priests.  We should try to stop that kind of thing before the churches here are burned and the priests murdered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion we heard a good deal of solicitude expressed and manifested for persons who have been brought up and charged under the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act, but not one half of that solicitude or sympathy was ever expressed for the victims of the organisation which was instrumental in having these murders committed in our midst&mdash;the murder of young Egan and of Admiral Somerville in County Cork.  Not one half of the solicitude was manifested or expressed in connection with the victims of these murders.  Now, the attitude of Deputy Norton and his Party to-night, in so far as we can understand it, in their attempt to capture votes and to wean away voters from Fianna Fáil and the extreme Republican Party, appears to me to be a policy of facing both ways. Apparently, the pale pink Communism of the Labour Party does not appeal to the ordinary working-class people of this State, nor does it make that appeal which it was calculated it would make, and the Labour Party, apparently, are now turning out as full-blooded republicans and they express the greatest solicitude and sympathy with every person who was interrogated.  Now, as the Attorney-General pointed out, the system of interrogation exists and has existed for years in many other countries and the citizens of these countries, being <Col N="2916" /> loyal citizens, are quite prepared to give answers at any hour of the day or night when they are interrogated by the police authorities as to their whereabouts at a given time.  What is wrong in asking any honest man, who has nothing to be afraid of or nothing to be ashamed of, where he was at any given time?</P>
      <P>Then we have Deputy Davin, whom I always looked upon as a wonderfully constitutional person in this House, asking some silly questions here to-night about a man being imprisoned and people calling to him and about maltreatment in the prisons of this country.  Does he want us to supply these prisoners with wireless sets and playing-cards to play poker with, and moving pictures, and so on?  I wonder at Deputy Davin's mentality and that of other people.  In my view&mdash;and I expressed the same view when Deputy Cosgrave was in office here&mdash;this is a time when every honest, decent man in this country should stand four-square behind President de Valera and his Government in supporting the law and order for which this Dáil is responsible.</P>
      <P>Every member of this House is either shirking his duty as a public man, or he is acting the coward by shielding himself and by being on the side of the angels, the angels being possibly the persons with the guns in their hands. I have never yet been afraid of a man with a gun in his hand, and never shall. I want to make my position in that connection quite clear, that, so far as I am concerned, the Government will have my vote behind them in any measure they take to enforce law and order in this country.  Having said that, I feel that more of Deputy Norton's speech as Leader of the Labour Party might have been devoted to the problems which confront the working-class people of this country every day, rather than that he should coquette with a Party outside this House which is trying to break down the institutions of the State which were built up by President Cosgrave and his Party and which are now being continued by President de Valera and his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were asked to epitomise or summarise the principal effects and results that have flowed from Fianna Fáil government in this country, I could <Col N="2917" /> easily do so under two or three headings. They are (1) more unemployment and more poverty; (2) increased taxation, local and general, and (3) the impoverishment of our principal industry, agriculture, due to the continuation of the economic war.  I should like to emphasise each of the points I have read out, but the time is too limited, due to the longwindedness of a lot of people who took a long time to say very little.  It is most unfair to members of this House who sat here all day to be left until almost 12 o'clock without an opportunity of speaking.  I myself have risen six or eight times and I have protested already.  I know it is not your fault, Sir, because you were not always in the Chair and because the personnel of the Chair is changed so frequently, it is a matter of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the farmers and farm labourers of this country have been impoverished as a result of the activities of this Government, but I want particularly to refer to the position as I find it in Cork.  While the industrial policy of the Government is highly commendable in many respects, I should like to point out that it has not had the direction and careful and thoughtful planning that one should reasonably anticipate from the Government charged with conduct of political and economic affairs in this country.  I should like to call the attention of the Vice-President to the fact that in the flour milling industry we have had many stoppages of work.  We have had mills closing down for weeks on end, and we have had under-employment due to these quota orders, etc. In the boot and shoe industry in the same way, we have almost reached saturation point, and I want to know what it is intended to do with the surplus products.  There is a danger in this respect which I see and which other persons who have given the matter any kind of thought or study at all can see.  If the mills work to their full capacity, you will very soon have over-production in flour and you will have, as a consequence, men thrown out of work.  If the boot and shoe industry works at full pressure, they will be enabled to turn out more goods <Col N="2918" /> than will satisfy the requirements of our people.  What is going to be done with the surplus?  We will have an exportable surplus, and I understand it is the intention of the Government to establish one or two additional boot and shoe factories in this country. Representations have been made to me by many people engaged in those two industries asking me to protest against the establishment of any other flour milling establishment, and also to protest against any additional boot and shoe factories being established, all going to show that there is a feeling that one of these days we shall reach saturation point and there will be no demand for the surplus products of our factories.</P>
    <P>One other point, and I am finished. It has been stated time and time again that the President of the State, whom I respect as President of the State, although I am very much opposed to his policy, and some members of the Executive Council know where arms are dumped in this country.  I am not making the charge, but it has been so stated over and over again in public. If the President or any member of the Executive Council knows where those arms are dumped, I think it is his duty to show example to other people in the country and have those arms handed over to the responsible authorities of the State, either the police or the military authorities.  I welcome the speech made by the President on Tuesday, I think, in Galway, and I welcome the attitude adopted by him in relation to these illegal organisations, and I have no hesitation and no fear in saying so.  I deprecate very much the attitude of Deputy Davin and others who questioned the Minister for Finance to-night.  The statement of the Minister for Finance, as I read it, was a simple statement of fact.  He stated that if the murderers were found they would receive a murderer's fate.  In effect that is what he said.  I see nothing wrong in that, and I feel, too, that when the Government is endeavouring to govern, it is no time to deprecate that change of front, which I welcome, towards crime and criminals.  We should welcome it, and every Deputy should be behind the Government in their changed attitude, <Col N="2919" /> as I regard it, towards crime.  Having said that, I want to say also that I hope that, as the President has announced his change of front in relation to his political views, if you like, he will also show a change of front in his industrial policy, and that in the light of the experience he has gained already, he will learn to change his attitude and perhaps get some more economic wisdom.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will give a return showing the names of the lay assistants and junior assistant mistresses who retired from the service of the Department during the period April 1st, 1922, to March 31st, 1934, with the school and county in which they were serving at the date of retiral, and the number of years' service given by each such teacher.</P>

      <P>The official time and expenditure which would be involved in the preparation of the return as desired by the Deputy would not be justified, but, apart from this, I am not prepared to give a list of the names of individual teachers with the other particulars specified.  The records of the Department show that approximately 170 lay <Col N="2729" /> assistants and 530 junior assistants mistresses ceased to serve in national schools during the period stated.</P>
