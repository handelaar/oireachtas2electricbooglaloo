      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he received a memorial signed by a large number of persons residing in the vicinity of the Ranch in which it was complained that the Dublin United Tramways Company failed to provide a regular bus service between O'Connell Bridge and the Ranch; whether he is aware that the nearest point at which people residing at the Ranch can obtain a regular bus service to the city is more than a mile distant from their houses; whether he is aware that the absence of a regular transport service to and from the city inflicts great hardship on people residing in this neighbourhood and prevents them from taking or sending their younger children to the city, and whether he intends to take any steps to secure an adequate bus service for them.</P>

      <P>A memorial of the nature referred to has been received by me.  I am not prepared to accept the implications of the remainder of the question, as I am informed that in addition to a direct service, at least three other bus services pass within half-a-mile of the Ranch, providing a frequent and reasonably adequate service for the area.  I am further informed that only limited support has been afforded to the existing service and it is very doubtful whether in these circumstances the company could reasonably be required to extend the service.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, consequent on the action of Dublin United Tramways Company in withdrawing the service formerly provided on this route, the present service provided for residents is decidedly unsatisfactory and that, as a result of the present limited service, persons resident in this area are required to <Col N="2131" /> walk long distances before they can connect with the present unsatisfactory transport service provided by the Tramways Company?  Does the Minister propose to ask the Dublin United Tramways Company to provide in this area a service as good as the service which existed before it took over the previous bus service?</P>

If the service were efficient, the persons concerned would be glad to avail of it. Will the Minister put that consideration to the Tramways Company and ask them to give back to the people in this area the efficient transport service they have taken from the people?

    <Col N="2133" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we were discussing two alternative methods of dealing with the latest problem.  One of these methods is set out in amendment No. 133 and the other is contained in the Minister's scheme in the Bill.  I think it may be appropriate at the moment to point out to the House that the abuse of lapsed policies which this is designed to remedy is an abuse upon which has been built a great deal of the prosperity of the great industrial assurance companies of the world. At the time when vast reserves were accumulated abroad as a result of lapsed policies, it must be borne in mind that that was then a perfectly legal proceeding.  But it should be borne in mind also when comparing the state of the Irish companies with the great wealthy British and American companies that these latter companies had the advantage of operating freely without any legislative interference in the matter of lapsed policies while the Irish companies from the date on which they were instituted had to proceed on much more conservative lines and had to allow their policy-holders more generous terms than their more wealthy rivals had been required to give them long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we asked the question how an agent could discharge himself from the guilt of negligence under sub-section (2) of Section 61 if he did not make ten separate calls during the ten-week period which must elapse before the insurance company lapsed the policy for non-payment of premium. Short of getting an express letter addressed to the company from the policy-holder announcing that the latter desired to lapse the policy, I do not see how an insurance agent could avoid going ten times and asking the policy-holder if he or she were not prepared to resume payment of the dividend arrears and the dividend now due.  I think, however, from the point of view of the policy-holder that is not as satisfactory an arrangement as if the insurance company were required to send the policy-holder a form of notice giving him the limited time in which to resume payment of dividends and notifying him that unless he did resume payment of dividends <Col N="2134" /> within that time that this policy would lapse and that he would not lose the premiums that he had paid before because nobody suggests that that would be the case.  On the date of the lapse he would receive a paid-up policy in respect of what he had so far contracted.</P>
    <P>I want to urge again that while it is admitted that legislation concerning industrial assurance must have as its prime purpose the protection of the policy-holder, owing to the peculiar character of the policy-holders in such contract, we ought not to allow ourselves to be carried away into doing a substantial injustice to a properly conducted business.  When the question of a lapse arises the insurance company must prove to the satisfaction of the responsible authority that that lapse did not take place as a result of any negligence on the part of their agents.  If my memory serves me right the policy can be revised over a pretty considerable period.  In fact, if the policy-holder alleges that he was willing to pay his premium if the collector were to call for it, the policy goes on indefinitely until the time for its completion.  But anyone who is familiar with insurance practice will know that agents habitually change their employment and very frequently an agent who is in the employment of one company now, is in the employment of quite another company in 12 months' time and may have passed to the third company in three or four years' time.  When that agent ceases to be employed by the first company he has no inducement whatever to come forward and give evidence on behalf of the employer whose employment he left three years ago and with whom he has now no contract at all. The insurance company alleges that by the implied will of the policy-holder the policy has lapsed.  The responsible authority asks for proof and that insurance company says &ldquo;So-and-so was the agent responsible,&rdquo; and the responsible authority says &ldquo;Produce that agent.&rdquo;  If they go and find him they may find that he may be in some other employment now.  They ask him to go down to the court to testify on their behalf.  He either will not do it <Col N="2135" /> or if he goes to the court he says he has no recollection of the transaction at all, that he was handling thousands of claims and policies at the time&mdash;he has no recollection.  If it were represented emphatically by the policy-holder that the lapse had taken place as a result of negligence on the agent's part, the latter would not be prepared to deny it.</P>
    <P>Does not the House see that unless there is some method whereby the insurance company can establish documentary evidence at the time of the lapse that they did honestly take every precaution to ensure that the policy-holder would be clear in his mind as to what the consequence of withholding premiums was, that their position becomes absolutely impossible and that to establish a lapse against a dishonest policy-holder becomes quite impossible for any company no matter how much the right may be on the company's side?  Lastly, I believe in a bold policy where a certain job has to be done, but I believe it is useful to learn from experience.  The method set out in amendment No. 133 has had ten years' trial in Great Britain.  The method set out in the Minister's scheme has had no trial at all.  So far as I am aware, the method which has been tried out in Great Britain, which is probably the greatest industrial assurance country in the world, has been eminently satisfactory and no claims have arisen in respect of policy-holders which have not been properly disposed of.  With that evidence before us, would it not be a much wiser thing to adopt the tried and proven remedy for overcoming the abuses which we want to make an end of rather than to adopt something which yet remains to be tried out and which may not, in fact, operate as efficiently as the British plan is operating at the present time and has operated over the last decade?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many features of this question which Deputy Dillon has not referred to.  He stated that the amendment proposes to insert provision for a system which has been in <Col N="2136" /> operation in Great Britain since 1923, and which has proved eminently satisfactory there, so far as he is aware. The British Industrial Assurance Commissioner in his memorandum to the Cohen Committee, the report of which Deputies opposite have quoted from frequently, stated that the system of forfeiture is unsatisfactory and leads to innumerable difficulties and disputes. In these circumstances it is obviously up to us to endeavour to devise some other and more satisfactory system, and I think we have provided for that in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to his memorandum.  The main difficulty he referred to was the innumerable disputes it led to between the insurance companies and the policy-holder. Remember what is involved in the issue of lapsed policies.  Deputy Morrissey mentioned that 6,000,000 policies lapsed one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that of 10,000,000 policies issued in a particular year, 6,000,000 lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Just imagine what that involves to the companies in the matter of issuing lapse notices, in keeping the records from which the notices can be prepared, and being in a position to prove, perhaps five or ten years hence, that such notice was, in fact, issued, and then to find that the notice was invalidated because it was addressed to John Murphy instead of James Murphy, or because the arrears were stated to be 2/5 instead of 2/4.  These difficulties and the disputes arising from these matters were so great that the system adopted under the 1923 Act proved unsuitable and unsatisfactory in Great Britain, and we do not propose to adopt it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an amendment which has been recommended on the ground that <Col N="2137" /> the sole purpose is to require companies to give notice of default before lapsing the policy.  There is more than that involved.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a company giving notice, but we are providing, first of all, that the contract between the insured person and the company shall oblige the company to collect the premiums by sending a collector to call at the address of the policy-holder.  The policy cannot be lapsed unless there is a default over ten weeks in the payment of premiums and at any time within the ensuing two years, if the policy-holder proves the failure to pay premiums was due to the fault of the collector, he can revive the policy at full rates on payment of the arrears due.  We further provide that the policy-holder, under certain circumstances set out in the relevant section, is entitled to get automatically, without application on his part, a free paid-up policy in the event of his ordinary policy lapsing. Under the existing law and, as I assume, under the system which would operate if this amendment were adopted, that obligation to collect would not be there, and that obligation to give a free paid-up policy automatically would not be there.  We have a system which, we think, will get us clear of the abuses.  Let us take the class of person whose policy is likely to lapse.  Deputy Dillon referred to those who ceased to pay because of some dispute with the insurance company. There are those who cannot pay because their economic conditions have worsened, or because they were induced through the efforts of a canvasser to take out a policy involving higher premiums than they could afford to continue.  There are those who are induced by the canvasser to allow a policy to lapse and take out a policy involving a higher premium.  There are those who go away without leaving their address and whose lapse notices are returned from the Dead Letter Office.  In all these cases the lapse notice is a sheer waste of time and expense.</P>
    <P>The only class whom it may be desirable to keep insured are persons who will continue their policies if persuaded to do so by the company's agent and <Col N="2138" /> the company's agent may be relied on to do this if the provisions of the Bill are brought into operation.  In all such cases I agree the issuing of a lapse notice may support the efforts of the agent.  There is nothing in the Bill which prevents the company serving a lapse notice, but we are not making it a statutory obligation on the company to do so.  Further, they can have printed in the receipt book in clear language intimation of the conditions under which the policy may lapse and that will be brought to the attention of the policy-holder on every occasion when the premium receipt book is opened; so that, in so far as the function of the lapse notice is to call attention to the conditions, that is amply provided for in that section.  I therefore find myself unable to accept the amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell. I think the provisions in the Bill are likely to prove much more satisfactory in operation than the provisions in the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the question of the lapse notice, there is one thing the Minister is doing, and that is, he is definitely reducing the period to ten weeks.  The period at present, so far as most companies are concerned, is considerably longer.  If you take the maximum amount of the arrears period, plus the time given in the forfeiture notice, it will mean 12 and perhaps 16 or 17 weeks in the case of certain companies.  The Minister seems to be taking the minimum period allowed at the moment&mdash;ten weeks.  I would like to hear from the Minister why he has come down with ten weeks rather than with 12 weeks or some other figure.  So far as I know, the average period&mdash;that is, taking the period allowed for the lapse notice plus the arrears period&mdash;would be about 13 or 14 weeks.  So far as I am concerned, I am inclined more to the section than to the amendment.  I think, however, that the Bill, notwithstanding what the Minister said about the forfeiture notice, would be very much strengthened if we retained the provision to serve the forfeiture notice.  The Minister talked about the expense and the difficulties there already, but what additional obligation are you putting <Col N="2139" /> on the companies except to collect the premiums?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very considerable obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice that is done by every company now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a company is not subject to any penalty if it fails to do it.  We are saying now that it is a condition of the contract between the company and the policy-holder that the company must collect the premiums. That makes a very considerable difference, because, obviously, it brings up the question of the circumstances under which a company can get out of a contract.  As regards the period, I may point out that under the existing law the statutory period is four weeks.  We are extending that to ten weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about what the practice is.  With regard to the other point, I have suggested to the Minister that in practice he is not putting any additional obligation on the company, by making it a statutory obligation, to collect the premiums.  In practice they do that.  I must say that if the obligation to do that is printed in fairly large type on the premium receipt books&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And in plain language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that goes some way to meet my point, because usually what you get on the back page of a premium receipt book is a notice in such small type that you would need a very good magnifying glass to read it, apart altogether from understanding it.  At the present time these notices are not either read or understood by a great number of people who take out industrial policies.  The Minister also implied in his statement that what is asked here would involve the companies in keeping special records on which the forfeiture notices would be based.  Again I suggest to him that is not any obstacle, because, obviously, they must keep records as to the number of weeks that a particular policy-holder is in arrears as well as of the exact amount due. Therefore, the records will always be <Col N="2140" /> available, and no special difficulties, I suggest, are likely to arise under the new section as regards serving the forfeiture notices.  While, as I have said, I prefer the section to the amendment, at the same time I would be much more strongly in favour of the section if I could induce the Minister to retain the obligation to serve the forfeiture notices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 135 deals with substantially the same point as amendment No. 133, except that Deputy Dockrell wants to insert a new section, as provided in amendment No. 133, and to delete sub-section (2) of the section.  In my opinion amendment No. 133 is not a substitute for sub-section (2) of the section.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that, from the standpoint of the policy-holder, the section would be much better if sub-section (2) were retained, and that there was grafted on to it an obligation to serve the 28 days' notice of intention to lapse on the policy-holder.  Amendment No. 133 without sub-section (2) would, I think, definitely weaken the section so far as the policy-holder is concerned, although Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Dillon when speaking in favour of the amendment used the language calculated to give the impression that they were desirous of serving the interests of policy-holders by moving amendment No. 133 and proposing to delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Morrissey's view that sub-section (2) has advantages, and that the whole section would have still more advantages if it were made obligatory on a company to serve a notice to lapse.  The Minister said that there were certain kinds of persons whose policies lapsed.  He seemed to indicate that the lapsing of these was inevitable and could not be avoided under any circumstances. There was the type of case where a person might be induced by a canvasser or collector to continue to pay premiums, but even the Minister was compelled to admit that if a canvasser's efforts tended in that direction they would be assisted by reason of the fact that the company had placed upon it an obligation to issue <Col N="2141" /> a lapse notice.  I submit that any action which tends to induce a policy-holder to continue to pay a premium is one which ought to be supported in this House, because everybody knows that in the past it is the lapsed policies that have contributed largely to the wealth of insurance companies. A number of insurance companies have been taken out of precarious financial positions by reason of lapses on an extensive scale.  It was the policy-holders who helped to rehabilitate those companies financially by reason of the losses suffered as a result of large-scale lapses.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that any steps which the Legislature may take to encourage policy-holders to continue to pay premiums on their policies is worth while, not merely in the interests of policy-holders but of the community at large.  It has to be remembered that the State itself has expense thrown on it when persons who were formerly policy-holders die in impecunious circumstances. In cases of destitution, resulting from such a course, the cost of burial and other expenses have often to be met out of State funds or out of the funds of local authorities.  Therefore, I say that every effort which the State makes to induce policy-holders to continue to pay premiums is one which the State is justified in taking so as to ensure that policy-holders will get what they originally arranged to have available for themselves under the contract, and in order that the State will not be asked to bear burdens which are almost certain to fall upon it in cases where policies are allowed to lapse.  I think there is a very strong case for imposing on a company or companies an obligation to issue lapse notices and in that way bring home to the policy-holder the possibility that the assurance which he thinks is available for him in certain eventualities will no longer be available unless he continues to pay his premium.  To that extent, I think the Legislature would be taking a positive step towards helping to reduce the number of lapsed policies.  I think also that the State and the community generally <Col N="2142" /> will benefit substantially, provided there is an obligation put on companies to serve a 28 days' lapse notice.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that such an obligation would cause administrative difficulties to the assurance companies.  It may cause them some difficulty to issue lapse notices, but assurance companies cannot be said to be people who are not able to overcome difficulties of that kind.  I do not think that whatever administrative difficulties might reside in the issuing of lapsing notices are insuperable and that an insurance company could not overcome the difficulties.  It is desirable that the policy-holder should have intimation conveyed to him by the company of the intention to lapse before the policy is allowed to lapse.  A provision of that kind would help to avoid the lapsing of many policies which, I am afraid, will lapse unnecessarily if the section is allowed to pass as it stands.  The Minister might bear in mind that many persons who allow their policies to lapse often contend that the collector did not call upon them and that they would have paid on such-and-such a date if the collector had called.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that sub-section (2) provides that the policy cannot lapse if due diligence, etc., is shown by the collector.  That is true; but there is very little value, in some cases, in giving persons a remedy of that kind because, being poor and having little or no resources, probably not being intellectually equipped for conducting a case against the company, many of these persons because of the difficulty which will confront them in sub-section (2), will not avail of the benefits which, in certain circumstances, are conveyed to policy-holders in that sub-section.  The fact that a lapsing notice is provided for will help to ensure that the policy-holder gets a very definite intimation of intention to lapse before the policy is lapsed. It is not at all clear that that would be conveyed to him in the same way merely by putting an obligation on the collector to collect and to display due diligence in the collection.  If the Minister does not agree to amendment <Col N="2143" /> No. 133, he might consent to meet the matter by accepting amendment No. 135, or the substance of that amendment, or any form of amendment which will impose on the company an obligation to notify the policy-holder of the intention to lapse before the lapsing takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton put very forcibly the advantages of requiring a forfeiture notice to be served.  As I understand the matter before the House, the question is whether policies should be forfeited by means of, or after the service of, a forfeiture notice, or whether they should be forfeited after the expiration of a period during which the company are under an obligation to endeavour to collect.  It is surely going much further, and perhaps making the whole system incapable of being worked out, if the two systems are to be worked together. I do not understand that the Minister would be prepared to impose on the company the liability, first of all, to serve a forfeiture notice, and also to allow the period of ten weeks to expire during which efforts were being made to collect.  The period of ten weeks, incidentally, is different from the period of 28 days provided for in the arrears notice suggested in amendment No. 133 and also in Deputy Norton's own amendment, No. 135.  Surely the interests of the policy-holders are best served by giving them explicit notice, as has been said by Deputy Norton, that unless within a period of 28 days, which after all is a very considerable period, they pay, the policy will be lapsed.  Surely it is far better that they should be given explicit notice of that kind than that the mere lapse of time, with the periodic attempts to collect made by the collector, should bring about automatic forfeiture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section the forfeiture notice goes, as I understand&mdash;there is to be none.  The collector is to call, though the section does not say so, week by week, or to make efforts to collect.  I do not think that in any other part of the Bill the standard of <Col N="2144" /> care or diligence to be used is indicated.  I do not know that in any part of the Bill it is arranged what the collector must do or what the company must do.  I do not know what it is considered by the Minister would be due diligence within the meaning of Section 61.  Suppose the collector calls to a house where the policy-holder resided and he finds the policy-holder has gone and left no address.  What does the Minister suggest are the obligations of that collector, or of the company?  Is the period of ten weeks to bring about automatic forfeiture if the collector simply calls week by week at that house, which is empty or in which no person has any knowledge of the policy-holder?  Where is he to seek him and what efforts is he to make?  It is obvious that the policy-holder is not going to be protected in such a case because the collector can say, &ldquo;I issued a policy to a particular person at a particular address; he is no longer there; I have called there every week for ten weeks&rdquo; and the policy is lapsed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>His position is the same, but if the notice goes to the address, the policy-holder has such rights as the contract gave him, if the letter can be forwarded to him by any person.  The service of the notice is something definite, whereas the standard of care required is left indefinite. There is another objection to the section, if I might refer to the section while dealing with the amendment, because they are really alternatives.  A period of two years is allowed to the policy-holder within which to pay up arrears of premiums and bring the policy into force again, subject, of course, to showing that due diligence was not shown in the efforts made to collect.  Is it considered by the Minister that it would be right that such forfeiture should be relieved against if the policy had matured?  Because, if so, it would seem that, in many cases, the policy might be allowed to run into arrears and within a period of two years, if the claim matured within that <Col N="2145" /> period and had not been met, it would be open to the policy-holder to come along and pay up the arrears of premiums and claim the amount, even though he may have had no <i>bona fide</i> intention to maintain the policy, taking the chance that the claim might fall due in the period.  If the claim does not fall due in the period he does not pay the premiums, but if he becomes entitled to a large sum, he pays up the arrears and, in effect, secures for himself something like two years' free insurance.  There is a difficulty I suggest raised by the automatic forfeiture on the expiration of the period.  I do not know whether I quite understand Section 62, because it would seem from Section 62 that, on the expiration of ten weeks from the payment of the last premium, due diligence having been used, the policy is necessarily forfeited, and that the company have practically no option but to allow the policy-holder to retain the benefit, if afterwards he comes along and pays up the premiums. Deputy Morrissey said, and I believe it to be the fact, that many companies allow their policy-holders a longer period than ten weeks.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have answered the difficulty I am raising, but it does seem to me that the policy-holder's interests will not be met if the freedom which is allowed now by companies to policy-holders is to be in any way restricted.  It is obvious that if a policy has been kept on foot for a great number of years a company would be slow to forfeit it merely because even ten weeks' premiums fell into arrear. They might allow a much longer period during which they might accept from the policy-holder payments on foot of his arrears.  They might recognise that his difficulty, because of unemployment or some other condition in keeping the premiums on foot, merited consideration and might allow a period of 15, 16 or 20 weeks or longer in which to make up his arrears.  On the other hand, if a policy has been taken out and premiums have only been paid for two, three or four weeks, it would perhaps be reasonable on the part of the company to be more severe in forfeiting that policy.  Does the Minister not think that by fixing this period of ten weeks he is serving the policy-holders badly by removing from the company power to give that consideration to their policy-holders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all is said and done, it comes back to this, as Deputy Norton has said, that the policy-holder cannot reasonably expect more than a definite intimation conveyed to him that within the period of 28 days, subject to payment of his arrears, his policy will go. There is no use in attempting to protect a policy-holder against himself. We are not dealing with the man who is falling into arrear by accident, but with the man who is falling into arrear because he cannot maintain the policy or does not wish to do so.  Surely he cannot expect more than that he should be given definite notice of a period of time in which he must make his position regular or let his policy go?  If the two systems are to be adopted, and an effort made to place them side by side, it will make for great difficulty in operation.  Neither of the amendments before the House can stand with the section, because, as <Col N="2147" /> I have pointed out, the periods allowed in them are substantially different.  Forfeiture is provided for in the case of the amendments in 28 days, while the present section allows a minimum of ten weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Lavery was speaking the Minister interjected by way of answer to this very debatable point as to when forfeiture arises, that the Bill only enables a company to make a forfeiture after a certain period.  I do not find that phrase anywhere in the section.  The Minister, I thought, was quoting; I thought I could put quotation marks around his phrase, that the Bill somewhere contained a phrase that after this period the company may forfeit. That is not the language of the section. The language of the section and of Section 62 is very definitely so phrased as to lead one to a conclusion opposite to that which the Minister draws.  Sub-section (1) of Section 61 says that no person who has effected a policy shall incur a forfeiture unless a premium is unpaid for not less than ten weeks.  The next sub-section says that where a policy of industrial assurance has become forfeited by reason of the non-payment of a premium payable, etc., and then sub-section (1) of Section 62 says that whenever a policy of industrial assurance becomes forfeited after a particular date by reason of the non-payment of a premium payable, etc.  I suggest to the Minister that the phraseology used leads to the conclusion that the forfeiture was to operate automatically after the ten weeks had expired.  If that is not the case, and if there is some other view to be expressed through this measure, some different language will have to be used.  Anybody reading this Bill and construing these phrases together would come to the conclusion that what was in Deputy Norton's mind, and, I think, in Deputy Lavery's mind, is the correct thought, that after ten weeks' non-payment the forfeiture automatically happens.  I gather from the Minister's phrase that that was not his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As between these opposing ideas, because undoubtedly they are <Col N="2148" /> opposed and cannot be worked together, of having a policy lapse because a premium has not been paid for a certain period, and not allowing a policy to lapse until notice of a precise nature is given to the person, I think the Minister ought to come down in favour of the proposal in the amendment, if he considers the reasons as stated in the variety of Commissions' reports for lapsing.  Both the Committee which examined this matter in this country about 1924 and the Committee which examined it in England in 1934 drew attention to the root evil, and that was what they called the pressure for increase that was thrown upon agents.  The Cohen Report does not reveal what would appear to outsiders to be such dubious practices in England as were, and may still be, common here. It simply says that there is undoubtedly a variety of ingenious methods operated upon the staffs by the companies themselves, and operated upon the policy-holder or potential policy-holder by the canvassers in order to get business.  In this country, it was stated that the practice had gone to this extent:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a general rule, the remuneration of the Collector consists, in part, of a fixed percentage of the contributions thus collected, and, in part, in the retention by him of the whole of the premiums he collects during the first 12, 14 or 16 weeks upon all new assurance which he has been instrumental in effecting&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>these being known as &ldquo;procuration fees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conclusion which the Committee drew from that practice was that after 12, 14 or 16 weeks had gone, there was not the same enthusiasm on the part of the collector to call back again.  There is also the interlocking in respect of inducing a policy-holder to change from one company to another.  They do not say that there is a practice of that type, but they do refer to what are called ingenious devices utilised by companies on their staffs, and by canvassers on the class to <Col N="2149" /> whom this type of insurance appeals. They say that the whole difficulty was due to what is called the pressure for increase, and, so far as I can read the Report, they recommend that as you could not rely on a canvasser to exercise the same diligence, there should be something substituted for that.  The Minister's sub-section (2) of Section 61 is an attempt to do that; in other words, it throws the liability on a company if it can be shown that due diligence was not exercised, but no standard is laid down and, in fact, it will be impossible to get a standard.  The notice is a precise thing, and it was recommended in the Report of the 1924 Committee in this country.  The recommendation was that it should be provided as a condition precedent to the forfeiture of a policy that notice should be given to the policy-holder, stating the amount due and the place where it was to be paid, and giving 28 days in which to pay.</P>
    <P>They refer to the other suggestion made, that a longer period of grace should be given, and they recommended against that on the ground that when dealing with people who are inclined to put everything off, you would probably only increase the number of lapsings.  If the Minister would read the Cohen Report and McCann Report here, he would find that a very big number of the lapsings occur almost immediately after the policy is taken out; in other words, it means that the enthusiasm of collectors&mdash;and it goes much deeper than that, but it is one reason for it&mdash;gets people to enter into uneconomic contracts which they are keen to drop after a little while.  Those people will not be saved, in any event, but there was another practice of a much more dubious nature alluded to in both reports.  It was, that, owing to the particular system on which canvassers or agents are paid, it sometimes became an economic proposition for a canvasser to put dummy people on the books, and to continue to pay small sums for them for a while, in order to get the bonus held out for acquiring new business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> They cannot be saved, but if you take the person who has been induced to make something in the way of a Savings Certificates type of contribution towards a later event, and who has kept on paying premiums on it, he does put off the ugly day of payment, and the only way he can be kept up to the mark is by frequent calling and the display of enthusiasm by the collector.</P>
    <P>The Cohen Report decided to try to limit the abuses by certain devices such as the question of the amount that might be spent on management. Whether that is going to be effective here or not I do not know, but it seems that, as between the two devices before us, recognising what the trouble is, and taking it that we are meeting one part of the trouble in regard to expenses, what is left over is surely to be met by bringing the matter directly to the notice of the individual concerned in a precise way than by putting it as an obligation on the company to see that their collectors will display due diligence in calling, the root evil being that they do not, and they cannot be expected to because frequently the terms of their employment preclude them.  They have to seek new business and have to leave some of these people on their own.  If there is to be a choice between the two, I suggest to the Minister that the Cohen Report, instead of favouring this, is definitely favourable to the other proposal, and the report that was brought here by the only body of people who had evidence publicly supplied to them &mdash;or, at least, after public notice had been served&mdash;by the companies and their agents and other people interested, recommended exactly what is proposed in the amendment, and I think the merits are entirely with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am afraid I do not take that view.  My opinion is that amendment No. 133 is, in principle, reconcilable with the principle contained in Section 62 and that it could be and should be made reconcilable with it in effect.  I think it will be admitted that we are all agreed on the principle of the free paid-up policy instead of the old system of lapse upon which the wealth of many of the companies was built.  The Industrial Assurance Committee in Great Britain reported to the effect that they regarded such machinery as is proposed in amendment No. 133 as unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it had given rise to endless disputes and litigation.  Can any remedy be evolved to meet the evil we seek to abate which will not leave it open to considerable dispute and litigation?  If you compare the precise and easily ascertainable procedure under amendment No. 133 with the vague requirements of sub-section (2) of Section 61, which is going to give rise to the greatest amount of litigation and dispute, is it not worth anybody's time to have a <Col N="2152" /> skeleton in the courts or the arbitrator's office on sub-section (2) of Section 61?  There never can be a settlement of any dispute without reference to the arbitrator or the courts if sub-section (2) of Section 61 stands, because every decision must be <i>ad hoc</i> on the facts stated, and there never can be a clear proof of compliance with the requirements of the statute governing the insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point to which I refer is this: we are bound to protect insured persons' interests effectively for the reasons already stated, but we are also bound, taking into consideration the fact that this Bill is partially designed to preserve the Irish insurance business, to safeguard the interests of the policy-holders' rights in this country by the most economical methods we can devise from the insurance companies' points of view, and we are bound to do so for this reason: that the great companies of Great Britain, with their enormous services, can bear burdens up to a point.  They could certainly carry these burdens for a protracted period and never feel them, even though they had made up their minds that, during that period, it was not economic to carry these burdens.  The Irish companies, on the other hand, cannot do that, and if we place a burden on the shoulders of the companies which makes the industrial assurance business uneconomic in this country, what is going to happen is that the big British companies, which are already doing substantially more than half the entire industrial assurance business of this country, will continue to carry whatever burden we put upon them until all the Irish companies collapse, and when the Irish companies collapse, the foreign insurance companies can then say to us: &ldquo;This burden must be taken off from us or we will wind up the entire industrial assurance business in this country and get out.&rdquo;  In my opinion, this House should not impose upon the Irish industrial assurance companies a system which is uneconomic, if they have at their disposal an alternative system to remedy the same evils&mdash;a system which carried the approval of the McCann Commission, of the Cohen Commission, and which <Col N="2153" /> carries manifest approval by the fact that it is operating still in Great Britain 13 years after it was first introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither do I think that we can seriously consider imposing upon the companies both sets of obligations.  Deputy Lavery spoke against that, and I think he was right; and, apart altogether from the difficulties which the imposition of both sets of obligations would create for the companies, there would be a considerable practical difficulty in doing so, because it seems to me that both things are based on different conceptions of the obligations of the companies.  We have at present, in theory, the position that the company is not bound to collect the premiums; that the obligation is upon the policy-holder to pay the premiums, and that, if he fails to pay the premiums under certain circumstances and after a certain period of time, the company can lapse his policy subject to this: that they send him notice that, if he does not pay up in a particular time and at a particular place the amount due by him, the policy is going to terminate.  The existing law in Great Britain provides that, under certain circumstances, the person whose policy has so lapsed becomes entitled to a free paid-up policy on making an application therefor and on certain conditions.  That is being maintained in the amendment. Apparently the contract between the company and the policy-holder is still conceived as one in which the company has no obligation to ensure that the policy-holder pays his premium by carrying out a collection of the premium. <Col N="2154" /> We still have the position by which the insurer is in the position that, if he wishes to keep his policy alive, he must himself take the necessary measures to see that his premium is paid, still having the provision that, if he fails to do so, the company can send notice of default requiring the payment of the premium within a certain time and at a certain place. You have still the position under which application for a free paid-up policy must be made by the insured person. We propose to get away from all this. We are putting it as part of the contract between the insurance company and the person that the company is going to collect the premiums by means of personal visits of the agent to the residence of the insured person. That is the first essential difference between the two positions.  That being so, it is no longer necessary, in our opinion, to provide the suggested obligation of giving notice of forfeiture. If a company fails to carry out that portion of the contract, it is the company which has failed and not the insured person, and the right of forfeiture under such circumstances is limited as provided by Section 61 (2). What is the need for sending this statutory notice of forfeiture if the agent is obliged to take all due measures to ensure that the premium is paid?  There are two classes of persons concerned &mdash; those who let policies lapse through carelessness, and those who let them lapse for other reasons, and who are not likely to be induced to revive them by personal calls by an agent or by the issuing of a notice by the company, the persons in the various categories I mentioned earlier.  Some of those may be induced to continue paying the premiums by personal influence exercised by the agent, but they are not going to be induced to do so by the mere receipt of a formal notice from the company.  I submit, from the point of view of the insured person, and in the new circumstances, having regard to the new terms of the contract between the insured persons and the company, it is better for them that the provisions in Section 61 should operate than the provisions <Col N="2155" /> suggested in the proposed amendment. It is also better for the companies, because the alternative to the adoption of the proposals described in the new circumstances is to place upon the companies a dual obligation, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of period has been mentioned. What is proposed in Section 61 and what is intended, is that there must be at least a period of ten weeks before a company can forfeit a policy. It is not proposed to provide that the company must do it at the end of that period.  What is provided is that a minimum period of ten weeks must elapse, and subsequent to that the company has the right to forfeit the policy subject to conditions which apply only in certain cases.  The present statutory period after which notice of forfeiture can be given is four weeks.  It is true that most of the companies allow arrears to accumulate for a much longer period, and it is unlikely that they will change their practice in consequence of Section 61. I think the ten weeks' minimum period is not unreasonable.  It is quite a long time, and if a person has allowed premiums to go into arrears for that period it is reasonable to assume that that person does not want to continue the policy or is unable to do so, unless the failure to pay premiums is in some way due to the fault of the insurance company, in which case the provisions of sub-section (2) of the section operate.  Taking the two provisions side by side, and examining them I think there is no doubt it is better for the insured person and the company that the proposal in Section 61 should stand unless we are prepared to get back to the system that we proposed to abolish, in which there is on the company no legal obligation to collect the premiums at all.  I do not think we should do that.  We should have on the company, as part of the terms of the contract, an obligation to collect the premiums, and if that obligation is there, the rest follows automatically and logically from the adoption of that provision, unless we are prepared to take the only other alternative, which I think is objectionable, of putting the dual obligation on <Col N="2156" /> the company.  That is unnecessary and would involve very considerable difficulties for the companies.  Deputy Norton may not object, but it might increase the cost of insurance and otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the persons who do that kind of insurance.</P>

Of course there is not.  We want to keep them doing this.  There is, in fact, no additional obligation put upon them by the dual responsibility.  The Minister talked as if making it a statutory obligation to collect the premiums was putting a new responsibility on the companies as well as additional expense.  It is merely giving statutory effect to what has been carried on by every insurance company engaged in this kind of business.  There would be no additional expense to the ordinary company engaged in industrial assurance.</P>

      <P>There are advantages for the policy-holder if the insurance company has to notify him of the intention to lapse the policy.  The practice of insurance companies in the past of issuing notices before lapsing policies has been advantageous to insured persons and policy-holders. As Deputy Morrissey stated, the Minister's whole speech on the subject has been an incitement to the companies to stop the issue of lapsed notices, because he talked of it as being a <Col N="2157" /> burden on the companies, something imposing a hardship on them, something that was going to swell administrative costs, and that the companies should not be asked to undertake that duty.  Of course, that is going to happen after the Minister's speech.  It might happen, without the Minister's speech, that the companies were going to take the view that there was no need to put this burden upon themselves. The Minister has given them a certificate that it is a burden, that it is costly, and that it will increase the cost of administration, and that the inconveniences are such that the companies will be justified in getting rid of this costly practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem so to me.  We have a position under the Bill that there is no statutory obligation on a company to issue a lapse notice.  During the discussion we got a certificate from the Minister that the practice of issuing such notices is expensive on the companies, that it is cumbersome and imposes a burden which sends up administrative costs, with the result, as the companies probably know, that there is a certain inconvenience about issuing these notices.  Possibly they realise that it might save the staffs a good deal of time if they had not to issue such notices.  Are they going to take the Minister's advice and to drop the issuing of lapse notices?  There is no obligation on them to issue notices under the Bill.  As the Minister says, some of them might continue, but as it is expensive, the companies are, of course, going to drop the issue of these notices.  It will be on the advice given by the Minister, in the speech just delivered, that they may decide to get rid of these notices because of the cost and inconvenience associated with them.  What I suspect will be the normal development following the passage of the Bill is that the lapse notice as such will go and the policy-holder will simply wait for a periodic visit from the canvasser or collector, and if the canvasser or collector <Col N="2158" /> cannot produce the necessary change of attitude in the defaulting policy-holder, then the policy lapses. I say that is facilitating the lapsing of policies.  The Minister should retain in this section a provision which will continue to impose on the companies the obligation to issue a lapse notice.  I do not think that the issuing of a lapse notice is in conflict with sub-section (1), because you could have the over-riding consideration of ten or 13 weeks lapsing period, and, at the same time, require that a person could not be affected even at the end of that period if the lapse notice had not been given by the company.  I think the Minister has positively weakened the position of the policy-holders, and is not checking effectively possible losses to policy-holders by discontinuing the provision requiring statutory notice of intention to lapse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief on this matter.  I cannot understand the Minister founding his argument on two points which may be a correct statement of law, but certainly is not a statement of the practice.  He sets two systems in opposition, one in which the obligation is on the insurer to see that the premium is paid.  That may be law, but every line of every report written on this matter for the last 12 years shows distinctly that whatever good arose under the industrial assurance system, comes from the fact that people are got by constant irritating nagging visits to pay the premium. Whatever the legal situation, the Minister can put it on one side. The practice was the call.  He further states that under his system it would be incumbent on the collector to call.  The defect revealed by the various Commissions which have inquired into this was not the failure to call but the failure to use the same persuasive methods after the first few months, as were first employed to get the individual to take on.  The matter of the collector calling was so much a commonplace that it became one of the stock jokes. We all know the jokes about the man from the Prudential, and the <Col N="2159" /> variety of domestic disputes for which he was supposed to be responsible. The Minister talks as if the courts are going to be able to decide easily in future on the complicated matter of what constitutes due diligence.  Due diligence has to be observed, and the Minister has turned his points about the obligation now put on the collector to call on that particular phrase.  In opposition to that you have the clear-cut system recommended by two Commissions&mdash;to send notice. There cannot be a great deal of dispute over that.  There may be a dispute about people who have left their former addresses.  That may happen in a small proportion of cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister also says, or appears to understand, that there is an incompatibility between some of the amendments and Section 62.  I cannot understand how he thinks that incompatibility arises.  Deputy Dockrell puts in the final phrase, that there shall not be an obligation on the company to issue a free paid-up policy except on the written request of the policy-holder.  The system in England under later legislation is that the obtaining of a free paid-up policy is on the application of the policy-holder. When does a person become entitled to it under the Minister's Bill?  Has there to be a notice of forfeiture issued, and is it only at the particular point fixed in the Bill&mdash;that that forfeiture notice cannot be issued until after ten weeks have elapsed? At what point does a person become entitled to this free paid-up policy? Must the company wait and possibly suffer in a great many cases the situation to which Deputy Lavery referred, in which people, who have no intention of paying on the policies, wait until a particular life falls in and then come along and put down money in order to draw a little more, and fall back on sub-section (2) by alleging that due diligence was not observed by the collector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the free paid-up policies are concerned, the amounts in the <Col N="2160" /> main are very small.  In the Commission's Report they did not think a great deal of the proposal when it was first mooted.  They said that in a great many cases whatever sum a person would be entitled to would be somewhere in the region of 5/- or 6/-, and that could not be cashed for a great number of years. Apart from the danger of the documents verifying title being lost, there was the fact that a person would get tired waiting on the chance of getting 6/- or 7/- afterwards.  The Minister, I think, can get over the objection that there is an incompatibility between the proposed amendments and Section 62.  There is none at all I believe between the Section and one of the amendments, amendment No. 135.  The Minister can disabuse his mind of any idea that there is any incompatibility between that amendment and Section 62. Think of the system there would be if there was no forfeiture until notice of arrears had been served.  On the happening of that event, Section 62 floats into line.  Surely, that is a good system.  It is not a system I imagine which the companies will be particularly keen on, because even although these 6/- and 7/- may not be of great benefit to people, it was the accumulation of such sums over the years, amounting to a million eventually, that formed the pickings for the companies in the old days. Suppose the Minister can get the two sections together, has he not a perfectly good situation&mdash;no lapsing until notice has been served, a certain time goes on and then on the happening of that&mdash;I am always assuming that Section 62 will disappear and that sub-section (1) of Section 61 will also disappear&mdash;the person becomes entitled to a free paid-up policy to whatever amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that amendments Nos. 133, 135, 136 and 137 go together, I shall raise my point.  Sub-section (2) operates to allow a person to pay a premium of 6d., or indeed 1d., under certain circumstances, and thereafter to allege in court that the agent did not exercise due diligence in collecting the subsequent premiums. After 23 months have elapsed and the person insured dies, the policy-holder can walk into the office of the insurance company, pay up the premiums outstanding, and collect the entire amount of the policy.  Surely there ought to be some restriction placed on that right similar to the restriction which operates in Section 62 in regard to the right of a policy-holder to a paid-up policy in the event of a lapse notice being served.  Surely a person who has paid only one premium ought not to be allowed to pay up arrears after two years and secure the entire amount of the policy, thus obtaining for himself two years' free insurance by paying one premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> I suggest that, instead of that, a restriction of time should be imposed and that, if the Minister stands on the ten weeks proposal contained in sub-section (2), the company should be entitled to lapse the policy, in accordance with the terms of Section 62, in ten weeks if two years' premiums have been paid; in eight weeks, if 18 months' premiums have been paid; in six weeks, if a year's premiums have been paid; in four weeks, if six months' premiums, or less, have been paid.  Otherwise, I think you are going to have a racket started whereby people will speculatively pay up 6d. in the same way in which they put it into a lottery, without the slightest intention of honestly entering into an insurance contract with the company, but having the hope that, at the end of two years, the contingency may fall in and they will put up a mighty good fight in the courts to be allowed to pay the arrears and collect the amount of the policy.  While it is right to keep a tight rein on the insurance companies, any practising barrister will tell you that the courts habitually interpret contracts of this kind in favour of the insured party and look with suspicion and extreme disfavour on any suggestion that insurance companies should be released from the letter of the bond.  They will accept any explanation from the insured parties if they are the aggrieved persons.  In that connection, if a widow comes forward and says that sub-section (2) was not complied with, that the collector did not search her out, that he came on a day or at a time when he knew she would not be in the house, the court would listen to that excuse sympathetically and the excuse would be accepted by the courts to prove that the fault for non-payment of premiums rested on the collector and not on the policy-holder.  That means that the policy-holder secures for a period of two years virtually free insurance.  I want justice done between all parties, but I do not want a ramp created or conditions imposed upon Irish insurance companies which will make it absolutely impossible for them, who had their origin and have spent their <Col N="2164" /> whole existence under stringent insurance legislation, to survive.</P>

      <P>I have not been able to relate the amendment suggested verbally by Deputy Dillon to the provisions of the sub-section but, if he puts it down for next Stage, I may have an opportunity of considering it. I do not quarrel with the Deputy's rendering of the section but I should like to point out that the insured person must not merely &ldquo;make a good fight&rdquo; in court to show that there was negligence, or failure to exercise due diligence, on the part of the agent of the company; he must prove that to the satisfaction of the court or, if the dispute is determined under Section 67, to the satisfaction of the Minister. Unless he proves that, there can be no action on this sub-section.  The period referred to in the sub-section is two years.  I am not committed to the term of two years.  I think it is a reasonable period but if somebody makes a case for increasing or decreasing that period, I am prepared to consider it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> The object of this amendment is to substitute 13 weeks for ten weeks. It is provided in the section, as it stands, that the policy will not be lapsed until the premium payable in respect of such policy is unpaid for not less than ten weeks after it becomes due.  The object of the amendment is to increase the ten weeks to 13 weeks.  I think the Minister is aware of the fact that many companies at present allow periods of grace up to 13 weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see whether it is or not.  In fact, some of the companies allow more than 13 weeks.  Now when you put in a Bill that the period of grace is only ten weeks I am afraid that many companies will be inclined to think that ten weeks is an extension of the present phenomenal maximum period so far as they are concerned and may be supposed to reduce the period of grace, in excess of ten weeks allowed at present, to ten weeks.  In that way the policy-holder may have his policy lapsed if his premium is unpaid for a period in excess of ten weeks.  I do not think it is a very onerous obligation on them to ask them to carry the policy for 13 weeks, particularly in the case of industrial assurance, where periodical employment makes it extremely difficult for people to pay assurance premiums.  Supposing a person in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit had a policy and suppose the Minister's Employment Period Order came into operation, say, on the 3rd June and there was no prospect of getting any more benefit until the Employment Period Order finished on the 27th October, you would have the position that the insured person would be unable to pay the premium for 26 weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that, too, if the Minister considers it more desirable. I think it would be very harsh if policies were allowed to lapse in that way.  In that case the fault would be not merely with the policy-holders, <Col N="2166" /> but with the Minister, who deprived them of their income.  Ten weeks is a particularly short period, having regard generally to the fact that the insurance companies are now being placed in a strengthened position by the State and they ought to be prepared to share the advantage of the strengthened position with the policy-holders.  It has been shown in the past that 13 weeks is not unreasonable. The insurance companies themselves by their action have shown that they think it is not unreasonable, and there is no reason why the period should not be extended now to 13 weeks.</P>

In the great majority of cases Section 61 will operate when the policy-holder allows his policy to run into arrears, and after such a period as the company will allow in the way of grace, or after such a period as the law fixes, the company will forfeit the policy.  If the policy-holder has rights under Section 62, that section will secure those rights for him.  In certain eventualities the provisions of Section 61, sub-section (2) will come into operation, but in almost every case there will be a dispute between the policy-holder and the company as to whether the section applies.  The dispute will be determined by the provisions of Section 67.  Possibly no question will arise under Section 61, sub-section (2), unless there is a claim. It is intended, if a claim should arise on the policy, that the company will <Col N="2169" /> be obliged to meet the claim if the person who effected the policy will revive it.  It is only after such circumstances that the matter will arise at all, because otherwise there would be no point in raising it.  It would be only an academic matter.  I do not want again to go over the various considerations I advanced against the provision recommended in the amendments in Deputy Norton's and Deputy Lynch's name.  I am not putting this section forward as perfect, or as likely to eliminate all disputes between the companies and their policy-holders, but it is our opinion, and we have given the matter considerable care, and, having due regard to all the facts, we believe that this will occasion fewer disputes, at any rate, than the provisions of the 1923 British Industrial Assurance Act.</P>

      <P>Will this ensure the object which is at the back of all insurance&mdash;that is, insurance proper? The Minister talks as if the avoidance of disputes was one of the desirable aims.  Possibly it is, but it is a minor aim.  Surely what one should aim at in any Bill of this type is to see that the primary object of insurance is achieved in the greatest number of cases.</P>

      <P>I know that, but <Col N="2170" /> let me point out that the committee that investigated this matter discovered that, in practice, that particular method had its defects.  The primary purpose is to get a person to continue paying over a particular period.  Does the Minister think that that will be better achieved by Section 61 (2) and by Section 62 rather than by the notice proposed here, and by Deputy Lynch, plus Section 62?  I always keep Section 62 as a bulwark, not as a primary object.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Section 62, the policy-holder becomes entitled to a free paid-up policy.

It will be in the interest of the company to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with what was stated, that it pays the company to allow a policy to lapse after a comparatively short period.  I think the evidence is to the contrary, that the expenses involved in the issuing of the policy and in the work associated therewith, during the preliminary period, plus the commission paid to agents, may outweigh the receipts of the company during that earlier period.  It is only after the policy is in operation for some time that the company derive benefit.</P>

It would mean that if shown to the satisfaction of the court that the agent of the company was &ldquo;negligent or failed to exercise due diligence,&rdquo; then the company would be obliged to allow the provisions of sub-section (2) to operate.

      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete the words &ldquo;two years,&rdquo; line 52, and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;one year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It appears to me that in one year a policy-holder should certainly have time enough to save himself from forfeiture of his policy.  He will have, roughly, 15 months from the time he stopped making payments in which to make up his mind in the matter of reviving the policy.  Two years appears to me to be rather a long period to allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that two years is an unduly long period to allow for the re-entry of cases coming within the sub-section.  It is a matter upon which, as I have already said, I had a certain openness of mind, but on consideration of the facts I consider that two years, as against a longer or a shorter period, seems reasonable.  Even if I were to be induced to make a change I would need to have very good reasons advanced for the change.  I think that two years is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>When you consider that the premium is payable weekly in the ordinary case, that the person insured is, presumably, reasonably, intelligent and has failed for 52 weekly periods to pay the premium, it must be admitted, I think, that he has had sufficient time to make sure as to what his responsibilities and his rights are.  I have already suggested that a period of two years gives a very long period during which a person, even without being fraudulently inclined, may have a free insurance.  A person may allow the period to run on and not pay the premium, and then find that it is to his or her advantage to pay the premium because the life falls in before the expiration of the period of two years.  If a person is under an <Col N="2174" /> obligation to pay a small weekly sum and for 52 weeks has not done so, it cannot be supposed that the policy-holder is not alive to the position, and has not had ample time to get in touch with the company through the medium of the post, even supposing the collector is not performing his duty, and has ceased to do so in this period of 52 weeks.  If he has so failed, there is always the post office to be availed of.  The address of the company will, no doubt, be within the knowledge of the policy-holder. It will be on the policy or on an insurance book or some other document in his possession, so that all he has to do is to write a letter to the company saying that he wants to pay his premium, and asking that the collector be sent out to collect it. Two years means that the companies must regard all policies as not definitely dead until that period is lapsed.  They must be kept on their books as being capable of being revived for that considerable time.  I would certainly suggest to the Minister, having regard to the small amounts involved, the small amount of the premium, the regularity with which it has to be paid, the short period within which it must be paid that one year, which is 52 times the length of time within which the premium should be paid, is surely ample.  Deputy Lynch suggests one year.  I think it might be made even shorter, but I certainly would suggest that one year is more than ample.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that a middle course should be pursued in this case. What we want, in lieu of the Minister's proviso, is some escalator provision. While two years does seem to be excessive when one contemplates all policies, I think I can satisfy Deputy Lynch that where a man had been paying industrial assurance premiums for thirty years two years would not be too long to give him the right to revive the policy if he were prevented from paying the premiums through some unforeseen and sudden hazard.  On the other hand, take the case of a man who has only paid two premiums amounting to about 6d.  It seems absurd that he should open a liability <Col N="2175" /> with an insurance company which cannot be effectively closed for two years. If we provide that a man who has only paid a small number of premiums will have a comparatively short period of grace, say three months for less than six premiums, six months for any person who has been paying in for six months or a year, 12 months for any person who has been paying between one year and 18 months, and two years for any person who has been paying more than two years, or something along these lines, I think we have arrived at a workable plan.  I submit to the Minister that it is an absolutely indefensible theory that by paying one premium of 3d. he can open a liability with an insurance company which the company cannot close definitely for two years.  It was on these lines I was arguing at an earlier stage when the Minister said he could not follow my proposal and that if I put down an amendment on the Report Stage he would consider it.  Perhaps the Minister now understands what I am getting at.  It would be interesting to know if an escalator proposal along the lines I suggest would be acceptable if proposed on the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that I have grasped the proposal, I like it less than when I heard it first.  In fact, I think a man who has been paying for 30 years regularly is much more likely to comment on the failure of the collector to call than the man who has been paying only for a week or two.  This section only operates where there is negligence on the part of the company, where the collector fails to call.  We are not dealing with the case of a man who has been paying for a long time and finds himself, through some misfortune, unable to pay his premiums, but with the case of a man whose failure to pay is due to the failure of the company to collect the premium. In these circumstances, I think there is little case to be made for the arrangement the Deputy suggests.  The longer a person has, in fact, been paying, the more likely he is to take immediate action if the company's collector fails to call upon him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for the <Col N="2176" /> argument advanced by Deputy Lavery for the shorter period.  There is, I think, a further argument, that after a period of two years there may be greater difficulty in producing rebutting evidence to meet the contention that the failure to pay the premium is due to the neglect of the collector.  If Deputies feel strongly on the point, I am prepared to reduce the period to one year, but not below one year.  I think one year is not unreasonable, while I think two years is all right.</P>

But the Minister and we are agreed upon this, that whatever are the relative merits of amendment No. 133 and his proposal, either would be better than a combination of the two.  The House will remember that the amendment of Deputy Norton proposed that we should have neither our proposal nor the Minister's, but the two, which we feel are incompatible, would not work together, and would make an ineffective, cumbersome and expensive instrument for carrying out the purpose which we both have in mind.</P>

    <P>(1)  Whenever a policy of industrial assurance becomes forfeited after the 31st day of December, 1936, by reason of the non-payment of a premium payable thereunder, the person entitled to such policy shall on such forfeiture become entitled to the free paid-up policy hereinafter mentioned and the industrial assurance company which issued such forfeited policy shall, subject to the provisions of this section, issue as soon as may be after such forfeiture to the person entitled to such policy a free paid-up policy assuring the payment, in accordance with the terms (other than payment of <Col N="2179" /> premiums) contained in such forfeited policy, of a sum calculated in accordance with the rules contained in the Third Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  The next preceding sub-section of this section shall not apply to a policy which is not an endowment or endowment assurance policy issued on the life of a child aged less than ten years unless, before such forfeiture occurs, premiums have been paid on such policy&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for not less than three years where such policy is issued after the commencement of this Part of this Act and assures the payment of money in connection with the death and funeral of a person other than the person effecting such policy and is either an endowment or endowment assurance policy or is a policy for the whole term of life, or</P>

    <P>I wonder how that phrase, &ldquo;as soon as may be,&rdquo; will be interpreted.  My suggestion is that you should make it definite and substitute for that phrase the words &ldquo;within 12 calendar months after the date of the forfeiture.&rdquo;  If the sub-section is allowed to stand, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; might be interpreted to mean in a fortnight, or in a month, and it would put the companies to the trouble of issuing a free paid-up policy.  Subsequently the policy-holder could come along and demand a cash surrender value for the policy.  If you give a reasonable time, as suggested <Col N="2180" /> in the amendment, before the free paid-up policy should be issued, you would obviate that, because if you allow 12 months to elapse, the likelihood is that the persons then would have made up their minds whether or not they required a cash surrender value instead of a free paid-up policy.</P>

      <P>The effect of the Deputy's proposal is to allow 12 months after forfeiture before the issue of a free paid-up policy should be issued.  The special intention of the section is that, in the case of lapsed policies to which this section applies, the free paid-up policy should be issued as soon as possible, and the interpretation of the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;; so that the policy-holder should be made aware of his rights.  In any event, I think it will help the Deputy to appreciate the significance of the wording of the section and the undesirability of the proposal in his amendment when I point out that free paid-up policy rights are inherent in the terms of the policy, and that those rights would not be voided by any failure to issue the free paid-up policy as soon as may be or as soon as possible.  I do not know if I have made that point clear to the Deputy. What I mean is, that the rights to the free paid-up policy are inherent in the terms of the policy and the policy-holder is not deprived of these rights by any failure or delay in issuing the free paid-up policy itself.  In these circumstances, such phrases as &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; or &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; are adequate, I think, to describe the obligations of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But does it place the obligation on the company to issue the policy within any particular period of time, such as, say, two months or three months?  My point is that the companies would have the double trouble, possibly, because the policy-holder might not have made up his mind as to whether he desired the cash surrender value or the free paid-up policy.</P>

      <P>This is really what I might call a fishing amendment.

The only model for this section is to be found in the Acts of Parliament controlling industrial assurance in Great Britain, and there the figures are fifteen, five, and five, respectively.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment is calculated to increase the range of policies under which the benefits would apply, and, while that would be, possibly, quite feasible for the strong companies in Great Britain, it would increase the strain that will be imposed by the section on the weaker native companies in our circumstances here.  On that account, I would not accept any amendment of the nature the Deputy proposes. Perhaps we will avoid the necessity for going further into the provisions of this section if I deal on this amendment with some of the general considerations affecting the section which may arise upon this or some other amendments.  The present legal position <Col N="2182" /> here is that there is no statutory requirement to give, on forfeiture, either free paid-up policies or cash surrender values.  The position here is now the same as it was in Great Britain before the 1923 Act was passed.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon has mentioned, that Act provided that, after 1928, companies carrying on industrial assurance in Great Britain were compelled, after forfeiture, to give a free policy after the policy had been five years in force, or after three years where the policy was an endowment of insurance for a term of not less than 25 years.  The present practice amongst the English companies is to give a free policy after the policy has been two years in force, and, in some cases, after it has been only one year in force.  Under the Bill the conditions are that a free policy is to be given, on forfeiture, after the policy has been three years in force, or after two years where the policy is an endowment assurance for less than 16 years. In our opinion these are quite proper provisions, and the interests of the policy-holders require that they should not be weakened.  It is true that these provisions will impose a strain upon native companies&mdash;upon weak companies generally, but our view is that it is undesirable that industrial assurance business should be carried on by weak companies at all, and consequently we have embodied conditions in the Bill which, we hope, will operate to eliminate weak companies by providing for their amalgamation into larger units, and the support of these larger units by various devices which will make them more efficient and economic and capable of meeting the obligations of this section and providing free policies without undue strain on their resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, of course, is proposing in this amendment to effect a change which would increase the strain, and I think, in all the circumstances, that is neither desirable nor necessary.  On the other hand, if there were a proposal to weaken the statutory requirements, I should also, in the interests of the policy-holders, be strongly opposed to it, and in any <Col N="2183" /> event I doubt if it would be of special advantage to the native companies, because stronger companies could take advantage of that position.  They certainly could take advantage of that position against the interests of the policy-holders, and, as I have frequently pointed out, our primary obligation with regard to insurance legislation is to protect the interests of policy-holders, particularly in regard to industrial assurance.  Under the Act of 1923, there was a certain period of five years before the free policy came into operation.  We have not provided for that here, but we have provided in the schedule a graduated period which gives free policies, on forfeiture, in 1937, if the policy is ten years in force, and then graduating it down.  With regard to policies issued after the commencement of the Act on the life of another for funeral expenses, the Bill as it stands at present provides that the full provision shall come into force in 1937.  I might be prepared to consider the alteration of that date. That date was inserted when the Bill was originally drafted, which was a considerable time ago, as the Bill is having a slow passage through the Dáil.  Consequently, the considerations which prompted the insertion of that date, as distinct from a later date, have become weakened, and I might be prepared to consider the postponement of that date to a somewhat later period.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to these policies effected on the life of another for funeral expenses in the way I have mentioned, we are not providing for the graduated period to which I have referred, because of the undesirable nature of that class of assurance, and a very large part of the industrial assurance policies issued in the Saorstat are in that class.  It is not possible&mdash;probably not even desirable&mdash;to prohibit persons taking out policies to provide for the funeral expenses of their relatives, but that form of assurance has many objections to it.  It diverts money that should be used to provide assurance on the life of the breadwinner, and it lends itself to abuses in the form of gambling upon the lives of relatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2184" /> However, if the companies wish to provide that form of policy, I think they can be reasonably required to submit themselves to the more stringent conditions that the section proposes. I have given this explanation of the general provisions which prompted the framing of the section in the form in which it appears, because it is desirable that Deputies should have it in mind when discussing the various amendments.  It did not arise on Deputy Dillon's amendment.  My sole objection to the Deputy's amendment is that it proposes to make the provisions of the Bill even more stringent than when we framed them, and they do undoubtedly impose a strain on Saorstát companies.  I do not think we should increase that strain. There is no particular reason for doing so, and in the interests of the policy-holders I would have to oppose also any amendment designed to reduce that stringency.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how my amendment is calculated to increase the burdens on Irish insurance companies, because sub-section (2) provides that there shall be a paid-up policy given in exchange for a forfeited policy.  But the section is said not to apply to a policy &ldquo;which is not an endowment or endowment assurance policy issued on the life of a child aged less than ten years.&rdquo;  I propose to exempt policies issued on the lives of children less than 15 years.</P>

In relation to that class of policy &ldquo;which is not an endowment or endowment assurance policy issued on the life of a child less than ten years&rdquo;, the policy-holder may if he desires get a free paid-up policy and obtain a cash surrender value.  I put these policies into that special category to give policy-holders in lieu of free paid-up policies a cash surrender value.  It is undesirable to increase the range of policies to which that provision applies.</P>

Perhaps the matter can be discussed. I would be strongly disinclined to accept any proposal to weaken the proposals of the Bill in relation to this matter.  In all the circumstances, three years appears to be a reasonable period.  Various provisions in the section were all fixed deliberately in view of the relevant factors, bearing in mind the obligations that exist to policy-holders on the one hand and the undesirability of being too onerous with weaker companies on the other hand.  Taking all the factors into account, we fixed on this period and I am very reluctant to consider an amendment to change it, because there are so many considerations to be borne in mind they might be overlooked in a discussion across the House.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (b), line 19, to delete the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does it not seem very hard that the Minister should jump the Irish companies down to two years in (b), and to three years in paragraph (a), while British companies which are restricted by statute are only restricted to five years?  They have slowly built themselves up to the position here that they can afford three years, two years or one year. It is common knowledge that the Irish companies cannot give as good terms as the Prudential, and they do not try.  When an Irish company goes canvassing for business, if the terms of the Prudential, the Pearl, or the Britannic are put up against them they have no answer.  It is common knowledge that the terms offered by these companies are better than an Irish company can offer.  Is it reasonable for an Irish Legislature to impose at one slap a much heavier burden on what are admittedly much smaller companies, a far more onerous burden than the great British companies have been asked to bear under the legislation passed in Britain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the British Legislature when framing its legislation had regard to practices operating in Great Britain, and we must have regard to the position here. In fact no British company is giving <Col N="2188" /> less favourable terms than are outlined here.  That is an element of the situation we must keep in mind. We are not imposing under this section the same obligations in all respects that the British Act imposed. We have modified the obligations in one or two respects to the advantage of Saorstát companies.  In other respects, the provisions are not as favourable as the 1923 Act would have been, but I think no Saorstát company except a company that is in such circumstances that the amalgamation provisions should be applied to it as quickly as possible, will have difficulty in carrying out its obligations under this section.  In any event, I advance the general principle that it is undesirable that industrial assurance should be carried on by a company that cannot bear this strain.  If there is a company which finds the strain too great, the sooner it comes under the amalgamation scheme and amalgamates with stronger units, the better, because otherwise we will be unable to maintain industrial assurance on the basis on which it should be kept in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Let us just consider how the British parties dealt with this.  In this country the situation in the year 1934 was that there were 21 groups engaged in this industrial business. Of these eight were companies and 13 were societies.  Nine of these groups were registered in the Free State and 12 were registered in Great Britain.  Two of these companies, or rather one company and one society, had over 50 per cent. of the business. In 1934 there were 16 companies and 153 societies operating in Great Britain.  The premium income exceeded £250,000 only in the case of ten of the companies and five of the societies.  In other words, ten of the companies and five of the societies did the substantial end of the business. Amongst the companies who did a substantial end of the business were two who used to give this concession after premiums were paid for one year. Most offices granted a free policy in the event of premiums being discontinued after two years.  That was a good practice, but I presume I may <Col N="2189" /> add the phrase in the report, that the practice of granting free policies after two years' payment of premiums was certainly a failure.  In this country we have one of the groups that granted this concession after a year.  Yet the British parties, when they were considering the matter, although they had this multitudinous number of societies, ten of them having a premium income of over £250,000 a year, nevertheless thought fit to slacken what was a good practice and only to impose a statutory obligation after payment had been made for five years.  In this country, although we have nothing in the same proportion going into the funds, and we have no information as to how the business is divided, it is proposed to grant this concession after three years.  We are imposing much more stringent regulations against a smaller number of people than the British thought fit to make against large companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have to go into further statistical information as to how the business is divided up to follow that up, but on the whole argument I am making here it does seem unnecessary, unless there is some better reason than has so far been given, to impose these burdens in this country on companies who have relatively less business to do.  The whole effect of this is to load the dice definitely in favour of the stronger companies, who happen to be the foreign companies.  There should be some case made out before imposing such burdens that there is a danger to be apprehended from not imposing the restrictions that are set out here.  It is obviously going to be a bit of a strain financially and it is going to affect the small companies much more than the others.  I think that point deserves some attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the sweepstake, I say it.  In respect to other classes of insurance than these, the provisions of the fourth schedule will operate.  As Deputies will see, they provide for ten years, where the forfeiture occurs in 1937, and that is gradually reduced to three years, where the forfeiture occurs in 1944 or any subsequent year.  That arrangement is, I think, better from the point of view of the companies than a fixed period of five years, and, as the classes of insurance dealt with are the most desirable classes of insurance business, that is a fact that I think must be taken into consideration.  In respect of (a) and (b) we are providing for three years in respect of that class of insurance where the policy is effected by one person on the life of another, where it is for the whole term of the life or is an endowment assurance policy exceeding 16 years.  We are providing for two years where it is an endowment insurance policy for a term of less than 16 years.  Having regard to the nature of the business and the general considerations which apply in relation to policy-holders, I do not think these periods are unduly short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must bear in mind that the big insurance companies do not give better terms because they love the colour of their clients' eyes.  They give better terms to beat their competitors.  Of course, the big companies are going to give better and better terms, but it is an entirely different thing for the Legislature to step in and state, as a minimum statutory limit, a period substantially less than that obtaining in Great Britain.  I take it when the British Legislature was considering this problem, they took into consideration the small provincial collecting societies scattered through Britain. They were better circumstanced than our Irish companies, who are collecting over a widely scattered country. <Col N="2191" /> The small societies in England are collecting over a very densely populated industrial area, and are much more advantageously placed than our companies are.  Still, the British Legislature thought it was not fair to ask them to come on to the standard of the Prudential, the Liver, the Pearl, or the other companies, with their immense reserves, and they had to leave a certain amount of leeway, depending on the fact that, in the ordinary course of affairs, the big companies, in searching for added business, would go on giving better terms and that the local people would have to depend on local patriotism, just as our companies are depending on local patriotism and extraneous conditions of that kind.  It is not fair to set a standard for our companies substantially higher than that being set for companies in Great Britain, and I do not see how the Minister can defend it.  It may be an ideal arrangement, or something at which we should legitimately aim, but, at this stage, to say that we can demand of the small Irish companies a higher standard of benefit for subscribers thereto than the British Government can demand from their provincial societies seems to me to be extravagant.</P>

      <P>The Cohen Committee recommended a period of two years in respect of all classes of insurance.  There is the further consideration that the 1923 Act introduced this principle into insurance legislation for the first time in these countries.  That fact was taken into account in determining the provisions of the Act.  Regard was had to the strain that would be imposed upon companies which had written policies before they became aware that this provision was likely to attach to them.  Consequently, there was in the British Act the provision that the whole thing would not operate for five years, so that companies would have adequate notice of the change and could make the necessary <Col N="2192" /> arrangements to meet it.  Here that consideration does not apply.</P>
      <P>The Irish companies, when they saw the change effected in British law in 1923, assumed that, at some stage, a similar change would be effected in the law here.  At any rate, we know that the committee which sat in 1924 recommended a similar change in the law here.  The companies had good reason to know some years ago that, when proposals for insurance legislation were brought before this House, they were likely to contain such a provision. I am sure it caused no surprise to them to find those provisions in the Bill.  The same situation, therefore, does not exist here which existed in Britain when the 1923 Act was introduced.</P>

They say that it is now the practice of most of the offices to grant a free policy in the event of premiums being discontinued after two years and an estimate prepared for them led them to the conclusion that the owners of the policies lapsing in each year pay in the aggregate not less than £1,000,000 in premiums in excess of the cost of the assurance cover which they receive.  After a further examination of that side of the matter, they say that this does not dispose of the matter.  As indicated, some companies, they say, grant a free policy if the payment of premiums is discontinued after one year and a life concession is made by the majority of the other offices after premiums have been paid for two years.  They describe this grant as a &ldquo;concession,&rdquo; because, under the Act of 1923, the statutory period after which a free policy must be issued is three or five years according to the type of assurance.  Then, they continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;But while the policy-owner in these cases is given a document representing, as a matter of arithmetic, <Col N="2193" /> a substantial proportion of the reserve accumulated out of his premiums, we are constrained to ask `what is its practical value to him?' After paying, say, 2d. a week for two years on a whole-life policy, effected on a life aged 40, the owner, on discontinuing his payment, will receive a free policy of 6/- or 7/- payable on the death of the life assured. Even if we disregard the probability of the loss or destruction of this `policy' during the many years which, on average, must elapse before it can be encashed, it is clear that an assurance of such an amount is of no real service to its owner. The free policy granted in compensation for premiums paid in the past on a discontinued policy can only be regarded as having a real value if its amount is fairly substantial.  In the great number of cases in which a free policy is issued on the discontinuance of premiums within a few years after the original policy is effected, its amount is necessarily trifling and the payer of the premiums is, for all practical purposes, no better off than if his policy had lapsed without consideration. From the point of view of the public, therefore, such policies must be grouped with those of actual lapse as representing a direct waste of economic effort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While they, also, on the other side of the Minister's argument, set their faces somewhat against insurances on the lives of others and, more particularly, make critical comment on the practice of insuring young children, their remarks seem to me to be vitiated by one consideration.  They make the point that people who go in for this type of insurance have not a great deal of money to effect insurance.  If the breadwinner referred to by the Minister insures his own life and then goes on, in some sort of gambling spirit, to insure the lives of other people, he has less for the proper type of insurance. But the human factor enters in.  Will the man who is prohibited by law from making this type of insurance on the life of a parent or somebody else pay 2d. or 3d. extra per week on his own life?  By no means, in this country.  If the Minister is driving against that <Col N="2194" /> particular tendency, he has no guarantee whatever that he is going to turn the tendency in a more desirable way.  Taking all the considerations, one with the other, into account, it seems to me that there will be an outstanding disadvantage if there is a statutory obligation imposed which will work unfairly against certain companies who are not, on the information gives to us, at the point where they should be discouraged any more than the heavier and stronger companies operating from outside.</P>

      <P>This class of insurance is objectionable from many points of view, and companies which desire to issue such policies should be prepared to accept more stringent conditions than would apply in the case of normal insurance policies.  The most stringent conditions imposed in this paragraph are not very much greater than those proposed by paragraph (c), but there should be greater stringency in the obligations attached to these policies. Of course, in respect to the other class of insurances with regard to the provision after 1944, it will be three years as well.</P>

      <P>I take it that this section is primarily designed to remedy the conditions, to which references were made last night, in which persons were fraudulently persuaded to transfer themselves from one company to another when in fact the operation was not a transfer at all, but the lapsing of one policy in the old company and the commencement of a new policy with another company.</P>

      <P>It obviously makes that transaction illegal if a person represents to the policy-holder that he is transferring the policy to a new company when in fact all he is doing is that he is persuading the policy-holder to lapse his policy and take out a new policy with another company.

      <P>The circumstances will be different in the future when free paid-up policies attach to lapsed policies.  That introduces a new element which will have a bearing upon the practice of industrial assurance here.  It would be perhaps unwise to forecast the changes which will be brought about, but this will considerably alter the position of insurance companies whenever an agent endeavours to induce the policy-holder to allow his policy to lapse and to take out a new policy with another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this submission&mdash;this is a bad section because it gives legislative recognition to what is in fact a fraudulent fiction.  There is no transfer.  There is the taking out of a new policy with another company and the lapsing of the old policy.  But the whole fact in this business has been <Col N="2196" /> that the collector went to an innocent person and said &ldquo;Let me transfer your policy to my company.&rdquo;  That connoted to the mind of the person who had the policy that he could carry over that policy to the new company&mdash; could carry it from one company to another, and that he would be credited by the new company with the amount that he paid to the other company over a number of years.  No such transaction can take place.  But if we indicate machinery to facilitate this operation which is described as a transfer, we strengthen the impression in the minds of people that it is a genuine transaction.  I would be very much inclined, in order to remedy the abuse, which seems to have no redeeming feature at all, to insert a provision to require the insurance company to notify any person who offers himself as a transferee that the operation of transfer is not practicable and that what they can offer is to issue him a new policy as from the date of receiving his notification if he desires to take out a policy with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; when the waiting period is over and the provisions are in full operation the situation would be that the policy-holder cannot be transferred as his policy remains in force as a free paid-up policy.  There is, however, some necessity to provide the earlier period during which the Bill will operate.  By 1944 it will be possible for the Government then in office to repeal the section and to substitute some less elaborate provisions as has been recommended in Great Britain.  However, this section will impede one company from poaching on another.</P>

      <P>Personally I am not so much concerned between the companies, as between one company and another, but when an attempt is made to carry through a transaction described as a &ldquo;transfer,&rdquo; instantly the policy-holder should be notified that this is a fraudulent representation and that there is no such thing as a transfer from one company to another.  The word &ldquo;transfer,&rdquo; is a misnomer.  I feel that this section is <Col N="2197" /> going to give legislative approval to that transaction as a transfer.  It is not a transfer at all.  Can anything be devised whereby if an agent attempts to carry through this operation he will be required explicitly to inform the policy-holder of the exact nature of the transaction, and to tell him that there is no such thing as an effective transfer in industrial assurance?  Why should we give legislative approval to such a transaction?</P>

      <P>I think it will, because all the insurance company has to do is to issue a new policy and to say nothing about transferring a policy&mdash; not to mention the other policy at all. The insurance company is not making a transfer, and all they are doing is issuing a new policy.  There is nothing in the Bill as it stands to prevent their issuing a new policy.</P>

Why should we provide machinery to make such a proceeding legal?  Why not go out frankly and say: &ldquo;We disapprove of the practice: we think it should be ended and if we recognise it by legislation at all, we will only recognise it to make it impossible for the transaction to be carried out&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say now that it may be necessary to define what the Legislature may describe as a transfer&mdash;to define if you like this transaction as a transfer and then to say: <Col N="2198" />&ldquo;It shall be obligatory under sub-section (3) to set out in large print that the operation of the transfer means that the policy has lapsed and that it is now proposed to take out a new policy.&rdquo;  Is not that what happens in every country?  I want that set out in black print as the first item of information to the policy-holder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want those words to be set out first.  The operation of transfer, into which the policy-holder is now invited to enter, in effect means that the policy-holder lapses the policy he at present holds and opens a new policy on the terms set out below with the second company. That is what actually happens, and I venture to say, on the strength of what Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Murphy said, that the vast majority of transferees do not realise that is what is happening.  Seeing we are going to define what the operation of the transfer is, and that a document will be served, surely the first information we should serve on the transferee is the exact nature of what he is doing? I suggest that should be set out in defined print for the special purpose of attracting the attention of the proposed transferee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that sub-section (3) is going to be the safeguard the Minister seems to think. We ought to face up to what usually happens.  The agent of a company may approach a policy-holder, who is paying into a certain company for any length of time you wish.  That policy-holder is appealed to on various grounds, very often on so-called patriotic grounds, to transfer from the foreign company to a home company. The policy-holder does not understand that it is not a transfer, that it means lapsing the old policy or the existing policy, leaving the foreign company in possession of whatever premiums have been paid, their responsibility to the policy-holder ended, and the taking out of a new policy with the other company.  We know that that has <Col N="2199" /> happened, and when policy-holders have been intelligent enough to ask certain questions as to what the position would be, they have been promised in many cases&mdash;this has happened and it is well known&mdash;immediate full benefit; that is, immediately the policy is issued by the company to which they are asked to transfer they are entitled to full benefit instead of waiting the usual period.  We know that in the great majority of cases, if a claim were to arise immediately or within a comparatively short time after the new policy had been taken out, the person would not get full benefit.</P>
      <P>Insurance agents working for a particular company, if they are working in a good district and are good agents, persons in a position to command business, are offered better terms.  They are approached by the representatives of another company and are offered better terms than they are getting from the company for which they are working; but it is an understood part of the contract that if the agent decides to transfer his services to the other company he will bring as much of the business as he possibly can with him.  It is only on that ground that he is offered the new employment.  I have a case in mind, a case that occurred ten or 12 years ago or more. The agent had a full-time appointment, salary plus commission, and he was earning what would be probably looked upon as a fairly good wage for an insurance agent.  He had a good book, between £13 and £14 a week, industrial business, to be collected.  He was offered by another company the same terms as he was receiving from the existing company to take up an open book without a single policy on it. When he asked questions he was told: &ldquo;Of course, we will expect you to bring as many as you possibly can of your existing clients.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3), in view of the blandishments and blarney of the agent, is not going to convey very much to the ordinary industrial policy-holder.  A considerable number of the people do not understand this business and they accept whatever the agent tells them and are prepared to sign on the dotted <Col N="2200" /> line without reading the policy or in any way examining it.  I would like the Minister to go as far as he can to prevent that.  I do not think this proposal in the Bill goes far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This merely provides that the transferred policy-holder will have an opportunity of comparing his existing policy with the new policy before he signs his consent to the transfer.  It is believed the granting of a free paid-up policy such as is provided for will make it impossible for a person to transfer.  He will let his policy lapse and he will get a free paid-up policy for a smaller sum instead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get this associated with reality in some way.  Section 63 will only apply where an assured person carries out what will be regarded as a transfer.  A transfer means substituting one for another, getting from one company to another, that being done in a way which will bring all the impact of Section 63 upon that individual.  Supposing an individual assured with one company decides on an inducement put up to him by the collector of another company to drop his policy in the first company and take out a new policy in the second, it is nowhere defined that that must be deemed to be a transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, in fact, what happens when the transfer occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no definition of a transfer.  Where a <Col N="2201" /> person paying to one company suddenly ceases and takes out a policy with another, there is no definition that that is deemed to be a transfer. Therefore, it is hard to see when Section 63 will operate.  The report from which we have been quoting drew attention definitely to this matter of transfers from one company to another. They say very much what the Minister is saying, that when the recent development of the free policy schemes matured there would be less possibility of what would be called a transfer happening.  But they went on, nevertheless, to say that although the application of a section of the 1923 Act had been materially limited and although they thought the section would become still more restricted, the section requires re-drafting to meet the new conditions.  They agreed with the Commissioner when he said that if an effort is made to induce a policy-owner to transfer from one office to another, the office in which he is assured is the best advocate of the reasons against transfer and, if they receive due notice of an intention to transfer, the matter may safely be left at that.  That, I think, is Deputy Morrissey's point.  We are deemed to be dealing with people of low grade intelligence who are going to be played upon by the agent, collector or the insurance company.</P>

      <P>If you are going to deal with transfers you have to see that the transfer section is made applicable to the circumstances it is intended to meet.  I do not think it does immediately tack on to those circumstances as it is drafted.  That may be met by a slight drafting amendment, but even supposing you have it regularised, the conditions here are that the policy-holder must be told and his consent must be got.  If a man believes that he is going into a better company than the one in which he has been, is it not better to ensure <Col N="2202" /> that somebody will put up the other side of the story to him?  He has already been solicited by an agent from No. 2 company, who has prevailed on him that his company offers better terms.  If, as the Cohen Committee recommended, it is made compulsory to send notice to the company with which the person was first insured, is it not better to do that than leave it to that company to make a case for their particular insurance continuing?

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think comment is necessary, and I will just put one point to the Minister with a view to showing that it is.  I want to submit to him that it is a point that requires to be more fully cleared up before this Bill gets a Second Reading and finally leaves this House.  This time last year there was a tax of 5/- a ton on coal coming into this country.  Over a normal year that tax of 5/- a ton would have brought in, approximately, £350,000 to the Minister for the Exchequer.  The price charged to bellmen from, say, March of last year to November of last year, during the whole period of which there was this tax of 5/- on coal, was 36/-.  The tax was taken off in the beginning of this year because of the burden which it was putting on the poorer classes of the community using coal.  In February of this year the Controller of Prices fixed a price at which the importers of coal were to sell coal to bellmen in the City of Dublin.  The price fixed has been running since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from statements that have been made to me by different people that there was some kind of reference in the broadcast recently that this fixed price would continue until October.  As I have said, from March to November of last year, when this tax of 5/- would bring £350,000 to the Revenue, bellmen were being charged 36/- a ton.  To-day, at the price fixed by the Controller of Prices and with the tax off, they are being charged 36/- a ton.  In spite of all that, the Minister says that no point arises that requires explanation.  I think that the Minister, in asking the House to confirm by an Act the Order which took the 5/- tax per ton off coal, should tell the House where that 5/- has gone which people who are buying coal are still paying.  They are paying the same price for coal <Col N="2204" /> to-day as they paid last year when a tax was in operation that should bring in £350,000 to the Revenue.  We want some explanation from the Minister as to where that £350,000 is to go this year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister admit that the House is placed in a difficulty by him when he asks us to confirm an Order which took a tax of 5/- per ton off coal, and when the House is now aware that under an order made by the Controller of Prices people are to-day paying the same price for coal as when that 5/- tax was on?  Does he admit that the House is in a difficulty when faced with that fact?  I am sure there is no Deputy in the House who will not admit it.  We want to know where that 5/- is going, and where the accumulated amount of £350,000 is going. If the Minister thinks that he is being put questions in connection with this Bill that he is not able to answer, then I suggest to him that he ought to withhold the further consideration of it until somebody comes into the House who is able to answer the questions that I am putting.</P>

      <P>I want to know where the 5/- is that used to go to the Treasury.  The Minister's own statements have indicated that if it continued to go to the Treasury the taxpayers of this country would be saved in another way.  The 5/- is still being paid.  Where is it going?  We ought to know where that money is going when the Minister asks us to pass a Bill taking off that tax.  I must leave it at that point for the moment.  The <Col N="2205" /> Minister, apparently, is making no offer to drop discussion on the Bill until somebody can attend here who will tell us something about it.  If somebody is not able to persuade the Minister to tell us where the money is going, we must wait until somebody attends who can tell us.  At any rate, the position is that by an order of the Controller of Prices people in the City of Dublin to-day are paying the very same price for coal which they paid during the summer of last year when this tax was on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dublin, Friday.  &mdash;Having received formal complaints regarding the price charged by Dublin coal merchants for bellmen's coal the Controller of Prices has investigated the matter and satisfied himself that a reasonable maximum price to bellmen for this class of coal would be 36/- per ton, a reduction of 1/- per ton on the maximum price <Col N="2206" /> hitherto prevailing in Dublin.  As a result of representations made by the Controller of Prices to the merchants concerned, they have agreed to reduce the price accordingly as from to-morrow.  The Controller has been informed that the other members of the Dublin coal trade have also agreed to the reduction.&rdquo;</P>

The Deputy, I suppose, will not feel hurt if I refer to him as an old Parliamentary hand.  I think he was one of the members of the Administration with Deputy McGilligan which helped to draft and to sponsor the Ministers and Secretaries Act in this House.  While, of course, Deputy Mulcahy might be forgiven for not knowing what are the functions of other Departments of Government than the one with which he was associated, Deputy McGilligan can hardly make the same plea in regard to this particular matter.  I indicated to the House that the Minister for Finance has no responsibility for the questions which Deputy Mulcahy raised.  All I say is that this 5/- per ton ought to be in the pockets of the taxpayers.  I do not know what purpose was behind Deputy Mulcahy's speech, except to endeavour to induce us to reimpose the 5/- duty.</P>

As I said, the job of the Minister for Finance is to be responsible to the House for the collection of the taxes which the House decides should be imposed, and for the due and proper expenditure of them.  My functions end at that.  I have come to the House and asked it to confirm an emergency order made by the Executive Council, remitting the Customs duty of 5/- per ton which was imposed on British coal.  The only question the House has to consider is whether it will or will not remit that duty.  No other question that has been raised in this debate is relevant. The Opposition, if they wish, can divide against this Bill, and can vote for the reimposition of the duty of 5/- per ton upon coal, but, if they do, I hope that in the course of the coming elections, we will not hear them on the hustings protesting against the burden of taxation.</P>

Again, I say that the only question that is relevant in this debate is whether or not this 5/- per ton Customs duty on British coal is going to be remitted.  We are asking the House to confirm this remission.  The Opposition can make their choice in the matter.  They can either decide that they will agree with the Government that it ought to be remitted or decide that it ought not to be remitted, that the 5/- should still be collected and come into the Exchequer, and, of course, naturally, that coal users will bear the additional burden thereby imposed.  That is the one thing that has to be decided in this debate, and all the other questions that have been raised by Deputy Mulcahy are, in my view, absolutely irrelevant.  I am perfectly certain that people outside this House who take often a more intelligent interest in it than those inside will appreciate that point, and will realise that Deputy Mulcahy is a person who has had experience of Ministerial functions and duties and responsibilities, and will say that, after all, he ought to have known better than to raise so irrelevant an issue in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, as its title indicates, is consequential on the abolition of Seanad Eireann.  The <Col N="2212" /> first section provides that all references to the Seanad shall cease to have effect, and also that references to members of the Seanad, or to the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Cathaorleach of the Seanad, shall cease to have effect.  Section 2 provides that every mention or reference contained in any Act of the Oireachtas to either House or to both Houses of the Oireachtas shall be construed and take effect as a mention or reference to Dáil Eireann. The second portion of that section provides also that, wherever in an Act of the Oireachtas it is required that anything should be done by both Houses or by either House of the Oireachtas, such thing may now be done by Dáil Eireann, and, furthermore, if and when done, it shall have the same effect as if done by both or either House of the Oireachtas as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The best-known example of the conditions under which this sub-section would operate is in connection with the well-known provision which appears in many Acts of the Oireachtas by which regulations made by the Minister are laid before each House, and within a period, generally of 21 days, if a resolution providing for the annulment of such Order is passed by either House, the Order shall cease to have effect.  If this section be passed into law, it will mean that in future regulations of that character will have to be brought before the Dáil and, unless annulled by resolution of the Dáil, will have full force and effect as if they had hitherto been passed, that is to say, had not been annulled by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other examples, such as the Control of Imports Act, which make this provision necessary.  Under the Control of Imports Act, 1934, it is provided that a quota order shall expire at the end of six months, unless, before the expiry of such period, a resolution is brought before either House of the Oireachtas in a manner similar to that in respect of regulations. If this section becomes law, it will suffice that any import order or amendment of an import order shall be brought before the Dáil.  The third section of the Bill deals with the Private <Col N="2213" /> Bill (Costs) Act, in which there are certain references to the Seanad. Section 3 and the First Schedule of the Bill provide for the consequential amendments necessary in this Private Bill (Costs) Act.  Deputies will see from this Schedule that the references to the Seanad are deleted.  Unless this amendment of the Private Bill (Costs) Act becomes law, there is danger that that Act would become inoperative and ineffective.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, wherever the Executive Council are of opinion that it is necessary, in consequence of the abolition of Seanad Eireann, that any general or specific modification or adaptation of any Act of the Oireachtas should be made, they shall have power to make by Order such modification or adaptation, whether the Act be public or private, and that the Order in question shall have the effect of making the modification or adaptation in question have full force and effect.  The second sub-section of Section 4 provides that any adaptation or modification of the Act made by order of the Executive Council shall not be contrary to or inconsistent with any adaptation or modification made by this Act.  The third sub-section of this section provides that the power of the Executive Council to make Orders for the adaptation and modification of Acts of the Oireachtas shall also extend to Orders or regulations made under such Acts.  This section is on the same principle as the Adaptation of Enactments Act of 1922, under which the Executive Council has been empowered to make adaptations from time to time to suit the altered conditions and altered needs of the Saorstát, and should it become necessary for the Executive Council to make an Order adapting any Act or any Order or regulation under such Act because of the abolition of the Seanad, then the Executive Council, under this section, will be empowered to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that that power of the Executive Council to adapt or modify Acts of the Oireachtas shall apply to private Acts as well as to public Acts and to any Order, regulation or other instrument made under any such Act.  Section 6 <Col N="2214" /> provides that the enactments referred to in the Second Schedule of this Bill shall be repealed.  These enactments deal very largely with electoral questions. For example, Part VII of the Electoral Act of 1923, which lays down regulations regarding the eligibility of certain people for election to Seanad Eireann, is dealt with.  The Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, is also dealt with to a similar extent dealing with the Seanad.  It also deals with the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, as well as with the Seanad Electoral Act, 1928, the Seanad By-elections Act, 1930, and the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1933. The object of the repeal, so far as it is effected in the Acts referred to, is to delete all references to Seanad Eireann.  These references, if continued, would simply mean that there would be nothing on which they would operate, and hence it is desired and is thought convenient that they should be repealed at the present juncture.  There is also a reference to the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1933, and it is considered suitable in connection with this Bill to amend a portion of that measure which deals with Seanad Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing this measure, read out and gave us a short description of each one of the sections of the Act as it is before us.  That has grown to be a practice with Ministers in recent times.  We get no information, in general, as regards the measure or as regards the reasons for the measure, and we are left then to infer, practically from the Title of the Bill, what is the reason for the introduction of this measure.  This measure is necessary in order to implement the policy of the Executive Council&mdash; a policy, as everybody knows, that was hastily conceived, carried out with very little delay, and ultimately passed, leaving a gap which it is proposed to fill up or otherwise to provide for by this measure.  There is one point about which the Minister would have been well advised to have taken the Dáil into his confidence, and that is that, as matters stand <Col N="2215" /> now, directly this Bill becomes law&mdash; and this is the last grip that this House has got in that connection&mdash; once this Bill passes into law the Ministry are at liberty, so long as they have a majority in this House, to do as they please.  When this Bill passes into law, we can be presented on any sitting day of the Dáil, so long as the notice is on the Order Paper, with the introduction of a Bill for its passage into law before night.</P>
      <P>That is not a very attractive proposal. It is quite possible that the Minister will say there is no such intention.  Whether the intention is there or not, it ought not to be there, practically inscribed in our Standing Orders or regulations, giving such power to a Ministry.  Having passed the abolition of the Seanad through this House, and now proceeding to clear up any of the debris that may have been left, the Minister would have been very well advised in an Act of this sort to make provision to deal with a situation such as I have described. He could have provided in this Act that in future a certain notice should be given in respect of each stage of a measure, allowing for due consideration by the people of the country of any Bill that is introduced here before it would pass into law. The Minister may urge in that connection that if the Dáil wants to pass a Bill why should it not have the power to do so?  If necessary, it could be provided for in the measure that a large majority of the House would be required.  When I speak of a majority in that case, I mean a majority of the whole House rather than a majority that would be composed of the majority Parties.  I mean a majority of the House, or two-thirds, or three-fourths, or five-sixths, or something of that sort.  All that would be required would be to provide for the crank&mdash;the person who would object under any circumstances to allowing a Bill to go through if it were required in a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that that sort of thing can be provided for now in the Standing Orders.  Yes, but they <Col N="2216" /> can be amended at any time.  He may say that you could alter or amend this Bill.  Yes, but at least a certain amount of time would elapse before that could be done, and the very fact of doing so would be an indication to the public that the intention was to rush measures through this House.  It is a bad headline to set in this country which is unaccastomed, except for a little over a decade, to the exercise of political responsibility.  It was bad enough to be setting these headlines even in our earlier years, and while the Ministry might have made a case that in the first year or two that they were in office they might require such powers, now, in their fourth or fifth year of office, they can make no such excuse.  In the first place, they did not come into office after a revolutionary period.  They were presented with the various institutions of the State already functioning, and they ought to have been able to make up their minds in regard to legislative proposals instead of trying to stampede the people by hasty methods such as this.  Accordingly, I think, not alone the debris should be cleared up, but some regular plan should be outlined to prevent abuses which will very rapidly creep in once the door is opened for them, and the door is left open by this measure.</P>
    <P>The other point to which I desire to direct attention is that here the Executive Council takes power to make Orders, and they content themselves with simply recording these Orders in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It is not a very big point, but now, with a single House, it means that we shall have these Orders being made without the opportunity to enter an objection to them, when we know that even now one must go almost salaaming to the Whips in order to get accommodation in the House for the discussion, not merely of an Order or a regulation, but of a positive motion.</P>
    <P>Until a week or two ago we had two Houses, and it was open to certain people to approach one of these Houses when objection was taken to any of these Orders.  There was there a forum or an opportunity for different bodies to get explanations, <Col N="2217" /> and if they were not given, the Orders could be annulled.  Now there is no such power except in one House, in which there is a well regimented majority.  It may not be always so, but whether it is or not, it is a blot upon the legislation of the State to have even that situation for a short period.  I think it is not a big point in connection with this Bill, having destroyed the second House of the Oireachtas.  Even if it has an absolutely free hand, the Ministry would be well advised to have as much publicity as possible in what is left of representative institutions, and to put their deliberate decisions before it.  The Bill is one which the Ministry requires in the circumstances of the case, and there will be no objection taken to it on that account.  That it has defects is apparent, and if they can be remedied, the Ministry will be well advised to consider doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question.  I have not the faintest hope that he will be able to answer me, but as this Bill is designed to sweep away the last vestige of the Seanad which exists in our institutions, and as we are engaged in the pious belief that we are to get something sometime from an inquiry to be set up, I want to know: Can anyone tell me are we going to have a Seanad or are we not?  I want to make a submission to the House that neither the Minister nor the docile Deputies on other seats, who are supposed to be members of the Labour Party, know that.  Nobody else does.  A lot of people might interpolate that President de Valera knows and that he will tell the country when it is good for it to know.  President de Valera does not know, and no one knows.  In six months' time, if he has a headache we will be told.  If he has a toothache or rheumatism, we may have no Seanad, but if he is in good humour or goes to the seaside, we may have a Seanad.  I consider that a country which has reached that stage of degradation, not to speak of a Party that is prepared to submit to be dragooned, and not to contemplate a Minister much less an Executive Council which submits <Col N="2218" /> to the public humiliation of being dragooned by one individual who masquerades as a democratic leader, speaks ill of democratic institutions. I hope out of the mess into which we have been led there will emerge a bicameral Oireachtas.  It is right that the country should realise the humiliating position into which it has been allowed to drift by the complacency of the dragooned and futile members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who are prepared to accept the position that they are prepared to go bleating into the Lobby on Monday for a unicameral system, and are prepared to go into it for a bicameral system on Tuesday; just to do what they are told.  I regard it as the greatest crime against this country for them to use the minds that God gave them, having no higher duty to the country or constituents than to ask an individual what they are to do, without bothering to consider the merits of the gravest question that could be put before them.  They meekly do that bidding from hour to hour.  I do not blame some of the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Possibly better could not be expected from them, but for a Minister, masquerading as a Minister, to allow himself to be driven into bringing a Bill of this kind before the House&mdash;being himself wholly unaware of what the policy of the Executive Council is&mdash;seems to me to be about the lowest depths to which a Minister of an Executive Council in this or any other country could sink publicly.</P>

      <P>I hope whatever thought strikes the Minister he will not let out of his mind when he comes to speak, because there should be some thought on this matter, something more than the mere reading of the clauses of the Bill.  Deputy Dillon put one point pungently.  Should not the title of the Bill be amended?  It has only certain provisions in consequence of the abolition of the Seanad as a constituent House.  What about dealing with the whole thing at one sweep.  Is not the Minister prepared even to consider the possibility, although his leader does consider it, that such might be the case?  The circumstances <Col N="2219" /> are undoubtedly peculiar. We took a vote for the abolition of Seanad Eireann as a constituent part of the Oireachtas, and we have a group of people meeting to try to put up proposals for a Seanad in the event of someone deciding that a Seanad is desirable.  It is to be noted at any rate that there has been associated with that committee certain people who will not be intrigued any longer into repudiating their own signatures. There is a committee gathered together with a see-saw type of mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be very many comparisons made of an odious type.  I think this is relevant when we have a Bill consequential on a measure that was passed for the abolition of the Seanad.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there is a body gathered together to make representations.  Of the matters referred to by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Cosgrave two are outstanding, in which the Executive Council takes power not merely to sweep away but remove all reference to Seanad Eireann as a constituent <Col N="2220" /> House and to give this special power&mdash; the terms are noteworthy:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Whenever the Executive Council are of opinion that, in consequence of the abolition of Seanad Eireann as a constituent House of the Legislature created by Article 12 of the Constitution, any general or specific adaptation of or modification in any Act (whether public or private) of the Oireachtas is necessary to enable such Act to have full force and effect, the Executive Council may, from time to time, by Order make all such general or specific adaptations of or modifications in any such Act as are in the opinion aforesaid necessary to enable such Act to have full force and effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing founds upon the view of the Executive Council that the modification has become necessary. We had in the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act a clause laying down that certain things had to be decided by the Executive Council itself before the duties could come into operation, and when we questioned later as to whether the Executive Council had met to decide these matters, we got the clear-cut statement that they had not even considered the point, that they had introduced the emergency duty and that had to be taken as covering everything that was supposed to be envisaged in the Act.  Here I have no doubt it will be urged that the fact of making a modification proves that the Executive Council considered it necessary.  If that is to be the situation surely, as Deputy Cosgrave stressed, notice should be given here. There are various types of Orders made, some of which do not come into effect until a formal resolution is passed approving of them, others of which come into effect but which may be annulled on an adverse vote of the House but still having force during the interval.  There is the other type of Order which we are told is purely of an administrative type, something in the nature of a minor regulation carrying out a well-known procedure. That is sometimes allowed to be done by Order without submission to the House.  Here we are to have Orders which may result in modifications of, <Col N="2221" /> or additions to, the statute law and the Government take upon themselves the right to make these modifications when they think they are necessary.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I desire to refer.  I do not know whether it is deliberate, or to retrieve the Attorney-General from the rather difficult position in which he placed himself here on a former occasion, but the Attorney-General is going to occupy a prominent position on the committee set up to-day, and he will have the task there, which he will find somewhat difficult, of disproving what he said in this House.  Under statutory provisions judges could only be removed from office in a particular way heretofore. That I take to be an operation which falls under sub-section (2) of the Bill, because the constitution is scheduled to an Act of the Oireachtas &mdash;requiring something to be done by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  When the Bill for the abolition of the Seanad was before the House, the view was put forward that, in future, judges could be removed by one House.  When that problem was before the Dáil, at an earlier stage, the Attorney-General had an ingenious device&mdash;to introduce into the resolution abolishing the Seanad or into the legislation which led to that resolution, a phrase that judges could not be removed from office until there was a vote of a certain majority of the House in favour of the removal.  It was pointed out to him that that was not going to be of very much effect, because that particular provision could be repealed by whatever bare majority the Government had in the House.  We had an addition to that, saying that no attempt should be made to repeal that section until a resolution had been passed by a certain majority of the House.  It was again pointed out to him that that would be of no effect, because that could be again repealed by a bare majority in the House.  He professed to believe that it could not.  He asserted vigorously in the House that the provision could not be touched by a bare majority, that it must have whatever fraction of a majority was required by the resolution.  What is the effect of this measure on that?  That explanation <Col N="2222" /> has been described by two or three authorities outside as something that no child for a moment could imagine, but he has asserted it here, with all the weight of whatever reputation he has in the House, that it is a good and binding provision and that an amendment can only be effected by the necessary four-sevenths majority.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with a later piece of legislation which in the ordinary course of events will override the earlier legislation.  This Bill states: &ldquo;Whenever any Act of the Oireachtas requires anything to be done by both Houses of the Oireachtas or either House of the Oireachtas, such thing may ... be done by Dáil Eireann and shall, if and when so done, have the same force and effect for the purposes of such Act as if done ... by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  It used to be that the judges could be removed only for stated reasons by a majority of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Is this really an attempt by the Government to put us where I think everybody then knew we were heading, despite what the Attorney-General said, notwithstanding the previous phrase?  I regard this as an amendment of the old provision that judges could only be removed by a vote of a majority of the Dáil and Seanad.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 will hereafter entitle a majority in this House to dismiss a judge.  The same thing will apply to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the provisions in the Constitution which are supposed to be protected.  It is possible that this may be a blunder caused through people walking into an area which they have not surveyed beforehand, but the effect may be what I have described.  I suggest to the Minister that if these Orders making adaptations and modifications of the statute law of the country, are to be made operative, they should not operate until they have gone through one or other of the processes I have described.  Surely, when we are making a new law by modification it should require an affirmative resolution of the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave when he was speaking raised a point that I think is one that should be openly discussed in the House, that is the question as to whether additional provisions should not be made to safeguard the privileges of the House generally in the matter of discussing legislation.  The matter will, no doubt, arise at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but it is one of such importance that it requires discussion, too, here in this House.  As has been pointed out, it is possible by the operation of a bare Government majority of one vote, to introduce any measure dealing with any aspect of the country's life in a very widespread and thorough way, the Bill being introduced one day, and passed through all its stages on the following day.  When we have reached the point that we are going to have a unicameral Legislature, for no matter how small a period, we require to look frankly at the situation.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the important matters we are dealing with here, there should be adequate time to appreciate the details of measures brought before the House.  Not only should Deputies have time to consider these matters, but Deputies should have time to consult the people of the country, and the people of the country should also have time to consider these matters.  It is, therefore, essential that a definite period should elapse between the circulation of a Bill and the Second Reading.  There should be a similar safeguard with regard to giving an adequate amount of time for the discussions that are likely to take place between the different stages of a Bill. I raise this matter at this point with a view to putting to the Ministry that some discussion by them of the principles on which they propose to act in the future would be of the greatest possible assistance to the House.  That is necessary if certain important things are to be decided in the proper way at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I, therefore, move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I was stating, in answer to the Minister's point, when we adjourned consideration of the Bill, that this matter had been investigated by the Cohen Committee in England. Though they do not say so, it is well known that the use of the word &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; is not really applicable to these cases at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens is that a person who is insured in one company ceases to insure in that company and goes off to another.  The recommendation of the Cohen Commission states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If an effort is made to induce a policy-owner to transfer from one office to another, the office in which he is assured is the best advocate of the reasons against his transferring, and if they receive due notice of an intention to transfer, the matter may sefely be left at that. We recommend that the present section be repealed and a new section substituted requiring a society or company when it receives a proposal for a policy, the premiums under which are to replace <Col N="2225" /> the premiums under a policy in another society or company, to send by post a written notice to the latter society or company within seven days of the signing of the proposal.  The notice, which should be in a prescribed form, should give particulars of the proposal and of the policy under which the payment of premiums has ceased, or is to cease, on the issue of the new policy.  It should be made an offence if notice is not duly given or a policy is issued within 14 days of the service of the notice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have, in all this, to remember that we are dealing with people who are not, because of their lack of education, either capable of paying, or are not sufficiently interested to pay, attention to the rather technical details of some of these forms.  We have to protect those people.  The alert and vigilant people will look after themselves.  The Minister's proposal is to make the man who has been insured in one company and who is going off to another company, sign a consent.  I suggest that that is not much good.  He has already been induced by the agent of the second company to make the transfer. Whether or not it is an accurate case, it must be a good case that has been made to him.  It is, at least, one which has persuaded him to make the change. Surely, the best way to balance the activities of the agent trying to get the man transferred is to put on the alert the agent of the company from which the insured person proposes to go. That is the proposal in the Cohen Report, and it is a far better proposal than the proposal here.  Make it requisite that notice be given by the proposed transferee company to the transferor company and leave them to get after the matter.  If the insured person, in the end, decides to transfer, he will have had the impact on him of two officials&mdash;one telling him that he is going into a far better land and the other telling him that he is far better off where he is.  He will get an intensive education in the actual points at issue and, if he makes his choice after that happening, it must be agreed that he has had far more freedom of choice, <Col N="2226" /> after knowledge, than he would have under the Minister's proposal.  The proposal in the Bill merely requires the man's signature which can be easily got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated already that I was not very much concerned whether we adopted the proposals set out in the Bill or the recommendations of the Cohen Committee.  We must remember, however, that the Cohen Committee was making a recommendation bearing upon conditions in Great Britain&mdash;conditions in which the provision set out in Section 63 of the Bill had been embodied in the existing law and had been there since 1923.  No transfers can take place there because the free paid-up policy provisions are in operation.  We are only effecting that change here.  When the free paid-up policy provisions are in full operation here there will be no such thing as a transfer because, when the policy lapses, the insured person will get a free paid-up policy for a certain amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I am disposed to think that we should have the more elaborate provisions set out in Section 63 in operation here.  The recommendation of the Cohen Committee was based on the contention that it was no longer necessary, in the circumstances in Great Britain, to have these more elaborate provisions and they suggested a simpler method of dealing with this problem.  There is no legal way of preventing a person lapsing his policy with one company and taking out a policy with another company.  What is desirable is that the advantages and disadvantages should be brought to his notice.  I think the section in the Bill is better than the proposal of the Cohen Committee but the balance of argument, I admit, is slight.  If there is any strong feeling that the Dáil should adopt the recommendation of the Cohen Committee rather than the proposal in the section, I shall be pre- <Col N="2227" /> pared to discuss the matter on the next Stage.  I feel, however, that it is better to keep these more elaborate provisions, for the present at all events.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the attitude of the companies to the section is at all.  We adopted this provision because some control in relation to these so-called &ldquo;transfers&rdquo; was necessary.  The provisions in the 1923 Act in Great Britain seem to meet the point to some extent, and we adopted practically the same provisions as they have in their statute in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>We cannot stop them, because they are not real transfers. The policy-holder in one company allows his policy in that company to lapse, and he pays the premiums to another company.  He gets a new policy in the other company in consideration of his premiums.  That is what is known as a transfer.  There is no legal way of ending it.  The change is made because of the representations, very often exaggerated representations, of the agent of another company. The policy-holder will lose by making the change, and it is found desirable to have some provision that the exact consequences of the change will be brought to his notice.  He should know what are the consequences to himself of these changes. Deputy Morrissey referred to the case where the agent transfers <Col N="2228" /> from one company to another and endeavours to bring all his clients with him.</P>

    <P>Whenever an industrial assurance company pays a claim arising under a policy of industrial assurance, such company shall send by prepaid ordinary post from its registered office in Saorstát Eireann to the person to whom such claim is paid a statement setting forth the gross amount payable in respect of such claim, the amounts of all deductions made from such gross amount, and such particulars of every such deduction as may be necessary to explain clearly the grounds on which such deduction was made and the manner in which the amount therof was calculated.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to insure that the policy-holder is quite well aware of what deductions are being made.  If the Minister can see his way to accept this he will be given the advantage of saving a certain amount of unnecessary detail.  I quite agree with the rest of the section.  Of course the policy-holder is quite well aware of what premiums are in arrears and he will understand the deductions for the arrears.</P>

It is important that the policy-holder should be informed from the head office of the company what amount he is to receive so that if the amount actually paid to him does not agree with the amount stated by the head office he can raise the matter with the head office.

It would be apparent to him on the face of this document that all that <Col N="2230" /> had been deducted from him were sums other than the premiums in arrears about which he knew himself.  Would the Minister consider putting in words in the notice to the effect that &ldquo;the amount of the deductions which do not include the arrears of premiums are as follows&rdquo;?

The section merely provides that where the company pays a claim, the company can send notice to the person to whom the claim is paid, set forth the gross amount to be paid, the amount of the various deductions, and particulars of the deductions, and explain clearly the grounds on which the deduction were made.  That is a clear definition, and it only complicates the notice to leave out of the deductions such matters as arrears of premium.

      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (2) the words &ldquo;and in every such case a statement of the nature of the claim shall be delivered to the other party to the dispute at least 14 clear days before the hearing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that where a dispute arises, the person who is claiming should serve a notice, which may be informal, on the other party to the dispute, setting forth the nature of his claim and the facts and submissions on which he grounds the claim, before the matter should be referred to the Minister. It is only right the other party should know what the alleged dispute is.  There may be many cases in which spurious disputes may be raised, but, taking it that the section is passed, I think only disputes of a <i>bona fide</i> character should be dealt with, and, before such a dispute becomes caught in the machinery of the section, the other party should have some idea what it is all about.  That is the object of the amendment, which provides that in every case a statement of the nature of the claim shall be delivered to the other party.</P>

      <P>I think that is what Deputy Dillon has in mind, but I think he has moved his amendment to the wrong sub-section.  It is probable most of the matters referred by the applicants to the Minister can be settled by correspondence with the parties concerned. It is only where an inquiry is necessary, under sub-section (5), and the inspector who is appointed for the purpose gives notice under paragraph (b) to the parties concerned, that any such question will arise.  If the Deputy were to move to insert in paragraph (b) an amendment to ensure that at least 14 days' notice will be given at that stage, then I think a case could be made for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At that stage it is desirable to keep the matter informal, because in this country, as was the experience in Great Britain, the great majority of disputes will be settled <Col N="2235" /> informally by way of correspondence without any of the procedure contemplated later.  It is only where a dispute cannot be settled in that way that an inspector will be appointed and that formal measures become necessary.  At that stage there might be a case for requiring a period to elapse after the serving of the notice before other action would follow.  I think that period should be provided in sub-section (5) (b) rather than in sub-section (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it might be put in both.  Let me speak on the amendment to the section to which it is at the moment related.  In order to get the point clear, sub-section (3) has to be looked at as well as sub-section (2).  The point in sub-section (2) is that if there is a dispute, before there is an application to the Circuit Court, both parties may agree in referring the matter to the Minister, and in certain circumstances either party may refer it to the Minister.  Once it has been referred, whether properly or not, once that step has been taken there cannot be a submission or an approach to the Circuit Court for the determination of that dispute.  Surely it is proper if one party is moving to refer the dispute to the Minister, and the right of approach to the court is then blocked from the point of view of the other party, that he should get notice of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So he will.  We will write to the party saying we got this complaint from the other party, and making proposals for resolving the dispute either by referring the party to a previous decision or the general practice or something of that kind.  In the great majority of cases informal effort to settle a dispute will be made, but it is only where that fails that the question of appointing an inspector, holding an inquiry and sending formal notice will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in touch with Deputy Dillon in relation to this amendment, but I am taking it on the words he has used.  He says &ldquo;in every such case a statement of the nature of the claim shall be delivered.&rdquo; Why is he precise in requiring a statement <Col N="2236" /> of the nature of the claim?  So that the party without whose assent the matter has been referred to the Minister may decide whether or not it falls inside the exceptions&mdash;that it does not come inside the exceptions which preclude it from going to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by way of an appeal instead of still keeping the matter informal.  If B gets notice he may say that the essence of the claim is such and such, and it is therefore outside the type of matter that may be referred to the Minister except by consent. B wants to go to the Circuit Court.  Why not permit that to be done still in the informal way?  Sub-section (5) may need this as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that in the majority of disputes a settlement will be effected in a couple of hours or a day or two, where it lends itself to the informal approach and, therefore, it is undesirable to have the 14 days requirement.  It is only where a settlement by these informal means cannot be secured that the rest of the section comes into operation and the matter gets out of the informal plane on to the formal plane.  At that point adequate notice to serve documents and so forth is undoubtedly called for.  I prefer to keep the preliminary stages entirely on an informal plane, and not to have any requirements that would postpone action for 14 days.</P>

If we cannot get the consent of both parties to a settlement, then we have to go ahead and carry out the inquiry.  The experience in Great Britain is that in the great majority of cases disputes lend themselves to this informal treatment and are settled in that way.  There should be nothing, I think, in the way of a fortnight's delay before attempting to secure it.</P>

Suddenly, he is met with the statement that the other party has forestalled him by sending the dispute to the Minister as being one inside the exceptions clause &mdash;and then sub-section (3) swings in.  In that case he may not go to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>May I make this suggestion. If you take out the words &ldquo;14 clear days before the hearing&rdquo; and substitute words which will result in one of the disputants getting a statement of the nature of the claim and notification that the matter has been referred to the Minister, that would meet my point.  A case such as this may arise.  An industrial company, or claimant, may refer the matter to the Circuit Court.  The other party forestalls him by referring it to the Minister.  The Minister would ordinarily notify the person who had intended to go to the Circuit Court that he must stay his hand pending the Minister's decision as to whether the Minister would take the matter under his own jurisdiction or not.  When the Minister has made up <Col N="2238" /> his mind to communicate to the second party, I would ask him to send a copy of the nature of the claim to the person whom he was staying from going to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>My suggestion was that I was prepared to consider the insertion of the 14 days requirement under paragraph (b) of sub-section (5).  When the matter in dispute has gone as far as that, it is on the formal plane, and notice of intention to each party is probably required, but at the earlier stage I think the Minister should be free to try to effect an informal settlement of the dispute by agreement between the parties as soon as possible. In the majority of cases it is probable that he would be able to get that.  It is only where he cannot get that agreement that a formal determination would be given.</P>

    <P>a matter that has arisen on a <Col N="2240" /> number of other Bills in connection with questions giving rise to the production of evidence, the weighing of evidence and of comparing the comparative value of statements made by claimants.  It has been deemed desirable to take such matters out of the hands of civil servants and to put them into the hands of persons with judicial experience.  This amendment was incorporated in the Pigs and Bacon Act when similar arbitrations were under consideration.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a desirable amendment to insert in this Bill.  It may be necessary to provide that the practising barrister conducting inquiries of this kind should have an assessor to assist him when matters in reference to actuarial calculations arise.  Otherwise, I think the amendment is all right.</P>

      <P>I think it is better to leave the Minister free in the selection of a suitable person.  I think he can be relied on to select the person who would be best able to determine the disputes coming up.  It may be that the most suitable person to deal with these matters would be somebody with experience in relation to insurance matters or the carrying on of an industrial assurance business, or a civil servant, an officer in the Department of Industry and Commerce, who had been dealing with these matters previously.  I think it is better to leave the Minister free.  I know it has been the practice in a number of Acts to put in a condition such as this, but I think that recently the tide has turned in the opposite direction.  I have noticed in a number of enactments passed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in other Parliaments that provisions of this kind in previous Acts are being repealed, and that a freer hand is being given to the Minister in each case.</P>

      <P>In certain circumstances this section says that the contesting parties can go to the Circuit Court. If one of them proposes to go to the Circuit Court and the other wants to go to arbitration, as the more expeditious and economical method of settling the dispute, he can stay the Circuit Court proceedings by referring the matter to the Minister.  I do not want to remove all judical atmosphere or judicial habit from the person who is going to decide this between the parties. Suppose you have a dispute between an industrial assurance company and a claimant, the company may have been in contact with the Department time and time again in the ordinary course of business.  Rightly or wrongly, they may feel that the officials of the Department are unfriendly to them owing to some dispute which may have been dragging on about another matter.  Suddenly a policy-holder precipitates this procedure upon them, and they have to go to arbitration, believing that the responsible official who is called upon to arbitrate goes into the arbitration with the preconceived notion that this is a slippery insurance company, or something of that kind.  The Minister must realise, if he is going to delegate the work to someone in his Department, that common gossip in the Department will be present in that person's mind.  If an insurance company has a good or a bad reputation, that must weigh in the mind of the person called upon to consider the respective claims of the policy-holder and the insurance company. If the insurance company has a reputation for high rectitude, the case would begin with the profound conviction in the mind of the assessor or arbitrator that there is no justice in the claim, because this company is a decent company and does not try to put quick ones over on the people.  If, on the other hand, the Department feels that this is a company that had to be watched or checked or rebuked in the past, the official deciding the claim will say: &ldquo;There must be something in it; this company has been giving trouble for years; it is very fortunate that we have a concrete case that we can go into.&rdquo;  I say that such considerations should not operate in the mind of the <Col N="2243" /> person called upon to arbitrate under this section.

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter I had intended putting a question upon in connection with the section.  I have an absolutely open mind on the subject. I repeat that I object to this section <i>in toto.</i>  Assuming the section goes through, and it will go through, I think the machinery set up should be the best possible.  I have no doubt that the Minister will, in his own interest, endeavour to get a person whom he thinks will do the job as well as it can be done, but if you consider the machinery set forth to determine these disputes you will find that the Minister is the final arbiter.  He is the person who decides, and decides on the report of the inspector.  The report will probably be in a document.  Possibly, although it is not stated in the Bill, that will be supplemented by an oral interview with the Minister.  It may, or it may not be.  At all events, the fact that the report is a good one or a bad one is of vital importance to the Minister to enable him to make up his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an inspector is hearing the parties on both sides, if he is a man who is not conversant with the ordinary practice in court where witnesses give evidence, he will not be able to tell whether a particular witness is or is not telling the truth.  Where a question of fact has to be determined, the <Col N="2245" /> Minister will not be able to determine that fact, because he will not be able to determine it from some document. The person who determines it is the person who sees the witness.  The inspector who investigates and makes the report will be under the obligation to make up his mind as between the two parties.  The Minister may reject that if he likes.  Under the section, he could ignore the whole thing and say: &ldquo;Although you believe A.B. I think, on reading your report, that you ought to have believed C.D.&rdquo;  That is still open to the Minister and it is one of the objections to the section; but for the purpose of my argument at the moment, what I am pressing on the Minister is that some person should be appointed who has had experience of determining questions of fact.  An advocate in the ordinary course of his day's work sees witnesses, cross-examines them and examines them; he hears judges giving their decisions and making up their minds as to which person is telling the truth, and in that way, merely as an advocate, he gains sufficient experience to enable himself to know with a very considerable amount of accuracy whether any given witness, whether he is for him or against him, is telling the truth.</P>
    <P>Most of these decisions will be either pure questions of law or questions of fact.  If they are pure questions of law, it makes precious little difference because they would probably go to the court, but if they are pure questions of fact, it is of most vital importance that people who are accustomed and trained to deal in facts should be in a position to sift the wheat from the chaff.  Trained people are better able to do that than untrained people, and even the best civil servant, in my view, as a practising barrister, has no proper qualifications for doing that.  He is hopeless at that, in my view, and I say that without any disrespect to any of the officials.  Even a barrister who has practised and has gone into a sheltered occupation in the Government service loses touch, loses his sense of the realities of life and of the realities of a case operating in court, and, mind you, there is a considerable difference between a case running in court and as it appears on paper.  While I am <Col N="2246" /> supporting this amendment of Deputy Dillon's, I am not doing it at all in the interests of my own profession.  The amount of money to be made out of this, from the point of view of my profession, would be absolutely negligible. I am doing it from the point of view of the interests of the parties who are forced to take up this method of determining disputes, and they ought to get the best possible method of having those disputes determined and the best people to determine them for them. It is in their interests that I am pressing this amendment.  I think a practising barrister whose daily duty is to deal with these questions of fact is the best person to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still of opinion that it is better to leave the Minister free of any such condition.  It is certain that he is going to get a person who has all the necessary qualifications. It is inconceivable that a Minister would entrust this work to somebody on whose recommendations he is not prepared to place the fullest possible reliance.  On the general question as to whether we could get persons other than barristers competent to do this work, I think we can.  Deputy Costello, I am sure, appreciates fully how far this kind of procedure has gone in relation to a number of matters.</P>

It is, perhaps, a tribute to the wisdom of the judgments given.  The procedure is precisely the same here. There very frequently is, and, in fact, in every case I think there must be, an inquiry.  An officer interviews the parties, hears evidence, and very <Col N="2247" /> often the evidence of the parties is in very violent conflict, as to the nature of the work a particular person had to do, and particularly whether it was agricultural work or partly some other class of work.

That will arise in relation to this Act at some stage, too, and simplify the procedure, but I do not think that any difficulties have arisen, and I am sure there are other Acts in respect of which the same procedure is in operation.  The limitation of the Minister's power to the selection of a person who is a practising barrister is, I think, undesirable, although, in fact, the person appointed may come within that description.</P>

      <P>But surely the effect of this will be that, if the Minister does not have a trained legal investigator, the unfortunate legal adviser in his Department, who, to my own certain knowledge, is over burdened with work, will have an additional burden placed upon him, because he will be constantly consulted, both by the inspector, probably during the course of the investigation, and certainly by the Minister, when the report comes in and before he reaches his decision. I think the Minister will probably find that he will have to increase his legal adviser's staff and the staff of the Attorney-General's Department, but certainly he will have to get legal advice from his own legal adviser and the Attorney-General's Department <Col N="2248" /> on practically 99 per cent. of the cases that arise under this section.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, under the circumstances, it would not leave very much of it, but if the Minister were inclined to accept my last amendment, suggesting that arbitration should be conducted by a barrister of five years' standing, I would have no scruple about withdrawing this amendment. In the existing circumstances, when I do not know who is going to be the arbitrator, or what the nature of the arbitration is going to be, because that will largely depend on the personality of the person conducting it, I feel that there ought to be an appeal <Col N="2249" /> to a court of law, so that a judicial person may have the facts and the law in any case where one of the parties thinks it necessary to appeal from the decision of the arbitrator.</P>

The range of cases where a dispute can be referred by one party is limited.  If it is referred by both parties, it is evident that they are willing to accept the Minister's decision on the facts as final.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider between now and Report Stage changing the actual wording of this sub-section?  The provisions as they stand at the moment are that the Minister shall, at the request of any party to such dispute, refer any question of law arising in such dispute, etc.  I suggest that he should insert there that an appeal should lie from the decision on a question of law.  If the sub-section stands, I can see that there will be a considerable amount of wrangling as to what is and what is not a question of law.  One party to the dispute will ask the Minister to refer that to the court.  The Minister will say, having consulted his legal advisers, already overburdened, as I have said: &ldquo;Is this a question in law which I am bound to determine or send forward?&rdquo; and there will be a considerable amount of trouble and worry to all parties, whereas, if the suggestion I make is adopted, it would be left to the court to decide whether a particular thing brought to the court is or is not a question of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not want to make that too easy.  The whole purpose of the section is to give the type of person who does industrial assurance <Col N="2250" /> an opportunity of getting a determination of any dispute that may arise between him and his company, without being intimidated by the possibility of costs arising on appeal altogether out of proportion to the value of the policy.  Therefore, I think we should have the wording of this sub-section so cast that an appeal will not take place unless there is genuine ground for it; in other words, that the principle of appeal will not be used by insurance companies merely to intimidate policy-holders from availing of the section by involving the first applicants under the section in undue costs.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>(8)  Whenever the Minister orders under this section any costs and expenses incurred by one person to be paid by another person, such costs and expenses shall be taxed and ascertained by a taxing-master of the High Court on the requisition of either the person to whom or the person by whom such costs and expenses were so ordered to be paid, and the amount of such costs and expenses, when so taxed and ascertained, shall be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction by the person to whom such costs and expenses were so ordered to be paid.</P>

      <P>I think this is a very good amendment. To be sending these cases to the Master of the High Court to be taxed when neither party wants to go there, and when both parties are prepared to accept the Minister's taxation of the costs, would seem to be a peculiar idea, and I think that this amendment is a very sensible suggestion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of sub-section (9) to add <Col N="2252" /> the words &ldquo;provided that no fee so prescribed shall exceed the following scale:&mdash;Where the claim does not exceed £10, 5/-; where the claim does not exceed £25, 10/-; where the claim does not exceed £50, 20/-, with an additional sum of 10/- for every additional £50 or part thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the sub-section referring to the payment of fees, and the amendment provides that no fee prescribed shall exceed the scale which is set out in the amendment.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is better not to fix the amount of fees in the Bill.  It may be found necessary from time to time, in altered circumstances, to vary the amount of the fees, and it is better to leave it as it is in sub-section (9) so as to avoid the necessity for future legislation on that point.  The sub-section is set out in the usual form, and says that the fee shall be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this section with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  If the Deputy fears that this section will be used for the purpose of getting unduly large fees, he can be reassured on that point, because any attempt to do so would defeat the whole purpose of the section.</P>

      <P>Speaking personally of what will happen, people will come to me and tell me the facts and ask what they ought to do.  In certain circumstances, I may advise them that the best thing to do is to take out an insurance policy and to pay 6d. a week so that they will have a nest-egg to meet contingencies when they arise. If I tell them they had better see So-and-so, ordinarily I would name a certain insurance company.  That would amount to an inducement to take out an insurance policy, and it seems from this sub-section that it would make me liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £10.  If that is so I object most strenuously to the section.</P>

If they are agents of the company there are other means of dealing with them.  It is quite clear that the provisions of the section will not operate to render liable to a penalty a person who gives friendly advice.

      <P>Let us take this case. I live in a small country town in which there are three insurance agents for three different companies.  A neighbour of mine is approached by the three agents and that neighbour comes in to me and says: &ldquo;I am bothered by Pat So-and-so, Tom So-and-so and Jim So-and-so, to take out an insurance policy with them.  What should I do?&rdquo; I say to him: &ldquo;If I were you I would take out a policy with Jim So-and-so.  He represents the best company and you should deal with him.  If I were taking out a policy I would take it for so much and I would advise you to deal with Jim.&rdquo;  In my opinion that advice renders me liable to prosecution for having procured a person to enter into a contract of industrial assurance.</P>

I wish to make a few remarks in regard to it, and <Col N="2262" /> perhaps if they are not in order on this section, you, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, will call me to order.  This is a very controversial section.  I take it that the ideal solution of this reinsurance problem would be that all the companies should join together.  I think that the Minister has said so himself. I understood that certain proposals were made to the Minister.  Perhaps if the Minister could tell us before we start to debate the section, how far any proposals have been made, and whether they met with his approval or not, it would save time.  I take it that it is agreed by everybody that if there could be some form of agreed measure, under which all the insurance companies would join together, it would be the ideal solution.</P>

Certainly I took it from his remarks that the door is not yet closed on proposals and I wish to know if the proposals are still being considered.  I do not wish to press him to make any statement if he does not feel in a position to do so, but I take it from his remarks that the door is not yet shut on that solution of the matter.  I suppose there is nothing left to us but to go on with Part VI.  I take it from his remarks that the matter is at the moment under consideration, but perhaps I should not ask him to say anything more on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister going to give us any further statement on this general question of reinsurance?  So far as my information goes, the power to establish a reinsurance corporation ought not to be granted to him at all.  I am informed that Part VI of the Bill is completely unworkable and futile.  So far as I am aware, the whole principle of reinsurance depends upon a system of reinsurance treaties.  The foundation upon which a reinsurance treaty stands is that the moment any given company signs a cover note, the stipulated percentage of the risk is simultaneously covered by the parties to the reinsurance treaty.  Unless that were so, an insurance company taking a risk for £100,000 and intending to distribute 80 per cent. of that risk &mdash; which might be assumed to be the fair average of the distribution of fire and accident risks&mdash;if they had to wait to negotiate an <i>ad hoc</i> treaty for that risk might encounter a catastrophe. Disaster might overtake them in respect of a risk which was quite beyond their capacity to bear before they had time to pass on the four-fifths of the risk which they intended to dispose of.  For that reason. the treaty system has been adopted by all insurance companies.  A company knows, the moment a cover note is issued to secure a person in respect of fire or accident risk, that the liability of the reinsurers is opened to the share of that risk that it has been previously agreed to pass on.  Under Part VI of the Bill, the proposal is that the Minister shall establish the Reinsurance Company of Ireland and that every Irish company should then be obliged to open negotiations with the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may, but, on the question whether this reinsurance corporation should be set up at all or not, I <Col N="2265" /> make the case that certain facts emerge which make it undesirable that it should be set up.  I say that the lines on which the Minister proposes to run this corporation strike at the whole basis on which treaty reinsurance is run.  The foundation of treaty reinsurance is that, at the beginning of the treaty period you know that, in respect of every risk you take, the treaty amount of the risk will be taken up by the reinsurance companies.  The moment you introduce an element enabling any one of the parties to the reinsurance treaty to say, in respect of a given risk: &ldquo;We revoke our undertaking and will not take the treaty-agreed share of that risk unless you are prepared to undertake further commitments,&rdquo; then the whole foundation upon which treaty reinsurance is built collapses.  The very essence of that arrangement is that, at the moment of the writing of the cover note, the reinsurance is effected, even though the party taking the reinsurance knows nothing of the nature of the original risk.</P>
      <P>I object to the establishment of this corporation, further, on the ground that a later section provides that every contract of reinsurance shall be guaranteed by the Government but it will be open to nobody to sue the Government to recover the amount of the guarantee.  Since the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; was first incorporated in the English language was there ever a guarantee of that character?  &ldquo;I will guarantee to pay you something but I make the proviso that you must not ask me to fulfil my guarantee.&rdquo;  The use of the words in such a context makes the English language meaningless.  I heard no indication from the Minister of the ground on which he defends these proposals and unless and until the Minister is in a position to give us some information on these fundamental objections to the establishment of a reinsurance corporation, I do not see how he can ask the House to vote for the establishment of the corporation at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's objections to the proposal are based on a complete misconception of the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill is intended to provide, and does in fact provide, <Col N="2266" /> that the reinsurance company will transact its business on ordinary commercial lines&mdash;as reinsurance business is transacted by other companies, that is, not by accepting separate risks but by making comprehensive treaties with insurance companies.  The provisions of Section 84 in that respect are quite clear.  They state that&mdash;</P>
      <P>every assurance company which effects assurance business ... in Saorstát Eireann shall enter into an agreement&mdash;</P>
      <P>these are the words the meaning of which Deputy Dillon does not understand&mdash;</P>
      <P>with the company whereby such assurance company agrees that, if and so far as it reinsures its assurance business ... it will reinsure with the company, but subject to the qualification that the company may, in the case of any particular risk, refuse to accept the reinsurance thereof unless such assurance company retains such portion of such risk as the company shall direct.</P>

      <P>160.  To delete all words from the word &ldquo;but,&rdquo; line 36, to and including the word &ldquo;direct,&rdquo; line 39, at the end of the section and substitute the words &ldquo;33? per cent. of every risk which it underwrites.&mdash;(Seamus A. Bourke.)</P>
      <P>Section 84 seems to me to make it obligatory on the insurance company to reinsure with the reinsurance corporation. At the same time, it gives that corporation power, if it so desires, to select the portion of the risk which, in each case, it will take.  A provision of that kind would, in my opinion, make it impossible to continue any reinsurance treaties.  In fact, it would create havoc in the whole reinsurance business of the country.  To my mind, it reverses the whole idea at the back of reinsurance, because it enables the reinsurance company to decide what portion of the risk it will take rather than give the original company the liberty of deciding what portion of the risk it will lay off.  It is really putting the insurance company in the position of being a reinsurance company for the reinsurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every insurance company has its own books to balance.  It is, in that respect, more or less in the position of a bookmaker.  Every bookmaker has to balance his books.  If he finds he has too much money on a particular horse, he has to lay that money off with another bookmaker.  If this Government, which seems to be travelling rapidly in that direction, ever arrive at the stage where they are going to make it compulsory for all the bookmakers in Ireland to lay off their bets with one particular bookmaker and, at the same time, gives that bookmaker the liberty to decide what portion of the risk in any particular case he will take, then we will have the betting business pretty much on a level with the reinsurance business. If a particular bookmaker finds he has £1,000 on the favourite more than he can carry, he goes to the official Government bookmaker to lay off the £1,000 and he is told he can lay off only £200 and carry the remainder of the risk himself. <Col N="2272" /> Another bookmaker may have £500 too much on an outsider and he attempts to lay it off and is told he can lay off only £100.  That is the type of position the insurance companies will be placed in under this section.</P>
    <P>Every company has to act according to its own books.  In one case, a company may be prepared to retain 80 per cent. or 99 per cent. or, in some cases, 100 per cent. of the risk and in another case they may not be anxious to retain more than 5 per cent.  There are cases where the risk is exceptionally great and from a general standpoint the company is forced to lay off the bulk of it. Even in the case of acquiring business from one particular firm, the business of that firm is often divided into a great many lines.  Take the case of the Great Southern Railways Company. The insurance company getting that business would probably have over 100 different lines.  In one particular line, such as labourers' cottages, the company would be prepared to take all that risk.  In the case of other lines it would not set out to take any more than 5 or 10 per cent. and it wants some insurance institution which will enable it to lay off the particular risk that it is not suitable to retain. If it is not given those facilities the company cannot carry on.  If that company is compelled to go to the official reinsurance company first of all and allow that company to pick and choose what it desires to take, then it is unreasonable to expect that they will be able to get any other reinsurance company to cover that business and they may have to carry the risk themselves.</P>
    <P>The amendment I suggest permits that a fair proportion, one-third, should go to the reinsurance corporation.  It gives them a fair proportion of the business and, at the same time, while not giving the Minister the privilege of picking and choosing, it still leaves it open to the various companies to enter into reinsurance treaties with other reinsurance companies.  I submit that it is a favourable provision all round, both from the point of view of the reinsurance company, the ordinary companies, the policy-holders and the public at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment would be, of course, impracticable. I do not think we could require the reinsurance with the company of such a fixed proportion of risks as the Deputy suggests.  I may say at once that it is intended that the reinsurance company to be established under this part of the Bill, if it is brought into operation, will operate as any other reinsurance company, except in so far as the Act will provide that every company doing insurance business in the Saorstát will be required to enter into an agreement with it for the transaction of reinsurance business. It may, perhaps, relieve the minds of some Deputies if I say that amendment No. 116, in the name of Deputy Costello, is, in my opinion, unnecessary, although if the Deputy thinks otherwise and presses that the amendment should be inserted, I am prepared to do so.  I think it is unnecessary, but I would be prepared, if the contrary opinion was strongly held&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to agree to that and, similarly, to the other amendment in Deputy Costello's name, amendment No. 161 which, I think, is intended to clarify the intention of the section and which would clarify it, in my opinion, if inserted. By intimating my willingness to accept those two amendments, I perhaps convey to Deputies better than I could do otherwise, the intentions as to the mode of operation of the reinsurance company.  It is possible that this part of the Bill may not be operated if alternative proposals for meeting the desires of the Government are put forward by the companies and brought into operation.  In fact, from many points of view, it is obviously desirable that the State should stay out of this business if it can get its object achieved in any other way. Our object is to provide that the greatest possible proportion of every risk written in the Free State will be retained here to the limit that the resources of the various Irish organisations dealing with insurance will permit.  That can be accomplished by means of such machinery as this <Col N="2274" /> part of the Bill proposes.  It could possibly be accomplished by other means, and if other means are preferable to the companies and are put forward in a manner acceptable to us, we are quite prepared to contemplate leaving this part of the Bill inoperative.</P>
      <P>But the essential purpose of this part of the Bill, the idea behind the establishment of the reinsurance company, is to ensure that some proportion of every risk written by a foreign company in the Saorstát will be retained here, either by the reinsurance company or by some Saorstát company to whom the reinsurance company has passed on that risk, so that to the limit of the combined resources of all the Irish offices in operation the risk will be retained here to whatever extent is found practicable. I have stated there are other obvious methods of accomplishing that end than those proposed in the Bill, but that would involve the voluntary co-operation and participation of all the companies concerned.  If that cannot be procured, then the same end can be met by means of these reinsurance proposals.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the reinsurance company of Ireland, when established, will operate in the ordinary way, entering into agreements with the various companies operating here, agreements of the ordinary kind negotiated between these companies and the board of the reinsurance company in accordance with the circumstances of the concern or the circumstances existing at the time.  I do not think any difficulty will arise in that regard.  It is certainly not intended to create any undue difficulties for the companies doing this class of business here other than the difficulties inevitable in the changes necessary to give effect to the desire of the Government in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes some distance to meet a number of the objections that we had to Section 84 to find that the Minister intends to accept amendments Nos. 161 and 164 in my name.  At the same time I would like to ask the Minister if he is still <Col N="2275" /> definitely of the opinion that the last four lines of the section are absolutely essential:</P>
      <P>Subject to the qualification that the company may, in the case of any particular risk, refuse to accept the reinsurance thereof unless such assurance company retains such portion of such risk as the company shall direct.</P>
      <P>I am informed that a proviso such as that is not usual in treaty arrangements. It would not be reasonable, of course, that the reinsurance company should be forced to accept every reinsurance policy on the terms that are dictated to it by the companies, but at the same time it should not be in a position itself to dictate the terms on which it will accept reinsurance proposals.  I would like to know from the Minister if he still adheres to the idea that this proviso is absolutely essential.  I accept, of course, his statement that his idea is that this reinsurance company should operate on the same business lines as ordinary reinsurance companies do at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is intended, but a reinsurance treaty at the present time between one company and another is a voluntary arrangement. To a certain extent, that voluntary element is being removed from the relations between companies licensed to do business here and the reinsurance company of Ireland because it says that there shall be an agreement. In these circumstances I think it is necessary to have the qualification to which the Deputy refers which is designed to prevent a company, having a reinsurance agreement with the reinsurance company, writing all sorts of bad risks, passing the whole of those risks on to the reinsurance company and retaining none itself. The object of this provision is to ensure that that cannot happen, and that the reinsurance company, if it has good reasons for doing so, can, in relation to a particular risk, refuse to accept the reinsurance unless a stipulated proportion of the risk is retained by the company writing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the words in the last four lines of Section 84, quoted a moment ago by Deputy Costello, have the effect of creating treaty obligations with other insurance companies.  That is where we join issue with him.  We deny that. The Minister says that he wishes to prevent insurance companies handing over the whole of very bad risks to the reinsurance company while retaining none themselves.  It would be absurd if that were allowed, and such a thing is not contained in any of our proposals. If the Minister is going to proceed along treaty lines, I think the way that operates is that while a company can discard a portion of the risk, it must keep at least 1/15th of it.  If the Minister made a provision of that sort, a company would know how it stood. It would know that it could not lay off the whole of its risk with the reinsurance company, and therefore would not write it.  That would be a business-like arrangement, and it is what prevails at present.  But what you cannot have is a case like this: A fire starts in some big business concern and continues burning for three days.  During all that time the insurance company may be fighting with the reinsurance company as to whether it held £1,000 or £10,000 of the risk involved in that case.  Would not that be a beautiful position for a small insurance company to be in, to be told by the reinsurance company when the premises were well alight: &ldquo;You are on for £9,000 of this risk, because you know we could not take it on.&rdquo;  I think the Minister <Col N="2277" /> should realise that companies dealing with a reinsurance company must know where they stand&mdash;that they can have certain risks placed without any nonsense. If the Minister agreed to take out this proviso, he would find that there was no intention on the part of any Deputy to suggest that an insurance company should be allowed to plant the whole of a risk on the reinsurance company, retaining none itself. If that could happen it would be absurd.  But I think the Minister can see that his proposal will not do either.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement left nothing to be desired so far as approaching this as a business-like transaction, that this should be carried out as a commerial undertaking.  But, if this section contained some such provision as that the insurance company shall retain some portion, a minimum portion, of the risk, not exceeding such-and-such a percentage, that would leave the insurance company dealing with the reinsurance company in a position to say, &ldquo;I have carried out my part of the bargain, now you carry out yours.&rdquo;  A large number of people appear to have fallen into the same error as I did in reference to the last few lines of this section, namely, that it gives the reinsurance corporation the right to do something that was never in any ordinary reinsurance treaty.  We are dealing with a Government-backed or Government-owned company, according to this section, whose officers will be cold-blooded and will say, &ldquo;I cannot go beyond the provisions <Col N="2279" /> of the Act; there is your section of it, read it.&rdquo;  I appeal to the Minister to make that portion of it right, as it is a very important section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the meaning of the qualification was that the particular risk proportion to be retained was to be provided for in the insurance treaty, the treaty agreement.  Surely the concluding words of the section as it stands do not mean that: &ldquo;Unless such assurance company retains such portion of such risk as the company shall direct.&rdquo;  As I read the section, as it stands, it will be competent for the company, no matter what terms are in the agreement, when a particular risk offers, to say in respect of that particular risk: &ldquo;You must retain 50, 70, 80, 90 or any other percentage.&rdquo;  But, if the intention is that portion of the risk to be retained should be fixed in the insurance treaty, then surely another form of words must be found to make that clear.  The concluding words, &ldquo;as the company shall direct,&rdquo; must go and be replaced by some such words as &ldquo;as provided by the agreement.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the only difference between us is as to whether the section, as drafted, has the same meaning which I have given in describing it.  I am prepared to have the drafting of the section revised, because it possibly could be made a little clearer at the expense of being made a little longer, and it is no harm to have it longer if it is clearer.  The intention is that the qualification in the final part of it shall be related to the agreement, and that, when the terms of the agreement between the company and the reinsurance company are being effected, the circumstances under which the reinsurance company will not be responsible for reinsurance, because of the failure of the company writing the risk to retain a reasonable proportion of it, such proportion as is fixed, will be clearly stated.  We have to deal with two novel features in relation to these reinsurance treaties.  The reinsurance treaties will be similar to the ordinary treaties made every day voluntarily between two companies, <Col N="2280" /> except for the two new features introduced by this Bill.  One is the provision which requires every company licensed to do this business here, and, doing it, to reinsure with this company and, in consequence of that, I have to prevent the situation rising in which the company will write all sorts of doubtful and bad risks and pass the whole of them on to the reinsurance company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The whole purpose of this section is to provide for these two points, to provide that each company shall reinsure with this company, and, secondly, to provide, in consequence, that the company writing the risk shall exercise the usual precautions to prevent unduly bad risks being written.  I am prepared to consider the drafting of the section to ensure that the intentions in that regard are fully carried out.  In any event, the intimation that I am prepared to accept amendments Nos. 161 and 164, in Deputy Costello's name, makes clear what the intention is. These amendments, in my opinion, are not necessary, except for the purpose of clarification, but as they are pressed for the purpose of clarification, I am prepared to accept them. They will, I think, help also to clear up the intentions in relation to this section.</P>

      <P>My idea in putting down the amendment is that I am assured that companies which have very good reinsurance treaties think <Col N="2281" /> that, when this compulsory reinsurance is put in, they will be left in the position that, when they go to the reinsurance company and are turned down on several lines of business, they will find themselves high and dry and cannot get cover.  If the Minister guarantees that that will not take place, or if it can be provided for in any way, I am satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is definitely intended that it will not take place.  So far as the Saorstát companies are concerned, these agreements will be reciprocal agreements, and involve the passing of business in both directions, that is from the company writing the risks to the reinsurance company, and from the reinsurance company accepting the risks from other companies on to the Irish companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see in this section the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>excluding life assurance business but including the renewal of any other assurance business, the original contract for which was entered into before the commencement of this part of this Act.</P>
      <P>It occurs to me that in the preliminary stages it might be very desirable to let many of the short term risks run on.  The valuing of them up to a certain point and inviting the reinsurance company to come to terms about something that was half expired would be an exceedingly awkward and difficult matter to carry out.  I should like to ask the Minister how far the running of short term risks could be availed of to straighten out a very awkward part of the business.  I realise, of course, that some of these risks are not short term, and that they would have to be provided for, but the Minister can quite easily see that, in the case of a 12 months' risk, of which six months had expired, the simplest thing would be to let it run on.  Would that be illegal under the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the compulsory provisions operate only in respect of assurance business effected in the Saorstát after the commencement of the operation of the Act.  That includes the renewal of any assurance business, the original contract for which was entered into before the commencement of the Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very grateful for even the smallest mercies from the present Government.  Even if I had the time, I would not attempt the task of correcting all the inaccuracies and misstatements of the Minister in this matter.  I have got tired of trying to correct his misstatements in this House, particularly with regard to unemployment and unemployment assistance.  The Minister did make a speech and it was the type of speech <Col N="2284" /> we expected to get from him&mdash;a series of sweeping statements.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are more people employed in this country than ever before, and there are fewer people unemployed than ever before.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was satisfied that of the people laid off last year, 41,000 got employment. When he was challenged for the evidence, the evidence, he told us, was the fact that they did not continue to register, and because there were only 4,000 odd of the people laid off under the Period Order, who received home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even that.  I said that the number of persons receiving home assistance as able-bodied persons was less after the Order was brought into operation than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister concluded from that that it was because they were employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I concluded that they did not get home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was talking without any knowledge of the matter at all, as usual.  He did not give us any indication of the numbers that applied for home assistance.  Is the Minister aware that there are boards of health in this country that have definitely decided they will not give home asistance to able-bodied unemployed?  The Minister's plea is that he is going to shift the burden from the State to the local authority&mdash; the Government that boasts that they have taken responsibility for maintaining the unemployed.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We know from direct evidence that these people were either employed on the farms on which they live, or got employment during that period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister did not produce the direct evidence and he told us nothing about it.  The Minister's statement of the position was this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulty in rural areas is this: that during periods of the year there is considerable difficulty in determining whether a particular <Col N="2285" /> individual can be regarded as employed or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister's way of solving that difficulty is to regard the whole lot of them as being employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are employed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>41,000 last year, and, at least, 41,000 this year for double the period.  The Minister gave us as one of the direct pieces of evidence that they were employed the fact that they did not register for employment.  He said that there were certain benefits to be got from registration.  They got priority on certain works, and there were certain public works available, he said.  Does the Minister not know quite well that the class of people affected by this Order have not got first claim upon public works in the country?  Does the Minister not know &mdash;if he does not, he ought to&mdash;that relief works in rural areas during the summer months are very few, and that whatever relief works are carried out are mainly confined to towns and cities, and that, in the rural areas, they are carried out mainly during the autumn, winter and early part of spring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember that this Order is an Order that affects every single unemployed man without dependents, and every widower without dependents, in a rural area.  It is interesting to note how a rural area is defined under the Order to show the stupid way in which this Order is applied.  A rural area for the purpose of this Order is defined as an area which has not either an urban council or town commissioners. We have this position as a result.  Let me take my own county as an example of how the workers are affected by this Order.  The town of Fethard, with a population of 1,180, has town commissioners.  This Order does not apply to it.  The town of Cahir has 1,709 of a population, nearly 600 more than Fethard, but because they <Col N="2286" /> have not town commissioners or an urban council, the unemployed in that particular town are to be deprived of their unemployment assistance.  The town of Templemore has an urban council, and a population of 2,233, but Roscrea, with a population of 2,772, has no urban council or no town commissioners, and therefore the man in the town of Templemore receives his unemployment assistance while the man in Rosrea is deprived of it.  The same thing applies in other counties.  In the county represented by the mover of this motion&mdash;County Kildare&mdash;Newbridge, with a population of 2,249, has an urban council, while Kildare, with a population of 2,316, has neither an urban council nor town commissioners.  This Order applies in Kildare, but not in Newbridge.</P>
    <P>Can anybody conceive of anything more stupid or more sweeping than that?  If there were nothing but that alone in connection with this Order, I say that it is a complete and absolute condemnation of the Order.  Does the Minister want to tell the members of this House that all the single unemployed men in the town of Kildare will get employment and are guaranteed it until the 27th October, and that the unemployed men in Newbridge will not get employment; that every man in Roscrea will be employed, and that the men in Templemore will be unemployed? The Minister has not produced one bit of evidence.  He is simply trying to balance the Budget for the Minister for Finance, and trying to do it at the expense of the poorest section of the people in this country.  It is a going back on the principle which the Minister and the Government said they accepted, of providing either work or maintenance for these people.  The Minister simply issues an Order which deems these people to be at work.  He says that there is plenty of work available in rural areas, and we are told by other members of the Minister's Party that the work is there, but that the people are too lazy to do it in rural areas.  We are accustomed to hearing from the Minister statements without any foundation.  Recently, in a debate on unemployment assistance in this House, I mentioned that one of the <Col N="2287" /> principal sources of employment in rural areas, outside agricultural work, was employment on roads, and I stated that unfortunately the employment on roads had been considerably reduced. What did the Minister say in reply? He said: &ldquo;Not at all; the Deputy is wrong as usual; there are more men employed on roads than ever before.&rdquo; That is what the Minister said, but in any event I was right, and the Minister was wrong.  However, in order to satisfy him on the matter, I put down a question to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and asked for a return setting out the numbers of men employed on relief work on roads for the years ending December, 1931, to December, 1935.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, relief work on roads.  Is the Minister going to quibble on that point?  I was informed by the Department that they were unable to give me the figures for the year ending December, 1931.  I do not know why, and I think it was rather unfortunate that I was not able to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was probably no employment for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They were unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister makes that point, I shall make this point: that there were at least three times the number engaged on relief works in 1931 than in 1935.  In any case, however, we got this return: that in November, 1932, the total number engaged on relief work on roads was 15,363.  In December, 1933, it had dropped from 15,000 to 4,139.  In December, 1934, the number was 5,990, and in December, 1935, it was 4,032. Yet I was told by the Minister that I was wrong, as usual, when I told him of the drop in the figures, and the Minister said that there were more men employed on the roads now than ever before.  That is the type of statement we get from the man who is charged with the responsibility of dealing with unemployment and unemployment assistance in this country. That is the sense of irresponsibility <Col N="2288" /> shown over and over again by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I want to put this to the Minister: if there were only 4,032 men in the whole of the Free State engaged on relief works on roads at December when, usually, the maximum number engaged on roads is put on, will he tell us how many are going to be absorbed on road work this year?</P>
      <P>As I say, the Minister's statement is absolutely irresponsible.  He spoke about the £2,500,000.  I asked him when it would be spent and he told us that it is being spent at the moment. He did not tell us where, or by whom the money was being provided, or for what schemes.  It would be interesting to know that, but we got this from the Minister, and, mind you, this statement is not from an ordinary member of a back bench in the House but from a responsible Minister:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is this sum of £2,500,000. All these people know&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;he was referring to the unemployed&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that every penny of that money is to be spent upon wages.  Every penny of it is going to some person who is registered at the unemployment exchanges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that every penny of that money is being spent on wages. Can he tell us how much of the £2,500,000 is being absorbed on materials?  He says that every penny is going on wages.  It just shows the absolutely irresponsible way in which the Minister gets up here to deal with matters affecting the unemployment situation in this country.  I do not know whether there is really any use in putting facts before the Minister; whether there is really any use in trying to bring home to him a sense of his responsibility in regard to those people; or whether there is any use in telling him that, to say the least of it, it is unfair on his part to treat this problem as if it did not exist. He knows that the problem exists. He must know that it does exist and that he is not going to provide employment simply by making an Order to the effect that, as between such and such dates, people are going to be in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> The Government boast, and have boasted inside this House and outside this House up and down the country, that they have accepted the responsibility of providing either work or maintenance for the unemployed in this country.  Either they have or they have not.  The Minister also told us that we were rather overlooking the point that the Act had not been suspended altogether: that it was only for certain classes.  He cannot have it both ways, and he cannot get out of his promise to provide either work or maintenance for the unemployed and at the same time suspend people, whether in work or not, from the benefits of unemployment assistance, whether they are in work for three or six months in the year. We want the Minister to treat this problem seriously and to adopt a different approach to the treatment of the problem than he has been adopting. We want to see that the Minister carries out the Government's promise to provide either work or maintenance and to see that, if employment cannot be provided, these people shall not be deprived of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The Minister availed of the discussion on this Order to display a form of optimism which, I think, exceeded any similar displays of optimism we have had from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, though one would wish that the occasion for the optimism was less tragic than that provided by the sufferings of the people we are going to deprive of unemployment assistance benefit as the result of the Minister's Order.  He told us that 41,000 persons were affected by the Employment Period Order of last year and that 24,000 of these were farmers' sons.  Presumably the other 17,000 were not farmers' sons.  The Minister seemed to find some curious satisfaction in cutting off farmers' sons from unemployment assistance benefit. Under the first Employment Period Order small farmers with valuations over £4 lost unemployment assistance benefit, and now, not content with depriving the fathers, who are small farmers, of unemployment assistance benefit, the Minister proposes in the rural areas to cut their sons off benefit <Col N="2290" /> also.  The fathers went under the first Employment Period Order, and now the sons are deprived of unemployment assistance benefit because they are single and because, according to the Minister, they should be working on their father's land, even though the small patch of land is utterly unable to sustain a family during the period of unemployment.  The Minister made the case that persons who were cut off unemployment assistance benefit in fact immediately proceeded to get work. We have the extraordinary position apparently, that the State recognises that there is no work for single men without dependents on June 2nd, but suddenly, like rain or manna, from June 3rd until October 27th, work is there in such abundance as to make it possible to deny unemployment assistance benefit to single persons or to widowers without dependents.  The work is not there on June 2nd, but on June 3rd it is there in abundance, and then disappears on October 3rd.  That is what the Minister asks us to believe in the attempt to justify this Order.  The Minister wonders why persons do not register at the employment exchange when cut off unemployment assistance benefit.  He has not told us what real benefits are attached to continued registration at the employment exchanges by those who have been denied unemployment assistance benefit.</P>

      <P>We will discuss that later.  What advantage is there for people continuing to register at the exchanges when they are denied unemployment assistance benefit? There are married men registering at the employment exchanges, after the single men have been cut off, and there are also single men with dependents registering to see if any <Col N="2291" /> work financed wholly or partly out of public funds is available.  Preference is given to married men with dependents, and then to single men with dependents, and it is only when these catagories are exhausted that single men without dependents have any chance of getting work.  The Minister knows that and should realise that there is no advantage for these people continuing to register at the employment exchanges for work when they know that there are two other unexhausted catagories there already, and that people in these catagories will get preference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wonders why these people do not seek home assistance.  There he is speaking with the city mind.  If he had any appreciation of what is happening in rural areas, or if he went around the rural areas, or sent his inspectors there to inquire about the home assistance position, everybody knows, including Deputies on the Government Benches, that it is almost impossible for able-bodied single men to get home assistance from boards of health under existing circumstances.  I wish the Minister would ask some members of his own Party about the difficulty that single able-bodied men have in getting home assistance.  I venture to say that the Minister will find that Deputies on the benches behind him will be able to assure him that it is almost impossible for these persons <Col N="2292" /> to get home assistance.  It is hard enough for married men who are destitute to get home assistance much less single men.  The Minister says that there is work in the rural areas, and I suppose 21,000 are going to get it there this year.  That seems to be the Minister's contention, because with delightful urbanity he is proceeding to cut single persons off unemployment assistance in rural areas, believing, or pretending to believe, that work is available there.</P>

      <P>That is part of the foolish optimism of the Minister.  We can get evidence to show how groundless the Minister's statement is.  He says that work is available in rural areas but as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, rural areas have a wide definition in regard to unemployment.  Towns with substantial populations in the circumstances of this country come within the category of rural areas. Substantial towns are affected by this Order, places like Kildare, Tullow, and Monasterevan.  Town workers in these places come within the category of rural workers for the purpose of this Employment Period Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to send his inspectors to these areas and to tell the workers where they are to get work from June 3rd to October 27th.  Until such time as the Minister or Deputies on the benches behind him tell these people where they are to get work for 21 weeks we ought to have no more talk about work.  If it was decided to send some of the Deputies in the Minister's Party to these places, to tell the unemployed where work could be got, I venture to say that very few of them would have the hardihood to go to towns with populations of 2,000 or over that are affected by the Order.  Since the optimistic speech of the Minister on the last occasion that this motion was discussed I received a letter from a person who resides in Donegal.  The contents are an interesting sidelight on the Minister's statement.  The writer says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In order that you will understand the position of the working classes in the Gaeltacht area, I have only to point to the fact that there are hundreds leaving here every week for Scotland and England.  I am a strong supporter of the Government and was for a great many years a county councillor, and so cannot regard the spectacle of witnessing such a panorama of exiled industry with indifference.  But, as a matter of fact, the whole aspect of things as regard the labouring class here is a disgrace for any native Government, and the alleged remark of the Cosgrave Minister, that it was not part of the duty of the Government to provide for the unemployed, is partly borne out as being once more the policy when we observe the callous criticism of the Employment Period Order by the Minister a few days ago in the Dáil.  Therefore, if unemployment allowance is to be discontinued during the summer period it is important that the Government provide a scheme of relief work. It is only right as the Pope said in his famous Encyclical that the State <Col N="2294" /> should concern itself with the workman and that necessary work should be provided.  I trust you will bear in mind that there are no relief works or any industries here to give young people employment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will let the Deputy see the letter afterwards.  There is testimony from a strong supporter of the present Government that there are hundreds of people leaving Donegal every week for Scotland and England, that there is no employment there for people affected by the Employment Period Order and that in that area the problem of destitution, already bad, is going to be inserted.  One would think from what the Minister says about employment in rural areas that to live in a rural area is like living in an El Dorado.  I have a document here which is described as a wages receipt of the Turf Development Board, Limited, which shows that a person in a rural area after doing nearly three days work, in Offaly, for the Turf Development Board, gets the munificent sum of 10/5 less a deduction of 1/5 for health insurance and unemployment insurance contributions &mdash;9/- for three days.</P>

      <P>This will probably gladden the heart of the Minister for Finance because in his Budget statement <Col N="2295" /> he referred to people who did not want work.  This man lives 13 miles from the place where he is employed. He has to cycle 13 miles to work and 13 miles back in the evening.  He told me that he leaves his own house at a quarter past six in the morning and gets to the bog about a quarter to eight.  He gets 5½d. an hour for working under these circumstances.</P>

His net wages for the three days amount to 9/-, and to earn that he has to cycle 13 miles to work and 13 miles home in the evening. If he did not do that, and lost the employment, he would not get unemployment insurance benefit.  This goes to show conclusively that there is not that abundance of employment in the rural areas which the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggests. If there was that abundance of work in rural areas you would not get a man to cycle 13 miles to work and 13 miles home in the evening for 5½d. an hour.</P>

The whole purpose of this Employment Order is to save money for the Exchequer.  It is an economy Order, not an Employment Period Order.  This Order is made and the <Col N="2298" /> period of it extended to enable the Minister for Finance to get money to balance his Budget.  That is the whole purpose of the Order, and the country should be told that.  The Minister should not pretend that there is an abundance of work in the rural areas when, in fact, it is not there.
