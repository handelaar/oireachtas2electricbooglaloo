      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the valuation of the Unified Society in respect of the five years ended 31st December, 1928, has been carried out, and whether a copy of the valuation report will be laid on the Table of the Dáil at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Unified Society was established under the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, and only began operations in that year.  No valuation could, therefore, have been made at the 31st December, 1928.  A valuation as at the 31st December, 1933, is at present being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether it has been brought to his notice that there is a widespread demand for the amendment of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act so as to confer a title to non-contributory pensions on (a) widows over 50 years of age who have no dependent children; (b) widows of small-holders who through economic circumstances ceased residing on the holding occupied by their husbands, and (c) widows of tradesmen not in insurable employment at the date of death; whether he has made an examination of such representations, and whether it is his intention to introduce proposals for legislation at an early date to give effect to the demands in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that demands have been made for extensions of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act under various heads, including the three heads mentioned in the question.  The Government is at present considering whether the non-contributory classes should be extended and whether any other changes in the scheme are desirable.  As the Act has not yet been three months in operation, the material from which statistics in respect of non-contributory claims could be compiled is as yet only partially available.  Arrangements are being made by which statistics of the various heads under which claims have been rejected can be analysed.  When this information is available, the Government will be in a better position to consider extensions of the scheme.</P>

    <P>I may add that some of the oldest cases mentioned above appeared in the judges' list for hearing some months ago, but on the application of the parties to the actions who were not ready to proceed were taken out of the list and re-entered for a later date. The position as indicated by these statistics appears to be fairly satisfactory and no complaints appear to have been made recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that in the year 1934 the Probation of Offenders Act was applied in the case of a prosecution under the Factory and Workshop Acts where the occupier of a wood turning factory was charged with eight specific offences involving the risk of life, including the offence of failure to fence securely the main belt drive to countershaft, failure to fence securely underground shafting, failure to provide a riving knife for a circular saw, failure to provide top of circular saw with a guard and failure to protect the part of a circular saw below the work-bench; whether he was advised that the neglect charged and proved against the occupier of the premises in question exposed the workers employed by him to serious risk and whether in view of the unwillingness of the court to impose substantial penalties in respect of such serious offences he will make provisions when introducing proposals for future factory legislation for specific minimum penalties in such cases.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in 1934 the Probation of Offenders Act was <Col N="342" /> applied in the case of a prosecution under the Factory and Workshop Acts and that certain of the offences complained of were serious.  I should point out that when the case came before the district justice the occupier of the factory in question had no employees and the contraventions complained of had been remedied.  The question of the provision of minimum penalties is being carefully considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he received a communication dated 27th January last from the Post Office Workers' Union and the Civil Service Clerical Association requesting an interview with him on the subject of setting up an arbitration board which would be mutually acceptable to these organisations and the Government, and whether in view of the promise made by the President of the Executive Council over four years ago that he was prepared to establish an arbitration board to adjudicate on the grievances of the Civil Service organisations, he is prepared to receive the deputation as requested so that a satisfactory scheme of arbitration may be devised and brought into operation at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a communication under the date stated from the two organisations referred to in the question.  The communication purported to be a reply to a letter issued on the 8th June last from my Department asking for written observations on a detailed draft scheme for setting up arbitration machinery to deal with certain Civil Service matters. In fact, however, beyond a few broad statements in regard to arbitration generally, no detailed or considered criticism of the draft arbitration scheme was offered.  This question of arbitration, affecting as it does the whole Civil Service in which there are many and varied grades of officers, duties, and circumstances of service, cannot be dealt with piecemeal.  Until I have received from the service as a whole written observations on the details of the draft scheme which show appreciation of the grave constitutional and other difficulties which, apart from questions of conditions of service of civil servants, are inherent in this matter and have had an opportunity to review and consider such criticisms, no useful purpose would be served by receiving any deputation.</P>

      <P>Do I understand although he has received joint letters from both organisations, the two largest organisations in the Civil Service, the Minister does not propose to receive a deputation to discuss the question of arbitration?  Does the Minister think that his attitude in this respect is in accordance with the very definite promise made by the President on the eve of the 1932 General Election that he would establish an arbitration board to deal with grievances in the Civil Service?</P>

      <P>I propose to take the Deputy's three questions together.  The total number of new holdings (as distinct from the enlargement of existing uneconomic holdings) created on the division of untenanted land under the Land Acts, 1923-33, in each of the calendar years, 1933, 1934 and 1935, and the total area comprised therein, was approximately as follows:&mdash;Year 1933: 517 new holdings, comprising 15,055 acres; year 1934: 484 new holdings, comprising 12,326 acres; year 1935: 2,424 new holdings, comprising 55,260 acres. The corresponding figures appropriate to the respective 26 counties are set out in a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report. It would be impracticable to supply the information asked for by the Deputy as to the charges in connection <Col N="351" /> with the creation and assignment of these new holdings or the number of persons in the families of the allottees.  No statistical returns of such matters are kept by the Land Commission, and in order to compile <Col N="352" /> the information it would be necessary to collect and analyse all the resale schemes involved, which would be a very long and laborious task, necessitating the diversion of the Land Commission staff from the urgent work of land division.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary directs his attention to question 15 he will see that I ask him to state the total number of new holdings created, under the Land Acts, 1923-33, and the total amount of the charges paid, or to be paid, by the State in connection with the creation and assignment of these new holdings. He told us that it would be impracticable to supply the information as to the cost of the creation of the new holdings in 1934.</P>

He is not asked to give information in respect of either a particular county or province, but for the State as a whole.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us that he has that information I will repeat the question so that he will have the opportunity of giving us the total cost of the creation of new holdings in 1934.</P>

      <P>That is quite true, but does not the Deputy realise the tremendous amount of work that would <Col N="354" /> be involved if the Land Commission staff had to go over the 800 estates dealt with in 1935, and compile all the statistics necessary in respect of each allottee on each of these estates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when the land inspectors are allocating holdings of land they inquire from the allottees the number they have in family?  Is it not also a fact that a grant for the building of a new house depends on the number in family that a particular allottee has?  Could not the information asked for in these questions be complied from the statistics in the possession of the land inspectors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that there were 800 estates dealt with in 1935.  The compilation of the statistics required by Deputies would scarcely justify the amount of work involved.  The staff of the Land Commission can, in my opinion, be much better employed than in doing such work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I consider there has been some improvement in this particular service since I raised the matter last year.  So far as the news service, and the presentation of that news are concerned, there has been, generally speaking, a very welcome improvement. We certainly have got away from the position which obtained previously when, on so many nights, there was no news service.  The news broadcast now is pretty exhaustive and, on the whole, is presented fairly well.  At the same time I think it will be admitted by those who listen-in that there is still room for improvement. There has been a decided improvement in the programmes generally, but while I say that I do not think that anybody is satisfied with the standard of the Irish broadcasts. There has been, as I have said, just a slight improvement.  The main reason for that is that the amount of money devoted to the service is not sufficient to enable those in charge to engage the talent which, in my opinion, could be obtained in the country.  I think it ought to be recognised that this is a national service and that the programmes are listened to by people not only in this country but in many countries throughout Europe, and we ought to aim at having the programme broadcast from our station at least on as high a level as the programmes of some of the countries on the Continent.  It would, of course, be absurd to think that we could get programmes as lengthy or of the same high standard of excellence as, say, the British Broadcasting Corporation, which has an immense income and which has large sums of money available in order to get broadcasts from people who are at the top of the various professions.</P>

    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of lectures and talks&mdash;giving information about certain matters.  These could be made very useful and could prove very valuable for the community at large.  We had a number of interesting talks during <Col N="367" /> the year, and we also had a number of talks that were neither interesting nor creditable to the State.  I think the sooner we get away from talks of the latter type the better for the credit of the State.  I trust the Minister will do all he can to encourage talks of an informative nature, not too highbrow, talks which will be of value to the ordinary people in the country.</P>
    <P>I think the wireless could be utilised to a far greater extent in conveying useful information to the people. Unfortunately, owing to the very high duty on wireless sets, wireless is not availed of in this country to the same extent as in other countries.  For instance, wireless sets are not very numerous amongst the agricultural community.  If they were readily available it might be possible to convey to the agricultural community valuable information in a more effective way than through the medium of leaflets, which cost so much and which are really so useless.  I refer now to the leaflets issued by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister what was the result of the appeal made regarding Sunday programmes.  I think the director of broadcasting invited listeners to indicate whether they wanted the hours from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock or from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  A couple of years ago I advocated a change from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock to 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  I am still in favour of the later hours.  I think the Minister ought to make an effort to give a longer programme on Sunday.  It is the day on which people can find most time to devote to wireless programmes.  As it is, we have a gramophone programme from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  Then there is a break until 8.30.  Then we have a musical programme for an hour, and later there is a sponsored programme, and that practically finishes the broadcast for the night.  I think listeners would be glad if there was a more extensive programme on Sundays.  I must say that there has been an improvement of late in the programmes broadcast, perhaps not very great, but still an improvement. <Col N="368" /> There certainly has been a very decided improvement so far as the news is concerned</P>

      <P>I think it is generally conceded that the evening news has been greatly improved within recent months.  Speaking impartially as an ordinary listener, my view about the international news broadcast from our station is that it seems to take its line entirely from the British Broadcasting Corporation.  Each evening after the British news is sent over the ether, if one listens to Dublin one finds that there is more or less the same colour and the same outlook in international politics.  I am sorry to say that we in the Free State seem to be following the British lines in that respect too closely. We are certainly agreeing with Great Britain in this respect, if not in regard to other matters.  I think it was about a year ago, when tuning in at 6 o'clock to London, one heard that Scott and Black had reached Australia.  At 6.45 the same evening the Dublin station announced that they were over the Timor Sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I mentioned to the Minister before, and I would like to renew my observations. Certain artistes were invited to come from County Donegal to perform in Dublin for Radio Athlone, and they complained that they were given a sum of only £2 2/- or £3 3/- for the performance which they gave, and that their travelling expenses cost them more than the entire fee which they received for performing, with the result that when another invitation was sent to them, some of them declined to come.  I appreciate that it is very difficult for the director of broadcasting to give somebody from Cork who has to travel to Dublin, to make whatever contribution he has to make, a higher fee than he gives to a resident of Dublin for the same kind of performance. But it is obvious to me that if we want to introduce traditional singing, traditional violin-playing and a variety of forms of traditional music, the most expert exponents of which are to be found in the Gaeltacht or in the more remote rural parts of the country, we have to make up our <Col N="369" /> minds to pay for it if we are to have it at all.</P>
      <P>I think it is an eminently desirable thing that the traditional music of this country should be incorporated frequently in our musical programmes; but I would like to make this suggestion, that we cannot afford to tolerate the same mediocrity in the presenta tion of traditional music that we might afford in the presentation of popular music.  I do not think, if you are dealing with the great classics of music, that you can afford to broadcast from a mediocre performance.  When you are broadcasting dance music or light popular music it is not a matter of such great consequence whether the performer is highly expert or not. But when you are broadcasting traditional music, with which a great many people in this country and abroad are not familiar, it should be broadcast as perfectly as it is possible to get it done and, therefore, I would have no hesitation in paying an extra fee in order to make it possible for the exponents of that kind of music to come.  I suggest to the Minister that the only way that can be done, if he desires to set a standard of fees for similar performances, is to set a standard in the studio and add to that fee the travelling expenses where a person has to come from outside the area of the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the income from listeners to the broadcasting service in this country will tend to grow. Certain foreign broadcasting stations, finding themselves with a surplus income, determined that it would be a very good thing to subsidise themselves, or maintain themselves, a really good orchestra, a philharmonic orchestra.  The great difficulty in Dublin of maintaining a philharmonic orchestra is that there are not very many wealthy people knocking about and it is extremely difficult to make it possible for any such orchestra in our native city to develop without cohesion and a continuity of work together, which would give the individual musician a fair opportunity of making an adequate contribution to such an ensemble.  I therefore suggest <Col N="370" /> that the Irish broadcasting service should seriously consider the question of subsidising the Dublin Philharmonic Orchestra, even if it were only in the form of paying them a regular annual fee in consideration of a certain number of performances before the microphone.  I should be glad if it were done in that way, or else that they should be guaranteed a certain annual endowment so that their services might be available to the broadcasting service when they were wanted, and also so that they might provide a centre of musical entertainment for the people of the country generally as well as for the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>My third point is that, while we have very interesting and also exceedingly dull talks on the radio, and while we have had some excellent performances on the wireless and also some execrably bad ones, I think we ought to consider whether or not the time has come to extend our invitations for lectures and individual performances a little further afield.  For instance, celebrity concerts are held here in Dublin from time to time, and the artistes who appear there, and who, doubtless, require a very large fee for coming to Dublin for one concert, might be persuaded to perform individually over the radio, on the occasion of their visit for the celebrity concert, on, say, a Sunday, at a fee which the broadcasting service might be able to pay.  If that could be done, we might consider, later on, inviting them specially to give one or more broadcasts themselves and that would make available to the rural population of the country the enjoyment which those, who can afford to attend the celebrity concert, can have by visiting Dublin and paying for a ticket.  That would not be calculated to interfere with the success of such enterprises as the celebrity concerts, because experience has shown that, if you introduce people to the delights of hearing a really great violinist or a really fine pianist over the radio or on the gramophone, the effect generally is that you induce a larger number of people to come up themselves <Col N="371" /> and hear the performers in person.</P>
    <P>I should be glad also if the Minister would consider getting persons of distinction in various branches of science and art to come to the radio and deliver lectures.  It is quite possible that that could be arranged more economically by relaying from London than by bringing the lecturer to Dublin, because London is more central.  I do not know whether you could relay a lecture from Paris or the Continent generally, but I think one might consider the advisability of having lectures from distinguished persons either by way of relay or by inviting them to the City of Dublin.  If we begin by using the method of relaying instead of bringing such people to Dublin, I would urge on the broadcasting service the advisability of helping in the future to bring persons of distinction both in science and art to the City of Dublin, because, while the broadcasting service would contribute the bulk of the expense in such a case, individuals or societies, who could not contemplate the extravagance of inviting these people to come themselves, might avail of their presence in the City of Dublin to meet them and in that way would benefit by their presence here and might be able to procure their services for a smaller fee than that offered by the broadcasting service for a special lecture dealing with a subject with which these distinguished visitors are peculiarly qualified to deal, and in that way we might draw to the City of Dublin a number of persons whom it might be of inestimable value to meet and whom we could not hope to induce to come here under other circumstances. In the same way, we would be able to introduce these distinguished visitors to the people at large through the radio.</P>
    <P>That is the last matter I wish to touch upon, but I want to invite the opinion of the Minister and of the House to this aspect of the question. I think it is a good thing to let the views of persons of distinction be ventilated in public.  I believe in free speech and therefore I would <Col N="372" /> suggest to the Minister that he should be somewhat radical in the kind of talks which he permits on the radio. It is well known that, if a person of distinction is invited to the microphone, neither the Government nor the Director of Broadcasting, nor anybody else, accepts responsibility for the view which the person of distinction is going to express.  Such people are simply brought there so that the public at large may hear all sides of every question.  I know that it is an extremely delicate and difficult problem to decide where you are going to draw the line as to what is going to be regarded as propaganda and what is going to be regarded as legitimate discussion; but so long as the ring is fairly held and all sides of every question are given, and so long as ample opportunity of ventilating all sides is given, I believe that that is the most effective way of demonstrating clearly that there is no question of prejudice one way or the other.  On mature reflection, I am satisfied that the Department ought to set its face definitely and rigorously against discussion on the radio of domestic politics, except, possibly, at the time of general elections. Now, I am as enthusiastic a politician as there is in this country. Some people will say: &ldquo;Why should you not discuss politics at all times of the year?&rdquo;  I say that you should not discuss them because the people do not want that kind of thing, and because I believe that it would give rise, at the present time in any case, to endless practical difficulties which, in theory, it would be very hard to define clearly.  Accordingly, I would be very slow to ask the Director of Broadcasting to open the door to discussions of purely domestic politics.  I do not suggest for a moment, however, that the wider issues of political philosophies should not be expounded by Irishmen and by foreigners by way of debate or by way of the reading of discourses on the radio; and I also think that, at the time of general elections, the principal Parties, as well as a fair representation of independent Deputies, should be given access to the radio, as was done, I think, in <Col N="373" /> the last general election with great success and with immense satisfaction to the vast majority of listeners.</P>
    <P>I think it would be discourteous on my part if I were to sit down without paying a tribute to the work that is being done by the Director of Broadcasting at the present time.  I think that a very great improvement has taken place.  We are under an obligation here, of course, to throw bricks whenever bricks require to be thrown; but I think it is equally desirable to throw bouquets when bouquets should be thrown.  I think that the wireless service is improving and I am only hoping that it will improve still more.  Personally, I am proud to rank myself amongst those citizens who are continually sending postcards to Broadcasting House in Dublin expressing approval or disapproval, as the case may be, and I think that if other citizens would adopt the same course it would be of considerable help to the Director of Broadcasting in the work he is doing and to the service generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have so high an opinion of the talks, lectures and addresses which are given over the radio from time to time that I would like to inquire from the Minister whether he would consider the establishment of a journal for the publication of these valuable discourses. Everybody knows that the talk over the radio, however successful it may be, is in reality only partially a success if it is not recorded so that people can read it afterwards. No matter what enjoyment one gets out of hearing it when being delivered that enjoyment is only half what it would be if one had the opportunity subsequently of reading it in print.  A number of the lectures delivered during the past year would, in my opinion be very well worth preserving. I do not see how that could be done except through the medium of a journal issued from the Dublin Broadcasting Station.  Other countries have found it necessary to issue such a journal.  I think it would be easier to do that here than elsewhere.  There are less vested interests in the way of journals in <Col N="374" /> this country that would consider there was unfair competition, if the State engaged in such a business.  I suggest to the Minister this matter is well worthy of consideration, in view of the great importance now attached to the radio as an educative medium. It is almost essential if the full function of radio, in present circumstances, is to be achieved that we should have the advantage of a publication like that.</P>
      <P>May I say that at no time did I consider that the criticisms levelled at our Dublin station were anything like justified.  I think from its inception it has been a good station.  A great many people in other countries who have the opportunity of hearing their own stations, and world stations, have been very appreciative of the Dublin programmes.  But certainly, during the past 12 months, there has been a very great improvement.  I think that such a feature as the trial of John Mitchel, lately given from the Dublin station, would be a credit to any station in the world.  In conclusion, I would like to hear the Minister's opinion upon the publication of a journal to record talks and publish other items of news as to our radio programmes.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my meed of praise to what has been said, and tell the Minister that, in my opinion, this year has shown progress in the Dublin Broadcasting Station. The concise and clear way in which the news is delivered, in recent months, is a gratification; but with other Deputies who have spoken, I think there are still heights to be reached. Deputy Morrissey mentioned the Sunday programme.  I would go further than he has gone and say that to most country people the Sunday programme is a very meagre thing. What would be the objection or what would be the harm in our station broadcasting services from different churches?  From the B.B.C. station we get services of various religious denominations, without exception.  It is a great boon and help to those who cannot leave their homes&mdash;to the afflicted and the crippled and so on&mdash;<Col N="375" /> to hear some little note on Sunday as to what Christianity stands for.  I also think we might have a further extension of our special feature programme, lectures, talks and so on.  I do not know that I want to endorse all that Deputy Dillon said, but there are many different subjects of public interest that we would be gratified to learn more about.  Surely we could get many people qualified to speak about these things to talk to us about them, and in that way make our station more interesting than it is.</P>
      <P>There is another thing&mdash;perhaps I stand alone in this&mdash;but it grates on me when I hear the announcement at the end of the sponsored programme. I think it is a blot upon our national institutions that at the end of that programme we hear urged that the purchase of a sweep ticket is the best way to provide for our families.  It seems to me to be a lowering of the whole position to find that one of our institutions such as the radio should be prostituted in such a manner.  The way in which it is done brings the whole thing down to the level of touting at a fair.  I may be peculiar in regard to this, but I do not think it is calculated to raise our national character to the highest standard.  Otherwise, I congratulate the Minister on what he has achieved. The programmes are improved, and I hope they will continue to improve.</P>

      <P>As everyone on this auspicious occasion has cooed like a sucking dove it would be breaking away from all precedent to say anything that would jar on the ears of the Minister or on those Deputies who suggested amendments.  It is a pity that that spirit manifested in presenting those suggestions was not preserved in regard to other suggestions.  The lion is lying down with the lamb on this occasion in relation to the suggestions tendered to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Evidently the influence of his beneficent aura has transmitted itself to the Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  Yesterday, at the opening of this discussion, only one jarring note was heard and that came from <Col N="376" /> Deputy McGilligan.  Jarring notes are not unusual in his case; but when one takes into account the volume of unanimity and general praise that greeted this Estimate, it looks out of place even to refer to that jarring note.  Out of the welter of suggestions poured on the Minister, some salient facts came to light.  Deputy McGilligan does not like those talks upon prison escapes, those episodic incidents of the recent past, and he does not like the frequency with which the prosperity of Ireland is referred to.  It is rather a pity that Deputy McGilligan does not like that.  There is nothing new in the featuring of those escapes.  If we could listen to the story of how Red Hugh escaped from Dublin Castle, or the story of the night before Kinsale, we would consider ourselves rather fortunate.  These recent events may eventually, in the course of years, be invested with as great interest as other episodes in Irish history, which we wish to see portrayed.  These escapes should not be deprecated in the jibing tones in which Deputy McGilligan spoke of them.  It might be that the manner of telling them of offended Deputy McGilligan's æsthetic sense. The language may have lacked the repose &ldquo;that stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His may have been an æsthetic objection, but rightly or wrongly, being a rather suspicious person, I read into Deputy McGilligan's strictures a sort of jealousy that possibly he was not among the faithful few who were privileged to take part in those glorious adventures, although God knows his company, right and left, would be well entitled to speak on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also referred, rather scathingly I thought, to the President's broadcast on St. Patrick's Day.  He seemed to see in it an effort to collect Party kudos.  That was the way I read the Deputy's statement in any case.  I may have read into it more than was intended, but when one listens in this House to a series of gibes from a man of the intellectual calibre of Deputy McGilligan, who should be above gibes, one naturally becomes a <Col N="377" /> little suspicious.  He seemed to read into the President's broadcast an effort to collect political kudos.  I think that cannot be alleged against the President. No doubt he is not fool-proof any more than the Opposition, but I think it cannot be alleged against him that he would use St. Patrick's Day as an occasion, and the radio as a vehicle, to collect Party kudos.  I am not an arbiter of taste; I have not had the advantage of a university education like Deputy McGilligan, but I say that possibly it would have been better to have left his Grace of Melbourne out of it.  After all, the featuring of jail escapes over the radio is nothing unique or unusual.  In what I might call, without meaning any offence, Deputy McGilligan's spiritual home, that great country across the Channel to which we were taught to look for inspiration in every crisis, jail escapes were frequently featured over the radio.  Those things were glorified, and rightly so.  Why should not we, with a past infinitely superior, a present equally superior, and a future of greater possiblities, rejoice not only in the escape of men from British jails but in the presentation of those escapes by men who actually took part in them?  I fail to see why this should come in for Deputy McGilligan's censure.  It was the only jarring note struck in the whole debate from yesterday until now.  As I do not want to be taken as one who is constantly criticising&mdash;God knows I do not criticise very often&mdash;I should like to offer some substantive suggestions to the Minister with a view to their adoption.  I may say here in advance that I am not a very ardent member of the ancient and honourable order of knob twiddlers. There are fans, as far as I can see, who persist in switching from China to Peru when you want to listen to Athlone.  I find it extremely irritating and I do not mind admitting it.  From the experience of some of those fans, I have gleaned a few suggestions and I should like to put them forward.  One is to the effect that jazz could be completely eradicated from the programmes of Radio Athlone.  It has been suggested to me, not unnaturally, that if we want jazz we can get it via England in the very best possible form. <Col N="378" /> Those who wish to hear it could get it via England, and we might be mercifully spared the infliction of hearing Radio Athlone relaying it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me to be a cross between a waltz and all-in wrestling. It has been suggested to me that the Children's Hour could be made more attractive from a national and educational point of view.  The children of to-day are getting rather sophisticated.  Possibly, those children, and the &ldquo;children of larger growth&rdquo; who listen-in to the Children's Hour, might possibly benefit from a better national and educational programme. I think we should also have a little more ceilidhe music.  It has been suggested also that we could have whole operas on records.  There appears to be a public for that sort of thing.  It has been done on the other side of the Channel.  There are records made, I believe, of practically every opera from the overture to the close, with a short descriptive sketch as a prelude.  Complaints have been made about a noise something like Big Bertha booming behind the transmission from Radio Athlone.  I am not a technician in that respect, but it appears to be pretty widely understood that this booming persists at most inconvenient intervals. Possibly the Minister can explain the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lectures have been alluded to and I think a series of historical lectures could well be initiated and carried on to the educational advantage of the listeners-in and the country.  I do not see, for instance, why we could not be taken in spirit to Clonmacnoise, by a lecturer who knew his stuff, and made familiar with the scenery around there, and made participators in the spirit of those who erected those glorious abbeys and monuments.  I do not see why we should not be taken to Vinegar Hill, and made to live in the spirit of that district.  It has been mentioned here that we ought to have a short-wave station for Ireland, whereby we could relay direct from Athlone, instead of being under an obligation to the courtesy of other stations for relaying to us.  Possibly, those suggestions <Col N="379" /> are enough for the harassed Minister, and if they have the effect of stirring his conscience into giving us a better programme than we have had I daresay they will not have been spoken in vain.  It is unquestionable, indubitable, that the programmes have been immensely improved of late, and everyone concerned, from the Minister, the Director and the staff downwards, are to be heartily congratulated.  We are all at one on that.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the tribute to the improvement which has been made in the broadcasting, and also to the development on the practical side of Irish life by the short talks of people with a knowledge of the various subjects.  That is a development in the right direction.  I got up to refer to just one or two matters in connection with broadcasting.  Deputy Kehoe brought Deputy McGilligan to task for some references he made in his speech yesterday.  I did not hear Deputy McGilligan's speech, neither did I read it, nor do I know that he spoke in the way attributed to him by Deputy Kehoe.  On St. Patrick's Day I, in common with all old Gaelic footballers and hurlers now on the scrapheap, am interested in a good Gaelic football match or a good hurling match.  We attend them when we can; when we cannot we listen-in.  I was listening-in with others on St. Patrick's Day.  Nobody would appreciate more than I would a talk on national matters, but in regard to the exchange of courtesies between the Head of this State and His Grace Archbishop Mannix I have no hesitation in saying that it was not national greetings but political greetings that were exchanged on that day.  Personally, I would much prefer&mdash;and so would everybody who was in my company&mdash;to have listened-in to the interesting stage which the Ulster v. Connaught match had reached at the time, than to hear the President and Archbishop Mannix exchanging political greetings over the radio.  His Grace, as he stated on that occasion, was 13,000 miles away, and we would welcome anything in the way of a national or religious talk from him, but personally I did not welcome <Col N="380" /> his statements about the condition of Ireland, which in my opinion, were not and are not true.  I do not say that he made a mis-statement, but I am quite sure that the words were put in his mouth and he said them, unfortunately. Why were not greetings exchanged between the President and His Grace the Archbishop on a very important matter that happened a few months ago&mdash;the President's attitude with regard to sanctions against Italy and His Grace's attitude towards those sanctions?</P>
      <P>Following that interruption, there was a broadcast of perhaps the greatest classical hurling match of the year&mdash;the final between the provinces. The Munster and Leinster match was being broadcast.  Everybody expected it would be a runaway victory for Munster, but they were beaten.  At a critical moment, when the match was becoming interesting&mdash;and if a thing is worth doing at all it is worth doing well and completely&mdash;when a score had taken place and the announcer could not say exactly whether it was a score or not because the flag had not been raised, we were switched on to Athlone to hear three people talk about something which, I candidly confess, I was not interested in or anybody else who was listening in, and which we could have heard either before or after the match just as well as at that stage.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have devoted the athletic years of our lives to the development of Gaelic pastimes should, apart from politics altogether, when a classic like that is being broadcast to Irishmen, or anybody else who wants to listen, see that it will not be interrupted.  I, as an individual, protest against that interruption.  I am sure the Minister will take full note of that.  I do not know whether he will take note of the implication in Deputy Haslett's suggestion that church services should be broadcast in order to make it easy for us to follow them.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must strike a jarring note according to Deputy Kehoe.  It has struck me for some time past that the broadcasting station is a place to enable the Government to pour forth their views&mdash;that <Col N="381" /> it is really a propagandist institution. I am not blaming the Director for that.  I expect he has to carry out the policy of the Minister.  Most of the people engaged to give lectures or plays or anything of that sort would appear to me to have been practically all tarred with the Government brush &mdash;that nobody, except he is <i>persona grata</i> with the political Party in power, has got much opportunity for giving any services to the public as far as broadcasting is concerned.</P>
      <P>Some time ago there was a play given there which had reference to a lady leaving Dublin who wishes to interview a gentleman in the country regarding a farm.  She had the feeling that a 150-acre farm was what she required.  Other people suggested that she should take a 50-acre farm.  As the play went on, she interviewed a Government supporter on the way who had a 50-acre farm of which he had made a great success, having got £40 for beet, £20 for wheat, £55 for sheep, £30 for cattle, £52 for fruit, £40 for eggs and £35 for potatoes, making a total of £260 out of this 50-acre farm. At that particular time I consulted some people who had been engaged in fruit growing, and not even those of them who had very much larger farms than 50 acres had got even £20 for fruit during the year.  That, while being a very interesting lecture or play or whatever the Minister might like to call it, was unquestionably propaganda for the Government agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>I might say, in order to disabuse anybody who had any views in that respect, and who did not notice one sentence in it, that the outgoings amounted to £110, of which wages accounted for £65.  That is approximately 25/- per week for wages.  He got £40 for beet, £52 for fruit, £40 for eggs and £35 for potatoes for 25/- per week in wages.  Going on to explain what he had to pay for annuities, he said: &ldquo;God be good to the long fellow, he reduced the annuities by half.&rdquo;  Fearing anyone might think that he was a Government supporter, he introduced this disrespectful observation with regard to the leader of the Government.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am not satisfied from the various programmes which we have got that they are up to the standard of other countries. We pride ourselves upon our culture as exemplified in music, in lectures, or in finished performances of that kind.  Our programmes certainly do not compare with programmes from other countries.  If we switch on to Spain, Italy, Germany, CzechoSlovakia or Great Britain, each and all of them have one characteristic in common&mdash;there is a certain naturalness about them.  Our broadcasting station, whether the Minister likes it or not, seems to strive after effect. Take, for example, the news.  Various descriptions precede the news items such as: &ldquo;What happened to-day.&rdquo; It is not necessary to say that.  We all know what happened when we hear the news.  The news item should be brief.  It is not necessary to give descriptions beforehand as to the headings. We shall arrive at them when they come along.  If we think our country is as important as others, we ought to get the home news first. There is no necessity for giving foreign items and particulars from the end of the earth and then, at long last, something that affects ourselves.  If they are of importance at all, our local news items should be more interesting to us than those of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I suggest to the Minister also that if we do take a pride in national institutions we ought to take pride in what is called our national anthem? It ought to be rendered on the one day in the year that we regard as our own day, the festival of our patron Saint on something else than a gramophone record.  That record, goodness knows, ought to be nearly worn out. To anybody who has been accustomed to drill at any time, however imperfectly, it is obvious that one would have almost to jog to keep up with the speed at which it is played upon certain occasions.  Whoever is responsible for striking off at the precise period carries on a note or two from the next bar or whatever description of music it is that should follow.  Certainly <Col N="383" /> on an occasion like that when we have first-class bands in this country, private bands throughout the city, and at least two State bands, those listening in to our station from other countries as well as our own people who are listening in here have a right to say that if the national anthem is to be played it should be played by something else besides a gramophone record.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been congratulated on the programme that is presented and on the work of the director.  I agree there has been an improvement, but whether the Minister or the director is responsible for it, it is an improvement at very considerable cost.  I have here the Estimates for 1932-33 for broadcasting.  The first item in that Estimate is:&mdash;Salaries, wages and allowances, £9,300.  Let us look at the figure for this year and we find that salaries, wages and allowances amount to £15,700.  That is a pretty considerable increase.  Mind you, it has nothing to do with the performances. It may have to do with other matters, with things that make performances successful.  The next item is the cost of the programmes. The figure down for 1932-33 is £14,700. The figure for the present year is £18,600.  So that the cost of the programme has not gone up by quite £4,000 in the four years, whereas salaries, wages and allowances are up by £6,400.  I think people are entitled to better value than that.</P>
    <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to another feature of the broadcasting station.  I do not know whether the Minister listens-in or not, or whether he listens to the Dublin or other stations.  But it appears to me that Dublin has a poor wave length or whatever it may be called.  There is another station on the wave length quite close to Dublin.  Perhaps I might say there are three stations close to it.  The first is Droitwich, which is very clear; the second is a German station, very clear too; and the third is an Italian station which has a very good reception.  Whether it is the wave length machine or plant or whatever else is the cause, the defect ought to be looked into.  The <Col N="384" /> Minister has two or three wave lengths.  If he had one good one he might be able to dispose of the other two at knock-down prices to someone else.</P>
    <P>There is another important item to which I wish to draw attention.  The Minister has a very valuable instrument, a piano, which cost a lot of money.  I might mention that it does not appear to suit this studio.  It has a tinny sound.  It is a very good piano but it has this defect.  Occasionally in the Continental stations one hears the same defect, but there are some stations from which very good piano sounds come.  This instrument may be a very good one, but it does not suit. The Minister might see whether a change might not be effected and whether a piano costing a smaller sum might not suit better.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister last year in connection with harp music.  He then promised he would have more renderings of harp music.  I did not hear any of them this year&mdash;I do not know about St. Patrick's Day.  An item to which I want to refer is in connection with the reception of the voice of the lecturers.  Whether it is that the distance that people are advised to stand from the microphone is not enough or whether it is that they stand too far away from the microphone I do not know, but one rarely hears a worse reception from British or Continental stations than one hears from the stations in this country.  That may be a defect that could be rectified.  On the question of lectures, stories or plays, there is a disposition on the part of people whether they wish it or not to exhibit the slave mind.  I know that the Minister exercises some sort of censorship.</P>

      <P>He exercises some censorship.  People ought to have grown out of that during the last 12 or 14 years.  It is not necessary.  It does us no credit, and it can be easily eliminated certainly from that studio. There were some lectures given recently on the radio&mdash;I do not know whether it was from Droitwich or not. <Col N="385" /> They were delivered within the last few months.  They were a series of lectures by scientists.  There were two which were of outstanding importance, and one of these referred to the Tennessee Valley Authority.  The other was in respect of a new prison scheme in Soviet Russia.  I cannot now remember the name of that scheme.  In the case of the Tennessee Valley Authority, although it was highly scientific the lecture had a certain amount of historical value, and it apparently was given by a man who had made a most complete study of the whole affair.  It was one of those matters that at the moment are the subject of court proceedings in America.  But the scheme was gigantic, something completely out of the ordinary in so far as popular information was concerned.  There may be some people who would say that a lecture like that was highbrow.  It was nothing of the sort.  It was a great scheme involving hydro-electric power and involving information and inquiry into the rainfall for a period of 1,000 years.  There was also instruction as to how it was possible to get that information.  There was information about the endeavour to stop the rolling off of the soil which had been going on through flooding.  The scheme was one of general importance, and it was much more than merely dealing with unemployment. I do not know whether it would be possible for the Minister to provide lectures such as these in our broadcasting station.  I support the views that have been expressed by Deputy Dillon, by saying that we have enough politics without having them introduced into the broadcasting station. The Minister would be well advised to clear out of the station the politics that have come into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in support of what Deputy Cosgrave has said in connection with the National Anthem.  I referred to this last year.  The National Anthem which was being played then, so far as I could understand, was an American interpretation of the National Anthem. That was what we were getting at that time through the medium of the radio. After that complaint of mine was made, <Col N="386" /> that record was not played for a considerable time, and we had a rendering by the No. 1 Army Band under Colonel Brasé.  That was an immense improvement, but the one that is being played now is an absolute disgrace.  It is the Irish National Anthem played in best jazz time.  I would prefer not to hear that rendering of the National Anthem.  I do agree that the Station Orchestra ought to play the National Anthem, or we might have some record by an Irish band, so as to get a really Irish interpretation of it.</P>
      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Dillon has said about the radio artistes who do not live in the vicinity of Dublin.  As in everything else, Dublin has a monopoly in radio engagements. There are artistes all over the country just as good as there are in Dublin, and they do not get a chance because they are handicapped.  Dublin artistes get a fee for appearing, and they have not to pay any expenses out of it.  The consequence is that various people who are living in the provinces have refused or they have not made an effort to get in touch with the broadcasting station because of the question of the expense incurred in travelling to Dublin. There is another matter, and that is the question of the breakdown or interruption of the programme.  On some occasions we have a breakdown or an interruption in Athlone.  After two or three minutes the station comes on again, but nobody says there has been a breakdown, and nobody makes anything like an apology.  In the case of breakdowns in other stations, an explanation is given when they are made right again.  That never happens in the case of Athlone, and nobody knows what really happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what has been said about the improvement in Radio Athlone. Certainly the news feature now is infinitely better than it was before Dr. Kiernan took up control.  I think, as a matter of fact, that the 6.45 news feature is far better than the English feature at 6 o'clock.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  In Wexford it is absolutely impossible to get Athlone for one of the four or five hours it is working at night.  I do not know whether that will be improved in the <Col N="387" /> near future by reason of the fact that the Minister is going to increase the power of the station.  I do not know where the fault is, but I think the complaint is general so far as the Wexford area is concerned.  I hope that the increased power will have the effect of providing better reception in the Wexford area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point to which I wish to draw attention. There are through the country a big number of wireless sets which are not being used.  They have neither connections nor batteries, but the Minister insists on collecting a licence fee in respect of them.  Some of those sets are made of polished timber and they form attractive pieces of furniture in a room, but whether aerials, batteries, or any of the working parts are missing, the Minister insists on the licence fee being paid.  I think he should be satisfied when there is a guarantee given that the set has not been working for a year or two and that some of the parts are missing, and should not insist on collecting the fee. I know of cases where it has been stated that if you have any one part of a set in your house you must pay the fee, and I think that should not be the case.  Some of these sets are nicely built, and, although old-fashioned and out of date, they are pieces of furniture and I think it is a hardship that people should be compelled to throw these sets out as scrap or pay the licence fee. That is the one matter I want to raise, and I hope the Minister will do something about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for doing the actual censoring, because if the responsibility lies with an official of the broadcasting office, I think his terms of reference should be amended in some way.  Exception has been taken to some of the things dealt with by the President in his St. Patrick's Day performance.  The suggestion is that these statements were Party statements.  I take exception to three or four points in his broadcast, not because what he said was pro his own Party, or because what he said was likely to be injurious to any other Party in this country, but because his statements were contrary to what I think are the best interests of international relations.</P>
      <P>I had a short time ago to protest against the President on a previous occasion inviting the United States Government to squeeze Great Britain as hard as they could in connection with war debts.  His broadcast to the United States on St. Patrick's Day practically invited that again.  I object to that for two reasons.  Firstly, there is a war debt problem.  The present Government may, or may not, have a policy in connection with it.  If they have a policy in connection with it, we ought to know it, and he ought not, in a casual and disruptive kind of way, deal with a problem, which is a world problem gravely affecting international political and economic relations, by a national broadcast on the national festival and indicate to the world that this country is against a sensible and realistic settlement of that particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it is an interference in the name of a race that is, at any rate, supposed to have a very great influence among a large section of the citizens of the United States.  It is an entry into internal United States politics. <Col N="389" /> Various statements by highly-placed and responsible American officials and politicians have recently indicated that they have a progressive and mellowing attitude with regard to the settlement of the world war debt problem.  There are sections of people in America who do not want anything but a rigid pound for pound settlement of these debts, irrespective entirely of the effect the presence of this problem has on international political and economic relations. It is throwing in an unwarranted way the weight of the influence, as it were, of the Irish nation, in so far as the President in a national broadcast on the national festival can do it, on one side of what may be, and no doubt is, an internal political question in the United States.</P>
    <P>The third point to which I object in his statement is his suggestion to European nations that the people of this country could help them in settling their present-day problems.  If the President and members of the Government have any conception at all of the spirit that is troubling the various nations in Europe, and of the difficulties that confront them, both externally and amongst themselves, it is a disgraceful thing to suggest to them that they are going to save themselves by anything but the evangelising which they can do on one another or by their own efforts; it is a disgraceful thing to suggest that they can rely on the people of Ireland in any way to help them in their difficulties, because we are doing nothing but creating for ourselves with our eyes open all the disruptions and all the disturbances which the European people have created for themselves in the past. Politically, we are going to have as many Parties in the country before long as there are Parties represented in the French Chamber of Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking seriously about what is a fact.  We are busily pursuing policies in this country to create another Alsace-Lorraine, as if we had not experience enough of what it means to more than one country in Europe to have that position created. <Col N="390" /> I think whoever is responsible for carrying out whatever censorship is carried out ought to have some additional instructions, and I should like to ask whether the President's broadcast on St. Patrick's Day was examined by this official censor or not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kehoe addressed himself to some of the remarks that Deputy McGilligan had to make last night on some of the historical broadcasts. I do not wish to comment in any way on them, but I do want to remark that it is a surprising thing that when the Minister for Finance has to stand up here in this House, recalling certain circumstances, to declare that Deputy Cosgrave did establish majority rule in this country, we should be having broadcasts of the escape of people who were in arms against this House.  I think there are quite sufficient historical episodes to broadcast without going into the 1922 period to attempt to glorify, to use a word that the Deputy used, episodes of that particular kind.  I am quite sure that we are not going to have a broadcast from the Minister for Finance on his attempt to rescue prisoners from Mountjoy Jail and if we are not going to hear the Minister for Finance on an important historical subject like that, I do not think that there is anybody else in the country we ought to hear.  The veil could be quite easily drawn over these gallant episodes for another period.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I do not want to allow to go entirely unchallenged the statement of Deputy Dillon that political issues should be rigorously excluded from broadcasting.  It does not appear to me that that is a reasonable statement to make.  We want the people of this country to think about political issues, as apart from merely always acting on strictly Party lines or under the influence of strong personal emotions or prepossessions. One of the best ways of getting people to think if they have got radios in their houses is to have calm, concise <Col N="391" /> discussions on specific issues over the radio.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dillon said that people do not want such discussions.  I do not know on what they based that statement. I believe that in this matter as in other matters affecting the choice of programmes the Director of Broadcasting can use his own judgment as to what would prove interesting and popular and what would not.  What really matters is not that political issues should be completely excluded, but that when they are presented they should be presented with fairness to all shades of opinion.</P>
      <P>I think as a matter of fact that apart from the interest of such discussions to listeners, they would be of considerable value to politicians because talking over the radio is a very useful discipline for a politician. Clap-trap and personalities do not come at all well over the radio.  If you are going to make a favourable impression over the radio you have got to do your best to talk sense, to talk calmly, persuasively, and in an objective manner, about the issue you are discussing.  I do not want at all to urge that an undue quantity of political matter should be introduced into our radio programmes, but on the other hand, I would ask that the Minister should not fall in with the suggestion of Deputy Dillon that domestic political issues should be rigorously excluded, except at the time of a general election.  I think that when issues of special interest are shortly to be dealt with by the Parliament of the country, it would be valuable to have such issues placed before the people by means of the radio, by speakers who are competent so to place them.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would allow me to address one query to him which I forgot when I spoke previously.  I should like to know if it is proposed to continue the feature known as &ldquo;Newcomers' Hour.&rdquo;  I think it is the most appalling form of entertainment we have in the whole programme.  If it is proposed to continue this feature, I should like to know whether the <Col N="392" /> Minister or those responsible will take steps to see that the people who come before the microphone during the Newcomers' Hour will be called upon to pass some test before they are allowed to inflict themselves on people who are listening-in, in the country. I think anybody who has listened on many occasions to this feature of the Newcomers' Hour will agree with me that it is a most appalling performance. I have heard superior performances at fairs up and down the country.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of joining in the well-merited praise extended to the Minister and his Depart ment in connection with wireless broadcasting, but having heard the statement, just made by Deputy Morrisey I feel obliged to rise to ask the Minister not to accede to the request put forward by Deputy Morrissey.  I think the introduction of the Newcomers' Hour has been of great good and has been a great boon.  While some of the talent that appeared may not meet with the approval of Deputy Morrissey, I believe that a good deal of new talent has been discovered in the country as a result of this feature. After all the public is the best judge in the long run, and in order to get the public to judge, this Newcomers' Hour in itself provides a good test. I hope the Minister will not at all accede to Deputy Morrissey's request to have that Newcomers' Hour taken away.  I am surprised that Deputy Morrissey, with his background, should suggest that this innovation is not a good one, because, after all, there are many poor persons all over the country who would never get an opportunity of exhibiting whatever talent they possess if it were not for the Newcomers' Hour.  Whatever hopes they might have for the future, or whatever talent they might possess which would require development, they would never get a chance if it were not for a feature of this kind. I hope that the Minister will very definitely tell Deputy Morrissey that this feature will not be discontinued.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy said is a complete misrepresentation <Col N="393" /> of what I stated.  I asked that if the feature were going to be continued, there should be some preliminary test before performers are allowed to go to the microphone.  If it were possible, I should like to have a pair of earphones affixed to Deputy Briscoe's ears every time this feature was being broadcast for the last twelve months. Any person in this country who has talent, no matter how poor he may be, will I am sure be given every opportunity by the broadcasting authorities, but surely, in order to discover one person who has talent or who is a fairly good singer, we ought not to be asked to give up an hour of our very short broadcasting programme to try-cut fourteen or fifteen of the most appalling performers it is possible to hear.</P>

      <P>To start where we left off, Deputy Morrissey asked about the &ldquo;Newcomers' Hour.&rdquo;  We have had proof here that there is a difference of opinion about that item.  The whole difficulty about broadcasting is that there is no way of getting an opinion you could rely upon about anything save by having a plebiscite of listeners. I agree that a good part of the &ldquo;Newcomers' Hour&rdquo; is not up to a high standard, but I think that the idea behind it is excellent.  There is some sifting done.  I understand that all sorts of aspirants come along.  I may be saying something which I should not say when I tell the House that only about 20 per cent. of those who offer are accepted.  That may speak badly for the musical talent of the country.  We are satisfied, however, that we have some very good singers and, as this experiment continues, there will, I hope, be a certain rivalry between different districts, resulting in the elevation of the musical standard of the country.  This feature was not introduced on my initiative.  The director was responsible for introducing it and I approve of it.  I think it is a good feature.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot does not agree with Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Dillon on the question of the broadcasting of political debates.  I agree with Deputy MacDermot.  As he pointed out, the resulting discipline would be very useful. I should have no objection, personally, if a political debate could be arranged, from time to time, between accredited speakers of different Parties.  I think it would lead to a much higher standard of political controversy than we have.  If we had a microphone here and if people who are prone to forget themselves in debate knew that what they were saying was being transmitted to the people outside, we might have a higher tone introduced into our discussions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy wanted to know where the responsibility for censorship lies.  I am responsible for everything that happens at the broadcasting station but I have never interfered with the actual censorship.  As regards the remarks of Deputy McGilligan, I was going to say that I was sorry that he was not here but I shall not say that because, in his absence, there has been a different tone in the debate.  The members of the Opposition have made their case in a very fair way.  I should be very disappointed if nothing resulted from this debate but a lot of praise.  I myself am not perfectly satisfied with the station.  I admit that there is room for improvement and the Director realises that, too.  Deputy McGilligan started off by saying that he was not quite sure whether what he was going to say happened but all the same he insinuated that it did happen.  He suggested that the script of a person who intended to broadcast was changed on occasion and that when he came before the microphone it even happened that it was blacked out.  I have made inquiries since and I have found that that has never happened. Only on one occasion in recent times has any person objected to reading a paper because of censorship.  On that occasion, the censorship was at the instance of an official who insisted on the deletion of what he considered a rather offensive expression&mdash;an expression that ought not to be broadcast. The person who proposed to give the lecture thought otherwise and, as he was not prepared to change the script, he had to walk out.  When on inquiry this morning I heard the particular word to which exception was taken, I agreed that the official was perfectly right in not allowing it to be broadcast.  I have never attempted to interfere in the censorship at the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point about the President's broadcast, no official in the Government service would have the right to censor what the head of the State would propose to broadcast.  I think that it would be impertinent to suggest that any official should have the right to censor the address to be delivered by the President.  I do not <Col N="396" /> agree with the interpretation placed by Deputy Mulcahy on the broadcast which the President thought fit to make on St. Patrick's Day.  I think it was quite a dignified statement, setting out the developments during the year.  I listened-in and was very pleased with the broadcast, as I think anybody who had the interest of this country at heart would be.  Deputy Belton made a frivolous complaint about the interruption of a hurling broadcast for the purpose of hearing Dr. Mannix.  I am as much interested in hurling as Deputy Belton is.  I played as many matches as he ever did and I was listening-in to the broadcast of the match in question.  I enjoyed the broadcast very well and I was anxious to hear the end of it and did hear it.  I had, however, no objection to the interruption. I thought that Dr. Mannix's address was a perfectly proper one and the reception was perfect.  On that question, Deputy Belton spoke for himself and a few people who were in the room with him but I think the vast majority of the people of the country would agree with me, that what was said was what ought to be said on an occasion like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said last night, referring to the winning of first prize at the Show by Deputy Cosgrave's bull, that he could not conceive of such an item being suppressed.  Somehow or other, he did conceive it, although nobody else conceived it.  I heard that item of news broadcast and I was delighted to hear that an animal owned by the ex-President should have commanded such a high price during the economic war.  In dealing with Deputy McGilligan, I must try to be charitable because I do not think he can help himself&mdash;I do not think that it is his fault.  Some people have remarked that they thought he was born that way but I think that would be in the nature of blasphemy.  I think that the nurse put some vinegar in his milk when he was a baby and that he has been generating venom ever since.  If he did not emit some of it now and again, he would collapse completely.  I hope that some of these explosions will do him good physically.</P>

      <P>Does it matter what the time was?  It was the first item that was broadcast.  There was no more in that suggestion of Deputy McGilligan than there was in his other suggestion that I instructed the Station Director, whom he started off by praising, to censor people's opinions and black out their statements before the microphone. I should like to remind the House that the present Director of Broadcasting holds a very responsible position in the Civil Service and was only seconded to our Department.  If the Minister were to deal with him in that way, I am sure he would not remain in the office another day.  I had better pass from that.  You know why the thing happened now; the man cannot help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to Deputy Holohan's statement, it is laid down in the Wireless Telegraphy Act that all sets must be licensed.  How are we to know that they are not being used when the collector is not knocking about?  As to the National Anthem, there is a division of opinion even in my own house on that.  I do not like it, but I am not an authority on the question. I am assured that a new rendering is to be produced soon, when I hope Deputies and others will be satisfied. Another point raised by Deputy Corish was in connection with the fees paid to country people coming to broadcast. I do not agree with what was said.  As <Col N="398" /> is well known we have, in order to cater for artistes from the country, arranged regional broadcasts which is a new development and as far as I know the first of its kind in any country.  We are bringing the radio to the people in the country. Voluntary committees have been set up in different parts.  I understand that Wexford has broadcast twice, and that Roscommon will be on the air to-night. It is a very good feature, and I am sure that people in charge of choral and dramatic societies are a better authority than individuals who consider that so-and-so is not a good singer.  The societies will not be prepared to ask people to take part in a programme unless they feel that they will do credit to a particular district. In that way I think the point made by Deputy Dillon is very well met.  As far as we can we will have regional broadcasts, and every facility will be given to bring forward native talent.  We may not get a very high standard in the beginning, but I am perfectly certain that as the service grow we will develop a very high standard of Irish music.  Dublin has not a monopoly.  I do not think we would be justified in paying the travelling expenses of people from the country who desire to broadcast or who ask for a date.  The Director tries to fit in a date with a time when these people may have business in Dublin.  He tries to facilitate them in that way.  I do not think we would be justified in giving extra fees for a performance that might be worse than we could get from other people.</P>
    <P>When breaksdown occur occasionally I think there is generally an apology. If not, there ought to be.  I have often heard apologies broadcast when a breakdown occurs.  Breaksdown are due to small technical faults, and as long as the wires are overhead they are inevitable.  I believe that Wexford has not good reception on occasions, but when the wave-length is increased to 100 kilowats the reception will be more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave had a good deal to say about bad lectures and good lectures.  There you are again.  We will have to differ about these things.  My own opinion is that there are good <Col N="399" /> lectures and bad lectures.  The one that I might consider to be a bad lecture, Deputy Mulcahy might consider a good one.  There is one thing we will have to agree upon&mdash;and I said it in this House on two or three occasions&mdash;and that is that no station in the world will suit everyone all the time.  If a person were to sit down at night and to listen-in for four hours to our station, and for the same length of time the next night to the B.B.C. or some other stations, I guarantee he would be fed up.  If people want to enjoy the radio my advice to them is to select the programmes they want to hear.  I do not know anything about the &ldquo;tinny&rdquo; piano that was referred to.  Deputy Cosgrave says it is a valuable one but that it has a tinny sound now.  The Broadcasting Director will look after that matter, as it may want tuning.  I do not know how often the harp is played from the studio&mdash;too often, perhaps, for my taste.  A sum of £6,000 is put down as salaries for the station orchestra.  Up to 1932 the members were not on a permanent basis, so that when that £6,000 is included in the Estimate it accounts for the big difference in the figures.  Previously, the orchestra was not on a permanent basis.  I do not know if Deputy Cosgrave objected, but he complained that we were spending more than in 1932. Perhaps I am taking him up wrong. I think the general complaint is that we are not spending enough.</P>

      <P>That seems to be the general complaint.  On that I can say definitely that the new Director was told that within reasonable limits any requirements would be met.  I asked him about this and he is satisfied that he is not hampered for want of money. I can tell the House that he will not be hampered within reasonable limits. Within the year it was not possible to have a very big extension such as was planned, but I hope next year we will have a big improvement.</P>

      <P>It would appear under &ldquo;programmes.&rdquo;  I think it was called the station sextet.  That was before we got the permanent orchestra. Deputy Cosgrave said that the programmes were not up to world standard. I do not agree with the Deputy. I think, on the whole, our station is as good as stations in other countries. The test is to listen-in for three or four hours.  It will be found that what pleases some people will not please others.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the Government aired their views on the radio. In my opinion the Government has not taken sufficient advantage of the broadcasting station to try to put across legislation concerning the agricultural and the economic policy which has passed into law.  Once that has happened these things are above Party.  We are certainly trying to encourage wheat growing and beet growing.  My complaint is that Ministers have not availed of the broadcasting station sufficiently to impress upon the people the necessity of giving effect to the legislation that has been passed and of co-operating with the Government in that legislation.  I have no apologies to make there.  I complain of their carelessness in not availing of broadcasting.  I think the Minister for Agriculture had practically to be dragged to the station, and also the Minister for Lands.  Why should we not ask Ministers to broadcast on what is the law of the country?  There is no Party politics about that.  We have certainly not put anything of a Party nature on the air.  After the Budget was introduced last year Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Good and others were asked to give their views on it, and no attempt was made by anyone to interfere with what they had to say.  I remember one of the first interviews I had with the new director, at which he mentioned certain names of very prominent political opponents of the Government whom, he said, he proposed to ask to broadcast occasionally.  When he asked me if I had any objection I said I certainly had not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that unless people were tarred with the brush of the political Party in power they rarely <Col N="401" /> got a chance to broadcast.  Well, of course, all the most intelligent people are on our side and I suppose that explains it.  I can tell the House that, as long as I have responsibility, there will be no attempt to restrict the choice of speakers.  The only censorship that has been attempted at the station is the kind of censorship that I have already mentioned.  Deputy Belton said that nobody was interested in Archbishop Mannix's statement.  Did anyone ever hear such cheek?  I suppose the Deputy and the few fellows he had in the room with him listening-in were not interested, but certainly his statement does not apply to the vast majority of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kehoe asked me to eliminate jazz.  I confess I would like to do it if I could because I do not like it.  I have received some complaints about it, but I think that on the whole there is not so much jazz broadcast now. Deputy MacDermot wanted to know what jazz is.  Deputy Kehoe gave him a definition, but I do not know whether it is a correct one or not.  As I have said, I do not like jazz and I would like to see it eliminated altogether, but I am afraid we will not be able to do that.  Deputy Kehoe also said that we should introduce an improvement in the Children's Hour.  We are going ahead in that direction and we are having broadcasts to the schools.  Of course, we are only at the beginning so far as that is concerned, but we hope to extend these weekly broadcasts and are doing all we can in that direction. The Deputy referred to the question of lectures from places of historic interest, such as Clonmacnoise and Vinegar Hill.  That suggestion will be considered.  If it is possible to lay lines to these places, we hope to be able to arrange for suitable lectures from them.</P>
    <P>Some very good lectures have been given from the station.  Some of them were mentioned in my opening statement and referred to as &ldquo;great moments in Irish history.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan who asked a question on this knew very well that these did not refer to the prison escapes.  They were lectures on the coming of St. Patrick, <Col N="402" /> the 1916 Rising, which is of real historic interest, and to other events. Speaking for myself, I may say that I was not too pleased with the broadcasts dealing with the prison escapes. What I felt was that the veil might well have been drawn over them.  I was not consulted about them, although, of course, I am responsible for everything that is broadcast.  I may say, however, that if my advice had been asked before the broadcasts were given, I would have said that a lot of these things might well be left unsaid until we are all dead, and then let others, if they think it well to do so, talk about them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked if it would be possible to have a journal published in connection with the broadcasting service.  There is a good deal, of course, involved in that.  I would like to have a journal if it were possible to have one.  First of all, it might involve us in very heavy cost, and all that I can do at the moment is to promise that the matter will be considered. If I am able to get round my colleague the Minister for Finance I will see what we can do.  At any rate, I promise that the suggestion will be examined into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the question of the establishment of a philharmonic orchestra.  That whole question is being considered, and I hope that it may be possible to do something along the lines suggested.  With regard to his point about getting the people who appear at the celebrity concerts to broadcast, I understand that they are under contract not to broadcast when they come here.  I can assure him that whenever the opportunity presents itself of engaging famous people to broadcast, we will do our best to get them.  Deputy Dillon also said that the views of people of distinction no matter how radical, should be ventilated in public. That is a rather controversial matter to deal with.  I do not think the Deputy or anybody would absolve me from complete responsibility if I gave people a free rein to say what they liked over the ether.  I am responsible for what is broadcast, and what the Deputy has suggested might <Col N="403" /> be a rather dangerous thing to do.  I cannot say that I agree with him.  I might think it a desirable thing to do if I did not happen to be the Minister, but while I am Minister if any unfortunate incident occurred I can anticipate the bombardment that I would get from all sides.  In my official capacity I hesitate to say that I am prepared to agree with him.  Deputy Morrissey complained about the programmes, and said the reason they were not better was because the station was being starved for want of money. That is not so at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically everyone admits that there has been an improvement in the programmes.  The station, I admit, is not as perfect as it might be.  There is always room for improvement whether you are thinking of a broadcasting station or anything else.  If things are not as good as they might be it is not due to the want of money.  I have not heard many complaints about the programmes. On the whole Deputies seem to be well pleased with them.  It has to be remembered that we are only a year working under the new conditions.  If the Director puts up proposals for an extension of the programme or for a better programme, they will not be rejected for want of money.  I do not admit that the station is anything at all as bad as the Deputy wanted to imply in his statement.</P>

      <P>Well, then, what is wrong?  The Deputy also asked for longer programmes on Sundays.  I agree with him about that.  He asked what was the result of the appeal that was made to listeners about the Sunday programme, whether they would like to have the programme of gramophone music broadcast from 3 to 5 or from 1 to 3 p.m.  I may tell him that very little interest was taken in that appeal although we have 85,000 licence holders.  About 300 voted for 3 to 5 p.m., and these were <Col N="404" /> mostly from the rural areas, and 200 voted for 1 to 3 p.m., most of the voters being from the cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a technical question to the Minister.  Can he say whether the station has received complaints of a recurrent hum in the diffusion from Athlone?  It is not heard in any Continental station, or in any English station, but it is very marked on occasions in the Athlone station.  People find that when reception is very good from Athlone, it is often very much disfigured by this recurrent hum which distorts the programme, and is, apparently, due to some defect in the broadcasting apparatus.  I am interested to know if the Minister has received complaints from any other centre from that in which I happen to live and listen in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKeogh" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kehoe has just said, he raised that question when speaking.  It was one of the things that I forgot to deal with when replying.  I am informed that this is probably due to interference from other stations, due to over-crowding. That is our information.  We have technical people examining this question. A shake of the head from the Deputy is not going to settle it.  I am making that statement on advice&mdash; that this hum is due to over-crowding. Other stations are also subject to this interference.  The Deputy may shake his head, but I am prepared to accept advice from people who are in a better position to know than Deputy Dillon or myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the short-wave suggestion, I believe it would be a very heavy cost and it is not necessary for national <Col N="405" /> broadcasting; possibly for international broadcasting it would be.  The way I feel about the matter is that when we reach the high pitch which I expect we will reach very shortly, then I shall become very enthusiastic about getting a high-power station.  I quite admit we are doing well, but, as Deputy Haslett says, there are other heights to conquer.  I quite agree, and I expect when we have them conquered there will be still others.  When we get to the stage of perfection that everyone will know it must be Ireland that is on the air, then perhaps we will become very keen on getting a short-wave station, but we can do without it until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cordially appreciate the frank manner in which the Minister has answered various questions, but he must not rebuke me for shaking my head, because Deputy Kehoe was also shaking his head with equal vigour behind him.  May I suggest that while his experts may give him expert opinion on how to work the wireless station, Deputy Kehoe and I can give him a very much better opinion as to what comes out of the receiving set? That there is a hum of this character from Athlone is certain, and that the same kind of hum does not come from Continental or English stations is equally certain.  That may be due to the idiosyncrasies of the Counties Wexford and Mayo, but that that does exist is unquestionably true.  Does such a complaint come from other counties, and, if so, would it not be well to get some external expert to come and examine the problem and indicate whether he confirms the view expressed by the Irish experts, that it is due to overcrowding, or perhaps throw some new light on the question?</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £443,600 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and of certain services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as compared with last year, there is a net decrease in connection with the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture of £333,060.  There are certain increases and certain decreases, and I would like to say a few words on the rather large items that make up these increases and decreases.  With regard to sub-head H&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture&mdash; there is an increase of £8,595, and this is entirely due to the cost of the distribution of cattle export licences, which has passed into the hands of these committees.  Under sub-head <Col N="407" /> OO (2)&mdash;Advances to the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund&mdash;there is an increase of £20,000.  This is due to the fact that it is anticipated there will be a larger export of butter during the first half of the year, and that fund will be overdrawn to the extent of £20,000 more than it was last year. The total amount will be completely paid back before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head O (8)&mdash;Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935&mdash;there is an increase of £10,606.  That Act was not in full operation for the whole of last year, but it will be in the coming financial year.  Under sub-head O (10)&mdash;Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Acts, 1933 and 1935&mdash;there is an increase of practically £200,000.  Last year there was only a token amount of £5, because the export of eggs and butter to the Continent was financed out of funds provided by the Newmarket Dairy Company.  It was thought more advisable to finance this completely out of moneys voted by the Dáil, so that the Dáil can see how this trade is being carried on.  The total amount will, it is expected, be paid back before the end of the financial year.  Sub-head O (12) deals with the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, 1934.  There is an increase of about £5,000.  Under the legislation passed a few years ago, the allotments scheme has been making progress and it is anticipated a larger amount will be spent during the coming year than during the present year.</P>
    <P>There are also decreases, and the first big decrease is under sub-head M (5)&mdash;Improvement of the Creamery Industry.  This sub-head deals with the purchase of proprietary creameries, the sale of those to co-operative societies; also the purchase of co-operative societies and the reorganisation and resale of those societies.  All that will cost £28,000 less than during the present year.  Sub-head O (9) deals with the Cereals Acts, and there is a decrease there of £295,000, mainly due to the elimination of the payment of wheat bounties out of voted moneys.  Under sub-head O (13)&mdash;Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts&mdash;there is a decrease of <Col N="408" /> £135,000.  Under this sub-head there is an increase under certain headings such as, for instance, the purchase of cattle for canning.  There will be an increase there of £37,000.  As regards the purchase of old cows, there will be an increase of £110,000.  On the other hand, there is a decrease under the heading of beef distribution and the amount of the decrease is £141,000. Then there is a decrease of about £140,000 in the case of the purchase of cattle for export.  The net result generally is that under that sub-head there is a decrease of £135,000.</P>
    <P>There are a few items also under the Appropriations-in-Aid.  As I have mentioned already, the total amount voted under the Dairy Produce (Stabilisation) Fund, £200,000, will be repaid before the end of the year.  It is necessary to finance the fund during the early part of the year.  There is a big export of butter during April, May and June. A bounty has to be paid on that butter and the levies collected would be very much in arrear until towards the end of the year.  As the levies come in towards the winter months, the fund becomes solvent and the amount advanced from the Exchequer can be repaid.  Under sub-head O (10)&mdash;Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Acts, there will be an Appropriation-in-Aid of £200,000, which, as I have already mentioned, is the total of the Vote for trading by the Government in agricultural exports.  Under sub-head O (13), there are Appropriations-in-Aid under the Cattle and Sheep Acts of £285,000 in levies, £200,000 for cattle exported, and £25,000 in respect of factory receipts for the cattle sold to the Waterford factory for the purposes of canning and meat extracts.  Under sub-head O (8)&mdash; Pigs and Bacon Act&mdash;there will be a receipt of £16,000.</P>
    <P>Now, to go further into the Cattle and Sheep Act, there are orders in preparation at the moment which will make a very substantial difference to the Estimates, as made out here. These Estimates, of course, as the House will understand, must be prepared under the existing legislation. An Order, however, is being prepared, which, if not nullified by the House, <Col N="409" /> will come into operation and will reduce the levy on cattle and sheep under that Act by half.  That will make a difference, presumably, of over £140,000 in receipts under that Act, if the Act runs for the full year.  There is also an Order being prepared which will increase the price to beef recipients under the scheme by 1d. per lb.  At the present time, the butcher who is supplying meat under that Act to recipients is getting 4d. per lb.  The butcher gets 2d. of that 4d. from the recipients and gets the other 2d. out of Government funds. Owing to the increase in the price of fat cattle, butchers have made a strong case to the effect that they cannot afford to supply beef, under the scheme, at that price, and I have agreed, in meeting with them some time ago, to increase the price by 1d. per lb. from the 1st April.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Other fundamental changes are contemplated in the whole scheme of beef distribution and collection of levies, but it is not necessary to dwell upon that question at the moment because these changes will necessitate legislation and will, therefore, come before the House for discussion in the ordinary course of events, I expect, before the end of this Session.  With regard to cattle, apart from what I have mentioned, there has been recently a considerable improvement in prices.  As a matter of fact, there appears to be no great difficulty in the export of cattle at the present time&mdash;I mean with regard to the getting of licences&mdash;and as far as I can find out, I think that a person with a licence to export a fat beast at the present time is unable to get any price for it.  He might get something small for it, but at any rate there is no price such as there was some time ago.  In fact, on getting a return of the number of cattle exported each month, and comparing that with the number of licences issued <Col N="410" /> for fat cattle each month, we find that a considerable number of these licences are not fully used.  It has appeared that there are certain farmers throughout the country applying for licences to the country committees of agriculture and getting these licences, but not using them. That may militate against us very strongly at a later period, because we find that there will be more cattle later on in the year than there will be licences to cover, and in that way I think that we ought, as far as possible, to try to get the cattle out while the licences are available.  I think that, in that connection, it will probably be necessary to keep people from applying for licences, unless they are going to use them, by making a small charge&mdash;possibly, a very small charge&mdash;for the licence, in order to prevent people applying for licences that they do not need.</P>

      <P>Naturally, one cannot be sure of what may happen, but it looks, as things are, as if we shall always be subject to some kind of restriction, even though we may have, at the moment, a sufficient quota and sufficient means of getting rid of our cattle, and even if we do not feel any great stress in that regard such as we felt two or three years ago.  The question, then, naturally arises whether we should restrict production in any way.  I think I mentioned here, on a former occasion, that various ways and means had been examined as to the best way of bringing the <Col N="411" /> number of cattle in this country down within reach of the available market at home and abroad, and it was then contemplated that there might be a registration of cows.  That, however, could only be done by methods which would entail many disadvantages.  In the first place, of course, it would interfere very much with the farmers' freedom of action and also it would be difficult to administer, and it would inevitably create hardship on individuals, because, no matter how a rule or regulation may be made, it is impossible to cover all the exceptional cases; and therefore it does inevitably create hardship on certain individuals. Therefore, I am hopeful that by the present methods of trying to eliminate the old cows and by the slaughter of a certain number of calves, production might be kept within certain limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps I agree with that, but I might not agree as to who should be slaughtered.  It must be remembered, however, that these are voluntary schemes, and that if a farmer thinks that he ought to keep his calf and get rid of his old cow, or to keep the old cow and get rid of the calf, he is at liberty to do so.  There is that much to be said for the scheme, at any rate.  From June next, it is expected that we may be able to get rid of about 1,800 old cows per week.  Up to the present it has been about 900 per week. Up to the present, we have been covering the country very slowly.  In fact, up to the present we have only done the counties of Kerry, Waterford, Clare and Galway; and at the rate we were going it would take us two or three years, or possibly more, to cover the whole country.  However, with the extensions that are being made to the factory, it will be possible to proceed much more quickly.  At the present moment we are starting in the County Mayo.  We may then do Donegal, Sligo <Col N="412" /> and Leitrim.  It is not expected that it will take very long to deal with these counties.  Then it is proposed to deal with Cavan and Monaghan, and then go on to Leinster.  We shall then have three very big creamery counties&mdash; Cork, Tipperary and Limerick&mdash;and they will take some time to deal with.</P>

      <P>After having made some progress in clearing out these old cows in the western counties, from Kerry upwards, it is hoped to do something in the way of following up a tuberculosis scheme, and, in that way, to make-some inroads on that problem with regard to our cattle.  During the year, the three Governments of the Saorstát, Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, agreed to adopt, simultaneously, means calculated to minimise, and eventually to eliminate, the trouble due to the warble fly.  Various calculations have been made and various figures have been given as to the great ultimate benefit that would accrue from the adoption of such measures; but even if we were only to calculate on the basis of a couple of shillings per hide, it would still be a great gain to the agricultural community to adopt such measures, even for the sake of two or three or four years' attention to the problem that exists at the moment.  It would be of benefit to the agricultural community to have these regulations enforced, even for two or three or four years.  The gain would not be confined entirely to the value of the hides, because Deputies here who have any experience of cattle in summer know they cannot thrive or improve while being annoyed by these flies and would naturally do much better if the flies were eliminated altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very big production of dairy produce during the year.  Production has been increasing during the last three or four years.  I think at the moment we have a larger number of cows in the 26 counties than ever we had before.  Taking creamery butter, 351,232 cwts. were exported in 1933, <Col N="413" /> and that figure went up to 473,152 cwts. in 1935.  At the same time exports of cream were reduced from 46,232 cwts. in 1933 to 33,461 cwts. in 1935, and of cheese increased from 609 cwts. in 1933 to 9,145 cwts. in 1935.  Creamery products as a whole have shown a considerable increase in export in 1934 over 1933, and in 1935 over 1934.  The position in regard to cheese is much better.  The total production of cheese in the four years was 2,590 cwts. in 1932, 18,166 cwts. in 1933, 24,498 cwts. in 1934, and 31,403 in 1935.  Now we are producing all the cheese we require and exporting 9,000 cwts.  To give an idea of the progress made in cheese production, our total output in 1932 was 2,500 cwts., and in 1935 it was 31,000 cwts.  We had a census made of our creameries in 1934, and as a result we got complete figures of the quantity of milk taken in by the creameries.  In that year 209,604,723 gallons were received and used as follows:&mdash;Butter - making, 197,436,340 gallons; cheese - making, 2,454,015 gallons; dried milk, 445,565 gallons; whole milk sales, cream sales and used for condensed milk, 9,268,803 gallons.</P>
    <P>The number of milk suppliers to creameries in that year was 82,370. The total value of milk products was £4,363,921, of which £3,551,847 was paid to suppliers, the difference representing the cost of production.</P>
    <P>By means of bounties under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts, 1932 and 1935, and subsidies out of the Vote for export bounties and subsidies, producers of creamery butter, cheese and other products received a much better average return on their home sales and exports than the world value as shown by the following prices of creamery butter during the last four seasons.  In 1932-33 the world value of Saorstát butter was 101/- per cwt.; the average f.o.r. price secured to creameries was 119/-. In 1933-34 the world value of Saorstát butter was 81/-; the average f.o.r. price to creameries 107/-.  In 1934-35 the world value of Saorstát butter was 73/6 per cwt.; the average f.o.r. price received by the creamery was 103/-. In 1935-36 the world value of our butter was 91/- per cwt.; the average f.o.r. price secured to creameries was 108/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual figure was £4,363,921.  The figures I have given represent the f.o.r. price secured to creameries for large consignments. Every creamery sells small lots locally, for which it obtains a better price, with the result that creameries averaged in 1935 about 110/- a cwt. on all their output&mdash;equivalent to 4.17d. per gallon for milk, the separated milk being returned to the supplier.  Many of the larger creameries paid a higher milk price as their working expenses per cwt. on butter were lower than the general average for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>4.17d. was the average price.  The export trade opened badly last year, the delivered price at the beginning of the season being only 77/- per cwt.  After May there was an improvement, month by month, until October, when an average price of 121/- was obtained.  The price fell to 108/- in November.  For the small quantities exported since December our creameries have obtained from 111/- to 114/- per cwt., which has been brought up to 129/- by means of subsidies. The price on the home market was maintained throughout the season at 139/- for large consignments and 143/- for small lots, equivalent to a retail price of 1/5 per lb.  The estimated revenue from levy on creamery products for the year is £498,000, which has been utilised in the payment of bounties on exports of butter, cream and cheese, etc.  In addition a sum of £660,000 was provided out of the Exchequer for subsidies and dairy produce generally. This sum was used to off-set the British duty on imports.  It is calculated that under the arrangements in force creamery farmers received for their butter during the season £613,000 more than if there were no duties on Saorstát products entering the United Kingdom, no levy and bounty under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act and no subsidies.  In other words, as a corresponding gain was secured on other products, the total <Col N="415" /> advantage of the Government's scheme to creamery farmers was not less than £650,000.</P>
      <P>Bounties and subsidies similar to those for creamery butter were paid on exports of factory and farm butter. The home price of non-creamery butter was also maintained at a comparatively high figure owing to the enhanced price at which creamery butter was selling.  It is computed that producers averaged 1½d. per lb. on their total sales of non-creamery butter more than the world value. The amount collected on levies on non-creamery butter and registration fees is estimated at £38,000, all of which has been expended on bounty on exports. It has been found from experience to be absolutely necessary to collect this levy.</P>
      <P>Also during the year there was a beginning made on the very difficult question of ordered marketing.  Deputies will remember that when the Price Stabilisation Bill was going through there was a clause in it that enabled the Minister for Agriculture to make a difference in the bounty paid to those who joined the ordered marketing scheme and those who remained outside.  Advantage was, taken of that clause of the Bill and a beginning was made rather late in the year with this scheme of ordered marketing. There was as little interference as possible, apart from the fact, of course, that a somewhat lower bounty was paid to those who remained outside, but as a result of the efforts that were made we had for the first time the experience of bringing the price for our butter higher than what was realised for New Zealand butter on the British market and holding it there. There have been occasions, of course, in the past when the price for Free State butter went above that for New Zealand butter, but very quickly fell below it again, and taking the year's average it always worked out lower. But from the time this scheme came into operation we brought our price up to the New Zealand price, gradually went a little above it, and held that position until the end of the season.</P>

      <P>It is hoped by those who have been operating that scheme that they will succeed this year in holding a higher price than New Zealand throughout the year.  If they only succeed in getting 5/- more through this marketing scheme&mdash;of course, I do not say that we can hope to hold that figure all the time, but it must be remembered that we were a few shillings under the New Zealand price &mdash;it would mean £100,000 a year to our dairy farmers, which is a very big item.  I hope also to see some improvement this year in the condensed milk business and in the milk powder business, both in regard to the volume of output and in regard to price.  Our exports of eggs for the year were lower than they were for the previous year.  There has been a continuous decline in our exports of eggs for six or seven years.  We must take serious note of this, and I am confident that we may be able to offer some inducement to poultry keepers this year to increase their output of eggs.

      <P>I did quote the figures, as a matter of fact, about a month ago. The census of pigs and bacon on the <Col N="417" /> 1st June, 1935, showed an increase over the previous year of 12.3 per cent., that is an increase from 968,413 to 1,087,679 pigs.  This increase in the number of pigs in the country is reflected in the number of pigs dealt with in the bacon factories.  In 1935, we had 1,062,000 pigs dealt with in the bacon factories. In 1932, which was a fairly normal year, the factories dealt with 744,000. The bacon export trade showed considerable expansion during the year, increasing by about 25 per cent. over the previous year.  In 1935, we exported 501,128 cwts., valued at £1,493,076. In 1934, we exported 401,702 cwts., valued at £1,288,694.  This is a very big increase in export, when it is remembered at the same time that our total home consumption is being supplied by our own factories.  As a matter of fact, even with this very big output which I have already quoted for the factories, 60 per cent. is still consumed by our own people and only 40 per cent. exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are the exports to?  Is the Minister in a position to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically entirely to Great Britain.  The arrangements which have been made for a bacon quota for the present year provide for an increase of ten per cent. on the exports for 1935.  The quality of our bacon is good, as everybody knows.  In fact it gets a price as high as the best English bacon, and sometimes something higher, on the British market. We hope that when the boards have got an opportunity of operating the Pigs and Bacon Act for a few years they may even improve the quality of and the marketing facilities for our bacon in Great Britain or other markets if they can find them.  Of course, in addition to bacon we also have a trade in the export of live pigs and pork.  The number of live pigs has gone down during the last few years because we had not a great number of pigs to spare after filling our export quotas and supplying the home market. The export of live pigs in 1935 was 126,640.  In 1932, which is about a normal year, the export was 303,234.  The export of live pigs varied, during the <Col N="418" /> previous ten years, from 300,000 to 400,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they calculated in our export quota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are.  The value of our live pigs exported in 1935 was £428,000.  Those live pigs are exported under a quota arrangement with Great Britain for conversion into bacon, and also as uncertified pigs.  A certain number are exported under certificates to be used by bacon factories in Great Britain, but apart from that, the pigs that go out to be killed for pork&mdash;what are called cutters&mdash;are not subject to the quota.  As a matter of fact, this trade in cutters absorbs a certain number of pigs which are not at all suitable for our own factories and would not be taken by them.  They are heavy, fat pigs.  The third form of our export trade in relation to the pig industry is the trade in fresh pork. In 1935 the figure was 140,000 cwts. and in 1932 it was 262,000 cwts.  There was no great fluctuation since 1932.  It would appear to be a rather stable trade for the last few years.  There was 26 factories dealing with this particular trade and I think that there are enough.  The reason why I say that is because there are a number of co-operative societies contemplating going into this pork trade, and I am afraid that if a large number of people were to go into this trade they would destroy any profits that there might be in it, and make it impossible both for those who are in it and those who come into it to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices realised for our fresh pork in Smithfield are practically the top prices for English pork, the occasional difference amounting to only about 2d. per stone of 8 lbs.  Since the Fresh Meat Act was passed the pork that is being shipped from this country under proper conditions has earned a very high reputation.  We are now in the position, taking pigs generally, that we are supplying in full our requirements at home and are maintaining or developing the export trade in bacon.  There is, of course, a certain amount of room for expansion but it is difficult to say how far that expansion could go.  It will also be noticed <Col N="419" /> from the figures I have mentioned that our exports of live pigs have gone down somewhat while our exports of bacon have gone up, and this, as far as it can be done, is a very desirable tendency as it creates a certain amount of employment here at home in the manufacture of pigs.  Taking the whole pig industry, the value of exports for the four years 1932 to 1935, taking bacon, live pigs, pork, and carcases to Northern Ireland, which trade is now practically wiped out, we exported in 1935 £2,275,000 worth; in 1934, £1,978,000; in 1933, £1,499,000 and in 1932, £2,373,000.  The Pigs and Bacon Act of 1935 was passed into law on the 20th of June and I want to say a word or two about the working of it.</P>

      <P>Pigs, pork, and bacon&mdash; the whole lot.  The principal influence of the Pigs and Bacon Act, as far as improving the condition of the farmers, is the grading that takes place in the bacon factories after slaughter.  That is supervised by Government inspectors. The prices fixed give every encouragement to farmers to produce pigs of the best quality.  The difference in price between the highest-class pig and the lowest is as much as 14s. per cwt.  That, of course, has been fixed by the curer and producer members on the Pigs Board.  Grades have been fixed bearing as close relation as possible to the value of the bacon produced from each class of pig.  There are already, as a matter of fact, indications that farmers are beginning to realise that it pays them better to produce the Class I.A. pig.  Returns which come monthly show more pigs each month going into Class I.A.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>By weight.  We have not got that.  As Deputies are aware, before the Act came into operation there were very acute fluctuations in the price of pigs&mdash;in fact, fluctuations from day to day, almost from factory to factory. Even on the same day we sometimes saw in the newspapers that one factory was offering one price and another factory another price.  That was one thing that we tried to remedy by this legislation, and the farmer now at least knows somewhat in advance what price he may get for his pigs in the market. The prices have been changed rather frequently since the Act came into operation, but it is hoped that, with more experience as regards the number of pigs coming in and of the working of the Act and the costings, it may not be necessary in a year or two years to change those prices nearly as often as at present.  It will be impossible, of course, to make one rate; that is, I am afraid we will always have more pigs in the autumn than any other time of the year.  If we have, it will always be necessary to have a lower price when pigs are plentiful than when they are scarce, because if the same price were to rule the whole year round, I am afraid we would have all the pigs in the autumn and none at other times of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with this Pigs and Bacon Act which it might be no harm to refresh Deputies' minds upon and that is the question of the hypothetical and the appointed prices.  I have been asked questions from time to time about that and I should like to say a word about it.  The hypothetical price is the price that the Board thinks would be paid for pigs if there was no Board; in other words, if there was ordinary demand and supply.  The appointed price is the price they think they ought to fix under the Act, taking into consideration all the things they were asked to take into consideration, such as the price of bacon, the amount of bacon in cold storage, the price of feeding stuffs for the previous four months and the other factors.  That is why <Col N="422" /> there has been sometimes some confusion between the hypothetical and the appointed price, and why they are different on occasions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make some reference to the system of marketing pigs in the form of carcases.  It is only done of course in the northern counties and it is a practice that has a great many disadvantages.  In the first place, when a farmer brings the carcases to the market he is compelled to sell them.  That was all right when there was no such thing as a production quota or an export quota.  But now, when the factories may be tied to producing only a certain amount difficulties have arisen in some cases. It would be much easier for the Board to deal with this matter if live pigs were being marketed instead of carcases.  Apart from that, the factories also claim, and I suppose we will agree with them, that they can kill pigs better than the farmer and that the pigs they kill in the factories are in a much better condition for conversion into bacon than the carcases of pigs killed at the farmer's house; brought on a cart to the fair or market, and on a lorry or something else to the factory.</P>
    <P>Another trouble in these areas is the fact that they have a breed of pig known as the Ulster pig.  Factories do not like these pigs and perhaps they have good reason for it. These pigs are inclined to be fatter than the Irish white pig.  Another objection is that when brought in as carcases they do not hold as well as if they were brought in alive.  That is, they are bad travellers and not able to stand up against any hardship</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think that the working of the Act has been as successful as one could expect in such a short time.  When these people came into control in the beginning there was a desperate situation facing them owing to the very large number of pigs. They had to try to keep up the price within some reasonable limits.  We were tied with regard to export and with regard to home consumption and it was extremely difficult to deal with the problem.  But in most parts of the country they had cleared up any <Col N="423" /> trouble there was within two or three weeks and since that things have gone smoothly.  Individual farmers of course may even still hold that they would prefer a free market and a free price.  I do not think that any farmers, I do not mind how many pigs he produces in the year, can have the same experience with regard to the weight of pigs at sight as the buyer. The buyer is at it every day in the week, and the farmers only occasionally. In most cases the buyer is likely to get the best of the bargain.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already about dressed pork.  There has also been a growing trade in dressed lamb for export which reached a record figure in 1935.  That also is fetching top prices in the export market.  It is classed as good as the English or any other lamb prepared for sale.  In the matter of sheep and lambs as in the case of bacon the home market is absorbing about two-thirds of our output. Now to deal with the cereals, I come to wheat first.  In 1932 the area under wheat was only about 20,000 acres.  In 1933, the first year in which the Government scheme of standard prices and bounty was in operation, the area under wheat increased to 50,000 acres.  That was sufficient to supply about 3½ per cent. of the output of the flour mills.  Of course, it must be remembered that the 20,000 acres grown in 1932 was grown mostly by farmers for their own use.  As far as we can calculate the produce of 20,000 acres is still mainly used by farmers for their own use and it is only the additional acreage that is put on the market.  As a result of the publicity given to this scheme, and also as a result of the experience gained by the neighbours of those who grew the wheat as to the prices realised in 1933, the acreage in 1934 reached 93,000 and in 1935 it went up to 163,000 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of the gross requirements was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 21½ per cent.  In 1935 as a result of the amending legislation introduced here, the farmers benefited.  They were paid in full for <Col N="424" /> their wheat crop when delivered.  That is they were paid the ordinary world prices and in addition to that the equivalent of the bounty in operation during the previous years.  I think that the farmers, pleased as they were by that arrangement, were inclined to make a very big increase in their acreage this year.  But as we know, the season for sowing wheat from October onwards was very unsuitable. The result was that the acreage under wheat at the end of February was not any higher than it had been in February last year.  There has been a very considerable amount of wheat sown during the month of March in spite of the unfavourable weather that we are having, and it is possible that there will be a slight increase in the acreage this year as compared with last year.</P>
      <P>We did take powers to see that the millers had provided storage for any wheat that might be offered during the autumn of last year, and we also took powers to see that they had drying plant in case there might be an excessively wet harvest.  Perhaps we directed too much attention to providing for a wet harvest and not enough to providing for a wet winter; but we must make that right in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not grow it in a greenhouse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The only source from which strong wheat seed can be got is either from Great Britain or from our own farmers who grew it last year.  I am referring to Red Marvel.  The wheat known as Wilhelmina can be got from the Continent. This year we did not have enough Red Marvel to supply our own requirements.  We must adopt a scheme here to supply this particular wheat seed from internal sources in future.  It will be necessary to amend further the cereal legislation, and it is quite probable that an amending Bill may be before this House in the course of the present Session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to explain that when the Bill comes along in due course.  I next come to tobacco growing. In 1933, when the restrictions on tobacco growing were relaxed, tobacco to the extent of nearly 1,000 acres was grown.  The growers realised 3/- to 6/- per lb.  That was a very fine price.  The growers did not realise that something would have to be done from many points of view to control the growing of tobacco.  In the first place they were only growing pipe-tobacco, and many of them were growing that indifferently.  We could only absorb pipe-tobacco here.  The intrinsic value of that tobacco was something like 1/- a lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on realities.  It was sold at the world price; some of it went as much as 1/3 a lb. and some of it as low as ld. a lb. Something had to be done to control the growing of tobacco, because at that price there would be very much more grown than our own consumers could absorb.  We could not possibly export it, and at that price there would be a huge loss. There would also be a heavy loss to the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give the revenue loss on the 1,000 acres grown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will later.  The Deputy can calculate the loss.  It is 800 times 1,000 acres at 9/4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nearly £400,000 loss on tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that would be the loss if there were 1,000 acres at 800 lbs. to the acre.  But I think the yield must have been much lower <Col N="426" /> than 800 lbs.  Legislation was introduced with the object of getting tobacco only of the very best quality grown this year.  After two years' experience we have now no grower who grows inferior tobacco.  Because any grower who grew for the two years in succession inferior tobacco was refused a permit.  It is hoped to get home growers to pay more attention to the seed, to the curing and to the curing barns, so that they may eventually produce only tobacco of good quality.  If all their tobacco was of good quality, it would be a paying crop, but only when the price they realise is much better than the price they realise at present.</P>

There are follows working up to their knees in dirt and muck and wet and misery on Sundays and weekdays, topping and readying beet for the factory, and when the whole account is cast up, they have not got what they used to make out of an acre of turnips, an acre of mangolds, or any other crop they set in the land.  I know that the people of this country ought to be prepared to work hard, and, in my experience of them, they are prepared to work hard, but there is no necessity to turn them into cart horses and slaves and to smash their standard of living down to that of the lowest peasant in the whole of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the tendency is in the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government at present.  There are men and boys working up and down this country for 12 and 14 hours a day on the land. Those who are working as agricultural labourers are getting from 15/- to 21/- a week, and those who are working as small farmers on their own land are very frequently getting nothing at all but living on their capital.  While that situation is continuing, oceans of money are being poured out of the Exchequer in the form of subsidies and bounties, and, in fact, the dog is eating its own tail, the whole community is becoming progressively poorer and nobody is deriving any benefit from it, except the Germans, who are buying our cattle at half their intrinsic worth, the Spaniards, who are being paid to take our eggs away and the British consumers of butter, who are getting butter at substantially less than is being asked of the poor of this country. I propose to go into those matters in greater detail before I sit down, but that is the general picture presented <Col N="430" /> by the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy since the present Government got into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;I must pay him this tribute&mdash;has delivered a statement here to-day in introducing this Estimate which is clearly intended to convey as much information on the subjects on which he saw fit to touch as was at his disposal, but he has carefully eschewed any comparison between the circumstances of the farmers to-day with the circumstances in which they found themselves when he took up office.  He dare not do it because the comparison would be between a body of men who were enjoying a modest measure of prosperity, and who were saving something, in 1931, and a body of men who, in the classical words of a Fianna Fáil Deputy, are with their backs to the wall and on the verge of starvation.  Deputies will remember that Deputy Dan Corkery, speaking at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis this year, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A commission should be set up to examine useful schemes because this thing has come to breaking point with the people living in the poorer districts.  They are barely existing at present and it is the duty of the Government to see that some means be devised by which they will be able to live at least in some kind of comfort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a quotation from a critic of the Government nor a quotation from somebody who wants to make a point against the Government.  It is a quotation from a speech made at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and there was no delegate so forward as to rise and contradict Deputy Corkery.  When he sat down there was a heavy silence. There was no rejection of his contention. It was universally admitted on all sides and that must be the epitaph that should be written on the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy in so far as it has affected the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The most biassed and narrow-minded Fianna Fáil Deputy will not contend that these words of Deputy Corkery could have been truly and legitimately applied to the farmers of this country in 1931.  Fianna Fáil Deputies must <Col N="431" /> ask themselves what is it that makes them relevant and true in 1936.  Some Deputies will reply that it was the outrageous attack of the British Government on the economic life of this country.  The whole of the agricultural policy outlined by the Minister is coloured by his reactions to the stupid and imbecile economic war.  I want to say a word in that regard because it is true that it is virtually impossible to view agricultural questions on their merits under the shadow of that absurdity.  When this private quarrel between President de Valera and the British Government started the President took up the position that his Government would not send the land annuities to Great Britain, that he was going to withhold them.</P>

      <P>May I proceed?  So long as there was a question of principle between us, one could readily recognise that that could not be bridged by any arguments founded exclusively on material considerations.  So long as the Fianna Fáil Government was saying &ldquo;On principle, we cannot remit these moneys and are bound by our ideals and principles to devise ways and means of withholding them,&rdquo; the force of certain arguments adduced by us was duly combated, but in the coal-cattle pact of 1936 a completely new situation has arisen.  The President first said: &ldquo;I will not settle it.&rdquo;  At a later stage the President said in the Dáil: &ldquo;I admit I am sending them, but in a very painful way.&rdquo;  Now we are devising ways and means to send them.  When he spoke on the coal-cattle pact of 1936 Deputy Belton interrupted him and he said to President de Valera: &ldquo;You have lowered the flag.&rdquo;  President de Valera said: &ldquo;Well, if you like to put it that way, yes, we have lowered the flag.&rdquo;&ldquo;I do not mind admitting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if I were in a stronger position I would not have made this agreement.&rdquo;  Now observe the situation that has arisen. The President has now altered his ground and he said: &ldquo;I wanted to withhold them and I could not.  I then tried to devise ways and means of withholding them, but the British Government circumnavigated me.  Then under the coal-cattle agreement I entered into a an agreement with the British Government that we would send them an increased number of cattle if they would lower the rate of tariff, and that we would undertake to send so many cattle at the new rates of tariff as would mean our continuing to send over to Great Britain the entire sum claimed by them in the land annuities.&rdquo;  There the President and the Executive Council were actually devising ways and means with the British Government to convey the land annuities to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that stage is reached, we have <Col N="434" /> reached a point where the quarrel between the President and the British Government is as to what is the most convenient way of sending over the land annuities.  They are actually negotiating as to what is the best way to send them over.  If you have made up your mind to send over the land annuities, or say you are still unwilling to send them and that you are only finding out the most convenient way to send them, I say by far the most convenient way is by cheque.  Instead of having an elaborate system of bounties, subsidies and drawbacks, all you need to do is to write a cheque once a month.  You have this additional advantage, that instead of making a tacit protest you can send over a Minister&mdash;a different one every month &mdash;with the cheque and he can make a formal protest after the delivery of each cheque.  There is no necessity to yield on principle.  You can keep on renewing the protest as often as you send over a Minister with the cheque. Furthermore, if we are to judge by pronouncements made by British Ministers in public&mdash;notably the Attorney-General, speaking at Southampton&mdash; the British are not interested primarily in the amount they receive.  They are primarily interested in receiving a discharge from the Irish Government of the allegation that the British set out to defraud the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I pass from that.  It is highly probable that if we sent over the money by cheque every month, not only would we relieve our farmers of the inconvenience of tariffs, bounties, quotas and so forth, but we would also prepare the ground for negotiations founded on the question purely of what it is reasonable to ask this country to pay on foot of a financial arrangement entered into almost contemporaneously with a financial agreement that was made by Mr. Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister of England, when he went over to Washington in 1924 as Chancellor of the Exchequer and made an arrangement that has so completely broken down that Great Britain is not sending even a token payment to <Col N="435" /> America, not because she denies the money is due&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy was proceeding to make analogies between the debt owing by Britain to America and the debt which this country is supposed to owe to Britain.  If the Deputy proceeds on those lines, he will draw a reply from the opposite side and the discussion will be widened to an extent far beyond what is necessary.

It seems to me greatly to militate against the usefulness of a discussion on agricultural policy that we should be carrying on under the shadow of this absurdity to which I have referred.  I have indicated one method&mdash;an effective method and one which conflicts in no way with the principles of the Executive <Col N="436" /> Council&mdash;whereby that shadow could be dissipated, and whereby we could deal with the problems raised by this Vote on their merits under their several heads, and not in an atmosphere of panic or a war atmosphere, such as the Government has sought to create and has, indeed, successfully created.  The Minister's speech has revealed some extraordinary things, and, perhaps, the most extraordinary thing of all is that the Minister has learned sense.  I can only hope that that infection will spread to his colleagues and supporters.  He revealed that licences for export of cattle to Great Britain are now worth little more than the paper on which they are written because the market is of such size that we have not enough cattle to fill it.  He warns us that anybody who gets these licences and does not use them is doing the community a very substantial injury because it may militate against us gravely in the future.  How?  Does the Minister disagree with Senator Connolly, who praises God that this accured cattle market which took 100 years to build up can be torn down in 10 months?  Has the policy of the Government changed?  Does the Minister regard it as a matter of regret&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is right in saying that any licence for the export of fat cattle should be used lest our quota for at cattle be reduced in future, which would be a catastrophe. <Col N="438" /> This interesting fact remains&mdash;it is a fact which seems to be overlooked in connection with fat cattle at the present time&mdash;that the prices we are getting on the British market are the prices at which the Germans are buying our cattle and the prices at which every other country is buying our cattle, with the result that, in fact, we are paying the land annuities not only to Great Britain but to Germany and every other country which purchases our cattle.  Surely the time has come when the Minister for Agriculture should realise that, whether it is worth paying the land annuities to Great Britain or not, the game is not worth the candle when we are paying the land annuities to Great Britain, Germany, and the dealers of every other country who choose to come over here and buy a cheap lot of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, the Minister dealt with cheese production.  I think it is a great pity we have concentrated so exclusively on factory cheese.  The factory cheese which is being produced here is as good as the factory cheese being produced anywhere else, but factory cheese is a dreadful imitation of what cheese should be.  Nobody who has any taste for cheese can eat factory cheese.  It is beastly stuff and that applies to Canadian, United States and Irish factory cheese.  Some people in this country have gone into cheese-making on the same lines as those pursued in Germany, England, Italy and, to a less extent, France. There are emerging in one or two districts here cheeses of quite distinctive character of the Cheddar type and one or two of the Continental types.  If that develops, it will be a national agricultural asset.  My suggestion to the Minister is that he should not rest content with increasing the product of the cheese factory, because I do not think, in that, he is providing us with a really valuable asset at all.  If our factory cheese is going to come into free and open competition with the factory cheese of the mass producers of the United States, our factory cheese will be up the spout.  The Minister would, however, provide us with a great asset if he developed a local cheese which would compete <Col N="439" /> with any cheese of the world, because it would be a luxury for which foreigners, if they liked it, would pay a fancy price simply because they liked it.  I suggest that the Minister should set on foot some scheme for subsidising the production of cheeses of that character.</P>
    <P>It would not be at all expensive, because once the thing got under way it would cease to require a subsidy, and would be able to stand on its own feet.  Encouragement to a cheese production business of that kind would be extremely valuable, and would bring a fresh cash crop, as it might be so described, into houses of people all over the country, more particularly into houses and districts where there are no co-operative creameries, where co-operative creameries ought not to be built, that is, the congested areas, where the milk produced should be fed to the children of the house in one form or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the butter situation.  My complaint with regard to the butter situation is this, that our subsidy scheme is operating in this country in such a fashion that we are selling our butter in Great Britain at 9d. to 10d. per lb. while our own people have to pay 1/5.  That seems to me to be a thoroughly unsound principle.  If butter, owing to temporary world conditions, requires a subsidy, and I think it does in order to make the thing sufficiently economic, and to make it possible to maintain it, the cheap butter made available by the subsidy should be for our own people first, and if there remains a surplus, after the capacity of our people to consume it has been exhausted, it could be sold cheaper to our external buyers. I ask the House to bear in mind that it seems to me to be extravagance to be paying a subsidy to raise the price of milk and, at the same time, to be pursuing a political policy which destroys the value of the calf.  A cow is, to a certain extent, a factory, and if you adopt the language of the sugar beet factory in each campaign: &ldquo;a cow produces a calf and so much milk,&rdquo; that is the fruit of the cows' lactation campaign.  If you increase the price of milk and destroy the price of the <Col N="440" /> calf you are where you began, and the whole subsidy is gone for nothing.  I suggest that what we should try to do is to make the calves as valuable as they were before the Minister came into office, and ensure that any subsidy subsequently given for milk production would be given to the producer of the milk, and to milk production for the benefit of our own people.  Remember, when you increase the price of the calf to the general value of the cows total production, it might not be as expensive as the figures before us at the present time, while it would make it possible to make available milk products for our own people, with substantial economics hereafter, even in public health institutions which the country is maintaining for under-nourished children and people suffering as a result of failure to get adequate supplies of such food as milk and butter.</P>
    <P>The Minister was proud of his report on bacon exports and pig products exports.  While he was speaking I noticed Deputies behind him smirking at the achievement.  Not one of them knew of course the reason for the increase in our exports of bacon.  The reason is that the British Government told us they would take so much more bacon from us.  If we were in a position to supply still more bacon, and if we were on terms of cordial trade relationship with Great Britain, we could have increased our exports of bacon substantially above the figures at which they at present stand.  It is only because we have pursued the insane policy of Fianna Fáil during the past four years, that we find ourselves now embarrassed to find a sufficient number of pigs to supply the British market. That is only that scrap of the British market that the British Government threw to us without any negotiations or pressure of any kind.  All the Minister has to do is to ask them for an increase and it is gladly given to him by the British Government.  He told us that the quota on the British market had been substantially increased.  It might be further increased if the Minister had the gumption to go and get it.  The entire improvement in the position of the pig-raising population in this country is due to the fact that the British market is prepared to take <Col N="441" /> more bacon from us than ever before, and as many more pigs.  In addition to being able to send them bacon under the pig marketing regulations in Great Britain we can send them an unlimited quantity of store pigs. After those pigs have been a month or six weeks in Great Britain they are recognised by the British Bacon and Pig Marketing Boards as British pigs, and are sold to curers by English farmers who bought them from us at market price, which accounts for the comparatively economic price that obtains for pigs in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies that but for the antics of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture pigs would be not only paying an economic price at the present time, but would be a mighty valuable asset to the farmers, because owing to the ridiculous and absurd cereals legislation which requires me to take my oats out of my own land and sell them to the first miller who will take them, maybe in Cork or Kilkenny, I have to buy oats grown in Kilkenny, shipped to Sligo and milled there and then railed back to me, and I have to pay 8/- per cwt. for maize meal mixture, while British farmers can buy equivalent feeding-stuff for 5/-.  It is hard to assess what difference that makes in the fattening of a pig.  It may be safely and conservatively said that on these figures the British farmer has 15/- more for each pig he sells than the Irish farmer. Farmers in this country may well realise what the pig industry would be to our people if the tax put upon them by the imbecile cereals legislation of the Fianna Fáil Government was withdrawn.  I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to end the idiotic maize meal mixture legislation. It has not improved the price of oats. It has not increased the price of barley by one penny.  Far from it.  It left a vast surplus of barley unsaleable on the market this year, and but for the fact that Arthur Guinness intervened chaos would have broken out.  It has increased the price of feeding stuffs of pig producers selling in the markets of the world by 3/- a cwt.  I ask any rational Deputy, what advantage is there in the maize meal mixture?  I <Col N="442" /> say that no advantage has accrued and that farmers here are charged £3 per ton more for feeding stuffs used for the production of agricultural produce that is being sold in competition with people who can buy the cheaper feeding stuff.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to tell what the Bacon and Pigs Marketing Board was doing.  Let me say that no body of men could have made a greater mess of the job they were charged to do. They burnt their fingers, they broke the shins of the pig producers, and generally turned somersaults with the pig business throughout the country. They have now done what most rational people in the pig industry knew before the Bacon Board started, settled down to rational methods.  I do not think there is any use dragging up the absurd mistakes into which they fell, dragging out the purchase of pork that was hawked round the country, put into cold store as pork, sold at one-quarter of its value to the curers, and then thrown out as unfit for conversion into bacon.  However, what is done is done and there is no use crying over it. They have probably learned a lesson from bitter experience which will prevent messes of a similar kind.  But the Minister ought to tell us how much money they lost in the transactions which took place in the three weeks to which he referred.  The Minister has consistently sought to shake off responsibility for the Pig and Bacon Marketing Boards.  He cannot do so.  He has power to require all relevant information.</P>

If the Minister desires to read what I am saying <Col N="443" /> he will find that he has machinery under the Pigs Act, and that I put a provision in the Act to make it available. I insisted in Committee that he should take powers to administer interrogatories to the board whenever he wanted to.

      <P>I have made these allegations on three separate occasions, and I have challenged the Minister to administer all necessary interrogatories to this board to controvert the truth of what I am saying.  He has not used those powers, because he knows that if he did they would confirm every word that I am saying.  Perhaps, as the Chair has suggested, we may now pass from that.  The Minister hopes that this board will, in due course, improve the quality of Irish bacon.  Of all things on God's earth that the board should not have anything to do with is the power to interfere with the quality of Irish bacon.  In the same breath as the Minister said that, he told us that Irish bacon was of such excellent quality that it was getting top price on the British market in competition with bacon from over the whole world.  If it is, cannot the Minister leave well enough alone, and not be sending in his inspectors to interfere with the bacon curers of this country?</P>

If he cannot do that under the powers that he has then I suggest to him that he should introduce legislation prohibiting the board from interfering with the methods of our Irish bacon curers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom am.  I have another criticism to make of the Pigs and Bacon Board.  When we assented to the principle underlying the Pigs and Bacon Act our principal desire was to secure that we should have <Col N="445" /> long term prices fixed.  The great difficulty in the pig business in this country and in every other country always has been the rise and fall in prices and supplies.  The object of all legislation has been to try and level-out prices and supplies so as to get a constant supply for the factories and a reasonably constant price for the farmers of the country, more particularly in order to secure that, if a farmer bred pigs and reckoned that he would have them fit for sale as bacon pigs at the end of five months, he would have some idea of what he was going to get for them when he put them on the market, so that in one period he would not make a fortune on his pigs and in another period lose a fortune.  The whole object was to tell the pig producer what he would get for his fat pigs five months hence.  Actually, the Pigs Marketing Board, in fixing the price for pigs, have made five alterations at least in the price in three months.  I allege that one of the price alterations was made at the instance of the Minister for Agriculture in order to cover up the additional charges which he had to impose upon the pig producers of the country by increasing the cereal content of the maize-meal mixture to 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already denied that in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there always has been a difficulty about this glut of pigs arising in the autumn, and of a comparative scarcity presenting itself in the spring and summer.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not despair and say that there is no method of dealing with that problem. There is a method and the Minister should make it known quite definitely. It is this: that pigs produced in the autumn and spring are going to make approximately the same price, but that in the period extending, say, from November to June they will definitely be higher and for the whole of that period, whereas in the period extending from June to November they will definitely be lower and for the whole of that period.  By doing that he may not succeed in producing an <Col N="446" /> absolutely constant flow, but he will so far reduce the ebb and flow of supply and prices as to eliminate the greater part of the evil.  The Minister cannot hope to do that in a month or six months.  The only effective way of doing it is to bring home to the minds of the people a new picture of a fairly even trend in pig prices and supply to supplant the traditional belief in the minds of the people that pig prices will fluctuate as they have hitherto, and that it was perfectly legitimate and sound economics to jump into pigs when you had a surplus of potatoes to dispose of. If the people are made realise that they can put their potatoes by and keep them to use as foodstuffs later in the year: that it is as easy to keep small potatoes as it is to keep big potatoes, and if you can persuade them that they should not allow their farming economy to be dominated exclusively by weather conditions, but that there are ample resources at their disposal to offset the weather conditions that have hitherto guided them in managing their affairs, the situation can be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important question and one that, in my opinion, has in it the material for a terrible injustice on a very deserving body of citizens, and one, too, that is calculated to inflict irreparable damage on the agricultural economy of the country&mdash;that is the attitude the Minister takes up towards the pig jobbers of Ireland.  The pig dealers of this country have discharged a most useful office for generations, and in the existing circumstances they are in the position to serve a more useful function than they have ever served before.  They have taken off the market of this country large numbers of pigs, and I ask Deputies to bear this carefully in mind, that the bulk of the pigs they have taken off the Irish markets are pigs that the Irish bacon factories would not touch.  They have taken what the Minister has described as the &ldquo;cutter&rdquo; off the markets, and not infrequently they have got a price for the &ldquo;cutter&rdquo; in England as good&mdash; sometimes a better price&mdash;as that paid for a grade A1 pig in this country. The reason for that is that the pig <Col N="447" /> jobbers' demand has been a flexible demand: it can be called off or expanded as the situation in Ireland requires.</P>
    <P>Take the situation to which the Minister refers and which so greatly embarrassed the Pigs Marketing Board some months ago in Monaghan, Donegal and Cavan.  There they had a mass of Ulster white pigs brought dead to the markets.  That was the problem that was before them.  The Pigs Marketing Board went rambling in there and got bogged.  If the Minister had been in close touch with the Pig Jobbers' Association and had their confidence, or if they had his confidence, all he need have done was to send to the Pig Jobbers' Association and say: &ldquo;Look here, I want you to do something which will help us all.  Put every man you have got in Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal; buy the pigs there and dispose of them through your connections in England.  It may mean a little bit of a loss, but it is urgently necessary.  Now, do the job and come back to me if you have got involved in any serious loss.&rdquo;  The Pig Jobbers' Association could have easily lifted that surplus off the market without any material loss.  Possibly all that would have been necessary would be to give them a fee to get the job done, and every one of the pigs would have passed into consumption and they would be taken off the market.</P>
    <P>The Pigs Marketing Board never succeeded in doing that.  Some of the pork converted into bacon is still in cold store and is complicating the problem of selling the bacon that is being manufactured at the present time.  The pig jobbers, I repeat, would have dealt with that problem and would be prepared to deal with similar problems in future.  The tendency the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board are exhibiting is to hand the pig producers over body and soul to the factories and let the factories fix the price.  People may say that the Pigs Marketing Board is fixing prices.  What does that board consist of?  Representatives of the factories and producers, presided over by a <Col N="448" /> chairman appointed by the Minister. I freely admit I was taken in on the Committee Stage.  I thought the producers' representatives would have the courage and intelligence to stand up for those whom they were supposed to represent on the board, and, if they did and presented an unanimous judgment as to what the appropriate price should be, the fixing of the price would be thrown back on the chairman, and if the chairman went wrong we could have demanded of the Minister to call on the chairman to account for his stewardship, and so would have dealt with the matter.</P>
    <P>In every price that has been fixed&mdash; some prices were so ludicrously inadequate that they had to be changed in two or three weeks&mdash;we find the producers' representatives bleated an assent and in these cases the board's personnel unanimously accepted the price.  If that is going to happen in future the factories will do just as they please with the pig producer.  I want to leave in the open market the pig jobbers, who will be prepared to compete against the factory prices, purchase the pigs, ship them abroad and sell them elsewhere, and so force the bacon factories to drive the prices up. Under the existing circumstances, when prices are being fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board, it is the duty of the Minister to demand of the bacon curers their balance sheets for his scrutiny, whether they are private or public companies.  I do not say that he should seek to publish these figures, because some of them are private companies, but if he finds that on the prices fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board the bacon factories are making excessive profits, then he ought to demand an explanation of how it is that they have so ineffectively discharged their duty as to leave the pig producer losing money at certain periods of the year while the bacon factories are coming as they never coined before.</P>
    <P>The last feature in connection with the pig jobbers is this, that they are the men who have maintained the fairs and markets in all the rural towns.  On those fairs and markets <Col N="449" /> depends the prosperity of hundreds and thousands of merchants; on the continued prosperity of the merchants depends the livelihood of thousands of labouring men all over Ireland.  If the pig jobbers are swept out of business, every pig fair in Ireland will collapse and the pigs will simply be carted to the factories to be bought at whatever price the factories please to give.  That will react on the farmers and on the towns.  I urge most strongly that any repetition of the language employed by the chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board on a recent occasion, when he indicated it was the policy of the board rather to eliminate the pig jobber than to concentrate the dealing with pigs in the factory, should be severely censured by the Minister and categorically contradicted by Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the sheet anchor, the bulwark, of the Fianna Fáil policy, wheat.  We are told that wheat could not be planted this year because it was too went in winter, and we are told it is very likely they will not be able to plant whatever wheat they have got in the spring because it is too wet.  I suggested we should grow the wheat in a glass-case and that would solve a good many of our difficulties, but that did not appeal to the Minister. We planted 163,000 acres of wheat last year and reaped it.  What did it cost us?  It cost us £1,500,000. That is what the wheat scheme is costing this country.  Flour to-day is 10/- per sack dearer in Saorstát Eireann than it can be purchased in Great Britain&mdash;and that is a very conservative figure.  It is more than 10/- a sack dearer here than in Great Britain.  The consumption of flour here has been conservatively estimated at 2,800,000 sacks; I believe the figure is nearer 3,000,000 sacks.  Suppose we say 2,800,000 sacks, the wheat scheme, the Minister's cereal policy, is costing this country in respect of flour £1,400,000, on the Minister's own figures, but I believe you can legitimately say it is costing £1,500,000.  The farmer is getting a price for wheat which, in my opinion, is not an economic price, taking into consideration the burden on the fertility of the soil which the wheat crop is.  Farmers <Col N="450" /> who are growing wheat are ruining their land; they are not cultivating it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the millers are getting out of this transaction, but I want to put this point to the House. There is a certain miller operating in this country and he has a mill in Liverpool and a mill in Ireland.  He is getting ex-mill 10/- to 11/- per sack more for the flour he is milling in Ireland than he is getting for the flour he is milling in England.  In each quota period that miller is allowed to mill in this country 36,000 sacks of flour, so that he is getting for the flour he mills in Ireland £16,000 in each quota period more than he would get from milling the same flour in Great Britain.  Is it any wonder that a policy of that kind should be popular with the people who are milling flour? If I were a miller it would be popular with me, but I am glad to think that there are some millers in this country far-sighted enough to realise that, though there are profits to be snatched from transactions of that character, in the long run, looking at it from the national point of view and feeling as I feel that we have all got to sink or swim with the country, no patriotic Irishman desires to see a scheme of that character continue as a characteristic of Irish life, or Irish industry, because it is calculated to undermine and upset the entire agricultural economy of the country on which the prosperity of this country ultimately depends.</P>
    <P>May I point out that we have enthusiastic wheat advocates here who have never advanced any solid argument to justify the growing of wheat, with or without a subsidy?  May I ask those who have somehow assured themselves that we were growing wheat in order to render ourselves independent of outside supplies, if we had attained last year the position where we would be independent of all outside supplies and had so arranged things that that was a necessary part of our economic life, what would have happened in a year when weather conditions would have prevented us from providing more that 21½ per cent. of our requirements? May I ask would we not have bought Canadian wheat at one-third of the <Col N="451" /> price we are paying here?  I invite Deputy Corry to deal with that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps I am not as mad as the Deputy.  However, if the Deputy will not deal with wheat, I invite him to deal with tobacco.  God be with the day when President de Valera was interviewing the <i>Evening Herald</i> on that subject. I am sure that this House will remember those halcyon days when the President said that he would consider the matter very fully, and that he had come to the conclusion that that matter ought to be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Revenue Commissioners. He said that he foresaw a loss.  With his well-known prudence, he said that he saw that it might involve a loss, but that he was satisfied that the increased benefits to the community would amply compensate the Revenue Commissioners for any loss that might ensue, and that he was satisfied that the Fianna Fáil Party should and would give their united support to the enlightened policy that was being brought forward by Deputy Matt. O'Reilly at the time.  Deputy Matt.  O'Reilly came in and suggested that tobacco should be relieved of Revenue duty.  Of course, that was turned down at the time; but then the present Minister for Finance came into office and turned it down, and Deputy Matt.  O'Reilly nearly went into hysterics.  The Day&mdash;&ldquo;Der Tag&rdquo;&mdash; had arrived, and tobacco was going to be released from Revenue&mdash;the great gold-mine&mdash;and, by jove, for the first year all Excise duty was to be taken off tobacco and we were getting 5/- and 6/- for our tobacco.  Everything was lovely.  We could afford to fight forty economic wars on that issue. But then, suddenly, Fianna Fáil got sense&mdash;not, however, before they had succeeded in squandering £400,000 on the production of 1,000 acres of tobacco. If, in every place that these unhappy men were led into follies of that character, it is going to cost £500,000 to dig them out of it, how is the Government going to draw them out of it?  There is a dozen of them, at any rate, and if each of them makes a mistake, it will take £6,000,000 <Col N="452" /> to take them out of it.  Of course, tobacco has gone up the spout.  I think the lowest price paid for tobacco is 4d. or 5d., and that does not include the rehandling and, of course, even at that, it is not worth growing.  It has become a complete frost and will shortly go into the limbo of all the other schemes of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Now, let us take the case of seed potatoes.  It was due to the foresight of that remarkable man, the former Minister for Agriculture, that that project was set on foot, and there was never any subsidy connected with it, but only hard work.</P>

      <P>Not at the beginning There is one now.  Anybody who has seeds for sale now has a gold-mine. They have to grow them under the stringent restrictions imposed by the Department.  We all know that they are producing something that is of advantage to the country, but will the Minister tell us that, with the main crop shortage in England at the present time, we are getting our share?  There are oceans going into Ulster at the moment.  Is it the fact that the British are excluding our potatoes and, if so, should the Minister not open negotiations with the British Government to allow us to get some share of the filling up of the gap between British requirements and British supplies? If that were done, it would help our farmers, who have, if not a surplus, at least good quantities of main crop on hand.  I could not leave this question of the Fianna Fáil policy without touching on the peat scheme. Do Deputies not remember when the cattle were going to be swept away&mdash; the sway of the base, bloody and brutal Saxon was to be swept away&mdash;and wheat, beet and peat were to be substituted? Tobacco is swept away already, and wheat and beet are not so comfortable as was expected.  I wonder what is thought of the peat scheme now?</P>

The Minister was shocked when I brought this matter up before.  He said that I was disparaging and sabotaging the efforts that had been made to provide new markets. We understood that the arrangement was that we were to import our oranges from Spain and send our eggs in return.  Has the Minister got tired of sending eggs to Spain without getting money for them?  Is he prepared to renew the Spanish trade agreement, or is it as attractive as it used to be; or has he come to realise that we were sending the best of eggs to Spain for half their intrinsic worth and taking oranges that were, to say the least of it, the sweepings of the market, as compared with the oranges that could be bought in other ways?  I have no hesitation in saying that, comparing the Valencia oranges coming here, which we had to go down on our knees to get, and in return for which we had to send our best eggs at half-price to Spain, with oranges that could be bought in the open market, these oranges were the sweepings of the market.</P>

Hens can hardly be regarded as factories and, therefore, I suggest, cannot come under the 300 factories, or so, alleged <Col N="454" /> to have been set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

The company to which I was referring was the Irish Iberian Company, formed for the purpose of undertaking trade relations with Spain.  Doubtless Deputy Briscoe will tell us all about it.  He will tell us that those people have been connected with Irish firms all their lives.  He will tell us they never earned a penny in Great Britain, or acted as agents for Great Britain, and he will explain how none of them would touch a penny of British gold. We will all hear this with admiration. I will not go into that now, as I am not as well versed in these things as Deputy Briscoe.</P>

      <P>I shall await the Deputy's information.  The next question I want to ask is what has happened in Brazil?  I understood a market was being opened up there for our livestock as they were embarking in a scheme similar to that in the Argentine.  Now, I understand, Brazil has withdrawn from this country most-favoured-nation treatment, and there is danger of their demand for cattle being diverted to the Scottish market. I want to know who is responsible for that.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the reductions that have been made in expenditure have been made particularly at the expense of agriculture. That seems to be the invariable practice of the present Government.  Whenever anybody is to lose, the farmer is selected.  However, this fact emerges and will develop as time goes on that the Fianna Fáil Party is coming to learn what we tried to teach them, that you cannot build up prosperity in this country on sweated factories. You cannot build up prosperity in this country with chancers and fly-by-nights who are in the economic life of this country only in the hope that they will get something out of it.  The only way to build up prosperity in this country is to have a prosperous agricultural community, with a sound industrial life and industrial development which will provide a decent livelihood for everyone engaged in it. The only hope of a sound agricultural community in this country is mixed farming in which livestock plays an indispensable part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when the Minister held up to public odium any persons in this country who bread livestock or sold them.  He is gradually coming to realise that that was the folly of ignorance, and he now knows that, through his own reckless experiments he has so depleted the cattle stock of this country, we are no longer able to supply the fragment of the British market which Great Britain has voluntarily given us.  He has discovered that through his own carelessness and folly we have a situation in which we are not able <Col N="456" /> to supply that part of the British market which the British themselves voluntarily gave us without any negotiations from us.  He has discovered that although there is virtually no limit to the quantity of eggs that could be exported to Great Britain he has by his own folly made the production of eggs so uneconomic that people have gone out of them.  He talked to-day of resorting to strong measures to induce people to engage in the production of eggs.  There is no need for strong measures; all that is necessary to be done is to restore reasonable production and make it easy to ship that production.  People want to dole; they want only to live out of production.  Eggs will command the normal price when there is no hugger-mugger and no secret arrangement by which some are sent to Germany and some are sent to Spain and there is a rake-off for this one and that.  If eggs are allowed to go to their ordinary market there will be plenty of eggs for sale.  The Minister deplored the scarcity of eggs, while at that moment he was shipping eggs to Spain for half their worth.  Now that scheme has broken down, and because of its inutility it is going to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters that I want to refer to in conclusion. We spent £7,700 last year on wheat publicity alone.  We had publicity telling farmers what to grow.  There were large posters put up at railway stations and in post offices with the injunction: &ldquo;Grow more wheat.&rdquo;  And we are told wheat is an economic crop to grow, and that it should attract every farmer in the country. Either of these statements is untrue. Wheat is an economic crop or else you are fooling the farmers, as I believe you are, into undermining their land.  Though the farmer sells his wheat, as I admit he is going to do at a price, still you are doing something that this country will not recover from for generations.  I do not see why there should be an Estimate for £100,000 for the purchase and storage of eggs.  The Minister says our exports to England are falling. Eggs exported by other countries <Col N="457" /> to England are not falling.  Do not imagine that the fall in our exports of eggs to Britain is because they are producing more eggs them selves than ever before.  In 1933 Denmark exported to Great Britain £2,511,551 worth of eggs.  In that year we exported to Great Britain £998,000 worth of eggs.  In 1932 Denmark sent to Great Britain £2,971,000 worth of eggs, and we sent £1,694,000 worth of eggs.</P>

Denmark was not an Ottawa country; we were, and through the incompetence of this unfortunate Minister who is sitting in front of us&mdash;I do him an injustice there, and I withdraw that, because he did make a settlement in Ottawa and it was the President &ldquo;bust&rdquo; it up; he did come home in advance of time, rejoicing, to tell the President he had made a settlement and made a good deal for this country, but he was sent back again with his tail between his legs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts in regard to this are sufficiently fresh in the minds of Deputies to warrant my passing from the subject in deference to your suggestion, Sir, without submitting further points of order to justify me in continuing to deal with it.  The exports of eggs in the case of Ireland have steadily fallen, and in 1935 amounted to not more than £711,337, which was £1,180,000 less than in 1934, but the imports of eggs into Great Britain between 1934 and 1935 had increased by £700,000.  Now, if it were true that our exports of eggs to Great Britain were falling only because and in the same measure as Great Britain's total imports were falling, our egg exports should have risen as between 1934 and 1935.  They had, in fact, fallen, and in that same year, when our egg exports fell by a further £180,000, the egg exports of Denmark to Great Britain increased by £250,000&mdash;from £2,435,591 to £2,689,194.  Is not that a record to be proud of?  Is not that something for the Minister to preen himself on, or is he coming to realise, as we realised and told him when he first came into office, that the agricultural <Col N="459" /> future of this country depended on live stock and live-stock products, and the tillage and pasture necessary to carry on that live-stock industry in the most economical way possible?</P>
      <P>They have got to come back to that view.  They have got to realise that while there is no going back to 1931, or going back to 1927, because the world has moved on and we have got to move with it, our future agricultural economy is going to be founded on our ability to deliver into the British market perishable agricultural produce in a fresh condition; that we have got to use all the arable land of this country for the production of so much grain as we can sell to the brewers and distillers, and such grain-roots and cereals as we can manufacture into a finished product and sell on the markets of the world at the prices we used to enjoy.  When that is done it is going to secure for our agricultural community in the future the high standard of living that they enjoyed in the past.  If the other scheme is pursued, under which people are discouraged from the production of live stock and live-stock products, and induced to resort to the peasant methods of agriculture which are advocated by the Fianna Fáil Administration, our people will go down to the level which obtained in this country in 1849.  I tell this House now that wheat is a crop on which famine is founded, and that if wheat becomes the mainstay of the agricultural policy of this country our people will go down to the famine level. In two or three generations you will be face to face with a situation in which you will have a large population living on the border-line of subsistence, just as you have in some of the peasant countries of Central Europe.  When that day dawns it will be a nice commentary on the capacity of our people to run this country to the best advantage of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no objection to the growing of a patch of wheat by any man who has the sentimental desire to produce food for his own family; but, looking at the problem in a broad way, we must realise that live stock is the source of our people's wealth, not only of our <Col N="460" /> farmers' wealth, but of the wealth of every other section of the community. We have to make our choice between a standard of living analogous to that enjoyed by the peasants of Yugo-Slavia and Czecho-Slovakia, founded on a wheat policy, or a standard of living such as our people have grown accustomed to since we won the land war&mdash; a standard founded on a live-stock policy, on intensive mixed farming, with increased tillage and increased live stock, and a full realisation of the fact that our tillage is not done for the production of home foodstuffs directly, but for the production of live-stock products indirectly.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Fianna Fáil Government is coming around to that view.  I do not give a hoot how long they are in office if they do come around to that view and carry it into effect, but unless they come around to that view the sooner they are put out of office the better it will be for everybody in this country.  Unless they are put out of office, and put out of it pretty soon, if they are going to stick to their own methods they will do damage which no Government will be able to repair in our life time.  I am anxious that the Ministers should learn sense not only in agricultural but in economic and political spheres as well. The same thing applies to them all. They show some signs of learning sense in certain spheres but show no signs of learning it in other spheres.  I hope an opportunity will soon be given them of either changing their tune and turning over a new leaf, or else making way for those who are prepared to run this country, not in the interests of narrow-minded bigots on the right or on the left, but in the interests of the ordinary people, so that our people will have a standard of living which will insure for them some measure of comfort and prosperity, instead of patriotic starvation, which consists of bitterness and hatred for everybody but the people who are prepared to bow down and worship at the shrine of Eamon de Valera.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I had the pleasure of giving the Dáil an illustration of the policy of admixture.  I gave as one illustration the high priest of the Opposition policy down in my county, who, having borne the ills of this terrible admixture scheme which Deputy Dillon has been fulminating against for a considerable time, having put up with the tariff on bacon for another period, said to himself in the end: &ldquo;I am an idiot; why do I not cut this all out and go to my darling mother country, England, produce pigs there, feed them with the maize meal I can buy without admixture, sell the pigs without any tariff on them and become rich and prosperous?&rdquo; And he went.  For 12 months we did not see his lovely face in my district.  Then, after fattening pigs in Great Britain for 12 months, he crawled back one day to fatten pigs again in the Free State on the 50 per cent. admixture and to sell them with the tariff on them, and he found it paid him better than it did in England.  That was one case.  I shall give the name if the House likes.  The second charge he made here was about this terrible Bacon Board that is after ruining everything.  Again I wish to quote on behalf of this board that has been attacked a statement made by another high priest of the Opposition, Mr. E.J. Cussen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The third person I bring in is a gentleman who occupied, for at least three days a week, two columns of the public Press on the admixture scheme.  I am only going to give a short quotation from that gentleman. At a meeting of the Dairy Science Society in Cork, at which Mr. O'Brien, the Chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board, delivered a lecture, Mr. Buckworth made a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with you.  Here is what he said: &ldquo;I made money on feeding pigs until the Pigs Marketing Board came along and ruined it.&rdquo;  That is the third witness, and he said he made money until the Pigs Marketing Board came along. The other high priest said the board had increased the price of pigs by 10/- per cwt., and the first high priest, who went to England and tried it, came back here to fatten pigs here because it paid better.</P>
      <P>Let us leave this and come to figures.  In 1932 our exports of pigs and pig products amounted to £2,273,000, and we imported from China or elsewhere that year, to feed the Irish people, £1,406,000 worth of foreign bacon.  In 1935 we supplied the Irish people with Irish bacon instead of that £1,406,000 worth of foreign bacon.  No bacon was imported, and we exported £2,275,000 worth of bacon. In other words, the farmers, who we are always told should be let alone as they knew what was best for themselves, increased the number of pigs that they bred and fattened so as to make £1,500,000 more out of the pig industry than in 1932 when the Oposition were in office.  So the farmers of this country, during the last 12 months, got £1,500,000 more for pigs than in 1932 when everything was prosperous. Apparently they were idiots enough to produce them at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was a long time sitting on a glugger.  I agree that he turned it into an orange to try to get a nice <Col N="463" /> smell from it before he was done with it.  He was hatching on eggs until I was sure I would hear some chicken clucking under him.  What is the position of the egg trade?  The Minister pointed out to-night that there was a steady decline in the export trade in eggs for a considerable number of years.  Deputy Dillon told us that if, instead of shipping eggs to Germany, Spain, etc., they were all left to our free market in England, there would be plenty of eggs produced.  He gave us an instance of the difference in export price, something like £500,000 or £600,000, between two separate years.  Deputy Dillon did not say a few other things.  He did not tell us that in 1929 we exported to Great Britain £2,970,000 worth of eggs, and in 1931, just two years afterwards, we only got a bare £2,000,000 for the eggs exported, a drop of £970,000 in two years.  What kind of a Minister for Agriculture had we that allowed all the hens to go clucking so as to lose £970,000 in two years?  Those were years when we had no economic war or anything like that, and we got £970,000 less for eggs.  If we take the year following that, the sum fell to £1,880,000, a further drop of £150,000 or £160,000, so that the export trade was steadily declining all the time.  After the first sudden drop of £1,000,000, it continued dropping down, and that is the glugger Deputy Dillon was hatching upon all the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also told us about the poor ruined farmer who was working in misery like a slave on account of beet-growing.  The English farmer, of course, is a prosperous gentleman, with money rolling into him hand over fist, having all these lovely markets at his door.  But the English farmer is growing beet, and at what price?  35/- per ton on 15½ per cent. sugar and no pulp given back.  That is the fixed price paid by the English sugar companies for beet this season.  I understand that in the beet-growing areas in England they have an Agricultural Wages Board. Deputy Dillon apparently is so anxious for the welfare of the farmers that he does not want them to <Col N="464" /> have anything.  To his mind requiring the farmers to make £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 a year on the growing of beet is outrageous.  Why should they do it?  Why should any of the collar-and-tie ranchers turn around and demean themselves by taking the plough and turning up the land?  Why should they do it?  Is it not outrageous? The farmers in the Free State are getting better prices for their beet than their brother farmers in England.  I defy contradiction on that statement.  I am not saying that our farmers are getting enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say this&mdash;that only for the Deputies opposite the farmers would be getting a better price.  When we were endeavouring to get the farmer to grow beet we found a campaign was on all over the country and the farmers were told: &ldquo;It will ruin you if you grow beet.&rdquo;  That campaign was going on tooth and nail, but we got our farmers to grow beet and we found in the following year, at the very period when the Beet-growers' Association were fighting for a fair price, the deluded farmers who had refused to grow beet, and who had seen the cheques their neighbours got, rushed into the office of the Beet Company offering to grow beet at 30/- a ton.  I can prove that.  That is the cut-throat competition that was going on at the very period when we were fighting for better prices for them.  That is why we have not to-day, as I wish we should have, a decenter price for beet.  I can say this much anyway, that the English farmer with the markets at his disposal, with the free, open English market for his beet, is growing beet at a lower price than the Irish farmer is getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to Deputy Dillon's bug-bear&mdash;wheat. The Deputy says: &ldquo;My goodness, is it not outrageous to think that the Irish farmers are growing something for which they have a guaranteed market?&rdquo;  Yes, is it not outrageous to be growing wheat on the lovely land on which you could fatten bullocks for John Bull?  I've seen 300 <Col N="465" /> or 400 acres of that lovely land worked by one herd and a dog.  Is it not terrible to see on that land a man with his coat off ploughing it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Any land is good wheat land, any land that you can plough is good wheat land.  I have seen crops of wheat grown on alleged fattening land that Deputy Belton is speaking of and it averaged 12½ barrels to the statute acre.  If Deputy Belton would spare a day and go round with me next harvest time I am sure it would be a pleasure to both of us, for he, too, is a supporter of the wheat growing policy.  I will bring him down to fattening lands and show him what has been grown on them.  This is land that we succeeded in wrenching off the landlords in the end.  So far as wheat is concerned, we were growing 20,000 acres in 1932.  This has particular interest for me, for I happen to represent a constituency where, under Griffith's valuation, the land is valued at something in the neighbourhood of 30/- to 40/- a statute acre. It was valued as wheat land, and because of that the valuation is very high.  A 40-acre farm has a valuation of £70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is five miles from Midleton and between Midleton and Youghal, where, by the way, five of those gentlemen for whom Parnell fought, if we are to believe the fulminations of the Deputies opposite, hold between them 6,000 acres.  As I was saying, unfortunate farmers in my constituency are paying high rates on their land, and after the wheat market went in 1921-22, I saw wheat sold there at £6 per ton.  That was in 1926. This was good millable wheat.  When the Opposition were in office there was no outlook for the farmers who worked that land.  They were told that they could grow wheat if they wished and sell it at the world price.  When they asked for protection in the growing of barley they were also refused. To-day these farmers are ploughing <Col N="466" /> their land and growing wheat.  I have seen beet grown in that particular district and yielding 18 tons to the statute acre.  Yet we are told that is land that is too good to till and that it should be left for fattening.  Deputy Dillon went a little bit further.  He attacked alleged foreign flour millers.  He said they were getting certain concessions here and a certain quota to mill wheat. He said they were milling wheat here and getting so much more for it than they would get in Liverpool.  When Deputy Dillon's Party were sitting here, that gentleman was importing wheat from Liverpool to feed labourers down in Midleton, while the flour mills in Midleton were idle or working two days a week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon went on to deal next with the butter question. He told us all about our iniquities in regard to that question and spoke of the wretched position into which we had brought that industry.  He had a new craze about cheese, some particular cheese that he himself would eat.  He could not dream of eating this Galtee cheese.  That is too near the mountain for him.  Deputy Dillon ignored the fact that, in 1932, the foreigner imported 19,000 cwts. of cheese here, and, in 1935, we exported 9,000 cwts. of cheese&mdash;a complete turn-about.  We not alone supplied our home market with 19,000 cwts. of cheese, but we exported 9,000 cwts. in addition.  When the Butter Prices (Stabilisation) Act was going through the House, Deputy Mulcahy led the Deputies opposite into the Lobby <Col N="468" /> against it like sheep, with the exception of a few unruly members who broke away from him and followed me into the other Lobby.  Apparently, the price that was to be good enough for the farmer delivering milk to the creamery was about 2d. per gallon.  He was not to get the benefit of that Act if Deputy Mulcahy was to have his way, because he led the Party opposite into the Lobby against it.  All credit to Deputy Bennett who voted for it.  He was a rebel that night in a good cause.</P>

That position should not be; all those markets should be taken away from the farmer, according to Deputy Dillon.  If the advice of Deputies opposite was taken, the farmers would be wiped out of existence in the last few years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon wound up in smoke when he went on to deal with tobacco. He attacked the growing of tobacco here.  It was another outrageous thing and he told us what it cost.  I grew tobacco the first year and I got a nice little cheque for £173 for two roods&mdash;half an acre.</P>

I was informed, at that meeting, by a neighbour of his, Mr. John Greene, that the relative value of one acre was £40.  I am sure that Mr. Greene is not a man who would put up the price.  A neighbour of his in County Meath told me that one half-acre had cleared £26 already, so that tobacco is not such a bad crop when you know how to go about it&mdash; that is the bother&mdash;and if you are prepared to put your hand down in your pocket and to say, &ldquo;There are a few fellows walking around the roads and we will give them a job and let them work at it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Up to the present I was busy looking over these wild, foolish statements made by some young people over there who would be better <Col N="471" /> employed if they stuck to one particular job, and learned all about one job. When a Deputy starts to talk at one time about galvanised buckets, at another time about Coats' thread, and on still another occasion about Indian meal, his poor little nut gets addled and he is so often up and down like a jack-in-the-box, that nobody pays any heed to him.  There is one matter to which I should like the Minister to pay some attention.  It has been referred to in this House before.  There is an item of £3,000 here for the enforcement of the Live Stock Breeding Act.  I honestly consider that a waste of public money.  Over and above that, it is putting a burden on our farmers that is an unfair burden.  I remember a previous occasion in this House when the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, speaking on that Act, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is one advice I should like to give to the new Minister in regard to the Live Stock Breeding Act.  It is this, that whilst it may produce very fine bullocks, and very fine cattle generally, beef animals, if it is worked in the way it has been worked for the last five or six years, it will be very difficult soon to get a decent milking cow in this country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the words of the late Minister at a time when he was no longer Minister, and when he was no longer working this Act.  I should like to call the attention of the Minister to the price of bulls at sales and shows down the country at the present day. Unfortunately, when inspectors come along licensing these bulls they will never look at the milk pedigree of an animal.  That will never enter their minds.  They will judge a bull just on condition with the result that you are getting beef-bulls and bad milking cows.  The way in which these gentlemen do their work has rendered it practically impossible for the ordinary farmer to get a bull.  The bulls are sold at such a price that it is beyond the capacity of the ordinary farmer to purchase one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

I say further that the action of the inspectors down the country has made bulls so scarce that the price of them has been run up to such a figure that it is impossible for the ordinary farmer with five or six cows to buy one.  Fancy his having to pay £40 for anything like a decent bull.  It was the habit of the previous Minister for Agriculture, and the habit has been carried on by the present Minister for Agriculture, to select these inspectors from the ranks of members of shorthorn breeders' associations, persons who have a vested interest in condemning as many bulls as possible at the local licensing shows in order to drive up the price of the registered bulls at the shows.</P>

      <P>I think I have, and I am glad that I was reminded of it.  I would suggest, in connection with the provision for agricultural schools and farms, that a few of the Opposition Deputies, Deputy Dillon in particular, should be taken out to these agricultural schools and farms for a period, given tuition and made to do a little work on the land.  Let these Deputies do a little work on the land and, when they come in here after that, they will not occupy the time of the House with such wild statements as we heard from Deputy Dillon the other night.  I suggest that the money spent on those agricultural schools would be well spent if Deputies were taken in there and got a little lesson.  Deputy Dillon also alluded to the admixture scheme.  He attacked the admixture scheme to-day and wanted to know why it existed at all.  He thought it was a wretched thing to have the admixture scheme operating.  He ignores the fact that the admixture scheme is using up 175,000 tons of barley and oats for which the gentlemen opposite could not find a market when they were in office. <Col N="474" /> It has provided a market to that extent for our working farmers whose valuation is 30/- to £2 per statute acre&mdash; farmers for whom I asked the ex-Minister for Finance to do something to provide a market when I was on the opposite side.  In the last year before we took office, I remember having to go to Mr. Beamish, the brewer, and beg of him on my bended knees to buy 20,000 barrels of barley in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We can congratulate the Minister on being more lucid in defending his Department to-night than Ministers usually are.  Deputy <Col N="475" /> Corry referred to the Pigs Marketing Board and the sale of pigs generally. It is dangerous for a Deputy to make any statement on the question, because he will be contradicted by some Minister who did not catch exactly what he said at some other period.  For that reason, I am glad the Minister for Finance is here at present.  The Minister for Finance, when winding up the debate on the Vote on Account, in Committee on Finance, referred to some statements I made and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is one point I want to deal with before I conclude.  That is, Deputy Bennett's statement that if any industry is in a parlous condition at the moment it is the bacon industry.  I do not know what foundation Deputy Bennett had for that statement.  I do not know what knowledge he has of the bacon industry. I do not know what paper he reads.  He comes from the South and as one of the representatives of the constituency of County Limerick, I assume he sometimes gets the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I did not say a word about bacon in the few remarks I made on that Vote. I never mentioned the subject, but as I am on this question I may say I agree with the Minister.  He went to great pains to suggest that I said everything was wrong with the bacon industry.  I agree with the Minister that everything is right with the bacon industry and more than right.  Everything is right with the bacon manufacturers, but everything is wrong with the pig producers&mdash;the people for whom some of us are here to speak. I never mentioned the word &ldquo;bacon&rdquo; in that particular debate.  Not being like the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not contradict the Minister when he spoke.  In that particular debate the Minister was, as he often is, out of order.  In defiance of the Chair, he insisted on speaking about bacon and pigs, about which he knows nothing.  I had only uttered two sentences on the question when <Col N="476" /> the Ceann Comhairle suggested that I should not proceed further and, in deference to him, I did not.  I now take advantage of this, which is a more suitable opportunity.  What I did say was that if I thought £10,000 or £12,000 would put any industry in a better position than it is now I would not grudge that sum or even double it, but if there was any industry in a bad condition at the moment it was the pig industry. The Minister for Finance went to great pains to suggest that I said the bacon industry was in a particularly bad way. When the Pigs Marketing Bill was before the House, the Minister for Agriculture predicted great things of it.  Some of us ventured to suggest that it was a pig merchants' or bacon curers' Bill.  That is what it has turned out to be.  Deputy Dillon has referred to some of its ramifications.  There have been frequent changes in price, he pointed out, and other occurrences which were objectionable.  If justification were required for what we said about that Bill, it was furnished by the quotations by the Minister for Finance of remarks made by bacon merchants showing conclusively, as he said, that the bacon industry was now in a better position than ever it was. This is because of the benefits of the Bill to the bacon curers.  They are more consolidated, better organised and better equipped to hoodwink the farmer than ever they were.</P>
      <P>At the end of his remarks about the Pigs Marketing Board to-night the Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the whole the working of the Act was as successful as we could expect.  Farmers may hold a preference for the &lsquo;free market&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, that that system is better than the system of handing over pigs to the factories and getting whatever the factories chose to give.  They were graded from the top price to the lowest.  The farmer had to be satisfied with the machinery set up by the Bill, to grade pigs after they were dead. &ldquo;The principle of the Bill,&rdquo; the Minister said, &ldquo;was grading after slaughter.&rdquo;  I might add and payment after slaughter.  I would not have any objection to grading after slaughter or before slaughter, if they were graded after payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am criticising what is occurring in the pigs and bacon industry.  What is happening is this: whatever was hoped for from certain legislation in the way of improving the position of farmers has not in practice resulted in any benefit to them, but rather the reverse.  The system as the Minister pointed out is that pigs are graded after slaughter into grade A, grade B and grade C and the farmers are paid accordingly.  To a limited extent farmers have the alternative of selling in the open market, but the Pigs Marketing Board are rapidly proceeding to exterminate that alternative.  Farmers are recommended and induced to deliver in the factories. Every effort is made to do away with the activities of pig jobbers, and with local markets where farmers at least were assured, if they sold their pigs, of payment for them.  They had not to wait until it was determined, after slaughter, what grade the pigs were in. Competition was good for trade, and in open competition a man was assured of a fair deal.  The Minister more or less admitted that in reply to an interjection of Deputy O'Leary, regarding the export price of pigs, because he said they had to compete against the factories and that that possibly raised prices.  If there was no competition we would hear loss about the factories and the grading operations.  I had a letter from one of the largest breeders and feeders of pigs in County Limerick which illustrates better than anything else what is happening.  This gentleman wrote to me when the Bill was going through pointing out certain things that might be done but which were not done.  He writes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Experience of the working of the measure has borne me out in this. You will notice that it is the policy of the Pigs Marketing Board to create a monopoly for the curers by doing away with the fairs and markets and thereby eliminating whatever open competition existed. As an instance of what is happening I may quote my own experience recently.  I forwarded a number of pigs to a certain curer.  The fixed <Col N="478" /> price for grade A, class I, was 59/- per cwt.  The price which I received was 47/-.  On inquiring the reason I was informed that when killed the bacon was bound to handle soft. Now, I have been selling pigs for quite a number of years and this particular lot were as good as any I ever sold.  Indeed, I always tried to put my pigs on a market in the best suitable condition.  I have no doubt whatever that had I sold these pigs to a buyer in the open market I could have secured as nearly as possible top price.  I would have known exactly what I had to receive and there would be no gamble as to whether the pigs killed hard or soft. The production of pigs at present prices and under present conditions is impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having referred to the grain mixture he continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can produce my account for the past year.  The cost of the actual food bought exceeds my income from pigs by about 10 per cent. and this is excluding the cost of labour, rent and rates.  Naturally, I am not going to continue and I am selling my breeding sows with a view to getting out of pigs as soon as possible. I am afraid there are all too many similar cases and unless there is a serious review of the whole position the pig industry in the country must inevitably collapse. This time 12 months I had 16 breeding sows, presently I have only seven and intend getting out of them at the suitable opportunity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What that breeder states is substantiated in every way by other people who are not in as big a way in the pig business.  I find that there is a common practice amongst curers, when pigs are delivered to them, of making some cut from the top price.  It may be because the bacon was soft.  That is a pretty good excuse.  The Minister referred to competition and said that, when selling in the fairs, the farmer does not know that the buyer is not getting the better of him.  It is possible that he would be a better judge of weight than the farmer.  The same applies to the cattle trade.  Most of us sell beef by hand.  In the good old <Col N="479" /> times, when trade was good, we knew our job pretty well.  Producers of pigs know their job and there are very few farmers who could not give a fair idea, within a few pounds, of the weight at which a pig would kill.  I venture to say that the gentleman whose letter I read could predict to within six pounds the weight of a live pig.  I am quite certain that when delivering his pigs to the curer he gave them as nearly as possible at the right weight and in the right condition.  I am certain that there are numerous other instances of the same kind.  The result of the Bill is that the bacon curers are becoming rapidly rich and the farmers are tending to get out of raising of pigs.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's reference to dairying.  I should not say &ldquo;dairying,&rdquo; because, practically speaking, the Minister confines himself to butter, cream, condensed milk and other articles of dairy production.  I complimented the Minister on giving so many details.  I am very glad that he did so in a very good spirit and tried to explain the Estimates as well as he could.  When dealing with dairying, the Minister proceeds to analyse it as if butter, cream and cheese were the only products of the dairy cow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;forgetting that there was a calf, as well as the calf's skin, and that the live calf within the skin was up to a couple of years ago one of the main profits of farmers; that the farmer's main source of profit was the rearing and feeding of the early matured calf.  It was on the sale of the calves that he depended much more than any fluctuation in the price of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often said that statistics are dangerous&mdash;and they are.  They confuse some people, and Deputy Corry fell into the trap this evening.  The Minister gave some statistics which are useful.  At the end of his speech he quoted one figure which I do not agree with.  He said that farmers' receipts for butter and from dairying generally were £613,000 more than if they had a free market and if there was no <Col N="480" /> economic war.  Then Deputy Corry proceeded to say that if the Minister and himself had not stepped in the farmers would be getting only 2d. a gallon for their milk.  The Minister and myself have often argued that question across the floor of the House &mdash;the Minister in the end sticking to his point and I to mine.  Even allowing that the figures quoted by the Minister are correct, I find that they are of help to me in my present argument. I think it is correct to say that we produce in or about 209,000,000 gallons of milk.  Due to the various manipulations adopted by the Government, we can take it that the average price the farmer gets for his milk is 4d. or 4¼d. a gallon.  The Minister says that the farmers are getting £613,000 more for their butter and dairy products than if they had a free market, and that they would be only getting 2d. a gallon for their milk if he had not stepped in.  In view of the fact that they have not a free market, and that, due to the manipulations to which I have referred, they are getting 4d. or 4¼d. a gallon for their milk&mdash;a difference of 2¼d. a gallon in comparison to what they would get if, according to the Minister, we had a free market&mdash;the farmers, basing our calculations on the quantity of milk produced, ought to have received in or about £2,000,000 instead of £613,000.</P>
    <P>That is the conclusion that I arrive at on the figures quoted by the Minister and if he is right in his contention. On their butter, cream and cheese alone, according to the Minister, our farmers ought to have received at least £2,000,000 instead of the £613,000 and that without taking into account the value of the calves.  I am afraid, however, that there must be something wrong with the Minister's figures.  I should have been glad if the Minister had adverted to the question of calves.  The only reference he made to them was in reply to an interruption by Deputy Belton when he said that the bounty on calf skins was being continued this year.  I want to ask the Minister why he should deliberately pursue a policy of reducing the number of cattle in the country, especially at the present time <Col N="481" /> when we are suffering from a shortage and cannot fill our quota in regard to our exports of cattle to Britain, and when, as seems probable under existing conditions, we will be suffering from a greater disability in that respect next year.  It is unfortunate, I think, that we should be engaging in this desperate practice of slaugh tering what would almost certainly be valuable animals in a year or two if they were allowed to survive.  I am afraid that, before long, we shall be reaping the fruits of the Minister's policy in that regard.  I believe that in 12 or 18 months there will be a shortage of stores of certain ages. There is already a shortage of store cattle&mdash;that is if farms were stocked to the extent that they ought to be. As everyone knows, owing to the depressed conditions in the country, there are a great number of farms, which are not stocked to their capacity.  If we ever get back again to the conditions in which farming can be carried on profitably as it was heretofore, and that farmers gradually set about filling up the gap in their herds, I am afraid that the number of cattle available to meet their needs will fall far short of their requirements.</P>
    <P>I do not think any purpose would be served by repeating the arguments which I have previously put forward in this House with regard to the Government's wheat policy.  Deputy Dillon dealt with that to-night.  As Deputies know, I have never believed in the Government's wheat policy, or their policy generally in regard to tillage. I am talking now of the creation of a wheat acreage by the payment of a subsidy.  As I have often said, if a subsidy is made large enough you can produce almost anything, whether it be a crop or a manufactured article. I, however, have always been against the production of anything which needed a perpetual subsidy, and always will be.  In going ahead with his policy, the Minister was favoured by fortunate circumstances&mdash;with three good seasons.  Because of that farmers were enabled to grow the crop under the best conditions.  Even though that was the case, I do not believe that many of them would have grown <Col N="482" /> wheat except for the fact that circumstances were so very bad in every other direction that they had to turn to it because they knew they would get a certain price for it whether it was good or bad.  The proof of that is that they did not grow wheat when there was a very much bigger price for it on the open market&mdash;a bigger price than the 23/6, including the subsidy, that was guaranteed to them. The Minister, as I said, was lucky in getting three good seasons in succession, seasons which we are not likely to have in this country for many years again, for putting his wheat policy into operation.  At the end of his speech, he said that they had been directing their attention to wet harvests and to providing for storage for damp crops.  He said that they forgot altogether to provide for wet winters until it was forced on them.  They did not think of it until the deluge came down and that drew the Minister's attention to the fact that even in this country we were likely to get a wet winter some time.  Might I suggest that in addition to providing for wet winters he would also provide for wet springs?</P>
    <P>I can conceive the possibility in this country, at a not very far distant date, of our having not only a wet winter, but a succeeding wet spring? I can remember several periods when we not only had a wet winter, but a wet spring and it continued wet well into the summer.  Indeed, we were lucky if we got three or four fine days in which to scramble some of the produce out of the flood.  We may reach such a period again.  We are certain to have at some time or other on top of a wet winter a wet spring.  If the Minister is providing for a wet winter, I would recommend him also to provide for a wet spring, because that is very likely to occur.</P>

      <P>There were plenty of floods then and we are very likely to have those times again.  Not only have we had wet winters and springs, but we have had wet summers and a wet portion of the autumn.  The interval between the rainy periods was sometimes so short that there was little chance of carrying out harvesting operations.  I do not think I have much to congratulate the Minister on, but I would like to pay him a tribute in this respect, that for the desperate circumstances that are forced on him he is not altogether responsible.  For much that is happening in agriculture the Minister is not responsible.  Whatever share of responsibility he has for it, it is his share as a partner in the Executive which controls the whole organisation of Government.  So far as his particular activities as Minister for Agriculture are concerned, I believe that to the best of his ability he has tried to tide the country over a difficult set of conditions, a set of conditions which a Deputy from any Party in the House, if placed in the Minister's position, would find it difficult to control, until very obvious remedies are put into operation.  I do not believe any Minister for Agriculture could, under present circumstances, so order conditions in any branch of the agricultural industry that the farmers would be able to live and work and make a profit.  That will not be possible until there is a settlement of the dispute which has brought about the existing unfortunate depressed prices for agricultural produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one phase of this Estimate to which I would like to direct particular attention.  It is a phase of agriculture which received very little attention from the Minister in the course of his speech.  It is a phase of agriculture which the Minister, in the many Bills he has introduced dealing with live stock and the corn production policy of the Executive Council, has studiously ignored. I refer to the rates of wages which are at present paid to agricultural <Col N="484" /> workers.  This is mainly an agricultural country, and, notwithstanding intensified efforts to develop its secondary industries, agriculture is, and will continue to play, an extremely important part in the national life.  One would imagine that in a country which has a very large number of agricultural labourers whose rates of wages are appallingly low, that the Minister for Agriculture, who ought to be concerned with their standard of livelihood, who ought to be concerned with the standard of remuneration paid to them, would long before now have realised the necessity for introducing here a Bill designed to have some steadying effect on the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers and would have long before now realised the necessity of doing something to frustrate the savage attacks made from time to time on the already intolerably low standard of wages of agricultural workers.  One would expect that he would have taken some definite remedial action.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the past four years, notwithstanding that he has introduced many Bills here, has not yet asked the Dáil for any legislative authority to establish an agricultural wages board, nor has he taken any other steps such as would be calculated to give to the agricultural workers a reasonable standard of remuneration for the valuable services he renders to the nation.  The Minister is not unfamiliar with the demands made for the establishment of some method not merely of retaining the existing rates of wages for agricultural workers, but producing a substantial increase in them.  The Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis has already directed attention to the necessity of doing something to stem the absolute rout of agricultural workers in respect of rates of wages.</P>

      <P>I am not discussing legislation and I am not even expecting the Minister to introduce the agricultural wages board which, I think, would be a partial solution of the problem. I am rather convinced, as a matter of fact, that the Minister has made up his mind that he is not going to introduce such a board.  I am not appealing to or exhorting him to do it, because I feel he has made up his mind that he will not do it.  You need not assume that my speech is in any way connected with a plea to the Minister to introduce legislation.</P>

I was saying that the Minister is not unfamiliar with the agitation which has been carried on for quite a long time directing his attention to the low rates of wages paid to agricultural workers and various remedies have been suggested by which the Minister could take action, administratively, if he desired, or by legislation, if that were found more desirable, to raise the level of wages of workers in the agricultural industry. Last year, the Minister announced&mdash;I think it was in June of last year&mdash;that he was preparing a memorandum for submission to the Executive Council on this question of the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers, and said that he hoped that, in a few weeks' time&mdash; probably in the month of July, 1935&mdash; the Executive Council would be busy considering the proposals which he was submitting to it for remedying the low rates of wages paid to agricultural workers.  Later in the year, however &mdash;in October&mdash;when asked what he proposed to do in this matter, which was one peculiarly within his province and for which he had special responsibility, the Minister indicated, in substance, in reply to a question by Deputy Davin in the House on the 31st October, that he did not contemplate doing anything at that time, and I expect that is the present position of the Minister in regard to that question.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I shall read the whole question, and I shall read the answer, if the question is more illuminating than the answer.  Deputy Davin, on the 31st October, 1935, asked the Minister for Agriculture:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he is aware that in several areas agricultural workers are in receipt of wages which are actually less than the amount of unemployment assistance to which they would be entitled if they were unemployed, and that in numerous instances agricultural workers in receipt of unemployment assistance are offered work at rates of wages lower than the amount of the unemployment assistance, and informed that unless they accept the work offered their claims to unemployment assistance will be disallowed, and whether he will state if it is proposed to introduce proposals for legislation to enable him to set up an agricultural wages board for the purpose of regulating the wages of agricultural workers; and, if so, when the proposals for this purpose will be circulated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To that question&mdash;one which ought to have excited the sympathy of the Minister&mdash;the Minister made this reply:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to the first part of the question, I am not aware that the facts are as stated by the Deputy but, in any event, the matter referred to would appear to be one that comes within the province of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As to the concluding part of the question, there are no proposals for legislation with a view to setting up an agricultural wages board in contemplation.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister can have a present of his bad manners. There are statistics issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce from time to time, and they indicate the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers over 21 years of age, in each year, in the Provinces of Leinster, Munster and Connacht, and three Ulster counties.  We get an illuminating picture of the condition of the agricultural workers by reference to these figures.  In 1925, the average earnings of agricultural workers in Leinster were 28/6.  In 1928, the average wages were 25/3.  In 1932 the average rates were 23/6.  In 1934 the average rates were 21/6.  So that, from 1932 to 1934, the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers, according to this statement, in the Province of Leinster, fell from 23/6 per week to 21/6 per week, and nothing was done in the meantime by the Minister or by the Executive Council in any way to stop the reduction of wages for agricultural workers during that period.  The figures for 1935 were supplied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the Dáil, in answer to a Parliamentary Question on the 5th February. The Minister indicated then what the rates of wages were in the various counties throughout the country.  An examination of the wages paid in the counties which comprise the Province of Leinster would show that the figures fell below the figure furnished in the Official Report of 1934.  So that when <Col N="490" /> we study the figures supplied in the Official Report we find there is a constant downward tendency so far as the wages of agricultural labourers are concerned; and the Minister does nothing while the agricultural workers are tightening their belts.  Agricultural wages are slashed all over the country, but the Minister does nothing whatever to stop the reduction of wages paid to those workers.  Everyone in contact with rural Ireland knows well that the figures supplied as the wages paid to male agricultural workers of 21 years of age are absolutely absurd; they are absolutely cruel.  I do not believe that those rates of wages, as given, are the wages paid to labourers in the counties of the province referred to.</P>
      <P>In the return furnished by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 5th February, we were told that the average rate of wages paid to male agricultural workers, over 21 years of age, in the County Kildare is 20/- per week, and in the County Carlow 20/- per week.  It is utterly preposterous to suggest that 20/- per week is the rate paid to agricultural workers in Kildare.  Agricultural labourers in Kildare would have to walk long weary miles before they could find a farmer to employ them at 20/- per week.  And the same applies in Carlow to workers employed in the agricultural industry. If the Minister wants any evidence of that let him find out from the Beet Sugar Company what rates are paid to agricultural workers for topping and readying beet for the factory. He will find that an appallingly low rate is paid all over Kildare and Carlow.  The rate of wages paid for long hours of work ought to excite the sympathy of the Minister to such an extent as to induce him to introduce legislation upon that matter.</P>

At all events, quite apart from that net point, I think that in discussing the Estimates for the Department of <Col N="493" /> Agriculture we are entitled, in reason, to survey the position in agriculture by directing the Minister's attention to this, and by showing him that there is need for him, with such administrative and executive power as he and the Executive possess to alter the position as we see it.  Up to the present no effort has been made to stop discussion of that kind on the Estimate of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when asked in October last whether he was aware that agricultural workers were being required to work for rates of wages lower than the rates of benefit provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, said that he was not aware that the facts were as stated at that time by Deputy Davin.  One would imagine from that that the Minister did not believe such a condition of affairs existed, but quite recently we had an interesting happening in County Clare&mdash;your own constituency, Sir, and you are probably familiar with the circumstances of this particular case.  The manager of the employment exchange in Ennis directed a number of workers to proceed to an agricultural holding two miles from the town, there to engage in the work of topping beet for farmers.  They were required to walk the two miles from the town to the farm, to work for 11 hours per day and walk the two miles back, and the munificent wage they were to receive for that work was 9/- per week.  Some of those people could have got 12/6 per week in the form of unemployment assistance benefit.</P>

      <P>Five of the persons who were sent to this particular farm declined to work for 2/- per day for a day of 11 hours.  They went back to the manager of the employment exchange and told him so.  The manager of the exchange said that if they did not work for 2/- a day for a day of 11 hours he would have to suspend them from the receipt of unemployment assistance benefit.  Here was a classical example of men being expected to engage in the laborious work of topping beet for 2/- per day when they could have got more in unemployment assistance benefit at the employment exchanges.  That is not the only instance of the conditions of agricultural workers.  Some time ago it was reported in the Dublin daily Press that a member of a local authority stated that the persons working in his district&mdash;the district of Tullow, in the County Carlow&mdash;could not earn more in wages than from 10/- to 12/- per week, and the statement was not controverted by anybody.  Again we recently had an example in the Roscommon District Court in an action to recover arrears of wages.  The plaintiff was a farm labourer, and he stated that he had been employed at a wage of 8/- per week.  The defendant farmer swore that the rate agreed upon was not 8/- per week, but 5/- per week. A full report of that case can be found in the <i>Roscommon Herald.</i>  We had another instance at Rathfarnham, where an action was instituted in the District Court for the recovery of a balance of wages due.  The plaintiff in that instance swore that he had agreed to milk cows and do general work for a dairy proprietress for a wage of 5/- per week and his board. He alleged, however, that after six weeks he was paid only 3/-, and the court accepted his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> About 12 months ago I caused inquiries to be made in 17 counties from reliable persons, in order to ascertain what were the prevailing rates of wages in respect of agricultural workers.  I received replies from those 17 counties, and in only two instances, one in Offaly and the other in County Dublin, did I get evidence that a rate of wages in excess of 20/- per week was being paid.  In October of last year the Minister did not know of the circumstances described by Deputy Davin, but the information I received in the matter was that in County Wexford agricultural workers were working for as low as 14/- a week; that in Kerry they were working for rates of wages from 12/- to 18/- per week; in Westmeath from 10/- to 12/- a week; in County Cork, from 15/- to 18/- per week; in Galway and Roscommon, from 15/- to 18/-; in Tipperary, from 15/- to 20/-; in Waterford, from 12/- to 18/-; in Meath, from 12/6 to 16/-; and in Sligo from 10/- to 15/-.  There is a picture of poverty portrayed there that obviously calls for remedy of some kind.  Look at those rates of wages. Pass over perhaps the rather abnormal case of the person who was employed for 5/- per week, and after working for six weeks got 3/-.  Pass over even the case of the person in Roscommon, who worked, he said, for 8/- per week, but the farmer said for 5/- per week. Let us pass over those cases as some what abnormal, and take the general level of agricultural wages as we know them from contact with agricultural workers.  I have already said&mdash;and I believe it, and I think no Deputy in this House will have any hesitation in believing the same thing&mdash;that the rates shown in the official statistics as the average rates of wages are absurdly inflated, and that they do not represent the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers in the counties or provinces mentioned.  Take those rates of wages which were received as typical of the rates of wages paid to agricultural workers in the counties mentioned, and I challenge the Minister or anybody else to deny that they are typical rates of wages.</P>
    <P>I mentioned 14/- per week in County Wexford, and many instances could be found of persons working in Wexford <Col N="496" /> and elsewhere for a lower rate than 14/- per week.  Is that the wage policy of the Minister in respect of agricultural workers?  Is that regarded as the wage policy of the Executive Council in respect of agricultural workers?  Just imagine the position of an agricultural worker, a married man with five or six children, expected to sustain himself and his family in a civilised community on a rate of wages as low as 14/- or 15/- per week.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he considers that that is a living wage.  I should like to know from him also whether he proposes, by any action within his command, to remedy the condition of affairs disclosed by the low rates of wages which I have quoted; rates of wages which the Minister must be familiar with in respect of his own constituency; rates of wages which can be ascertained by any reference he desires to make even to Deputies of his own Party.  I know at all events the rates of wages paid in County Kildare.  I know they are abominably low, and the Fianna Fáil Deputy for that constituency can say whether the rates of wages paid there are higher than the average level of wages which I have already quoted.  Of course it may be said by the Minister that the agricultural wage levels are low all round; that they are low in every country and that the rates of wages paid here are no lower than they are elsewhere.  But I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the report of the British Agricultural Wages Board issued in 1934, showed that during the years, 1932, and 1933, there was an increase in wages in nine counties in Britain, while there was a reduction of our rates in eight counties.  The recent report of the British Agricultural Wages Board shows that the average level of wages in the agricultural industry in Great Britain at present is 33/- per week.  Wages of 33/- per week were paid to agricultural workers in Great Britain and 14/- to agricultural workers in Wexford.  That is the anomaly that we see and any effort to suggest that there is depression all round in the agricultural industry cannot possibly gainsay these facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his <Col N="497" /> speech, talked about beet growing and wheat growing, and made reference to the position of barley and oats, pigs and live stock generally.  We find the position that, although the price guaranteed to the farmers in respect of beet is not a price that adequately rewards them for their labour&mdash;if Deputy Corry were here I suppose he would support me in that point of view &mdash;at all events, those persons who grow beet are at least guaranteed a minimum price.  The persons who grow wheat are guaranteed a minimum price and, so far as the State can ensure it, there is a guaranteed market for barley and oats, with the power, which has been occasionally used by the Minister, to fix a minimum price for barley and oats.  There has been a guaranteed minimum price fixed for pigs by the Pigs Marketing Board.  Recently the Minister found it necessary to fix a minimum price for cattle.  Minimum prices have been fixed for these products which are in the ownership of the farming class.</P>
    <P>While I think it is right and proper that a minimum price ought to be fixed for every possible type of farm produce, so as to ensure the farmer a decent return, for the labour he puts into production, I want to direct attention to the fact that the fixation of minimum prices has all been in respect of produce, but the agricultural worker has not been guaranteed any minimum return in the form of wages.  There is to be regulation, even though it is defective regulation, in respect of live stock and cereals, but there is to be no regulation whatever in respect of agricultural wages.  They are allowed to dribble down as low as possible, and the Minister stands by while that condition of affairs exists.  On the one hand, you have fixed prices, designed at all events to prevent the farmer being asked to sell his produce at slaughter and bankrupt prices, and on the other hand you have a position where the agricultural worker is not guaranteed any minimum standard of wages for the production of these products on behalf of the farmer.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is a contrast there which ought to excite his curiosity and even his sympathy <Col N="498" /> in order to do something to stop the continual downward drift of the wages paid to agricultural workers. For four years now these wages have been at the mercy of every economic blast that blew across the agricultural field; not merely exposed to the blast of the economic depression in the agricultural industry, but to the blast that blew in the economic war, and to a variety of other circumstances which are not calculated to raise the wages of agricultural workers.  During that four years, when the Minister had full power, as he still has, to do something to stop the downward drift of the agricultural workers' wages, the Minister apparently chose to do nothing in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who want to see as many persons occupied on the land as possible, as many persons kept on in the rural areas as possible, because I believe that the drift into the towns, the drift into a flooded labour market, the drift into overcrowded accommodation, the drift into insanitary dwellings, is neither economically nor nationally a desirable kind of development.  But, what encouragement is there to the agricultural worker to remain in the rural areas when these wages are being paid?  What encouragement is there to keep the agricultural worker on the land when these scandalously low wages are paid?  It is much better for the agricultural worker to leave the rural areas, to leave the land, and to drift into towns, particularly the boroughs, where he can manage to get at least freedom from the conditions of wage slavery that he knows in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have a healthy agricultural position we cannot possibly obtain that desirable standard of prosperity by pauperising the agricultural worker.  To-day he is being compelled to tolerate a pauperised standard of existence. One has only to go amongst the agricultural workers to realise their plight. One has only to look at the amount of the piling arrears on labourers' cottages to realise how difficult it is for them even to pay the relatively low rents charged for these cottages.  The plight of the agricultural worker to-day <Col N="499" /> is something that ought to excite the sympathy and attention of the Minister.  We can never attain in this country a healthy agricultural position so long as we continue to allow the agricultural workers' wages to be debased to the present level.  So long as that condition of affairs exists, it is impossible to foresee any possibility of importing any prosperity into the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made efforts in certain directions to improve the cereal and live-stock position.  Some of these efforts are commendable and praiseworthy, if one could look at them without reference to the general position in the agricultural industry. But, if we look at these individual achievements in one direction or another, if we look at this effort to get some kind of organised plan applied to agriculture and, at the same time look at the ocean of poverty which surrounds the agricultural industry in the form of underpaid workers, then we get a picture of agriculture which is far from healthy, far from prosperous, and which must be thoroughly and radically overhauled if we are going to get an agricultural position in this country which in any way approximates to a position which will give a reasonable return to all those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon desires to have this Estimate referred back for reconsideration. I do not share his views on agriculture generally, nor do I even share his views as to the reasons why this Estimate should be referred back, but having regard to the Minister's lamentable failure, and it can be described as no other type of failure, to do anything for the agricultural worker, the pursuance of that do-nothing policy for the past four years, and the present apparent unwillingness on the part of the Minister even to shift from the position which he has consistently adopted for the past four years, I think the best thing this House could do would be to refer the Estimate back to the Minister for reconsideration and in that way demonstrate to him in respect of agricultural wages that the <Col N="500" /> House expects him to do something to relieve the present deplorable poverty which exists amongst the agricultural workers.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Norton was speaking my mind went over the order in which the Estimates appear on the Paper.  The Estimate immediately preceding the one we are discussing was for wireless broadcasting. In the broadcasting programme we get every night before the news the weather forecast and shipping news.  I think the skipper of the Labour Ship has got some hint from somewhere that in the weather forecast the shipping news shows that the storms are looming up in the distance.  I am sure Deputy Norton, who now sees the danger ahead, is not so foolish. He is far too astute a politician to be so foolish as not now to see the results of the policy pursued for the last four years, the policy which he and his Party will find great difficulty in dissociating themselves from&mdash; dissociating themselves from responsibility for the policy which has produced the appalling conditions which have been portrayed by Deputy Norton as existing in the agricultural industry.  Anybody responsible for those conditions should now be examining his conscience.  Deputy Norton is quite right in saying that in Kildare and in Dublin, which pays the highest agricultural wage in Ireland, men cannot get work on the land at £1 a week.  It does not pay. Why?  I am surprised why Deputy Norton and his Party have not tumbled to the reason for the conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, it is better for them to pay the price to-day than, perhaps, in six months' time.  Some day they will have to afford it.  Some day men will have to come down to realities.  Economic conditions are forcing us to the climax, or perhaps anti-climax.  What is the reason? Agriculture the world over is going through the greatest depression in its history.  It is going through the worst type of depression&mdash;a depression coming <Col N="501" /> at a very bad time&mdash;a depression following a period of unpredecented prosperity in the agricultural industry. Then super-imposed on that we have the depression caused by the economic war in this country.  What is that depression as recognised by the coal-cattle pact recently ratified by this House with the support of Deputy Norton and the Labour Party?  Is it not this, that the House has given recognition to this fact that we can trade with Britain on certain conditions? The conditions precedent to any trading with Great Britain in which we will be paid for our merchandise is that the farmers of this country must hand over to Great Britain a tribute of £5,000,000 a year and this must be handed over free, gratis and for nothing before our produce can be accepted at Britain's valuation.  Is not that the position; I put the question to Deputy Norton?  Deputy Donnelly shakes his head.  Let us stop this nonsense.</P>

He acknowledged the flag was lowered and in lowering the flag he recognises that we have to pay £4 5s. 0d. a head on every bullock and heifer shipped to Great Britain.  That is the tribute the farmers have to pay. I want to tell Deputy Norton that there you have the secret of the low wages.  We learned long ago in our school reading books, longer ago than some of us would care to remember, that &ldquo;you cannot take more out of the meal tub than is put in it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Great Britain is taking the best of our produce and she will pay nothing for it until she gets that tribute of £5,000,000 a year free, gratis and for nothing.  Where does that money come from?  Of course it will <Col N="502" /> be denied that it comes from the farmer.  It will be dressed around in order to confuse the people.  The Minister for Agriculture and his semi-colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, yesterday in reply to a question put to him as to the compensation for this tribute that has to be paid to Great Britain came to tell us that the farmer was getting a market for beet.  I will deal with that point now.  Deputy Corry when speaking on this Estimate said that the price that we get for beet is not enough.  Now, growing beet has nothing whatever to do with the question of compensation for that tribute. The growing of beet on an extensive scale here is a new departure, and when the Beet Bill was before this House the Minister told us over and over again that in no country in the world was beet an economic proposition. It has to be subsidised in every country in the world where it is grown. It has to be subsidised here.  Therefore, as was pointed out to the Minister, and I think it was pointed out by myself, it would cost the taxpayers £1,000,000 a year either as a tax or as a duty to produce sufficient beet to meet our full requirements.  But how is that a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the levy exacted by Britain?  How is it a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the loss of the market in which this country sold its wares prior to the sudden change?  As a matter of fact, the beet scheme of the Government at the present price to the consumers or taxpayers was only made possible by the general depression in agriculture wrought by this tribute because the profits of the general agricultural industry were reduced to nil.  This cash crop came in during a period of depression to give the agriculturalists ready cash.  It was a cash crop and they accepted it under slave conditions and agreed for the time being to carry it through in order to give them ready cash.  They were prepared to work under these conditions.</P>

      <P>I am not opposing the production of sugar beet or the growing of sugar beet.  The point which I am emphasising is that a sugar factory, in view of the loss sustained by agriculture owing to the tribute that is forced from the farmers by Great Britain, is no compensation for that heavy tribute.  That is the point I want to drive home.  Neither does the wheat scheme and the price paid for it, either by the consumer or by the taxpayer, provide recompense for the loss sustained by the tribute to Britain.  The wheat policy I support, and I advocated that policy before a single Deputy on the Government Benches advocated it.  I published it in pamphlet form.  The Minister is laughing, but I did that at a time when the Minister knew practically nothing about agriculture, not that he knows a terrible lot about it to-day.</P>

He told us how he had stabilised dairying, but, as Deputy Bennett very rightly pointed out, the Minister's idea of dairying is buttermilk.  He told us about the good market there is here for butter at 1/5 a lb.  I wonder how much Irish butter at 1/5 a lb. can Deputy Norton's agricultural labourer buy on his present <Col N="504" /> weekly wage?  How much butter can the unfortunate working farmer and his family buy from the creamery they supply with milk and pay 1/5 a lb. for it?

If the Government had handled the external policy of this country properly, and if we had the markets we had heretofore and enjoyed the use of these markets until we found better ones, what would the price of the calf which the dairy cow has every year be compared with the subsidised price of 10/6d. for the calf skin?

      <P>After it has been agreed that this special levy must be paid annually by Irish farmers to Great Britain, the Minister comes in here and has now before this House an Estimate for agriculture that has been bled white, an Estimate for a gross sum of £1,700,000 or a net sum of £660,000. That is for administration only.  He puts up that Estimate and asks the House to pass it.  Deputy Dillon quite properly has down a motion to refer back the Estimate.  In a period of depression, how can the agricultural industry&mdash;I think £20,000,000 would represent the export portion of it&mdash; bear a tribute of £5,000,000 a year and survive?  What is the sense in taxing the people to the extent of £700,000 to administer Agricultural Acts in this country?  That is not the entire cost of administration.  There is a suggested rate of 2d. in the £ which agricultural committees must levy each year.  That 2d. in the £ does not appear in these Estimates at all.  It appears in the Estimates for the county councils.  That has to be levied to run the committees of agriculture.  There are other levies under the Dairies and Cowsheds Order, the Bovine Tuberculosis Order and various Orders of that kind, all running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.  That amount has to be collected and spent every year in the administration of schemes intended to help agriculture, while agriculture has placed upon it a burden that confiscates even more than the margin of profit which was derived from it when we enjoyed world market prices.  I really cannot understand the mentality of any <Col N="509" /> grown-up person who advocates an agricultural policy like that which the present Administration is putting through.  I cannot understand how any Minister or any man of mature years could tolerate the present system of agriculture.  As a matter of fact, if I had responsibility for it, I would interfere with the freedom of the farmers if they were foolish enough to work land in the way it is now being treated. The Minister gave us figures showing the increase in the acreage under wheat.  I think it went up to 160,000 acres this year as compared with about 20,000 in 1922.  How is that wheat grown?  Most of it is grown out of lea land and it is followed each year by wheat.  There is no rotation.  The fertility of the land is being robbed to produce wheat, and nothing goes back to provide the mechanical action that is necessary to keep up the fertility of the soil and keep it in what is generally known as &ldquo;good heart.&rdquo;  How can that be done?  It can be done only by mixed farming and by carrying the necessary quota of live stock.  The Minister, in his introductory speech, seemed to be concerned only with not having a surplus of live stock&mdash;with our being able to get rid of our live stock. He told us that it was necessary to slaughter more calves.  He told us that, unlike two years ago, the licences now issued for the export of fat cattle had no money value in themselves; they could not be sold at any price, whereas, two years ago, they could be sold at £4 or £5 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He tried to argue from that that the position is so much improved that we now get rid of our cattle.  But have we the same number of fat cattle to get rid of now?  Of course, we have not.  Two years ago, when this bolt fell, the quota system was introduced and the licences were introduced and handed over to the cattle dealers.  Some of them realised as much as £100 every Thursday morning for their licences for cattle in the Dublin market.  That year a considerable number of cattle were being stall-fed.  When the people could not get licences and could not get a market for their stallfeds that year, they parted with them at sacrifice prices. They had to do that.  Coming on late in the season, when the danger of their <Col N="510" /> taking pneumonia was passed, they put these cattle out on grass.  That could not be repeated.  The people could not bear to repeat the loss they suffered that year, and this year the people have not the same number of cattle tied up.  Consequently, when more cattle are going to Britain, there is a scarcity of fat cattle.  That is quite natural, and it is a fact, as the Minister knows. The Minister's own constituency has always been tillage country, and is still tillage country where grazing is not largely carried out in the summer.  The number of cattle carried on the land in Wexford during the summer is not great, but all the farmers there used to buy in cattle and fatten them in the winter, mainly for the manure necessary to carry out their tillage rotation. I suggest to the Minister that there are fewer cattle tied up in Wexford this year than have been tied up for the last four years.  If I made that as a positive statement, I doubt that the Minister would be able to contradict it.</P>

      <P>These cheap jibes are worthy of the irresponsibility that attaches to the present Administration. Though we have plenty of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; here, some of the &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; are finding out their masters.  I know some of them in County Dublin.  I have in mind a gentleman who has been a platform man for the Minister for Finance in the last few elections.  I shall not ask the Minister to read the <i>Independent,</i> but let him read &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; for some day last week and he will find that this gentleman presided at a convention of farmers at which 13 persons attended&mdash;I would not say that any of them was a farmer in the strict sense of the word.  This gentleman presided and proposed that during the economic war no rates or annuities should be collected from the farmers.  That is different from what the same group said three years ago at a meeting in the same hall&mdash;that the place for me and my colleagues in the Dublin County Council for advocating the same thing was Mountjoy.  The same gentleman now wants the Government to intervene to prevent the <Col N="511" />&ldquo;blood-sucking banks&rdquo; from calling in their mortgages.  Why?  Because an ejectment decree has been got against him, as published in the Press, for £6,000 or £7,000, and because he owes the Dublin County Council some hundreds of pounds for rates.  It has come home to him, and when it comes home to him and others like him, they drop the patriotism that is merely a whitewash on the present Administration. I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture ever considers the Commandments. Does he ever consider that we should pay our lawful debts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Finance to-day as to whether he had received a communication dated 27th January last, from <Col N="512" /> the Post Office Workers' Union and the Civil Service Clerical Association, the two largest organisations in the Civil Service, requesting an interview with him on the subject of setting up an arbitration board, which would be mutually acceptable to these organisations and the Government; and whether in view of the promise made by the President of the Executive Council over his own signature, that he was prepared to establish an arbitration board, the Minister would receive the deputation as requested, so that a satisfactory scheme of arbitration might be devised.  To that question the Minister made a lengthy reply, the substance of which was that he did not propose to receive the deputation, until such time as he had obtained the views of other organisations in the Civil Service; as if the Minister was by now unaware of the views which have been expressed by these organisations on the Minister's draft scheme of arbitration.  In order to get this question of arbitration in its proper perspective it is necessary to go back to 1932, to hear from the present President of the Executive Council his views on the subject Speaking in Rathmines Town Hall&mdash;I think on behalf of the present Minister for Finance, who was a candidate for the County Dublin Constituency, and having, no doubt, an eye on the fact that there was a considerable number of civil servants in that Constituency who would have ballot papers handed to them on polling day&mdash;the President used these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I believe it is only right that there should be an arbitration board for the Civil Service to deal with matters between the Service and the Executive.  We would be prepared to agree that an arbitration board be set up, and would assent to an inquiry into the basis on which the cost of living is calculated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There the President expressed the view, in a very definite manner, that he believed it was only right that an arbitration board for the Civil Service should be established to deal with matters in dispute between the Executive and Civil Service organisations. That was on the 28th January, 1932. The present President apparently <Col N="513" /> thought that that was not sufficiently emphatic, because in February, 1932, he published a half page advertisement in the Press which contained a declaration of programme and an appeal to the electorate.  Item number seven in the programme read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are prepared to institute an inquiry into the basis on which the cost-of-living figure is calculated, and to establish an arbitration board to deal with the grievances of Civil Servants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a very definite and in a very specific manner the present President of the Executive Council not merely promised an arbitration board twice, but made it clear that he believed it was only right, even if there was never an election presumably, that an arbitration board should be established to deal with these grievances.  The Civil Service expected there would be no delay on the part of the Government, in view of these specific promises by the President, in having the arbitration board constituted to deal with matters in dispute.  But the Government took a roundabout way of establishing the arbitration board.  It was generally believed that the President's declaration was a promise to establish an arbitration board, as it is popularly and industrially known&mdash;in other words, to establish a lay court, where the staff on the one hand, and the Minister on the other hand, could bring their claims and secure a definite judgment in the way that arbitration machinery generally provides for the declaration of judgment in matters of that kind. There was no question of there being any peculiar hybrid sort of arbitration. There was no qualification in the scheme.  It was a frank and candid declaration by the President, that there was to be an arbitration board, and obviously that meant a board of the type with which people are familiar.  After a while, however, it became clear that the Executive Council, or the Minister for Finance, thought it was necessary to have a tribunal to advise them as to the kind of arbitration board that should be constituted.  There was no tribunal set up to advise the Party prior to 1932. The President definitely promised arbitration in 1932, and the making of the <Col N="514" /> promise having produced the necessary electoral result, then there was to be an inquiry as to how this arbitration could be applied to the settlement of matters in dispute, clearly indicating in the view of the service organisations, that the Executive Council had decided that it was better to hedge on this issue than implement in a bold and honourable manner the promise specifically made by the President and which was relied upon by civil servants. However, after two or three years' cogitation by the Executive Council, the Department of Finance and the Brennan Commission of Inquiry which was set up to assist the Minister in the matter, the service organisations were furnished on the 8th June last with a document from the Department for Finance which was described as: &ldquo;Heads of the Draft Scheme of Arbitration for the Civil Service,&rdquo; together with notes on certain of the heads, and a letter from the Department of Finance containing this paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister will be glad to receive in due course the written observations, of your association on the draft scheme.  Any information required by the association in addition to that contained in the document enclosed will, as far as practicable, be sent to you on receipt of a written request in this Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The scheme submitted as a draft scheme of arbitration was the most remarkable draft scheme of arbitration anyone ever read.  It is described as a draft scheme of arbitration; it might more correctly be described as a draft scheme of arbitration, because there is none of the features of arbitration as popularly and industrially known contained in the scheme which the Minister furnished to the staff organisations.  The staff organisations, some individually and some in consultation with others, considered the Minister's scheme, and although there is a multiplicity of organisations in the Civil Service catering for particular grades, and some which cater for a comprehensive variety of grades, all except one of them rejected&mdash;some in most unmeasured language&mdash;this draft <Col N="515" /> scheme of arbitration submitted by the Minister.  It was left to one tiny organisation with a membership of 100 to 150 to be induced into the spider's web woven by the Minister.  The rest of the organisations would not dream of attempting to implement the Minter's conception of arbitration as indicated in this document.  The Post Office Workers' Union and the Civil Service Clerical Associations wrote to the Minister indicating that the scheme was unsatisfactory and unacceptable to them, and that they desired an opportunity of discussing the matter with him in order that the views of both sides might be harmonised, and a satisfactory scheme of arbitration evolved.  It was necessary that the organisations concerned should write to the Minister in these terms, because the scheme of arbitration submitted by him was utterly unacceptable.  In the scheme which the Minister submitted he proposed to circumscribe the choice of representatives by the staff. He was to be represented at the arbitration tribunal by any person he cared to select, and he was also to have a say as to the person the staff selected.  It is rather an unusual role for a defendant to be able to select his own counsel and, at the same time, to claim a veto over the counsel which the plaintiff would employ.  In substance, the Minister sought to do that in this remarkable scheme of arbitration which he produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the staffs' advocates.  I clearly said that the Minister wanted to be free to select his own counsel in a case in which he was the defendant, and to have the same say, by way of restriction, on the counsel which the plaintiffs would employ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister did not go as far as that, but I think he was doing fairly well by being free to select his own counsel to defend him there, and by wanting to interfere with the staffs' right to select people of their choice.  However, the Minister, I take it, now accepts the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then if I am to read this the time occupied in doing so will have to come out of the 15 minutes allowed to the Minister.  It was provided, firstly, that civil servants only could appear before the board, and that nobody else could appear before the board for them. They might desire to select other persons, but they could only appear before the board as individual civil servants representative of the classes concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Read paragraph 12 and see does it bear that interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided that &ldquo;the class of civil servants concerned in a claim referred to the board may select not more than three serving civil servants of that class.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So they may select their own representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of that class as individuals and as advocates to present the claim to the board.  In that way they were prevented from being represented by the officers of their organisation. They were not to be given a free choice then to select representatives, because the Minister prescribed that they must, in selecting persons to represent them before the board, be represented by three persons who as civil servants were responsible to the Minister, the defendant in the case.  They were not to be permitted to be represented by counsel, by solicitors or by the officers of their own organisation.  The Minister could select whom he liked to represent him, but the staff were to be represented by serving civil servants <Col N="517" /> and not by officers of their organisation of their own choice.</P>
      <P>The Minister's audacity did not end there.  He proposed also that he should have a veto over the matters which were referred to arbitration; in other words, that you would have to get the permission of the Minister before you could go to arbitration with the Minister, which is equivalent to saying to the plaintiff: &ldquo;You must get the defendant's permission before you can have the matter adjudicated upon by the court,&rdquo; and in case that was not sufficient the Minister was to take power to fix the terms of reference of the arbitration tribunal.  The reason given for that was so as to produce clarity.  The production of clarity was to be all on the side of the Minister. The staff were not to be allowed to fix the terms of reference which they desired should be submitted to the court, and even when the arbitration tribunal had heard the case and given a judgment which ought to be binding on both sides, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas&mdash;it having a veto in the matter if it cared to exercise it&mdash;the Minister would not, be bound by a judgment of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's scheme provided that the decision of the arbitration tribunal would not be a judgment binding on him, but would merely be a recommendation to the Executive Council which the Executive Council could accept or reject.  The picture then was: the Minister circumscribed the staff's choice of representatives; he had a veto over the matters to go to arbitration; he could fix the terms of reference, and if a verdict was given against him by an independent chairman, then that verdict was only to be regarded as a recommendation and he was free to flout it if he so choose.  In fact, in case it would be known what the recommendation was like, the recommendation was to be a confidential document.  The staffs organisations naturally rejected a scheme of arbitration of that kind, and asked the Minister for Finance to receive a deputation for the purpose of harmonising their views on arbitration <Col N="518" /> with those expressed by him in that extraordinary document.  They wrote to the Minister on 27th January, and said to him that an arbitration scheme to be acceptable to them should provide for the freedom of the organisations to select their own representatives before the tribunal, that the organisations should have the right to bring any matter to arbitration within the broad category of cases which might be referred to arbitration. They suggested that the terms of reference should be prepared jointly, and that, if there was failure to agree on that, each side could submit its terms of reference and allow the court to decide the matter on that basis.  They suggested also that the finding of the board on any scheme should be final and binding subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas.  The staff desired to see the Minister on this matter for the purpose of endeavouring to harmonise their views with those held by him, as they were invited to do in the letter received from the Department of Finance. Although the Minister has now had this request before him for almost two months from the two largest organisations in the Service, he is not apparently, prepared to receive a deputation to discuss a scheme of arbitration to be set up in accordance with the promise made by the President of the Executive Council in 1932.  I put it to the Minister that it is obviously his duty to set up a scheme which would provide the best means of having disputes between both sides decided in a reasonable manner.  The elements of fair play and justice would come more into play under such a scheme than under the draft scheme which is unacceptable to the staffs' organisations.  The only organisation that the Minister could get to accept the draft scheme was a tiny organisation of about 100 members and it is not at all improbable that if it were properly explained to the members of that organisation that they also would reject it.  There are the clearest indications that this draft scheme is unacceptable to the staffs' organisations. The President made a promise that was accepted as a pledge by civil servants, and I submit that there <Col N="519" /> should be no hesitation on the part of the Executive Council in implementing that promise.  The Minister told the House to-day that he did not give a blank cheque to anyone to fill in. Nobody has asked him for a blank cheque to fill in.  The Service organisations do not want a blank cheque, and neither do they want a dud cheque.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought receive this deputation from the two largest organisations in the Service, and in that way help to produce a satisfactory arbitration scheme, one that will be mutually acceptable.</P>

      <P>I understood that the matter which the Deputy was to raise on the adjournment was to be strictly related to the question put down on the Order Paper.  The Deputy, in fact, has resolved this into a discussion of the merits of certain proposals which were submitted to staff organisations for their considerations and observations. I think that it is a matter that will require a much longer time than I can devote to it to-night to deal with in order to show that there are sound constitutional grounds and sound reasons in the public interest why the particular scheme which we have submitted should be considered by the staff organisations and should be given practical effect to by a Statute of the Oireachtas.  Now, it is not denied that a pledge was given to establish an arbitration board and that pledge, if the Oireachtas gives us the authority, will be given statutory effect to. But it is clear from the speech we have listened to from Deputy Norton, that the meaning of arbitration has been wholly lost sight of by the staff organisations in their consideration of this matter.  Arbitration is essentially a process where two people agree to refer a certain matter to some person who is appointed as an arbitrator, who will listen to the arguments on both sides and who will express an opinion which, normally, would be binding upon the parties who made the reference to arbitration on the matter at issue in order to reconcile the difference which had arisen between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have Deputy Norton talking <Col N="520" /> about &ldquo;We must get permission before we go to arbitration.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  It means this, that the Minister for Finance, representing the general taxpayer in the country, must agree that a certain matter will be referred to an arbitration board, If there were a dispute between two parties outside, would not both parties have to agree?  But what we are asked here is that instead of an arbitration board should be constituted a court &mdash;&ldquo;a lay court&rdquo;&mdash; and that whether or not the Minister for Finance is prepared to agree that a certain matter is a proper subject for arbitration, he is to be haled before that court, as Deputy Norton says. The Minister for Finance is to be put in the position of a defendant at common law, in the position of some person who is alleged to have committed a tort or to have been guilty of some wrongdoing against another person and, whether he consents to be a party to these proceedings or not, he is to be brought before the court and put in the dock as a defendant.  That is not a position in which any member of the Government, of any Government, could permit himself to be placed in regard to the public service.</P>
    <P>This question of arbitration is a very difficult one and, because we recognised its difficulties, we set up a commission of impartial persons representative, as we thought, of all shades of the community and having among its members persons who had been civil servants and were familiar with Civil Service conditions.  They considered this question of arbitration at length and they pointed out the very serious constitutional difficulties which were in the way.  They emphasised, among other things, that the Government could not divest themselves of a responsibility which might ultimately involve an increase, and a very serious increase, in public taxation, and that they could not entrust the control of the public purse in the matter of the cost of the Civil Service, to a body which was not responsible to the Dáil or to the people.  That was the first difficulty.  They went on to refer to the constitutional position and, having considered this matter at length, the majority agreed that the principle of <Col N="521" /> arbitration might be applied to the consideration of matters which arose between the Minister for Finance, on the one hand, and the civil servants on the other, within the limitations necessarily imposed by the Constitution and by the fact that, even though the ultimate responsibility for taxation rested with the Oireachtas, the Government of the day must primarily assume responsibility for making proposals to the Oireachtas which would involve an increase in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It has been said by Deputy Norton that when the statement on arbitration was made by the President in Rathmines the Civil Service thought it meant that there would be set up something which would be what was popularly known as arbitration.  Most of the civil servants in the Free State are transferred officers.  They are very well aware of the conditions on the other side and of the conditions which exist elsewhere, and I am perfectly certain many of them have studied the introductory memoranda relating to the Civil Service, submitted by the Treasury to the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in 1929 and are aware of the fact that even on the other side of the Irish Sea the limitations which properly must apply to an arbitration scheme affecting the Civil Service are recognised and are acted on.  Here is an extract from a communication of the British Financial Secretary dated 9th March, 1926, in which he says, among other things:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But behind all such questions there is an underlying principle which must never be lost sight of. It is that the Government of the day, to whatever political Party it may belong, is responsible to Parliament for the administration of the public service.  It cannot relieve itself of this responsibility, or share it with any other persons or organisation. When, therefore, the Government accepted the principle of arbitration for the settlement of disputes arising between the Executive and servants of the State, in the earnest desire to promote the harmonious working of our institutions under fair conditions of service for all concerned, it could only do so within <Col N="522" /> certain defined limits and it could not delegate to any other authority the duty of determining what those limits should be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus, even in Great Britain, the limitations are recognised.</P>

      <P>A commission of impartial, competent persons devoted a great deal of time and labour to investigating this question of the practicability of applying the principle of arbitration to the Civil Service.  I believe that within the limitations of the Constitution they have produced a scheme which, I think, is a sound and workable scheme of arbitration, and which I am prepared to ask the Oireachtas to give statutory effect to. In any event, whether the Civil Service associations take that view or not, at least this scheme, backed by such representative opinion, by such weighty public opinion, should have received the courtesy of serious consideration by the Civil Service organisations. But, as Deputy Norton has told us, that was not the manner in which it was received by some of these organisations.  It was rejected, as he admitted, by some of them in most unmeasured language. This very carefully detailed examination of the whole position was thrown to one side and the attitude which the Civil Service organisations are asking us now to adopt is to line ourselves up with them, throw this report over altogether and repudiate these people, these public-spirited citizens who have given so much time and attention and devoted so much effort to produce an arbitration scheme which, I believe, would be <Col N="523" /> workable and which, I believe, when it is being worked, will give general satisfaction to the Civil Service.</P>
