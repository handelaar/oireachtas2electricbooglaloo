    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the low rate of wages now paid to workers employed by the Commissioners of Public Works in connection with the construction of a transatlantic air base at Rhynana, New-market-on-Fergus, <Col N="1144" /> County Clare.&mdash; (Deputies Hogan and Keyes).</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some understanding about the discussion that is going to take place.  As far as I am concerned it need only take a little time, but it might be lengthened by others.  Last night Deputy Hogan asked for an opportunity to reply and, as that is quite proper, I would be glad that he should have that opportunity.  I do not propose to occupy the time of the House to any considerable extent.  What I want to make quite clear is that this rate has not been invented for the purpose of this particular scheme, nor has it behind it any of the animus which, unfortunately, was suggested, of deliberately reducing wages or doing anything of that kind.  What happens in the case of a very large scheme is that there is a definitely segregated portion, roughly speaking, about £80,000, which is definitely analogous to drainage work in an existing drainage district.  The drainage rate for Clare, as far as I know, for the last six or seven years was 27/-, and that particular rate was adopted for the work on this scheme for no other reason than the fact that it was the conventional rate, as is the drainage rate in a scheme of this kind.  For instance, a portion of it is covered by something like £17,000 which is purely agricultural labouring work.  In the same way there is included in that £1,500 for purely temporary accommodation roads for the purpose of getting plant in for the drainage work. That £1,500 could be taken out and a special rate made for it, but what was desired was to get a rate which would cover the whole of this kind of work which is anologous to drainage work.  A large body of other work is going to be done by contract: (1) the construction of a concrete approach road also aprons to buildings and hangars; (2)  water supply and sewerage; (3)  buildings, including hangars; (4)  construction of prepared surface runways; (5)  the construction of sea breakwaters; (6)  Pitching slopes to breakwaters; (7)  construction of slipways and landing facilities; (8)  dredging anchorage.  All that is work that, as far as I know, will be done by contract <Col N="1145" /> and will be subject to the ordinary rates of contract in relation to the proper rate applicable to it.  What I am trying to get at is that there is a definite segregation here between work which is obviously of a drainage character and work which is obviously not of a drainage character, and what is desired is to get a rate which will cover the whole of those works.  We chose the highest rate which was available for work analogous to agricultural work in the district.</P>
      <P>We have run up against a certain difficulty, but the men actually working have made their own direct representations in the matter and, as far as I know, all the difficulties which they have had up to the present have been met.  I am perfectly satisfied that, as we go on, those representations will continue to be made and that those difficulties will be met as they come up.  The only difficulty that I see that might in any way technically be in the mind of anyone in criticising this as a drainage rate is probably the difficulty which is in the mind of the mover of the motion that while this is&mdash;and nobody can possibly deny that &mdash;essentially drainage, and nothing else but drainage, it is ancillary to something which is not drainage&mdash;I mean, not agricultural drainage.  The rate for drainage work has been set on the basis that the work actually done by those engaged in drainage is closely analogous to agricultural work, and the mere fact that that drainage has, in fact, been ancillary to other purposes has not affected the application of that drainage rate for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the case of the Barrow. In that case, a certain considerable amount of the effect of the drainage is not for the purpose of agricultural land at all, but benefited the property in urban areas, house property, and the rest in places liable to be flooded. Actually, some of these districts are being assessed on that valuation.  Take the Cappamore drainage in Limerick. The big urge in relation to that district as far as my experience of the files is concerned, was to save the town of Cappamore from being flooded.  Whenever I used to hear about Cappamore it was word from somebody to say, <Col N="1146" />&ldquo;Come and see Cappamore under water&rdquo;; it was not, &ldquo;Come and see the fields of Limerick under water,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Come and see Cappamore under water.&rdquo;  The fact that a good deal of the benefit of that particular scheme inured to the benefit of the town did not prevent a drainage wage, founded on agricultural wage, being used.  In another case the town of Tullamore was benefited and a special assessment was made on the town, but that did not affect the purpose.</P>
    <P>In case the Deputy may be under the misapprehension that it is the eventual purpose of the drainage which decides the wage on a scheme which is in its essence drainage, I think these things will disabuse his mind.  All I can say is that we are very anxious to see that the labour conditions in this aerodrome are going to be satisfactory. There are going to be up to 400 men employed.  We are going to have very definite difficulty in getting that amount of labour in that particular area, because geographically it is a most peculiar area.  In the ordinary way, if you want 400 men in a certain district you will have 360 degrees in the circle to draw from.  In this particular place, due to the fact that it is between the Shannon and the Fergus, you practically are out on a peninsula. You have only a very narrow radius from which to draw.  For that reason, there are going to be difficulties in getting labour and we recognise that there are problems to be solved.  All I can say is that, in the solving of these problems, every possible effort will be made to see that the conditions are those which will make for friendly and comfortable accord between those who have to do the job and those actually working on it.  Any representations I have received up to the present have been directly dealt with.  Any representations which I receive will be dealt with immediately and sympathetically. I am satisfied that, along those lines, we are more likely to obtain a solution of any difficulties we have than by discussions in this House.  The difficulty concerning discussions of this kind is that one word borrows another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is made that the Government is trying to pare down the level of wages.  The suggestion is made that the Government are using the fact that there is an amount of labour available&mdash;it is not a large amount in that particular district&mdash;for the purpose of doing the work at the lowest possible level.  That statement is utterly untrue.  The wage in Rhynana was not founded upon any <i>ad hoc</i> reason of that kind.  The wage in Rhynana was the rate which had been applicable to drainage work on which, so far as I know, £60,000 or £70,000 was spent, with the consent and agreement of the people of Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it contended that this is not drainage?  Is it contended that the rate should not be the drainage rate?  Is it contended that the rate which is being paid in Clare, which represents a 3/- advance on the average agricultural wage of the district is not the proper rate?  If it is not to apply to Clare, then it has got to be changed in relation to all other places.  If that is done, the House will have to face the implications in relation to the whole of drainage and the raising of the cost.  It will have specifically to face the implications in connection with the raising of the cost of hand labour relative to machine labour.  A great many of the present drainage schemes are in the position that they have just barely passed.  Any increase in the cost of drainage is going to reduce the total amount of drainage and any increase in the cost of labour is going to decrease the proportion of labour relative to machinery in the schemes which have been passed.  That is a question I should be very glad to have discussed in the House.  So long as that is not settled to be changed in relation to drainage as a whole, then, so far as I can see, we have no option but to say that in Rhynana the drainage rate was the right and proper rate.  Again, I say any representation I receive in relation to labour down there will have the most sympathetic and careful consideration.</P>

      <P>Last night, the House listened to one of the filthiest and most uncouth speeches ever heard in this House.  Coming from Deputy Hugo Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works, one did not expect very much better.  Recently, that Deputy had the audacity and effrontery to profane the sacredness of an Irish funeral by suggesting that Irish funerals and Irish wakes were, in his mind, used for quite dishonourable purposes.  Last night, we had from the Deputy a speech which came from the same filthy mind&mdash;a speech which constituted an attack upon the conditions of Irish workers and upon the right of anybody other than himself to regulate the conditions under which Irish workers should work.  We were told last night by Deputy Flinn that one of the justifications for continuing the low rate of 27/- per week on this scheme is that, during the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration, a similarly low wage of 27/- was paid. Apparently, everything else that Cumann na nGaedheal did, whether in the form of paying the land annuities or retaining the Oath or any other form, can be altered, but the wage-rates fixed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration are irrevocable so far as this Government is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Except when they reduced them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason they are irrevocable is that that low-wage mentality of the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration suits the whole outlook and purpose of the Parliamentary Secretary.  A wage of 27/- per week is to be paid now simply because it was paid by the previous Administration. In the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary, there is no reason for changing the wage-rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who sat in during this debate last night, could have told the Parliamentary Secretary that, during the past four or five years, there has been a distinctly upward tendency in industrial wage-rates.  If there has not been <Col N="1149" /> a similarly upward tendency in respect of agricultural wages, it is due to the unparalleled depression which exists in the agricultural industry.  Seeing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce accepts the position that officials of his Department can preside over conferences and fix rates of wages higher than those which obtained five or ten years ago, is there not something illogical in the fact that a State Department, such as the Board of Works, should hold up its hands in holy horror at any prospect of increasing the wage-rates which existed ten years ago?  We are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that, in his opinion, a wage of 27/- per week is good enough for workers on this scheme.  A wage of 4/6 per day is good enough to maintain a man, his wife and children, according to the wage mentality of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Four and sixpence per day is the rate of wages being paid on this State scheme at Rhynana, though it is not so many years ago since the present Government Party denounced in unmeasured terms the higher wage of 32/- per week being paid on the Shannon scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-two shillings per week was not good enough for Irish workers when the Fianna Fáil Party wanted the votes of the workers, but now 27/- per week is a generous wage, so far as the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works is concerned.  If these two declarations do not reveal the grossest and rankest hypocrisy, I have yet to conjure up any real explanation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;&mdash;4/6 per day on a State aerial scheme&mdash; on preparing plant and premises for a State aerial scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Four and sixpence per day is the Parliamentary Secretary's conception of the standard of living that he would extend to Irish workers and their families, and even this 4/6 per day can only be earned during good weather.  There is a good deal of broken time on this scheme, and many of these workers never get 27/- per week or 4/6 per day.  Many of them spend as many as 30 and 40 hours per week walking to and from this scheme in order to earn, not the 27/- per week, but sometimes two-thirds of that sum, due to broken time.  This is a State scheme, and these are the standards of wages that the Parliamentary Secretary prescribes for Irish workers.  I quoted in another debate a statement by a responsible body, such as the British Medical Association, that in order to maintain workers in the barest state of health it was necessary, in the opinion of that association, to spend £1 3s. 8d. per week on food in the conditions that obtained in Britain in 1933.  Many of these people who are working for 27/- per week can never spend even that low sum of money on food because many of them do not earn £1 3s. 8d. per week under the wage scales fixed by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Four and sixpence per day is now the Parliamentary Secretary's declaration of the standard that should exist for Irish workers employed on this or on similar work.  If that is the kind of republic that we are going to get, if that is the kind of republic that the Parliamentary Secretary is striving for, then God help the workers in that republic if he has anything to do with fixing wage rates or their conditions of employment.  The other evening we had an effort by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to suggest that the unemployment assistance standards were not intended to be the State's measure of what was necessary in order to maintain healthy existence.  We cannot have that <Col N="1151" /> statement on this occasion.  On this occasion the State is definitely carrying out a work which is not a relief scheme, which is a normal piece of work, and which, in many respects, compares with the work undertaken on the Shannon scheme so far as drainage and excavation are concerned. Yet, the very Administration which condemned that low rate of wages now fixes a wage for this State scheme at Rhynana at 5/- a week below the intolerably low rates fixed in connection with the Shannon scheme.</P>
      <P>Last night, again to show his vulgarity, and again to show that he was not one of the mere Irish, the Parliamentary Secretary wanted to have a bet of £500 on the conditions under which those unfortunate people at Rhynana are being paid 4/6 a day. Clearly, none of the Rhynana workers could take up that bet, even if the Parliamentary Secretary were prepared to lay ten to one.  These workers at 4/6 a day are not in a position to have many £500 bets, and yet we had the brazen audacity of the Parliamentary Secretary, who is paying these workers 4/6 a day, standing up in this House and offering to have a bet of £500 on the conditions under which they are being sweated by his authority. I imagine that there must be decent members in the Fianna Fáil Party who did not find it easy to swallow a statement of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary's vulgarity could not even end with his willingness to offer £500 bets over the 4/6 a day wage that he is paying on this scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary went further, and, in the course of an attempted reply to Deputy Hogan's motion, indulged in comments about the electoral strength of the Labour Party, and about its authority to raise this matter in the House.  I am glad to notice that this morning the tone of the Parliamentary Secretary has changed.  Apparently those in the Party who possess good manners have had in the meantime a severe talk with the Parliamentary Secretary.  Last night we had a virago addressing this House.  This morning the Parliamentary Secretary comes in <Col N="1152" /> like a cooing dove after the Party managers had suitably instructed him that that kind of language was much too vulgar for him to get away with. The Parliamentary Secretary chose to make an attack on the rights of the Labour Party to raise this matter in the House.  Deputy Hogan's right to do so was insultingly referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary.  We were told last night that, as a matter of fact, the only person who has any right to regulate conditions there, or to look after the interests of Irish workers, was none other than Deputy Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary.  It may be that the Labour Party's strength in this House is not as great as it ought to be, but then our electoral system produce strange results, and one of the most amazing of these results to me is that in a democratic country, where there is free education, enlightened people, and workers in particular, should elect to this House one who possess the tongue of a sewer rat such as Deputy Flinn possesses.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points that I wish to make on this motion.  I do not know that the members of the Labour Party have the right to appear surprised, as they seem to, at the performance of the Parliamentary Secretary last night.  I do not think Deputy Norton was correct in describing it as the worst performance that the Parliamentary Secretary has given in this House.  I think that we have had much worse performances from him.  Deputy Norton wrongs the Parliamentary Secretary when he accuses him of standing for a wage of 27/- a week, because the Parliamentary Secretary does not stand for that.  Do not Deputy Norton, Deputy Hogan and other members of the Labour Party remember the Parliamentary Secretary telling us in this House that the person who would dare to stand between an unemployed man and a wage of 21/- a week would be torn limb from limb?  That is the mentality of the gentleman who is put in charge of relief schemes and schemes that are not relief schemes but which, for the purpose of low wages, are treated as relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party cannot escape a certain responsibility themselves, because it was they who put Deputy Flinn there and it is they who are keeping Deputy Flinn there.  I do not believe there is any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who has the same outlook, and, I must say, the same contempt for Irish workers and, in particular, for the Irish unemployed, as Deputy Flinn has.  That was not evident to-day or yesterday; last night was not the first time when it was made evident.  He made the statement <Col N="1154" /> clearly in the House as a threat definitely to us, that if we dared to stand between an unemployed man and 21/- a week we would be torn limb from limb.  This morning the Deputy denied that he was at any time, or is now, taking advantage of the fact that there are huge numbers of unemployed in the country.  What was the meaning of that statement?  The Deputy's mentality is quite well known.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton talked about wages conditions under the previous Government. It is fairly well on record here what my views were with reference to the wages paid by the previous Government.  I think there was no member of the Dáil who attacked those wages conditions as often and as vigorously as I did.  I did not then, and neither do I now, agree that they were reasonable conditions, but I will say that they were infinitely superior to the wages that are being paid by the present Government, in particular having regard to the increase in the cost of living.  The Deputy knows that the purchasing power of wages to-day is not at all as great as in those days. The Deputy knows that the conditions on the Shannon scheme were quite different to the conditions on this scheme.  He knows that they represent more than a mere difference of 5/- a week.  The wage of 32/- paid on the Shannon scheme, bad as it was, was a minimum rate and many workers doing similar work to what is being done at Rhynana got £2 per week, and even £2 2s. and £2 4s. per week.  It is only fair that that should be said.  It must be remembered also that a great deal of the work at the beginning of the Shannon scheme was work exactly similar to what is being done at Rhynana.</P>
    <P>Let me put a final point to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If the Government decided to establish this air base in the County Dublin, near the City of Dublin, what wages would they decide to pay? Would they dare to offer 27/-, or even 37/- a week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They would offer the standard rate for the district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would be obliged to pay a higher rate because there are trade unions in and around Dublin strong enough to insist on the fixing of a decent rate of wages.  The Minister would not get the work done for 27/- a week, and he knows that.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that they are not taking advantage of the existing conditions. Of course they are.  We know the mentality of the Parliamentary Secretary quite well.  The responsibility is not altogether his. Those who helped to put him there and who keep him there will have to share some of the responsibility.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the motion moved by Deputy Hogan and supported by Deputy Keyes.  I want to say that the Labour Party should not be charged with the responsibility of keeping Deputy Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary, in public life in this country.  It is unfair to the Labour Party.  After all, the Fianna Fáil Party must share in the blame, if there is any.  I want to say on behalf of the citizens of Cork, so far as the responsible citizens are concerned anyhow, the persons who do not go according to the instructions of the Fianna Fáil Clubs in order to keep Deputy Flinn in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The ruling you have just given is entirely novel to me and it does not correspond with what is actually printed in the rules of order or the rules of procedure of this House.  After all, there are several Parliamentary Secretaries, and I submit that it is much more convenient that it should be open to Deputies to refer to them by their names.  I also submit that, for example, in the British House of Commons, it is not by any means <Col N="1156" /> compulsory on members to refer to people holding similar positions as the Parliamentary Secretary of so-and-so.</P>

      <P>The procedure in the British House of Commons is of interest to the Chair, but does not govern its rulings.  It is not obligatory to address the Parliamentary Secretary as such, but it has been customary.  There seems to the Chair to-day to be a deliberate design to speak of the Parliamentary Secretary as Deputy Flinn.</P>

      <P>In view of the remarks of the Chair I shall remember to refer to him as Deputy Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary, or, to give him his full title, Deputy Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  It was in order to economise time that I called him Deputy Flinn, instead of Parliamentary Secretary.  In order further to economise time, I will say that it is most unfair to blame the Labour Party, to saddle all the responsibility on them for having the Parliamentary Secretary here.  The Fianna Fáil Party too must take their share of the blame and some of the so-called trade unionists in the ranks of Fianna Fáil must take responsibility.  Deputy Corry seems anxious to interrupt.  The Deputy always interjects something about the &ldquo;poor, misfortunate farmers.&rdquo;  Many farmers object to that; they do not like being called &ldquo;poor, misfortunate farmers.&rdquo;  The Deputy keeps up that reference just like a parrot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wages paid on this scheme to workers who have to work in all sorts of weather, and who in many cases have to travel long distances to their work, are undoubtedly inadequate&mdash;I do not want to apply any other adjective.  The wages are entirely inadequate.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance last evening said that rubber boots were <Col N="1157" /> supplied to these workers and that at times they were only up to their ankles in the water.  The Parliamentary Secretary must know as well as I do that the weather conditions in this country are very variable and that while on one portion of a road in a certain condition of the weather these boots may not be at all necessary, there are other portions of the road where the men will require thigh boots in order to work.</P>

      <P>It is not worth while taking up the time of the House with Deputy Anthony and Deputy Morrissey any longer.  I should like to congratulate the mover of the motion upon a very astute piece of special pleading. I gather that one of the first things all budding advocates learn is that if they have a bad case the right thing to do is to attack the other man's representative in the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, when the mover of the motion came to justify the terms of it to the House, the one thing he carefully avoided was a statement of the facts in the matter.  This issue was put against the background of the world.  We remember the very eloquent and polysyllabic phrases which the Deputy used on a number of occasions to let the people of the country think that all this was being done, not for the benefit and advantage of this small country and this comparatively poor community but for weathy international corporations, and that the work which was being carried out at Rhynana was work of a character which was unique in this country and that upon this highly specialised work there was being paid to the men in Rhynana an unusually low rate of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the terms in which the Parliamentary Secretary characterised that charge, but I do think that if a person is told that he is deliberately trying to grind <Col N="1159" /> the faces of the poor, and deliberately trying to reduce the standard of living of the workers in this country, if an attack is launched on the Government charging them in general terms with endeavouring to introduce coolie conditions of labour in this country, if words mean anything in the mind of the man who utters them, the person to whom such language is addressed is entitled to show very just resentment, and to show it in just the same unmeasured way as that in which the charge was levelled against him.  That was the atmosphere in which this question was originally discussed.  That was the atmosphere which was created when the discussion was initiated.  And it was done deliberately.  It was done, as I have said, to obscure the facts of the case.  What are the facts?  Here is a drainage district where drainage works were formerly carried out.  It is now being reconditioned, and what is the type and character of the work? We are not building workshops, hangars, concrete runways, special embankments, or reclaiming any land destroyed.  There is no specialised work being carried out there at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there canalisation to be done on the scheme?  We ought not to have obscurities drawn up here in an endeavour to cloud our minds.  Some of us know something about the works just as well as the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember interrupting Deputy Hogan or Deputy Keyes.  I listened very patiently when we were being told that the first broadcast message which went out from the broadcasting station there was: &ldquo;The Irish Government is paying starvation rates of wages on its works.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Hogan is a man of imagination. He referred to me as a poet.  I know, of course, when he stated that the first message that went out from this wireless station was that the Irish Government was paying a starvation rate of wages, that he had simply gone <Col N="1160" /> and taken out his poetic licence and was indulging in the same sort of imaginative language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as I would, and therefore, I listened to him with a fellow feeling.  I do not feel the same resentment towards Deputy Hogan as a man would who might take him very seriously.  Let us get back again to what the facts are.  Here was a drainage district which was being reconditioned.  It had already been drained.  The work at present being carried out there consists, mainly, as the Parliamentary Secretary told the House last night&mdash;and these are the facts which govern and determine the issue&mdash;of the opening up of existing drains, sluices and outfalls&mdash;all being done by hand labour; the clearing of bushes, undergrowth, etc.&mdash;all being done by hand labour, and work that is done from day to day or, at any rate, from season to season, on the farms around Rhynana, and done by agricultural labourers paid agricultural rates; the excavation of main drains and boundary drains, levelling and grading, excavating trenches for subsoil drains, laying subsoil drains, back-filling with stone and replacing turf &mdash;ordinary field drainage, piping, culverting and filling existing drains, laying temporary surface roads&mdash; accommodation roads, as the Parliamentary Secretary has told the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The same as a county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including quarrying; strengthening existing embankments; and the preparation of the soil for grass surfacing, including ploughing, harrowing, rolling, fertilising and sowing.  That is the work being carried out down in Rhynana, and all this talk about transcontinental, international, inter-imperial services, and all that sort of thing, has nothing at all to do with the issue. Yet it was the background against which Deputy Hogan deliberately set this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but what has something to do with it, and what has a great deal to do with it, is the agricultural rate in the district, because, as the Deputy knows, and as he was informed last night, this is not the first drainage work carried out in County Clare.  Since 1929, there have been drainage works, costing, I think, roughly £40,000, carried out in and around that area in County Clare, and the rate which has been paid on these works has been consistently 27/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1932, that rate was being paid in County Clare.  It was being paid generally, and we had an election in 1933 and we came back. The reason we came back is that the people know that so far as these wage rates are concerned there is no foundation for the Labour Party's accusation that we are deliberately trying to reduce rates of wages in this country.  After all, the workers on the scheme and the workers everywhere else throughout the country know that, as far as all this talk is concerned, we have been endeavouring to raise the standard of living of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Drainage works are not relief works.  Drainage works are not carried out purely and primarily as relief works.  Occasionally, in order to provide employment, drainage work which would be otherwise unjustifiable, may be subsidised and helped out of the relief votes, but a drainage scheme <i>per se</i> is not a relief work.  When I speak of drainage works in County Clare, I mean works which have been carried out under the various Drainage Acts which have been passed by the Dáil and in connection with which a rate of wages has been fixed apart altogether from the rate paid on relief works.  The rate of wages on drainage works has been fixed with regard, and in strict relation, to the general agricultural wages in the district.  I am informed that in this particular district the agricultural wage is 24/- per week. It has been the custom and it has been laid down that where drainage works are being carried out the rate of wages paid on these works shall be 3/- per week higher than the rate for agricultural wages in the district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The average county rate for agricultural wages is 24/-.  Therefore, this rate of wages was fixed in accordance with regulations that have been several times debated in this House and which, though they might sometimes have been challenged by one Deputy or another, have been in general accepted by this House as affording a fair rate of wages.  Taking all the circumstances into consideration, taking into consideration the position of people who have to work as agricultural labourers, who have to pay some part of this expenditure and <Col N="1163" /> who would have to pay more if the rates of wages on Government schemes were going to be inflated too highly&mdash; taking all these factors into consideration, this House has universally accepted the proposition that since drainage works and field works of this kind are in one way or another analogous to the ordinary work of an agricultural labourer, there should be a relation between the agricultural wage rate and the wage rate which is paid on drainage schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the multiplicity of interests concerned, I think it would be a very difficult thing for this House to fix the general wage rate all over the country.  We are going to try to do something like that, and the House passed yesterday a Bill which will enable Agricultural Wages Boards to be set up which will be in a position to investigate conditions in the various areas and which will be, we hope, able to do something to get a wage rate fixed which will be recognised as, in all the circumstances, what the industry can bear and what it can pay. When that has been done, I can certainly undertake that a relationship will be instituted between the rate which is recommended by the Agricultural Wages Board and the rate which will be paid on works carried out <Col N="1164" /> under Government auspices.  But it is not possible for the Government and it would not be fair for the Government, having regard to its duty to other interests in the country, not merely to those who happen to be employees there, but also to those who have to provide employment, to fix wholly inflated rates because the work happened to be carried out under Government auspices.  We are paying a higher rate of wages, and even Deputy Hogan must admit that himself, on this work at Rhynana and on other works which are carried out as relief works pure and simple, in agricultural and in rural areas, than is generally paid to the agricultural labourer in these districts.  I do not think we ought to make the difference too high.  If we do, we are going to create great difficulties for everybody concerned in these districts.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Murphy or any other Deputy thinks over the position he will have to agree with me.  There is no use in their being angry about it.  I am talking about facts which have to be faced.  I did say this, and I repeat it, that the Government realised that there is need for the regulation of agricultural wages in this country.  In accordance with that, the Dáil yesterday passed through its final stages a Bill which was introduced by this Government to <Col N="1166" /> permit the rate of wages for agricultural workers to be fixed.  That was not done during the past ten years. I am not so sure whether outside Great Britain it has been done anywhere other than in this country.  By doing so, we showed that we are not insensible to the needs of agricultural workers.  Not merely that, but in order that we may do as much as we can, taking into consideration all the interests involved in this matter, wherever the Government carries out work under its auspices it does pay its workers higher than the agricultural rate.  It cannot pay them so high that it would bring to a standstill, possibly, the whole agricultural industry in this country, but taking all the factors into consideration we are doing our best to pay them something more.  If, when the agricultural wages boards are set up, higher rates are fixed, then I say that the Government will endeavour to maintain the same relation as it maintains to-day between the wages paid on schemes carried out under its auspices and the general agricultural wage in the district, taking into consideration all the circumstances of that time.  I say that the Government's own record in regard to social services, in regard to the endeavours which it is making to provide employment for the people, in regard to the steps which it is taking to house the people decently and properly, and in regard even to this question of agricultural wages, absolutely disproves the charges which were levelled last night by Deputy Hogan and this morning by Deputy Norton.  The Government is prepared, on its record, to go to the working-class people of this country, and it will go to them without any fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to put one point before the Minister for Finance.  He has laid down a very definite ruling, claiming to have the support of the whole country behind him, and that was that when works of this particular kind were carried out not as relief works but as ordinary constructive works throughout the country it was the suitable thing to add 3/- to the average current labourers' wages <Col N="1167" /> in the district, and to pay that.  In the circumstances that exist in the country I consider that a very serious statement on the part of the Minister for Finance, and to involve certain serious considerations for agriculture.  He resists the criticism of the 27/- a week in Clare, that is the 24/- agricultural wage, plus 3/-.  He resists any increase in that on the ground that if the principle was departed from wages would be paid on a standard that might bring to a standstill the whole agricultural industry.  It is being maintained by the Government that farmers at the present time are able to pay a better wage to agricultural labourers than they are paying.  He said they introduced a measure which was finally passed yesterday in order to deal with that.  The Minister for Finance seems to disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some farmers, was what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate the attitude of the Government is that the average wages at present paid to agricultural labourers are below the level that the industry should pay.  The Minister for Finance will maintain that.  He will claim that the reason why the Agricultural Wages Bill was introduced was because they were convinced of that, and because they were convinced they could increase them. It is stated that the Agricultural Labourers Wages Bill can be got working in time to improve matters in May, but surely if the Minister is convinced of the justice that is denied to the agricultural labourers at the present time he ought to do something on his part to give some of that justice now. It is in his power at the present time to do something to raise the agricultural wages throughout the country by giving a better Government lead.  The reason I refer to the standard he lays down is that over the greater part of the country&mdash;taking Louth, Meath and all that area across to Galway&mdash;the average wages paid to agricultural labourers is 20/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle on which the Minister for Finance asks the House to reject <Col N="1168" /> the motion which is before it now is that if this work were being carried out in any of those counties it would be paid for at the rate of 23/-.  In County Wexford we are informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the agricultural labourers' wages this year are 19/- a week.  On the principle on which the Minister for Finance asks us to reject this motion now, if this work were being carried out in Wexford and not in Clare the wages that would be paid in Wexford would be 22/- a week.  I think some member of the Government ought to clear up the points which the Minister for Finance has left so obscure.  The Government claims that agricultural labourers are, on the average, being done an injustice to-day.  The argument they are putting up against this motion would hold that injustice there. As I say, the Deputies from Wexford who are asked to resist Deputy Hogan's motion here now are asked to consider that 22/- a week would be enough for work of this particular class in Wexford.  Deputies from Louth, Galway and Kerry are asked to consider that 23/- would be sufficient.  The Minister has not been convincing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in his usual eloquent and emphatic style, boasted that the Fianna Fáil Government had freely brought forward this Agricultural Wages Bill for the purpose of improving the standard of wages of the agricultural labourers. I know that the Minister does not know everything about what goes on in Cabinet circles, and I suggest to him that he should take advantage of the earliest possible opportunity to find out from his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, the conditions and circumstances under which that Bill was extracted from the Ministry, and as a result of which it was passed through its final stages in this House yesterday. If the Minister wants really reliable information on the matter, I think documentary evidence could be handed to him to convince him that that Bill was not brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government as freely as he would like the House to believe. Evidence is available in support of what I say.  I would prefer that the <Col N="1169" /> Minister should have a private consultation with his own colleague on the matter before speaking again in the same strain as he spoke here this morning.  In my opinion, the Minister gave a good deal of evidence in support of the motion moved by Deputy Hogan.  He admitted, in reading out particulars of the work that is being done in Rhynana, that quarrying work is being done there as well as excavation work and the laying of roads. That is not usually done in connection with arterial drainage schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also talked about fixing the rates paid on arterial drainage schemes at a figure of 3/- per week above the rate paid to agricultural labourers.  I challenge&mdash; and the members of this Party challenge, and I have challenged it successfully before&mdash;the reliability of the figures available in the Department of Finance regarding the rates of wages paid by representative farmers in this country.  I assert here quite emphatically that the figures which are available in the Department of Finance and the Board of Works are not reliable, and I have proved them to be unreliable in my own area.  Some time ago, the same Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Lands, started a forestry scheme at a place called Kinnitty in Offaly, and, to the amazement of the workers all around that countryside, fixed the rate of wages at 22/- a week.  The secretary of the local branch of the Transport Union wrote to me asking me to draw the attention of the Minister for Lands to this matter, and expressing the opinion&mdash;his letter is on the file&mdash;that some mistake must have been made by the ganger in paying this previously unheard of rate to the men employed on that scheme.  All around the countryside, where the same kind of <Col N="1170" /> scheme was being carried out, the rate of wages paid before that was about 28/- a week.  I sent it to Senator Connolly, the then Minister for Lands, who was in charge of the Department, and he informed me that the figure fixed was fixed as a result of a decision by what is known as the Wages Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the first time that I, personally, had heard of the existence of this secret Wages Advisory Committee that evidently advises Deputy Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and other members of the Department on the rates of wages to be fixed in connection with these schemes.  However, I brought the matter up in the House, following my failure to get any satisfactory settlement of that particular dispute. The men concerned had refused to carry on and there was a dispute in the locality.  Senator Connolly, in the debate that took place here, informed me that the rate of wages, which was 22/- a week, was fixed after the Department had looked for and secured the rates of wages paid by representative farmers in the locality.  I was aware that the information in regard to the figures paid by what are called representative farmers in the locality were supplied to the Ministry&mdash;I do not say all the figures were supplied, but in some cases they were supplied&mdash;by local Fianna Fáil clubs.  I had also in my possession proof&mdash;and I had satisfied myself on it&mdash;that there were farmers&mdash;three of them, at any rate&mdash;in the very same locality, who gave a good deal of employment who were actually paying £1 a week to their agricultural labourers, plus meals.  Now, if 22/- a week was correct for the forestry workers, the average rate paid by the farmers should be 19/-.  It must be remembered also that these agricultural labourers were employed all the year round, and not on casual work as most of the workers on State-aided schemes are employed.  I challenge the figure of 24/- a week so far as it affects the Country Clare.  I do not accept the figures of the Department of Finance and other Government Departments concerning the rates of wages paid by representative farmers&mdash;decent farmers <Col N="1171" />&mdash;in the various localities in this country.  I make this point&mdash;and I am sure it will appeal to Deputy Corry. Deputy Corry is a farmer, and whatever Deputy Anthony and other Deputies may think of him, I take off my hat to him for the speech he made, on the Second Reading, in support of the Agricultural Wages Bill.  If Deputy Corry could succeed in inducing the farmers of this country to accept the point of view that he put forward when speaking on the Second Reading of that Bill, it would be a good day for the farmers of this country.  If he should speak in this debate, I ask him to say that agricultural labourers who are continuously employed at whatever may be the prevailing rate for the locality concerned&mdash;and it is more, in my opinion, than 24/- in the Country Clare; that is, the rate&mdash;paid by decent farmers at any rate&mdash;are better off and that it means more to the workingman than the 24/- which he gets for these casual relief works such as this scheme at Rhynana or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The agricultural labourer is far better off, because he has continuous employment and, in the majority of cases, has also meals and milk for his family and, in many cases, he has housing and grazing on the land of his employer at a nominal rent.  I think that the Minister for Finance is altogether wrong when he compares the conditions of the men employed on relief schemes at 24/-, or 22/- as it is in western counties, with the case of the agricultural labourers.  The case made here is that this work is no different from the work being carried out under the county councils where the wage is up to 35/- a week.  I think that, if anything, the Minister for Finance, by his speech, has really made a good point in favour of Deputy Hogan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, Sir, but in doing so I wish to make it plain that I entirely disbelieve in any suggestion that either the Government as a whole, or even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, is animated by a desire to depress the rates of wages <Col N="1172" /> throughout the country.  I think that, altogether, the most convincing speech that has been made on this motion was the speech that was made a few moments ago by Deputy Mulcahy.  It appears that the Government regard the Bill that has just been passed, the Agricultural Wages Bill, as an argument in their favour, but I suggest that that Bill is fatal to their present contentions.  There is talk of bringing the agricultural industry in this country to a standstill.  Now, if the Agricultural Wages Bill is to perform anything like what is hoped of it, it will result in the increase of agricultural wages, generally, by several shillings a week.  That is to be done&mdash;and I supported its being done&mdash;irrespective of any danger that may exist of its bringing the agricultural industry to a standstill.  If there is a danger, where does it lie?  Is it more likely that raising the wages of agricultural labourers, to be paid by farmers, by several shillings a week should bring the agricultural industry into difficulties, or is it more likely that the increase of Government wages by some shillings a week would bring the agricultural industry into difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should we not have some figures given to us?  We are not dealing with relief works, but we are dealing with Government works other than relief works.  When Deputy Fagan, yesterday or the day before, said that 30/-was, in his opinion, the lowest weekly wage on which a man could keep himself and his family in any sort of decency, there were cheers from the Government Benches.  If that is the case, what would it really cost the Government to raise the wages paid for any works that they undertake, other than relief works, at any rate, to 30/- a week?  It seems to me that now that we, very properly, have embarked upon an inquiry and embarked upon reform in relation to this whole matter of agricultural wages, the Government cannot rid themselves of the duty that, preeminently, lies upon them to see that the wages given to people working on schemes of theirs are wages that enable the workers to keep themselves <Col N="1173" /> and their families in some sort of decency.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, Sir, I wish to raise a point of order that I do not like to let go unnoticed.  I did not like to interrupt Deputy Norton, but he alluded several times to what he called &ldquo;the filthy mind&rdquo; of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  Well, I am no admirer of the style of oratory of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, but I think it would be deplorable if a precedent were set for treating such an expression as &ldquo;filthy mind,&rdquo; applied to another member of this House, as a Parliamentary expression.</P>

      <P>There is one matter in which I wish to correct Deputy Davin. The Deputy made a statement that we were forced to bring in the Agricultural Wages Bill.  I can assure Deputy Davin that many months before any motion from the Labour Party on this matter appeared on the Order Paper I was chairman of a committee that went into the agricultural question. That committee brought in a report recommending the Bill that has been before the House this week.  That report was unanimously adopted by my Party.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had a brain wave.  On this particular point I want to say that to my mind Deputy Hogan has <Col N="1174" /> opened up a very wide question because I understand that work of this kind is about to go on in my constituency sometime soon.  This, I understand, is work where a site will have to be prepared for an aeroplane base. Now people who used aeroplanes in any country in the world are people who can dang well afford to pay for them and to my mind the preparation of the ground for building an aeroplane base has no relation at all to agricultural work.  Apparently, there seems to be no objection to pay big money to a so-called expert who comes over to fly over a bit of bog and to tell the authorities that that is a nice place for an aeroplane base.  That gentleman is paid a couple of thousand pounds for his job.</P>

      <P>And there is no objection to paying £2,000 a year to gentlemen for walking around the grounds of an aeroplane base and saying they are the bosses.  I suggest that work of this kind has no relation to relief work or agricultural work, or to the wages paid for work of that kind; the wages paid to men employed preparing an aeroplane base should not be on a level with the wage paid to men on drainage work.  I make this statement more or less as a warning before hand so that, in the case of any work of that kind that may be contemplated in my constituency, the wages are not to be based on agricultural rates of wages.</P>

      <P>Not of Deputy Morrissey. In connection with this motion, statements were also made about agricultural wages.  I have heard statements made by the Labour Party on the reliability of wages statistics quoted in this House on both sides.  These have no relation at all to the actual local wage paid in the district in question.  I say that the people who prepared those figures do not know what they are talking about.  I have seen figures for Cork County, and for other counties as well.  Farmers here listening to me are aware of the regular rates paid in their districts.  What usually happens is this: a Gárda walks in to a farmhouse and says to the labourer there: &ldquo;Mick, what are you getting?&rdquo; and Mick says: &ldquo;I am paid 12/- a week.&rdquo; That 12/- is written down.  But the Gárda never looks into the board and lodging that that labourer is getting. That is never considered at all.  This is one of the factors that is bringing down this so-called rate of wages.  The ordinary labourer working in any other scheme would pay 15/- or 20/-a week for board and lodging, and if those who compiled those wage figures were to put down 15/- to 20/- a week for board and lodging for the labourer, you would have an entirely different situation, and entirely different figures with regard to the wages of agricultural labourers.  There are, of course, black sheep in every flock.  Amongst industrialists you will find a scabby fellow trying to knock what he can off the wages of his men.  An odd farmer may be found to be doing the same. The Bill was brought in to deal with the black sheep.  I am giving the House my honest opinion on this matter. Now, with regard to the aeroplane base, I want again to say that people who fly in aeroplanes are not men earning £1 or £2 a week.  They are people who can very well afford to pay £10 or £12 for a short trip, and it follows that the syndicates concerned with preparing these aeroplane bases can afford to pay a decent wage to the men engaged in preparing the base on which travellers by aeroplane are to land, that is, if they land there at all, and if they do not land in the sea.</P>

      <P>During the debate on this motion, there have been a very great many regrettable features, and <Col N="1176" /> I have listened to a great many regrettable utterances.  The speech to which we have listened from Deputy Corry is obviously a speech which shows that the Deputy has given some study to this whole question.  Therefore, I welcome it as a useful contribution to this debate.  On other occasions I have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance speeches of the same calibre as that to which we listened last night.  We had his speech of last night continued in a subdued mood this morning.  I am not surprised at that speech, because many years ago I made up my mind with regard to the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude on wages.  I think it is no exaggeration, or it is not unfair to him, to say that the Parliamentary Secretary has never made any attempt to hide his contempt for the working people of this country.  That is obvious in every way, and especially in the policy he is carrying out in his office at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen some extraordinary transformations in this House over a number of years.  But I think the most complete and perfect transformation that has taken place is what we see in the case of the Minister for Finance. In one of the usual foolish moments associated with youth, many years ago, I purchased a volume of poems by John Francis MacEntee.  Every line of that volume exuded the most pure and undiluted patriotism.  It is difficult to understand that the author of that volume is the Minister for Finance, a member of this House who has spoken here this morning.  Pure and hard materialism is the outstanding characteristic of that speech, but the pure and hard materialism of the speech this morning found no parallel in the volume produced a few years ago.  It is clear that the Minister for Finance has abandoned the democratic qualities that characterised his youth. While it is very often said that in advancing years people become more conservative, the progress of the Minister for Finance in that direction has been truly astonishing.  It is the merest subterfuge to try to associate the work. at Rhynana with agricultural work. There is no relation whatever between them.  There could be no relationship between the type of work being done <Col N="1177" /> there at present and the type of work carried on on drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corry said, this is work preparatory to the launching of a State scheme.  This is State work, pure and simple, and a wage of 27/- represents the State's conception of the appropriate wages to be paid there.  We have often heard recently the old story that you cannot get more out of a pool than you put into it.  That argument is always used when the question of wages arises.  It is an argument that is always heard when there is a discussion about widows' and orphans' pensions, and questions of that kind. We heard it from people like Deputy Anthony, who has swallowed every protestation he ever made in favour of democracy and a decent standard of living.  I repudiate Deputy Anthony's right to interfere in this debate, having regard to the fact that recently he was a member of Cork Corporation, who repudiated the right of the workers employed by the corporation to get a fair standard of wages, and was one of the men who signed the report denying them a hearing.  I want to criticise the Minister, but I want to see criticism coming from people who have the right to criticise. I repudiate Deputy Anthony's right to speak on this question at all.  The whole position here is disgraceful from the point of view of wages.  With regard to wages paid on minor relief schemes, I want to say that the present maximum of 24/- is less than what is paid in certain parts of the country by the previous Government.  I know of certain areas where 24/- is paid now where 25/- and 26/- was paid formerly. If that is not evidence of a deliberate attempt to depress wages, there is no use trying to argue with the mentality that refuses to recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>I believe there is overwhelming feeling in the Party to which the Parliamentary Secretary belongs against the wage standard of his Department, and I hope that feeling in the Party, which I have no doubt exists, will find its expression either by way of support for this motion, or by way of whatever machinery may be devised for a reconsideration of the position.  We heard about the undue strain on the people of the country.  What about the people who have to exist within the <Col N="1178" /> limit of the wages we are discussing? Must we always regard the question of pounds, shillings and pence as a consideration far exceeding in importance men, women and children in the matter of living and in the standard of wages? If we do, let us be definite about it and let us not pretend sympathy and support for the human needs of the people while disregarding them every time that the opportunity offers.  I want to associate myself with this motion, and I want to repudiate the line of attack directed against it as most unworthy, and as definitely evidencing a callous disregard of the human needs of the working people concerned.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to correct a statement which I saw in the newspapers this morning, that I stated that 30/- a week was the lowest amount that should be considered a living wage.  What I said last night was that 30/- was the lowest amount that could procure the necessary amount of food to maintain life.  I did not characterise it as a living wage.  I want to correct that statement now.</P>

Up to the present he has shown no inclination whatever to face up to the problem of fixing a living wage.

      <P>I am not going to be drawn by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is no use in his trying <Col N="1179" /> to do so.  The Minister may as well drop that attitude at the outset.  There is no use in stooping to the level of frivolity in which the Parliamentary Secretary indulged last night.  It will not add anything to the Parliamentary Secretary's personal reputation, nor will it enhance the dignity of the office he holds.  If the phrases I used in an endeavour to indicate a background for this question please the Parliamentary Secretary he can have these phrases free.  There is no copyright claim in them.  There will be one characteristic about them, at least, that is not common in the verbal armoury of the Parliamentary Secretary, they express the correct idea.  The Parliamentary Secretary said this was not heavy work, and then he proceeded to mention excavating, quarrying, and draining, and on that basis he said that the work was not heavy nor arduous.  I want the House to infer from the specification what kind this work is.  I say that the work is heavy and arduous, and is much more severe than work on the roads under Clare County Council, or work done by agricultural labourers in the area surrounding the air base construction works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is quarrying or drainage done by machinery?  The Parliamentary Secretary said that 27/- per week was the rate that had been paid in that area for years.  Therefore, that rate will be continued, and everything that was against the workers' conditions should be continued.  That was the programme of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and it was the accumulation of such activities that brought the Labour Party into the Lobby to vote the Cumann na nGaedheal Party out of office.  We objected to such rates when that Party was in office, and we object when the Fianna Fáil Government tries to continue that bad practice.  Having come into office, what has become of the Christian social services in connection with Parliamentary institutions about which they spoke?  We do not see any of them in the construction of the <Col N="1180" /> works at Rhynana.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the workers were satisfied with the payment they were getting.  I want to tell him that I had to use whatever influence I have to prevent a demonstration which would convince the Parliamentary Secretary that they are not satisfied with the conditions of employment, or with the rates of wages paid at the air base construction works.  There is very clear proof that they are not.  I said last night that even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is the political head of the Board of Works, would not have the temerity to suggest that it is because he can find sufficient people to work for 27/-that they are employed.  No one would have the temerity to say that.  These are the people who stand for Christian administration.  The Parliamentary Secretary's statement was that the workers were quite happy and satisfied. If people can be found to take that work, to paraphrase the words of Stuart Mill, that is robbing the poor because they are poor.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary's phrase means, that the poor can be robbed because they are poor; that men are being got at 27/- a week to do this work, and that they are satisfied they are getting more than they would get as unemployment assistance, and are satisfied that they are better off than if they were doing nothing.  That is robbing them because they are in that position.  These world services are to be built on human need, and on the flesh and blood of the needy workers in the country.  It is like what happened in ancient times, when they were under the lash of the slave masters.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that I do not speak for the workers in this matter.  There are two very noticeable absentees from the Fianna Fáil Benches this morning.  My two colleagus in the representation of Clare belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party are not here.  If they were here, would they say that I do not speak for the workers in that district?  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I addressed at least 300 people in New-market-on-Fergus about a fortnight ago, and said there the same things that I have said here regarding these <Col N="1181" /> wages; that I had representations made to me by the workers employed at the air base construction works, and I had to tell them that I did not think it would be a wise course to make a demonstration, such as they suggested they should make because of the conditions there.  When a member of the Government visited that area, was a statement of the demands to the workers at the air base put into his hands?  Are not these demands based upon the statements I am making here?  Did they not bear out the statements I am making and show clearly that I am speaking on behalf of the workers there?  I am speaking on behalf of the workers of that district, and on behalf of the workers of Clare.  Not alone am I speaking on behalf of the workers, but on behalf of every decent-minded farmer, every decent-minded shopkeeper, and every decent-minded citizen in that constituency.  The Parliamentary Secretary twitted us that we are not a big Party.  Does he think that truth and justice always march with the big battalions?</P>

It does not matter whether I am speaking for the workers or not, whether we are a big Party or not, or whether 27/- per week is the drainage rate paid in the area or not.  Several questions that I asked are clamouring for an answer.  One of them is: Is it a condition of the agreement that a standard of living is being imposed in the construction of this air base which the Canadian or British navvy would not accept?  Is it a condition of that agreement that we are to impose upon our workers here conditions that they would not accept?</P>

      <P>I gave the position of the agricultural worker in Clare last night&mdash;that he gets £26 a year in cash, together with board and lodging and laundry.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister for Finance, contend that 27/- per week corresponds to £26 per year, together with board and lodging and laundry in a farmer's house?  Can they give any figures to prove or sustain that?  Of course, they cannot.  On what is the 27/- based?  Is it based on the fact that you can get sufficient food, clothing and shelter for a single man for 27/- per week?  What food, clothing and shelter are you going to give a man and his wife and family for 27/-per week?  It takes some of these people at least 100 hours to get that 27/-.  I know of one man who cycled six miles back and forward to get this 27/- and who had to give up the work because he could not keep it up.  I know people who come home with 19/-, after endeavouring to earn this miserable 27/-, because of broken time. The Government have made no attempt to answer the case put up. The Parliamentary Secretary last night indulged in a lot of debating society tactics.  He treated us to a low standard of frivolity.  It is not frivolity for these people.  The offer of a wager of £500 as to the conditions of employment and the rate of wages in Rhynana shows the Parliamentary Secretary's outlook on the matter.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Unemployment Assistance Acts&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the wholly inadequate rates of benefit originally provided for unemployed persons under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and to the fact that during the last two years the retail prices of commodities normally used in working-class homes have been raised substantially, this House requests the Executive Council to introduce proposals for amending the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 and 1935, with a view to providing from State funds adequate maintenance for all persons unable to obtain remunerative employment.&mdash;(Deputies Norton, Corish, Davin and Keyes.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on Wednesday night, I was dealing with the rotation system of employment in consequence of the assertion made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Government were placing men at work at standard rates of wages.  I indicated that there was a great deal of discontent prevailing in consequence of the low rates of wages that are being paid on these particular works.  It was definitely understood in the country, when this rotation scheme was started, that the rates of wages that prevailed in the district for the same class of work were to be paid.  In the County Wexford, at the moment, some road work is being done under this rotation system and the men are only being paid at the rate of 24/- a week&mdash; 12/-for three days' work.  That, I would point out to the Minister, is not in accordance with the statement that he made in the course of his speech.  The question of how men are recruited for this rotation system is one to which, I think, the Minister should devote his attention.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out that, notwithstanding the fact that local authorities are compelled to put up 50 per cent.  of the amount required to do certain works in their area, they are not permitted to interfere in the employment of any of the men engaged on the work.  Now, that may be good or bad, but under the system which prevails at the moment you have some men in receipt of unemployment assistance who will never get any employment out of those schemes.  As the Minister knows, the regulations provide that the men who are in receipt of the greatest amount of benefit are taken off the list first, so that in an area, where 13/6 is the maximum, there is no chance of anybody in receipt of under about 12/- ever receiving employment under this system.  Notwithstanding the fact that men who are in receipt of the maximum amount of benefit have already got work on these schemes, when a new scheme is started the labour exchange again sends on men starting at the top of the list&mdash; that is men who are in receipt of the greatest amount of benefit.  I think the Minister will agree that that is not a good system.  In one of the towns in my constituency a job, for which there was a grant given by the Government, has just been completed.  Men were recruited off the labour exchange list in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They were kept on for a certain time, but, as I have said, the job was completed recently.  Now, another new job has been started, and the position is that the same men have been recruited, the labour exchange starting again at the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to get away from what <Col N="1187" /> people describe as this demoralising dole system, I do suggest that the men who are on the lower grades of unemployment assistance, and who are anxious for work, should get the opportunity of demonstrating the fact that they are anxious for work.  I would ask the Minister to pay some attention to that aspect of the situation.  If the system continues to be carried out as it has been up to this, one can imagine all the people who are paid under a certain rate of benefit being told, at the end of a certain period, that they are not genuinely seeking employment and, in consequence of that decision by the Minister or his Department, these people will be removed from the pay roll of unemployment assistance. I would ask the Minister to pay special attention to that matter, because men are clamouring for work, notwithstanding the fact that a good number of people in this country say that all that the working classes want is to be paid doles.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, said that the Act under which unemployment assistance has been paid permits of allowances being supplemented from other sources.  I think the Minister knows quite well that that is not so.  He knows that the means test laid down in the Act is being very rigidly carried out, and that it is almost impossible for a man to get anything like the maximum amount of assistance laid down under the Act if he is getting anything at all from any other source.  Therefore, I think the Minister should certainly withdraw that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to convey was that any income a worker receives from earnings in one year was not calculated as means, and that the income of the worker over a year was supplemented by what he earned during the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Minister's conception of what the Act is supposed to do, but it is not the position that prevails in the country when men apply for benefit.  The means test is being very rigidly carried out, and things are taken into consideration which surprise not only the applicants <Col N="1188" /> for benefit but independent people as well.  To come back to the question of the cost of living, as I said earlier, statistics mean very little to the ordinary working man.  We know quite well that it is the food bill that is seriously affecting the cost of living at the present moment.  Deputy Norton and other Deputies referred to the increase that has taken place in the case of certain commodities.  The Minister stated that, in accordance with the statistics presented by his Department, 6d. per week would cover the amount of the increase in foodstuffs in the cost of living.  I think that the Minister, before making that statement, should have made an examination of the figures and tried to find out what the actual facts are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the increase which has taken place in the cost of living since 1933 was 4.4 per cent. and that that was, in respect of the majority of the rates of unemployment assistance, similar to an increase of less than 6d. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the same thing said in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because I did not maintain that the rates of assistance given were capable of providing all the food required by a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you said at the time of the introduction of the Act.  I pointed out to the Minister before that he thought at that time that this was the minimum that a man would require to maintain himself in some kind of comfort, and, in view of the fact that the cost of foodstuffs has increased considerably, I suggest to the Minister that he should make some adjustment in the rates to try and overtake that increase in the price of foodstuffs.  The price of coal, flour, butter, sugar, tea and bread has been increased and rents have gone up.  Take the question of rent.  One has nothing but praise to offer the Department of Local Government and <Col N="1189" /> Public Health for their housing schemes and the efforts they are making to solve the housing problem.  But that, again, creates another problem for the local authorities and the unemployed for whom we are speaking at the moment.  The majority of those unemployed people have, up to recently, been living in slum areas. When the local authority sets about making a clearance order it is invariably found that the majority of the people who have to be transferred from the slum areas to the new houses are unemployed people.  The average rents in slum areas all over the country can be taken to be about 2/- per week.  The rents of the new houses, to which those people are transferred, range from about 3/6 to 4/6 a week, and sometimes to 5/- a week.  That creates another problem for the local authority and also for the unemployed man, because it means an increase in rent of about 2/- a week at least.  I know quite well it is a creditable thing to get these people into new dwellings. They have good hygienic surroundings, but if they have not the wherewithal to meet their rent and other demands it creates a big problem for them and for the local authority.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have much more to say in this connection.  I ask the Minister to examine this rotation system of work which has been launched by the Board of Works.  I think it will be found that it is not going to work very satisfactorily.  Nobody objects to the unemployed being put to work at this standard rate of wages; the unemployed themselves do not object and neither does any member of this Party; but we believe that as the system is at present being operated it is going to do infinite harm. It will be very hard to get local authorities to embark on schemes under the present arrangements because it will be impossible to get a surveyor or an engineer to give a definite estimate.  I should like the Minister to have the matter examined and to endeavour to do something to secure that the people who are on a lower rate of benefit will get some chance of employment at a decent rate of wages.</P>

      <P>I understand the discussion on this motion to-day will be closed at one o'clock.  There is only time, therefore, for a few preliminary remarks prior to the discussion arising again next February. The Minister for Industry and Commerce defended his position on this motion, first of all, by saying that there were limits to the resources of the State, a lesson he has apparently learned in the last four years. Secondly, he stated that these rates were not intended to provide full maintenance, which is not quite in accordance with the promises made in the general election of 1933.  Thirdly, he goes on to say, after making a poor mouth about everything, that anyone who looks for any indication of prosperity in any country will find abundant evidences of it here.  He tells us at one time of all the indications of prosperity, but when it comes to these rates of benefit and to a question of wages he draws our attention to the limit of the resources of the country and he tells us that the country is in a bad way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could make quite a good case for the position in which he finds himself, but he dare not.  There is really a good case and it could be made.  For instance, the Minister could divide the population amongst those looking for work and depending on it for the wherewithal to live into four classes&mdash;the industrially-employed, the agriculturally-employed, the unemployed and the fugitives.  He has denied there are fugitives.  Deputy Morrissey gave him figures to the extent of 40,000 and the Minister said that he would not accept them; they were figures estimated by somebody and he could not accept them.  He should consult his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government, who submitted figures on the <Col N="1191" /> 11th November.  It would appear that 50,000 people have fled these shores in the three years ending May, 1936. I suppose we will be told that that is stopped.  So far as I can get information from people living in the country districts, the figure of 23,000 from the middle of 1935 to 1936 will be exceeded.  Not merely is that the fact, but this so-called prosperous country, with every indication that a man may wish for in regard to prosperity, is in such a position that 97,000 people have been driven off the land into the cities and the Minister has not given them employment in the cities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a certain view with regard to prosperity.  Let me give him some indication of the position as it is observed by people who are moving amongst the poor.  Here is a leaflet from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  What do they say?  They allude to the point that Deputy Corish made, that the matter might have been foreseen, the question of the removal of people from slum quarters into other quarters, with an entire neglect of this fact, that by reason of these people having to pay more in the way of rent they have less to spend on food.  This is what the leaflet sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provision of new houses in the suburbs for large families who are living on unemployment assistance or home assistance, provides a problem which might have been foreseen. These poor people formerly lived in a single room with just a few pieces of furniture at rents from 3/6 to 7/6 a week according to the accommodation provided.  Now they find themselves outside the city with comfortable houses, but practically no furniture, and an increased rent to pay out of the same income they received in the slum dwelling.  To this additional rent has to be added train or bus fares for the family when the children go to school or the parents have to go to the city.  This is a problem which is not confined to Dublin, but has caused anxiety elsewhere in Ireland and in Great Britain, owing to the reduction in <Col N="1192" /> the amount of food purchased so that the increased rent may be paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the aspects of the new problem that has been created.  Here is another:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are numerous families which in the past were enabled to maintain themselves in frugal comfort on small incomes, but which under present economic conditions find it impossible to live except on a level which amounts practically to starvation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That comes from people who are moving amongst the poorer sections of the community.  They say that people of that type who have slipped below the borderline of frugal comfort into the area of practical starvation have to be assisted very privately and tactfully. A third point emerges:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In years gone by it was comparatively easy to collect quantities of unwanted clothes for the poor; nowadays it is almost impossible to get anything approaching the amount required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks that this country has all the indications of prosperity that one could hope for.  The St. Vincent de Paul people have not seen them.  Everybody is aware that there is a problem from the point of view of the poor in regard to this matter of new houses.  &ldquo;Numerous families&rdquo; is the phrase that was used.  There were many families accustomed to live in frugal comfort and now they are in a position which amounts practically to starvation.</P>

      <P>Of course it does not.  I always felt that the plea of an economic depression based on world <Col N="1193" /> circumstances would be used.  Against that argument I will give a quotation from the Government organ on January 15th, 1932, where they talk about depression and say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No doubt, it will be officially ascribed to that convenient world depression which serves as the scapegoat for all the blunders and follies of Cumann na nGaedheal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They did not think much of it in the early part of the year 1932.  Does the Minister think a lot of world depression affecting this country now?  He does.  The Minister calls on me to say why there are any people unable to live in frugal comfort now. Has the Minister any idea of what has happened in this country in regard to our main industry?  Has he seen the figure given by his colleague in the agricultural wages debate?  Does he know that in 1929 the farmer and every member of his family employed on the land got £93 and the labourer got £66? Is he aware that in 1934 that figure had slumped to the point that the labourer was getting more than the farmer&mdash; that the farmer was getting £51 and the labourer £55?</P>

      <P>How do you know? I submit that 97,000 of these people have been driven off the land into the cities.  Are they some of the people that the representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are moving amongst?  In another year the farmer had got to the point that he was getting £65 off his land, a sum less than he used to pay his labourer.  The conditions Fianna Fáil have brought about in this country have driven 97,000 people from <Col N="1194" /> the rural areas to the towns, and have driven over 50,000 people in the last three years across to the country with which we are at war.  We are sending our hostages over to Great Britain. There may be many of the people who were living in frugal comfort and who now live in conditions amounting practically to starvation who, if they found the same outlet, might be glad to avail of it.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the words and figures &ldquo;February 3, 1937&rdquo; and to insert the words and figures &ldquo;December 2nd, 1936&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do so in order to ask the House to express the view that the Government should take the necessary steps leading to the recognition by us of the Government of General Franco in Spain. Recognising fully that the matter is delicate, we are taking this action now because, in the circumstances in which the Opposition finds itself placed by the continued silence of the Government, no other course is open to us.  We have waited for months, daily hoping to hear the President in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs take the House, or at least the leaders of the political Parties in the House, into his confidence.  From the abundance of facts which must officially be in his possession, we expected an explanation from him, if not publicity, then privately, on the position in Spain to-day so far as that position affects the fundamental principles upon which we here are all agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the President has adhered to his deliberate plan of keeping the leaders of political Parties in opposition to him in the Dáil completely in the dark with regard to the <Col N="1195" /> facts, or reports upon which decisions with regard to foreign policy are based.  This is an undesirable state of affairs, and it has been repeatedly urged from these benches that political leaders should receive such information, in absolute confidence if need be, so that as far as possible there may be agreement on vital matters of foreign policy.  Our representations have been ignored and so we must decide, on the information available to us, merely as members of the general public, what our course of action should be.</P>
    <P>We have avoided as long as possible taking parliamentary action in this matter.  We do so now with a full sense of our responsibility to the nation and even to what goes far beyond the boundaries of our own State. It is impossible to look on Europe to-day without being acutely conscious of the vital character of the struggle now being waged in Spain.  It is not the fate of either party in Spain, not even the fate of the whole gallant Spanish people and their centuries-old glorious civilisation which are at stake. It is something more important even than these.  It is the fate of European civilisation and of everything in it which endears it to us that is in the balance.</P>
    <P>For a number of years past, for almost 20 years, we have seen that civilisation gravely threatened by the existence and activity of a State and a Party which have pursued their aims with a determination, a ruthlessness and a singlemindedness that should have been a warning to all statesmen who still attach value to European traditions.  After a revolution which has no parallel in history, it has relentlessly attacked every pillar by which that European civilisation is supported. It is the outspoken, forceful, and never sleeping foe of Christianity, that Christianity which has supplied the most valuable element in our inheritance.  The Soviet State has been almost equally hostile to every other form of religion.  It has put atheism in the forefront of its programme. It has trampled underfoot every right of the individual and every right of conscience.  It has denied the <Col N="1196" /> most rudimentary economic constituents of our civilisation.  It has recognised no other standard of conduct, no other guide of its public activities, no other measure for its actions than their usefulness in promoting the victory of the Communist cause.  It has spurned, as the invention of an effect bourgeois philosophy, all the canons of morality in which we have been brought up, canons which should shape our every action.  In forcing its cause to victory over its own people it has shrunk from no terrorism and has been held back by no consideration of mercy.  But the party that has been responsible for the triumph of Communism in Russia has always regarded its doctrine as meant, not only for its own people, but as a gospel to be spread by every method, secret or open, which would seem likely to help it to victory, with the aim of finally bringing the whole world under its domination.</P>
    <P>There have been apparent advances and withdrawals, as external and internal circumstances dictated in the intensity with which the propaganda has been carried on.  Many a statesman in Europe has probably solaced himself in recent years with the assumption that the Soviet Union has, apparently, finally settled down, within its own borders, content to take its place in a normal fashion amid the other States of Europe.  Those statesmen and nations who have founded on that assumption a sense of security have paid no attention to the two-fold voice with which in recent years Moscow has been wont to speak.  The Russian Foreign Office tries to attune its voice to the accustomed language of the Chancellories of Europe, but the work of spreading the gospel has been ceaselessly prosecuted by the other voice, the Comintern, the Communist International, with its Headquarters in Moscow and under the domination of the party which controls the Russian Government.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago it was possible for people to be misled by that apparent change of policy on the part of the Russian Foreign Office, but the events of the last year and, especially recent happenings in Spain, should tear the bandage from the eyes of <Col N="1197" /> everybody who has any interest in the higher aspects of our present complex social organisation.  Whatever pretence there may have been in the beginning it must surely now be clear to everyone that the cause of the Caballero Government and the cause of the Communist International are identical.  Moscow, Barcelona and Madrid form a common front.  We have only to ask ourselves do we wish for victory for the cause for which these comrades stand.  Let there be no mistake about it, the victory of the Communist cause in Spain would probably be a deciding factor for the fate of Europe.  It is not a question which any person with a vision which extends beyond his own parish can regard as something in which he has no interest.  The war in Spain is a war for the victory or defeat of Communism and all it stands for, with its denial of Christian principles, individual liberty, and democracy.</P>
    <P>I do not see how a country with our history, our beliefs, our traditions and our ideals, moral, religious and political, can fail to withdraw recognition from a Government standing for everything we abhor and accord it to a Government that is fighting enemies that are the greatest we have to combat in Europe now or in the future.  I am not suggesting that we abandon the policy of non-intervention. I am bringing forward this amendment, not for the purpose of criticising the Government for having adopted that policy.  Of that policy we on this side of the House fully approve.  I believe that the intervention of outside Powers would, as far as our human intelligence can judge, almost certainly lead to a general conflagration, a conflagration that might bring upon us at once these disastrous consequences that would follow inevitably but at a slower pace on the victory of the Red Forces in Spain.  Considering the present position in international affairs, and considering any other machinery that might possibly be called in to preserve the peace, I can see no better method than the policy of non-intervention to prevent such a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Whole-heartedly desiring as I do the defeat of Communism and all it stands for in Spain and elsewhere, I <Col N="1198" /> do not believe that the policy of intervention could accomplish that defeat. Intervention might do irreparable damage in that respect, too.  But what I advocate connotes in no way the abandonment of the policy of non-intervention. The recognition of General Franco's Government does not, it is clear, run contrary to that policy of non-intervention to which the Government is rightly committed.  We, I am quite willing to admit, are but a small State.  Our material resources are comparatively slight.  We cannot sway the counsels of the European States, but against this I put certain considerations before the House.  I do not believe that our influence in world affairs can be measured at all adequately by our material strength. There is another consideration of perhaps even greater importance.  It would indeed be a pity, in this present struggle for and against Communism, in which all Europe seems determined to take sides, that it should seem to be left to those States that boast their non-democratic character to take the step of recognising as a Government that Party in Spain which is fighting our most deadly foe.  I believe that Communism is in the end not only destructive of our civilisation but is more injurious to democracies than to dictatorships.  It is fitting and necessary that a Christian and democratic State such as ours should give a clear and clean lead in this matter which involves a life and death struggle against the enemies of our common civilisation.</P>
    <P>I have confined myself to the essential issues in the case.  I have not dwelt on the sacrileges, the destruction, the atrocities, that have shaken our people to the very core, because I was anxious that the main issue at stake should be clearly put before the Dáil.  I believe that a step of such paramount importance as this should transcend all party issues, that our national honour and more than our national honour is involved.  It is of importance that the nation here should speak with one voice on this issue, and it does appear to me that the plain facts as they appear to all men indicate that whatever may have been the beginnings <Col N="1199" /> or the history of the struggle at present being waged in Spain, that struggle has now assumed a character of European and of world importance. It is not fitting that even by passive taking of sides we should as a nation interest ourselves in domestic quarrels between two sections of any people. The war in Spain, as I have said, has ceased to have that character.  Ranged behind the Madrid Government are all the forces whose aims we, as Christians and as Irishmen, abhor.  What I am asking the Government to do involves no military operations, no breach in the policy of non-intervention. It seems to me to involve merely the taking of a simple action which will bring this generation of Irishmen into line and into harmony with those who have gone before us and left to us a great tradition.</P>
    <P>I think, and I hope the House will agree with me, that the Government of General Franco in Spain should be recognised and that recognition should be withdrawn from the combination which opposes him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment that has been moved by the leader of the Opposition, I think he has made quite clear what we are asking the President to do. We are asking him to take such steps, and to assure the House that he will take such steps, as will lead to the recognition of what is called the Franco Government in Spain.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, there may have been a time when a number of well-meaning men may have been in doubt about what was at issue in Spain.  They may have felt that the Liberal Government might have been given a chance.  There were many more who believed that the best that could be said for that Government was that it partook of the character of the Kerensky Government in Russia in 1917.  But that is not what is now at stake.  What is now at stake is clearly and definitely the victory or defeat of the Communist International in Spain, the victory or the defeat of the Red cause in Spain, the victory or defeat of Communism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have several problems that <Col N="1200" /> divide us here in this country.  I have never tried to slur over the seriousness of the divisions that politically divide the various classes and Parties in this country, but here is, I think, a matter on which every class in this country, every political Party in this country, every creed in this country, should be in full agreement, once they realise what is taking place in Spain, once it is clear to them that it is not merely a question as to who in future will rule in Spain, but that it is a question of what cause is to be triumphant in Europe.  We cannot disguise from ourselves the tremendous change that has taken place in world outlook in the last 12 months.  I feel that it is only because people still are able to shut their eyes to what is taking place or what has taken place in these 12 months, that there can be any hesitation or any doubt about the importance and the real significance of what is taking place in Spain at the present moment, and about the importance of the outcome of the struggle there.  It is a thing that is not merely serious; it is urgent for the reasons indicated by the leader of the Opposition in introducing his amendment.</P>
    <P>It is useless for us to say that we are against Communism, that we will not allow it to take a full root in this country, that we will stop it here once it openly shows its head and indulges in anything that is illegal.  To adopt an attitude of that kind, to think that we can put an antiseptic iron wall about this country, is to live in a fool's paradise.  We can do nothing of the kind.  Even were we to look at the thing, as I strongly hold we ought not, from our own selfish point of view, our own selfish point of view would dictate that our sympathies and interests should lie with the defeat of the Communist Party in Spain in the war.  I make no distinction, and I do not think the House or anybody who wants to face the issues ought to make any distinction, between the victory of Communism in Spain and the victory of Moscow.  There may be controversy about matters of detail but there can be no doubt or no difference of opinion as to the common front that is being put up by the Communist Party in Spain and the Moscow Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> This civilisation of ours has had to submit to many revolutions, revolutions that some people think have been salutary and that others regret, but I think we can all agree that never in its history has our race witnessed such a revolution as Communism implies&mdash;a revolution not content with ordinary destruction but bent on tearing up humanity and all the traditions handed down for centuries, tearing them up from their roots.  Do not think that it was ever meant to be confined to the States or the countries or the people that comprise the Soviet Union.  It never was.  Never have we witnessed such a determined attempt as is being made to-day under our very eyes. Anybody who looks at the international situation at the present time must be appalled&mdash;I do not think appalled is too strong a word&mdash;at all the dangers that confront us.  But is there any danger as serious or any danger as permanent as that represented by the declared victory of Communism over what they themselves boast to be one-sixth of the surface of the globe already, and its spread through western Europe, to one of the oldest countries in the civilisation of Europe, a country famous for its crusading on behalf of our civilisation and our Christianity?</P>
    <P>Have you asked yourselves what the spread of Communism there and the victory of Communism there would mean not merely for that country but for the whole of Western Europe? That is the issue which we have to face.  When we speak of that danger I think one of its great elements is that public men, statesmen in many countries of Europe, will not realise the danger.  It is exceedingly difficult, and it has always been exceedingly difficult, for a generation standing on the very threshold of a world revolution to realise that they are doing so. Surely it is up to the people who see that clearly, and who clearly see the danger, to put it before the people.  I am often amazed at the apparent indifference shown by public men throughout Europe to the advance of that particular cause.  I could only understand it on one of two assumptions, or perhaps both.  One reason is, they do not know what that <Col N="1202" /> Communist cause stands for, and that is quite possible.  They do not know it except in a vague and general way.  There are many people who think that it is a kind of altruistic, humanistic, harmless, idealistic philosophy.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is something much more terrible and real than that.  But I am afraid there are many statesmen and many public men in Europe who still regard it in that particular light.  The other reason why they are so complaisant is this, that they will not face the danger of its coming to their own shores or beyond their own frontiers. They are playing with fire, and they do not know they are playing with fire.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate; I do not want to indulge in any criticism within this country at the present moment.  I can understand that there may be honest differences of opinion as to the best way of combating the menace, but I cannot understand why the seriousness of the menace should not be seen, and why the danger should not be kept continually before us.  We are face to face with a doctrine, with a cause, with which there can be no possible compromise.  We could only accept it by rejecting, by spurning, everything we have been taught to hold dear, and everything we have held and do hold dear.  I admit that even with the triumph of that cause the human race will survive.  It will!  But if that cause triumphs it will be a very different civilisation and a very different human race, deprived of all the important values that we cherish. When we ask ourselves what are the alternatives, and when we answer that question for ourselves, I put it to the President ought the Government to have any hesitation in putting the necessary machinery in motion that will lead to the recognition by his Government of the opponents of Communism in Spain?</P>
    <P>It is not a question as to whether the form of government that that Party will set up is the precise form of government which we should set up if we had the settling of matters there.  That is not the question.  I have particularly avoided that question because I do not think it is the issue.  What we <Col N="1203" /> want first and foremost is the defeat of Moscow and the defeat of the Communist cause in Spain.  I see no other possibility of that being achieved except by the victory of the present opponents of Communism in Spain. Ask yourselves is there any other alternative to the recognition of the one side or the other?  We might prefer a parliamentary system of government. We do.  As the House knows, I am strongly attached to that particular form of government.  I do not believe it is effete; I do not believe it is worn out; but that is not the situation we are asked to face.  The only alternative in Spain is victory for the Reds or for General Franco. There is no other possible alternative. In those circumstances, seeing that it does not involve&mdash;and it is made clear by the statement of the big countries in Europe that it does not so involve&mdash; any breach of the policy of non-intervention to which the Government is committed&mdash;is there any reason why the Government should hesitate to go on the road towards the recognition of General Franco?</P>
    <P>It has often seemed strange to me that, just as I was convinced that the Communist menace was growing more and more, a large number of public men throughout Europe were lulling themselves into the security of the opposite opinion.  I admit that spectacular action in interference in the internal affairs of outside States is no longer the official policy of the Soviet Government.  I will admit that, but I claim at the same time that from the point of view of the triumph of Communism, not merely in Russia but in other countries in Europe, the situation is much more serious to-day than when that aggressive intervention, the fomenting of revolts, and ceaseless propaganda carried on in most countries in Europe were the order of the day.  The situation is more serious to-day than when all that thing was patronised and carried out by the official Soviet Government.  It is much more serious for the very reason that the Soviet Government is an established Government, and, as far as people can see, is destined to exist for a number of years at all <Col N="1204" /> events.  People can point to it and say &ldquo;Well, it works.  You told us it would not work, and still it is working. It has done great things.  It has done colossal things.&rdquo;  That is a much more attractive thing to many people in Europe&mdash;accustomed to pay snobbish tribute to success without considering what the success serves&mdash;than the intribute to success without considering what the success serves&mdash;than the intervention of outsiders in their internal affairs.  From that point of view, the propagandist value of Russia has increased tremendously, but, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, that is only one side of the picture.</P>
    <P>I have studied this matter for a number of years.  In my readings I did not confine myself by any means to unfavourable critics.  I have read the favourable and unfavourable critics of the Soviet Government, and I have read any speeches of the heads of the Soviet Government that I could get, provided they were written in a language I could read.  One thing is clear: whether it is in Asia, Europe or Africa, the steady work of propaganda and fomenting of revolt has been carried on all those years&mdash;there has been not a moment's cessation. The Soviet Government, which a few years ago was pointing out the degrading character of that bourgeois assembly&mdash;this is what it called the League of Nations&mdash;can go to Geneva and can speak the language of that assembly quite as well as any of the older statesmen in Europe.  All the time the Communist International, with its seat at Moscow, is engaged in ceaseless work of propaganda.  That work of propaganda will differ in character with the diverging character of the different peoples for whom it is intended.  That propaganda is ceaseless, sometimes open and unashamed, sometimes secret.  But, you may say, the Soviet Government is not responsible for that.  That is the Communist International! The Soviet Government and the Communist International are both under the domination of the same force.  They are both voices of the same controlling force in Russia, namely, the Communist Party of Russia.  In Russia, itself, the Government is merely the instrument of that particular party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> In connection with that, it is quite a revealing fact that for a number of years&mdash;I cannot speak as to what the position is at the moment&mdash;the real ruler of Russia had no official position in the Government.  He was merely general secretary of the Communist Party.  The Communist Party controls both the Government of Russia&mdash; which so often now makes such play of correct diplomatic action&mdash;and the Communist International, which acts far from &ldquo;correctly,&rdquo; in the old hemisphere. I cannot speak of the new hemisphere.  Unfortunately, therefore, the assumptions that some statesmen make about the situation being now much easier than it was ten years ago, rests on no solid foundation.  The situation now is much more serious and much more dangerous from the point of view of the opponents of Communism than it ever was.  Watch how cleverly the propaganda is done. Deputy Cosgrave alluded to that in the course of his speech.</P>
    <P>I have tried to put before you what are the real issues in Spain.  I should be surprised if there is any division of opinion on that particular point, but you need only read a number of papers&mdash;English papers shall we say? &mdash;you need only listen to the wireless, to see how cleverly it is being insinuated that the struggle in Spain is a struggle between Fascism and democracy. Read&mdash;listen to&mdash;the pronouncements of the official Labour Party in England on that point.  Take their whole attitude to this struggle, and you will see the cleverness and you will see the success with which that propaganda is being got across, the success with which the real issue is being clouded over.  Remember that that same Labour Party has rejected Communism, and yet, so cleverly has the propaganda been conducted, that. for them, in Spain, the struggle is between democracy and Fascism.  It is nothing of the kind.  For us, the struggle is between Communism and the foes of Communism.  It was a remarkably clever thing in the way of propaganda to pretend that this is a struggle for the life of democracy and to pretend that democracy is, at the present moment. represented in Spain by the Government of Señor Caballero. <Col N="1206" /> It has deceived many&mdash;some quite genuinely; others, perhaps, had no objection to being deceived.  That being so, however, is not that, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, all the more reason why we should take this step?  Many things may be said about us.  Many things can be said in our praise, and many things can be said in criticism of us; but, at least, the Government of this State can claim to be a Government based on the goodwill of the majority of the elected representatives of the people here.  I know of no country to-day that is more democratic, from the Parliamentary point of view, than is our State with our Constitution here at the present moment.  There are no exclusions for people over the age of 21.  And the Government holds office at the will of the majority of the representatives elected on a basis of universal suffrage. Certainly, we can boast that there is no more democratic country in the world than ourselves at the present moment.  It is all the more important, therefore, to take a step of this kind. It is, at least, an indication, so far as attention will be given to it, that there is a democratic country that believes in the necessity of defeating Communism; that the forces arrayed in Spain&mdash;that the sympathies of the peoples arrayed against the Caballero Government outside Spain&mdash;are not confined to those who repudiate what they call democratic government, at least of the Parliamentary type.</P>
    <P>That is one of the important reasons why I should like this step to be taken by this Government.  I do not know what the wars in the future may be. They may be something analogous to the old wars of religion.  They may be wars of rival philosophies.  I cannot go into that; but, at least, let us be clear that the cause of anti-Communism is not the cause of anti-democracy.  I believe that, in bringing forward this motion, the Leader of the Opposition is expressing the will of the bulk of the Irish people.  I believe that the emotion by which they have been stirred is a genuine emotion on their part.  I believe that it was a natural emotion on their part.</P>
    <P>If we had any doubt about the danger, nationally or internationally, <Col N="1207" /> coming from Moscow, the Spanish crisis, and the Spanish situation, ought to have banished all such doubts. What is at stake, as I said already, is our civilisation&mdash;every factor in that civilisation that makes it dear to us and that makes it valuable to us. Deputy Cosgrave referred to it as the Christian European civilisation, and he did so because he recognised that the Christian religion was the principal component part of that civilisation. Now, let there be no doubt as to what the triumph of Communism stands for. It stands, not merely for the destruction of Catholicism, not merely for the destruction of Christianity, but for the destruction of every kind of religion whatsoever&mdash;and that is no chance development on their part.  That is a fundamental article of their creed.</P>
    <P>May I point out to you&mdash;may I read for you&mdash;an extract from the address of the founder of that State: the founder of practical Communism&mdash;delivered, quite appropriately, to the Congress of the Young Communist League.  I refer to an address by Lenin in Moscow in October of 1920; and you can see by your papers to-day that this policy is still being carried on.  I bring forward this quotation for another reason, and that is, because, with a morality of the kind put forward here before our eyes, we shall be in a better position to understand a great deal of what is happening in Spain; because this quotation justifies the statement of Deputy Cosgrave that, so far as that cause is concerned, the ordinary rules of morality&mdash;the rules that we have been accustomed to and the rules that we observe&mdash;simply do not hold.  This is not a momentary statement made in the heat of the moment by Lenin&mdash;he did very little in the heat of the moment. I can give you quotation after quotation of the same tenour from his followers.  Therefore, with people who hold a view of morality such as this which I am about to quote, need we be surprised at any plotting or planning, or at anything that they do in Spain or elsewhere?  I am afraid the quotation is rather long, but this is what Lenin says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is there any such thing as Communist <Col N="1208" /> morality?  Of course there is. .... In what sense do we deny ethics and morals?  In the sense in which they are preached by the bourgeoisie&mdash;a sense that deduces these morals from God's commandments. Of course, we do not believe in God.  We know perfectly well that the clergy, the landlords, and the bourgeoisie all claim to speak in the name of God in order to protect their own interests as exploiters .... We deny all morality taken from super-human, or non-class conceptions. We say that this is a deception, a swindle, a befogging of the minds of the workers and peasants in the interests of the landlords and the capitalists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, here is what I want to come to particularly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We say that our morality is wholly subordinated to the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat. We deduce our morality from the facts and the nature of the proletariat&mdash;but morality taken from outside of human society does not exist for us.  It is a fraud.  For us morality is subordinated to the interests of the proletarian class-struggle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the issue I put to the House. That is the issue in Spain at the present moment.  Therefore I should like an expression of opinion from the President on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, as between the Government of General Franco and the Government of Senor Largo Caballero I suppose there is hardly anybody in this House, and very few in this country, who do not sympathise rather with the Government of General Franco.  Whether the Spanish revolution was necessary is another question. I take the view that the Government in Spain having ceased to govern, having ceased to protect its citizens against the operations of thugs, the people who felt disposed to throw off their allegiance to it were morally justified in doing so.  But whether, taking the wide view, it would not have been wiser for them and better in the long run for all concerned if they had decided on intensifying <Col N="1209" /> political activity and developing their party organisation for the overthrow of their enemies by parliamentary methods, is another question. Seeing the appalling things that have occurred in Spain since the outbreak of the revolution, one certainly feels inclined to wonder whether those who threw off their allegiance to the Government by methods of violence would not, however righteous their cause, have been wiser and more patriotic if they had adopted other methods.  But that is a side issue. We do all of us want to see the Franco Government in preference to the Caballero Government.</P>
      <P>But this motion is in effect a vote of censure on our own Government for their attitude towards the Spanish conflict and for their alleged indifference to the general menace of Communism. Frankly, I cannot see any ground for that censure and I do not think that the speeches of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Sullivan have given us any ground for that censure. I should have thought that if they considered that the Government should before now have recognised General Franco, it was incumbent on them to indicate what they believe to be the test of the right moment to recognise a revolutionary government.  Surely the test is not merely our sympathies. Suppose a revolution broke out in Germany or in France in which some of the rights of the Catholic church were involved, a revolution which for some reason or other attracted the sympathy of people in this country. Just at what moment would it be proper to recognise the revolutionary government instead of the previous Government?  That is a difficult problem, and it is a problem with which neither Deputy Cosgrave nor Deputy O'Sullivan has attempted to deal. Perhaps Deputy McGilligan or somebody else may do so later in the debate.</P>
      <P>I take it that the test accepted by the world in general is whether or not the new Government has obtained <i>de facto</i> control of the country of which it claims to be the legitimate Government. There are a great many nations in the world which are concerned in this matter besides ours.  So far the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> Government who recognise General Franco have been those of the Fascist line-up&mdash;Fascist countries and countries controlled by them, such as Albania.  But the world in general has adopted the course for which President de Valera is being censured by the Opposition.  It is suggested, for example, that we should recognise the Government of General Franco without any consultation with the other Governments of the British Commonwealth? Have we faced the difficulties of the constitutional position that would be created if the King and his Ministers in this country were to recognise one Government in Spain and the King and his Ministers in other parts of the Commonwealth were to recognise another Government in Spain?  Is it suggested that we should pay no heed at all, apart from the British Commonwealth, to the attitude of countries such as the United States of America, or the Scandinavian countries, or Belgium, a country as Catholic as we are?  I think we have a right to expect a great deal more light to be thrown by the Opposition upon their principles of action in this matter before we can agree to censure the Government for the line they have, so far, taken and are taking.  I believe that the ultimate victory of General Franco is pretty certain, and I believe that our Government will be amongst those most ready to recognise his Government when the right moment comes. Frankly, I have not enough experience of these matters to lay down a hard and fast rule as to when that moment will come, but I suggest it is better for us to act in concert with the general body of countries other than Fascist countries.  I am not eager to see this country linking itself up with Fascist countries, while other countries, which are not in the least Communist, are standing aloof.</P>
    <P>It is folly to talk as if the mere action of this Government in recognising General Franco was going to make a fundamental difference in the whole situation.  Recognising General Franco to-morrow would contribute little or nothing towards the prospect of General Franco's victory.  Therefore, what we have to be guided by is what <Col N="1211" /> is correct&mdash;and what is the normal diplomatic practice.  I would much rather, in forming our conclusions about that, that we should act in concert with the other Governments of good-will which are neither Communist nor Fascist.</P>
    <P>As regards the Communist peril in general, we all sympathise with the denunciations we have heard of the Communist International, and of the horrors which have taken place in Spain, but what are the practical suggestions of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Sullivan with regard to Communism?  They say that the Government has shown undue indifference to the subject.  Just what do they want the Government to do?  There was a speech made a few days ago by the very amiable and very able Director of Organisation of the Fine Gael Party on this subject, and I imagine, as it was obviously carefully prepared, that it would not have been made unless it had behind it the full authority of the leader of the Opposition. In it Mr. Burke said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In May of the present year in Wexford Dr. Ryan expressed the Government view in the following words: `If people said that in their opinion the best form of government for this country was the form of government in Russia, they were bound to protect them and allow them to put their views before the people.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>A little lower down, after elaborating the subject, Mr. Burke said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The attitude of Fine Gael had always been, and would always be, directly opposite to that of Fianna Fáil in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again a little lower down, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No Government can afford to ignore the wishes of the people in a matter so close to their hearts.  At the moment a great non-political movement had arisen in the country which would, no doubt, in due course force the Government's hand and secure that adequate steps are taken to check the moral and national menace which has been growing in our midst.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have said before that if there are organisations, Communistic or otherwise, <Col N="1212" /> in this country which are advocating the use of force for the overthrow of the Government, it is right they should be prosecuted and suppressed. But the quotation I have just read to the House goes far beyond that and plainly suggests that people who hold Communist opinions, who are in favour of the form of government that exists in Russia&mdash;which, by the by, is a form of government that could only inaccurately be described as Communist, because Communism in Russia has been a failure, and every day they seem to be dropping further and further away from Communism&mdash; should be prohibited by law from expressing their views.  I can only say that I totally and absolutely disagree with that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is the way to fight Communism.  That is not the way in which Communism is being successfully fought in Great Britain, America and elsewhere.  If you look at countries where Communism has been conspicuously successful, like Russia, Mexico or Spain, you will find that these are countries which were not noted for their liberalism.  You will not find that even before the advent of Communism they were remarkable for the liberty of speech that was encouraged in their midst. The very way, to my mind, to increase the risk of popularising Communism is to turn your back upon the principles of democracy and to try to suppress free speech.  I hope very much that these ideas do not represent the last word or the last thoughts of the Opposition Party on this subject.</P>
    <P>We all want to see this country secure against the propaganda of the Communist International, and the way to achieve that is by conducting our Government and our national life in accordance with Christian ideas; spread principles of class harmony instead of class hatred throughout the country; to see that people really care about their fellow-men and suffer with their sufferings and are interested in alleviating their misfortunes.  The fear I have is that a sort of hysteria is being created in Ireland owing to all this excitement about Communism that may result in doing just the kind of thing that may increase Communism <Col N="1213" /> rather than dispel it.  For my part, I believe that President de Valera and his Government are perfectly willing and even eager to recognise General Franco's administration when the proper moment comes, and there has been nothing in the speeches delivered from the Opposition Front Benches which suggest to me that they have clearer ideas on this subject than the Government has, or have more sense of responsibility on this subject than the Government has.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not always think alike, but I think Deputy MacDermot has replied sufficiently to the speech made from the opposite benches to warrant, if I care to use it, my allowing the amendment and all go to the House without any word from me.  I think any reasonable person who has listened to him, or who will read what he has said, will agree that the point of view which he has expressed is the right and proper point of view.  There are things about this particular amendment which tend to excite suspicion.  There has been a long campaign in the Press all directed to try to make it appear that somehow the Government in this matter of Spain was lacking in public duty or was not representing the views of the majority of the people in this country. There has been, from the opposite benches, a continued effort since 1931 to try to mend the fortunes of their Party, and to build up a case for Fascist organisations on the ground that this Government was sympathetic to Communism.  Everybody knows that that is fundamentally untrue and false.  I do not think there is anybody in the country who looks at the Government's action dispassionately who will not be satisfied that the Government have no more use for Communist philosophy than has any member of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is how are we best to defend our philosophy and the philosophy of the vast majority of the Irish people in our attitude towards life, and prevent organisations with a completely and fundamentally different policy from making inroads here?  I hold with Deputy MacDermot that the attitude of the Government in this matter has been fully justified.  I am convinced, as convinced as I am of anything, that had the present Opposition, with their outlook, continued in office after 1931 we would have had a <Col N="1218" /> very different position in this country to-day from the position which we have.  I believe that their whole attitude was one of reliance upon force, that reliance upon force, on the one side, was bound to beget reliance upon force on the other; and that we would have rapidly developed here into a position similar to the position that we have had on the Continent before either Fascism or Communism triumphed.  I, for one, did not want to see that position brought about here. I think that anybody who is working in that direction is wilfully moving in a line which is opposed to all the true interests of this country.  We came into office just after there had been a campaign to pretend to the people of Ireland that Communism was making rapid headway here.  We had people in responsible positions going around telling authorities in the Church of the Communist cells that were being established.  They said they derived their knowledge from secret information which they had received. We came into office and saw these reports.  Deputies who care to take the trouble will, I think, find in the journals of the House that I read from these reports, and showed the very opposite to what was being pretended publicly and privately.</P>
    <P>During the time we have been in office, we have seen a gradual waning of the little strength that Communism had in this country until it has practically disappeared.  If the contrary policy had been pursued, I believe you would have thrown on the side of these relatively insignificant groups a strength that did not fundamentally sympathise with them&mdash;the strength of labour and other groups who feared that this was only an attempt to found here a Fascist State in which their just freedom would be denied.  The policy of hitting on the head everybody who is opposed to you is a convenient policy for those who are strong enough to do so.  There is no doubt that it will silence opposition for a certain time but, in the long run, you are not going to kill any ideas, good or bad, in that way.  You are going to give strength to false ideas by preventing these false ideas from being examined home.</P>

      <P>The examining home of these ideas in our country is, I think, the best possible safeguard against any inroads by Communism. Therefore, so far as the Government's attitude on this matter is concerned, we have nothing to regret, nothing to retract and we do not purpose changing it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the immediate question of the recognition of General Franco's Government, I was hoping that, before the debate would conclude, I would get a copy of what Deputy Cosgrave said in the introductory portion of his speech, which I happened to miss, so that I could see its purport. As his speech proceeded, I seemed to gather that the Government was being accused of not being willing to cooperate with other parties in the House on matters of foreign policy.  The trouble is&mdash;it is obvious to everybody&mdash; that co-operation is almost impossible. It ought not to be so but, if you are to have co-operation, you must have a frank and free interchange of information. My experience up to the present has been that when even small matters went to the opposite side of the House, they were in the Press almost as soon as I was told that contact had been established.  It is quite clear that you cannot have co-operation in these circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be of great benefit to the country, as a whole, if matters of foreign policy were dealt with here as they are dealt with in other countries and if it were possible for the Government and for the Opposition in matters that affect the interests of the country externally to reach some sort of understanding by which the interests of the country as a whole would be put above any Party interests.  I am afraid we have not yet reached that position.  No effort, so far as I am aware, has been made by any member of the Opposition, the leader included, to find out from us, confidentially or otherwise, our attitude in this matter.  I am aware that Deputy MacDermot at one stage had intended to ask questions about the matter but I take it he deemed that the time for asking these questions had not yet arrived and, therefore, did not pursue the matter. Beyond that, I have got no indication from any member of the Opposition of a desire to find out what were the principles we were likely to act upon in this matter.  The principles are clear.  They are well-established principles&mdash;the principles on which any prudent Government or any prudent State would act in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, if you recognise a new Government, you should recognise it when there is some clear indication of stability&mdash;some clear indication that the Government will, in fact, continue to be able to speak on behalf of the nation of which it is the Government. I do not think that that moment can be said to have arrived in the case of Spain.  The question of our sympathies does not enter into this matter; it is a question of what is the usual practice, what is our right in the matter and what is our duty.  I hold that we would not be justified at this <Col N="1221" /> moment, on the basis of ordinary prudence, in according the recognition we are asked to accord by the 2nd December or some such date.  Everybody knows that if, as is predicted on the opposite benches, General Franco does become the head of a <i>de facto</i> Government in Spain, he must immediately receive <i>de facto</i> recognition from those who have interests in Spain and who have, therefore, in regard to these interests, to deal with some authority in Spain.</P>
    <P>These grounds of prudence on which it is customary to act do not need to be explained.  I think they are self-evident to everybody.  It would be ridiculous, obviously, to give recognition to a Government that was unable ultimately to maintain itself.  It certainly would not lead&mdash;I am talking in general&mdash;to cordial relations between the Government of one country and another if the relations had to be with the restored Government.  I do not say that that consideration applies altogether here, but it is the general basis on which, as a prudent rule, recognition is not given before there is a fair hope of stability.  But we are told that the interests are of such importance that we ought, in order to help General Franco, give this recognition. I do not think there has been any attempt at all to show that it would, in fact, help General Franco that this recognition should be accorded.  We are told that the cause of Christianity demands it.  It is extraordinary if that is so, when the head of Christianity in the Vatican State has not himself deemed it prudent or right so to accord, and the difficulties there are not of a political character clearly, because if there were any considerations of that sort the present position, as far as Italy is concerned, would not stand in the way.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Holy Father in not having given recognition already must believe that it was not in the best interests of Christianity that that recognition should be given.  We are freer, perhaps, and can take more lightly the consequences of our acts. I do not know that recognition on our part would involve any grievous consequences <Col N="1222" /> to us as a people, but if we take it on the high grounds of protection and help for Christianity, then I think, at least, that we ought to hesitate when the head of Christianity has not deemed it wise or prudent to give the recognition that we are asked to give.</P>
    <P>As Deputy MacDermot has said, the Opposition have made no case for this amendment which is, as he pointed out, in fact intended to be a vote of censure on the Government.  Our line has been in accord with the general line taken by States in circumstances like these.  Germany and Italy have accorded recognition, but they have accorded recognition for very clear and immediate political motives.  There is no doubt whatever about it.  I think that most people will admit that these are in the interests of a certain form of Government, and a certain form of State, rather than one such as has been referred to by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Sullivan.  We do not believe in their theory of the State any more than we believe in the Communist theory of the State.</P>
    <P>There is, I am glad to see from the opposite benches, agreement now, though there was a time in which one might very well begin to doubt it, that our people believe in a democratic form of government, and that a democratic form of government is, in fact, at least for us in our circumstances, a better form of government than any of the others.  We are gradually getting to agree upon certain fundamentals, and I think it is generally to the advantage of the country that that should be so.  On this matter of sympathy, in so far as that is concerned &mdash;I think there is very little difference, in the main, between the sympathies of people on the Government Benches and those in the Opposition as far as their views about Communism are concerned. The Government then propose to act in this matter with the prudence with which it is right that States should act.  If I felt as strongly as the members on the Opposition Bench pretend to feel, that recognition by us would mean what they suggest it would mean, then I feel we could not <Col N="1223" /> stop at mere recognition.  I feel that we would inevitably be involved, if we were serious about it, very much farther.  We could not simply take the easy way of a mere gesture.  If all these things are involved we should be prepared to do very much more and go very much farther, and, if we are not prepared to do these things, I take it it is on some grounds of prudence, and I am wondering whether the grounds of prudence which would justify us going farther than is suggested would not also suggest that we should not go even that far at the present moment.  That is the view, at any rate, that we take here.  The general principle is based on this: that peoples and States ought to be allowed to get that form of government which they themselves are prepared to accept. Unless we are prepared to go very much farther, we cannot, I think, in wisdom give any recognition until it is quite clear that we have a position in Spain that is likely to last.</P>
    <P>We have taken up the position of non-intervention.  I am glad to see that the Opposition have agreed that that policy was a wise one.  The trouble to-day, unfortunately, is that there is a tendency on both sides to make Spain a general battle ground, to have the people who sympathise with the one side or the other put all their forces there.  That can have only one effect&mdash; a general European conflagration, and I do not believe that such a conflagration would help either the people of Spain or the causes that we would like to see triumph.  I think the people of this country regret that Spain is in the condition in which it finds itself.  The true wish of all our people would be to see that struggle end as quickly as possible, and end on conditions which would enable the majority of the people of Spain to live and progress in the way <Col N="1224" /> in which they desire.  It has been many a time said here that Spain is a great old Catholic nation.  There is hardly a doubt that the vast majority of the people in Spain believe in Christian truths, and want these Christian truths, and the philosophy that they naturally entail, to triumph.</P>
    <P>Precipitate action on the part of this Government in recognising General Franco would not, in my opinion, lead to the best interests of Spain, nor would it achieve the results which the Opposition evidently think they would achieve if we adopted their views.  I, therefore, think that the policy of the Government is in accordance with the usual practice, that it is the right and prudent policy, best in the interests of this country, best in the interest of Spain and best in the general interests of world peace.</P>
