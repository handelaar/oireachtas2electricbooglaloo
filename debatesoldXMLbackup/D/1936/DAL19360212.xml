      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the combined outstanding indebtedness in each county in respect of loans raised by or on behalf of county councils for all purposes including board of health and vocational education at the 31st March, 1934, and the 31st March, 1935.</P>

      <P>As regards the period at the 31st March, 1934, the Deputy is referred to the returns of local taxation for the financial year which ended at that date.  Similar returns for the year ended 31st March, 1935, are nearing completion and will be published as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received a request from the Donegal Board of Health for increased financial assistance under the free milk supply scheme, and whether in view of the distress prevailing in the western areas of the county he will give the request his favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>A resolution of the board requesting an increased grant was received on the 3rd instant.  The board have been informed (11th instant) that no further grant can be made available in the current financial year.  The amount allocated to the board from the National Free Milk <Col N="438" /> Supply Grant was based on their expenditure on the supply of milk during the last financial year, and it was the duty of the board to administer the grant in the most advantageous manner.  It is evident, however, from a survey of the monthly expenditure that the board did not carry out the instructions of the Department to conserve the greater portion of the grant for the winter period when claims for milk are more urgent and numerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider increasing the grant in the coming financial year in view of the fact that the Donegal local authority represents to him that the need for free milk is pressing and greater than the existing grant will permit them to fill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant is based on the expenditure on free milk in the preceding year.  No increase can be made for the current year and, presumably, next year's grant will be allocated on the same basis and, unless the Minister for Finance makes a larger amount available for distribution, I cannot hold out hope that there will be any considerable increase in the amount that will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider making representations to the Department of Finance that money provided for the purpose of supplying free milk has a dual advantage, inasmuch as it provides an eminently desirable social service and, at the same time, provides one of the few effective alternative markets for agricultural produce in this country? With those facts in mind, will he urge the Minister for Finance to provide additional money in the coming year so that this need will not go unprovided for in 1936-37?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that last year a sum of £4,762 was allocated to the Donegal Board and they expended only £2,299. If they had availed of the full amount placed at their disposal last year, they would have got a correspondingly increased grant this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that any failure on their part to avail of the grant in the way suggested was almost certainly due to inexperience or to a misapprehension on their part?  If they are given the opportunity of availing of a grant as big as the original grant hereafter I have no doubt they will avail of it to the full.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has yet received the recommendations of the Hospitals Commission regarding the hospital requirements of West Cork and, if so, if he is in a position to state the amounts to be allocated to the different hospitals in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the second part of the question, it is not possible to say what amounts will be allocated to the different hospitals until the Minister has decided what works will proceed and until the cost of the works is ascertained.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is local interest in the question referred to by the Deputy.  Approval has not been given to any particular site, but the matter is at present under consideration by the Commissioner acting as the Tipperary (S.R.) Board of Health and Public Assistance.  It is not possible, therefore, to reply at present to the other parts of the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he received from the Arklow Urban District Council copy of a resolution directing attention to the hardship inflicted on fishermen who are deprived of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and the Unemployment Assistance Acts whenever they go out fishing, irrespective of the result of their enterprise, and whether he is prepared to regard as evidence that they are seeking work only the fact that they go out fishing, unless it can be shown that there is a catch from which they derive an income equal to the amount of the benefit to which they would be entitled if unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. <Col N="442" /> The resolution of the Arklow Urban District Council is at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Unemployment Insurance or Assistance Acts to prohibit an insurance officer or unemployment assistance officer from taking into consideration as evidence that an applicant is genuinely seeking work, the fact that he engages in fishing, but in determining whether such an applicant is entitled to unemployment insurance or assistance during the period while he is so engaged, the unemployment assistance officer must have regard to the other provisions of the Acts.  Any applicant who is aggrieved by the determination of an unemployment assistance officer has the right of appealing to the court of referees and, in certain circumstances, to the umpire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of merchandise licences granted under the Road Transport Act, 1933, was 1,383, and the number refused 216. 380 transfers of merchandise (existing carrier) licences were granted and two refused.  A statement showing the distribution of these figures by counties of domicile of the applicants or licensees will be circulated with the Official Report, but the area of operation of the licensees extends in practically all cases to more than one county.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 10 and 11 together. Cornflour is regarded as falling within the scope of the Customs duty chargeable at the rate of 3/- per cwt. on imported starch under the Finance Act, 1935, Section 11 and Second Schedule, reference No. 5.  The relative charging section makes no provision for importation without payment of duty of articles intended for manufacturing purposes, and, in view of the fact that this is a revenue producing duty, it has been deemed inexpedient to take advantage of the provisions of Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1932, for the purpose of allowing importation free of duty of goods liable to duty as starch except in cases where such goods are required for the manufacture of articles intended for export. No separate statistics are available in respect of imports of cornflour.  Goods of this description are required to be entered under the heading of &ldquo;Maize Products, other sorts,&rdquo; the imports of which during the nine months ended the 31st December, 1935, amounted to 19,733 cwts., value £13,188.  These <Col N="445" /> figures include 2,707 cwts. of maize products (including cornflour) on which Customs duty amounting to £406 was charged as &ldquo;starch &rdquo; under the Finance Act, 1935, Section 11 and Second Schedule, reference No. 5.</P>

      <P>Would I be doing the Minister an injustice if I said that when he was proposing that tax to the House he never dreamt that &ldquo;starch&rdquo; covered cornflour, and, further, that no Deputy in this House ever thought that the term &ldquo;starch&rdquo; covered cornflour, believing as they did that the Minister was asking for a duty on a product manufactured in this country used for stiffening collars and not for feeding men?</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that he did not consider that £450 was a very considerable imposition on manufacturers.  My information is that in the case of one firm alone the amount payable during the year was greater than that sum.  Will the Minister say whether £450 is the duty paid on imported cornflour during the period of nine months ending 31st December, 1935?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount which has been charged upon cornflour for the period is £406, not £450.  I cannot accept responsibility for what has been said to the Deputy, but he should verify these statements before he puts down a question.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statements, I want to ask if he will have the decision of the Revenue Commissioners declaring that cornflour is &ldquo;starch&rdquo; for the purposes of the Finance Act, reviewed because in my opinion the Revenue Commissioners have misdirected themselves.  Cornflour cannot properly be described as starch within the meaning of the Finance Act which imposed this duty on starch&mdash;will the Minister have their definition of that reviewed with a view to their satisfying themselves whether they have exceeded their jurisdiction in the collection of this tariff on edible cornflour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that in the Departments named in the question, or in other Departments, the practice referred to by the Deputy is followed.  If the inquiry concerns letters of acknowledgment, I may state that for a number of years past the practice laid down for the Civil Service generally requires that acknowledgments of letters received in Government Departments from persons resident in the Saorstát should be issued in common form printed in Irish only, and there is no reason to think that this arrangement has created any material inconvenience to correspondents. As to the individual replies to be sent to communications, the general official instruction is that all letters in Irish received in Departments should be replied to in Irish.  In the circumstances, I see no necessity for the further instruction suggested in the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit to the Minister that I have in my hand a letter of acknowledgment received from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the contents of which were not understood by the recipient thereof, and that his failure to understand them caused him considerable personal inconvenience? I have also another similar letter received from the Board of Works, which gave rise to considerable inconvenience as a result of the inability of the recipient to understand it.  Would it in any way derogate from the status of the Irish language if, in these form letters which merely say that the Minister has received your letter and is looking into the matter, there were subscribed thereunder in minor print a translation of the contents of the body of the letter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to amend sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 4 of the School Attendance Act, 1926.  Deputies will probably remember that these sub-sections were introduced in order that the doing of light agricultural work on their parents' land by children over the age of 12 years during two periods of the year&mdash;from 17th March to 15th May in the Spring, and from 1st August to 15th October in the harvest&mdash;should be accepted as a reasonable excuse for failure to attend school.  These sub-sections lapsed on 1st January, 1936, and it was necessary to come to a decision as to whether they should be re-enacted.  On the whole, I think there are very good reasons for re-enacting them.  In the first place, the reasons which the Dáil had in mind, when they inserted these provisions in the 1926 Bill, still hold.  There is no doubt but that farmers, and particularly small farmers, require the aid of their children at certain periods of the year&mdash; particularly the Spring period and the harvesting period&mdash;and possibly it may be argued, I think with reason, that there is a greater necessity for them to have the aid of their children at the <Col N="459" /> present time than even at the period when the Act was passed into law.  The present policy in regard to agriculture means that there will be more work to be done and more demand upon their children's time.  The second point which the House had in mind at the time when the sub-sections were put into the Bill was that light agricultural labour had a definitely educative advantage.  It is a form of vocational education, if you will, and so long as it is clearly understood that it shall be of a light nature and not injurious to the children, I think that that is a reasonable principle.</P>
    <P>We have had a good deal of experience now of the working of these two sections, and, on the whole, I feel that there are sound reasons for re-enactment. They have worked out satisfactorily. The percentage of violations of their provisions is relatively small.  On the other hand, it cannot be said that farmers have taken advantage of the sub-sections to keep their children at home from school unless they were really needed.  For example, during the last two years I find that, out of a school population of 97,000, roughly, which might have been affected by these sub-sections, only from 34,000 to 36,000 children took advantage of these clauses, and that 34,000 to 36,000 includes all children who remained at home from school during the two periods in question, even though they did not remain for the full period; that is, even though they only remained at home for part of the period and not for the whole of the ten days' period in both instances.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that, on balance, the Government are justified in thinking that this Bill should be proceeded with and that these particular sub-sections of the 1926 School Attendance Act should be re-enacted for a further period, and we have fixed a period of five years.  Therefore, the Bill, if passed into law, will lapse on 1st January, 1941.  I do not think that any other question arises, Sir, and if there are any points that Deputies wish to question me about, I shall be very glad to give them any information I have in regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise, Sir, to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  I am rather surprised that the Government and the Minister should recommend the re-enactment of these two clauses in the School Attendance Act without going somewhat further, in the light of the nine years' experience the Minister has had of the Bill, into an examination of the Bill in its entirety.  I rather expected that the Government would welcome the opportunity that presents itself of allowing these two clauses, which I consider objectionable, to lapse.  The bringing of children of tender years from the school into the fields to perform what is presumably light work, but what in actual practice has developed, in my opinion, into a form of heavy and undesirable work quite unsuitable for children of those tender years, is altogether wrong, in my opinion.  The pulling, thinning and topping of beet, for instance, is quite unsuitable for young children, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the educational value of having recourse to the agricultural fields, there is quite ample opportunity presented to the children of the small farmers during their vacation period, or during the long hours after school.  As a matter of fact, the vacation period is so fixed as to enable the children to be of help to their parents in the fields and I hold that the vacation periods provide sufficient opportunity for the children to get all the necessary knowledge of agriculture without having to put themselves actually to the heavy tasks of spring and harvest work.  These provisions have been availed of to a large extent to allow children to remain away from school and dodge about the country roads, instead of working in the fields &mdash;that is, apart from those engaged in actual agricultural operations.  I am aware of cases of children living on the outskirts of the city, in cases where work is being done on market gardening, who are clever enough, although they have no claim at all to assist their parents, to know these dates well and who, by means of these provisions, are afforded an easy way to escape school attendance.  These two periods, while short in themselves, are spread over <Col N="461" /> nineteen weeks of the school year, and consequently, cause considerable dislocation to the school work in that period.  I should have thought that, at the present time, in view of the provisions with regard to the school leaving age, it would be the policy of the Government to recognise that the educational life of the child must be in those years, and that anything that would tend to disturb the educational programme of the child should be set aside unless there were very serious reasons for deviating from the programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that only 34,000 to 36,000 children availed themselves of this.  It would be interesting to have an analysis of how many of these children were actually engaged on work and how many were engaged in dodging around the roads and sheltering under the plea that they were assisting their parents.  I think that there are other clauses in the Bill that call more seriously for attention than these two clauses.  There has been a general laxity and a general tendency for parents to try to get away from the obligation to send their children to school.  I hold that the Act wants to be tightened up badly, and yet we find that no action whatever has been taken. Evidently, the Minister and the Department are quite satisfied with the working of that machine.  I am aware that several amendments were submitted many months ago to the Minister for his consideration, but evidently they have not been considered worth giving effect to, and the only thing that is proposed to be done is to re-enact what we consider objectionable clauses which, we think, should be allowed to lapse into obscurity. Very considerable objections were offered to these clauses when the main Bill was being passed through this House.  It was only allowed to pass owing to the representations of Deputy Heffernan and the Farmers' Party at that time.  Deputy Gorey wanted to have nothing to do with it.  Notwithstanding the fact that the present policy is one of more tillage, I do not know whether it would more afford an opportunity for adult labour than provide an additional means for exploiting children's labour unduly and <Col N="462" /> unwisely at a period of their lives which should be devoted wholly to their education.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has advanced any reasons to justify or warrant the continuance of those clauses.  I think the Minister would be much better engaged if he would withdraw these clauses and bring in a Bill dealing generally with the School Attendance Act and tightening up the regulations which are so loose at the present time as to allow plenty of loopholes for children and their parents to evade their obligations with regard to school attendance.  For instance, I think the Minister should endeavour to tighten up, as in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the term under which children may be released or excused from school attendance.  It would be well if he could do something to stop the abuses that are taking place, such as where a man with a family of three or four children can keep one at home and, so long as he is not caught with the one particular child at home inside the prescribed period, he can thus evade his obligations. In that way, there can be one of a family of three or four children perpetually at home notwithstanding the school regulations.  I do not think any case has been made for the re-enactment of these clauses and they should be allowed to lapse now that the period for their reconsideration has arrived.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister or Deputy Keyes appears the more cynical or the more hypocritical in the remarks which they have made on this measure.  The Minister wants to extend the provisions of this Act in order to give the farmers the assistance of their children at home at particular periods of the year.  We had members of the Labour Party quite recently complaining throughout the country that the wages of agricultural labourers had been reduced from one end of the country to another.  They do not really believe that it was anything but the want of money &mdash; the incapacity of the farmers to pay the labourers the amount they paid them in the past &mdash; that was responsible for reducing the wages of agricultural <Col N="463" /> labourers.  In a very large section of the country agricultural labourers who were employed regularly up to a few years ago are no longer getting employment. That was the complaint also of the Labour Deputies throughout the country and now we have disagreement between Ministers and members of the Labour Party as to what should be done in these particular circumstances. The fact is that the farmer's income has almost completely disappeared. Nearly two-thirds of it has been wiped away.  There is no suggestion or no promise that any different attitude is going to be adopted, in pursuit of the joint policy of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, to put the farmer in a better condition inside the next six or 12 months to pay the agricultural labourer who wants work.</P>
      <P>Again we have to recall that a resolution was passed by the County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford in the beginning of last year appealing to the Government to extend the free beef scheme to agricultural labourers, because, as was stated, the average wage paid to an agricultural labourer in Wexford, even to a man with a family, was 8/- per week.  The Commissioner in South Tipperary had to face the same representations from cottage rent collectors there.</P>

Deputy Mulcahy made reference to the condition of the farmers and their need for having the services of their children on the farm.

I think Deputy Mulcahy should be as aware of the situation in the country as anybody else.  He should know there are particular periods in the year when farmers need assistance on their holdings, in connection with the thinning of turnips for example, and particularly at harvest time.  The few shillings earned in those periods by young lads, who would be free from school for a week or a fortnight, are very welcome <Col N="467" /> in the agricultural labourer's household.  Deputy Mulcahy, apparently, does not consider that side of it.  I am prepared to admit that we have not bettered the position of agricultural labourers to such an extraordinary extent as would enable us to get rid of this particular benefit.</P>

      <P>Now, to get back to what we were dealing with.  I realise the necessity at particular periods of the year to allow young lads to remain from school for nine or ten days to do work on the land.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly see the point of the Labour Party's objection to the retention of this particular privilege. The Labour Party ought to be well aware that if this privilege is not continued it will not put any great number of people into employment on the land.  That, I assume, is the motive underlying the objection by Deputy Keyes and the Labour Party to this measure; they anticipate if they carry their way that some additional employment may be given on the land.  I do not think, if the Minister were to accept the Labour Party's contention, that the extra employment would amount to much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought at one time that the Deputy referred to the matter of employment.  He did refer to the point he made now, and I will come to that later.  In the main, the farmers that this will apply to are the very small farmers who, in nine cases out of ten, were not employers of outside labour.  They are the types of farmers who at times have to avail of the help of their wives when harvesting their crops. Their wives look forward to the day when the children will be sufficiently grown up to relieve them of the necessity of working on the land.  In many cases for a number of years the wives of the small farmers have to assume those duties.  I think every Deputy knows that there are numbers of small farmers who can only carry on with the help of their wives and in the course of time the grown-up children relieve their mothers.  These small farmers are as anxious as any other section of the community that their children should be educated; they are perhaps as anxious as any Labour Deputy that their children should be educated and they are prepared to sacrifice as much as other <Col N="469" /> sections of the community in order to have their children educated.  It is only when necessity drives them that they will avail of the privilege the Minister proposes here to provide.</P>
      <P>Taking the matter from another aspect, there is an educational value for farmers' children in performing light work on the farm.  Most of them will have to assume the occupation of farming at a later stage.  Some, perhaps, will have to become farm labourers, because they all will not have farms, and an early education in farming subjects is perhaps as essential as the education derived in the schools.  Deputy Keyes says that this particular form of education should be confined to the period when the children are on holidays.  I assume that the farmers' children deserve a holiday as well as other children.  The school holiday season might not always coincide with the particular season when a small farmer would require his children to do the work on the land.  Deputy Corry referred to the thinning of turnips.  So far as I know, the thinning of turnips does not fall in with the school holiday period, but it is a type of work that boys and girls of 12 and 13 years might easily do without straining their physical powers or in any way injuring themselves.  The services of the children are a great help to the farmer.  I see no force in the objection to this privilege.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that this was necessary five and six years ago; it was necessary for the reason that the small farmer was not an employer of labour and at certain times he needed the help of his children.  It is necessary now for the very same reason.  Indeed, it is more necessary now, because, as the Minister admitted, there are numbers of farmers who were employers of labour but who are now placed in the same position as the smaller farmers and they are no longer employers of labour because they cannot afford it. I do not think there is any force whatsoever in the Labour Party's objection to the retention of this privilege in respect of the farmers' children and I think the House will agree with the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party is in a very unenviable position, because it is getting hung with the rope of its own record.  The Socialist Party in this country since this Parliament sat has consistently supported the Government; they have supported the Government in every burden the Government has put on the agricultural community.  Then they adjourn from this House and posture as the Socialist Party in this country fighting for the Workers' Republic and control of the means of production.  Now let them be known for what they are.  The Socialist Party, I am glad to think, represents a miserable minority of the working people of this country and they come in here, with shameless audacity, to complain of the inevitable consequences of what they have done. Free education in this country is a social service and it was made compulsorily available to every child in this country by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government some years ago.  That Government laid down the principle that it did not stand for revolutionary change because it believed that the benefits that might accrue from revolutionary changes would be far out-weighed by the difficulties that would be created.  Acting with common prudence, they introduced a new and very remarkable social service in compulsory education, not voluntary education, for the children of every man and woman in the country and they very prudently said: &ldquo;We do not hope to carry this into 100 per cent. effect without a transitional period.  Therefore we provide that in this transitional period the farmers will accustom themselves gradually to the prospect of doing without the labour that they depended upon in the past from their juvenile children.&rdquo;  They also said that with the increasing prosperity which the agricultural community was entitled to expect and contemplating the prospects in the country, they were satisfied that at the end of five years the change would involve the agricultural community in no unbearable financial burden through having to get labour elsewhere and let their children free to pursue their studies.  Then Fianna <Col N="471" /> Fáil emerged and, with the help of the Socialist Party in this House, they smashed all the prospects of financial improvement that the agricultural community looked for.  They reduced the rural community to the condition in which it finds itself at the present time when the income of the farmers to whose children this Bill will apply has been reduced by £25,000,000 sterling per annum.  I remember warning the Socialist Party of this fact&mdash;that you cannot cripple the agricultural community without destroying the social services.  I remember warning them that the first thing they would see emerging from the economic policy of the Government would be that they would have to retrench on the social services.</P>

      <P>When the Cumann na nGaedheal Government brought in this Act about compulsory education they indicated that the agricultural community must advance in prosperity before they could afford this change. First they must accustom themselves to it, and in the second place they must advance in their financial circumstances to justify their hiring labourers to do the work which they had expected their children to do in the past.  My suggestion is that when you provide free education for the children of the poor, when you say: &ldquo;We are determined the children should get this education,&rdquo; you are providing a valuable social service, and my submission is that this is part of the system which the Government has to make it possible for them to pile on burdens to the agricultural community.  One of the essential procedures in that is to relieve some part of the burden that the agricultural community now bears.  The social services are part of the burden. The farmer ordinarily contributes to the social services by paying men to do his work while his children get free education; they contribute to the rates, and they contribute their share to taxation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a similar difference in relation to all other social services. However, they will be provided with an opportunity for doing that hereafter. I want to ask Deputy Donnelly to bear in mind this fact: that this is a social service, and is being reduced by the Fianna Fáil Government because the Socialist Party helped the Fianna Fáil Party to break the farmers on whom this service rests.  I invite the Socialist Party to remember that so long as they continue to support Fianna Fáil in the policy they are at present pursuing, the more will they have to protest against the disappearance of the social services that have been built up in this country. I urge on the Socialist Party to make up their minds which end of the stick they want.  Fianna Fáil at last has made up its mind that it wants to trample the farmers into the dust, and it makes no disguise of that.  The Socialist Party wants to pretend to be a champion of the farmer and the agricultural labourer, and it wants at the same time to place burdens on their backs which they know they cannot bear.  Let them at least be honest and come out and tell us what they really do stand for.  When we know that, we will be better able to judge of the honesty of the representations they are at present making.  I think this amendment is a deplorable retrogression.  I think it is equally deplorable that the farmers are unable to pay a fair wage to labourers to do this work.  I think it is detestable that the place of those children will be taken by agricultural labourers who will receive 8/- a week for their work.  But I think it is inevitable. I think it is nothing but fraud to suggest that this consequence of Fianna Fáil's policy is avoidable.  It is absolutely unavoidable, and, if we go on as we are going at present, this is going to happen to every other social service in the country.  Let this be a warning to the Socialist Party and to the Fianna Fáil Party of where they <Col N="474" /> are drifting.  Let them realise that we ought to restore such a measure of prosperity in the country as will make it possible for the children of the poor to get at least a decent primary education, without having to go out and slave in the fields when they ought to be at their school books.</P>

      <P>I think, as my colleague points out, that probably if those sub-sections were not re-enacted we would have had an even more fiery speech from Deputy Dillon.  Had we allowed the sub-section to lapse, and the position to arise that farmers who had been accustomed for the past ten years to get the benefit of this concession which enabled them to keep their children home from school to assist them on the land for ten days at those two periods of the year, spring and harvest; had we allowed it to become the position that they would find themselves in the grip of the enforcing authority for violating the School Attendance Act, I am sure that the Deputy would positively shiver with indignation.  His rhetoric would certainly outpace even what we have heard to-day.  The fact is that the Bill is really a very small Bill, and I would suggest that if the Deputy wants to raise any general question about education or any other social service he will have ample opportunities of doing so.  He should not take advantage of a small Bill of this nature to pretend that there is some deplorable retrogression on the part of the Government.  There is no deplorable retrogression.  The fact is that I am quite satisfied with the way in which those sections have worked out.  I have shown the House that a very large number&mdash;the vast majority&mdash;of the farmers who could have kept their children from school, who could have taken advantage of those sub-sections, <Col N="475" /> have not done so.  The facilities are there, and it is absolute ráiméis for Deputy Dillon to pretend that this is retrogression in so far as rural education is concerned.  The exceedingly high record of attendance in the rural areas, and the fact that since the School Attendance Act was passed the figures showing the attendance in the higher classes in the national schools&mdash; which were exceedingly low before that Act was put into operation&mdash;have increased, show that rural education is going ahead.  We have more children in the upper classes of our schools getting the benefit of the entire period for which they should attend primary schools, and they are also attending fairly regularly.  I do not think anybody can question that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No new points have been raised in opposition to this measure.  All the arguments brought forward by Deputy Keyes were brought forward when the original Bill was under discussion.  It was agreed on that occasion&mdash;even by the representative of the Labour Party at the time, who was specially interested in this matter&mdash;that the farming community had a strong case, and that they should be given this concession. The case, I think it will be admitted, is at least as strong now. In view of the fact that there have not been any serious effects on education, and that the farming community has taken advantage of their opportunity, induces me to believe that it is good policy and wise policy to continue the concession for at least another period of five years.  The Deputy said that the work on which the children were engaged when they were kept from school under those sub-sections was often very unsuitable.  I do not think we need doubt that the parents will treat their children properly in this regard, and that they are not going to ask them to do the same kind of work as they would ask agricultural labourers to do.  They ask them to help out with the lighter duties during the spring and harvest when, as has been pointed out by Deputy Bennett, it is necessary that the work should be done in good time: when weather fluctuations often intervene, and the farmer cannot wait over even until the <Col N="476" /> week-end, let alone until the vacation period, to get the work done.  Deputy Keyes referred to the question of parental responsibility.  Of course I should like, and I have often said that I should like, to see the school attendance figures in this country as good as they are in Scotland.  They are not as good.  In Scotland they can reach a figure of 90 per cent.; here we can reach a figure of 84 per cent.  But in view of the fact that we have probably a very much larger proportion of our children in small rural schools, I think that our figures are probably very satisfactory in all the circumstances. I do not think there is any lack of responsibility on the part of the parents.  I think that the figures in regard to all branches of our educational system show that the parents want to do their very best for the children, and that the rural parents, if anything, are more anxious.  The poorer people are, the more anxious they are to get the best possible education for their children.</P>
    <P>With regard to the School Attendance Act in general, the Deputy says that the Department of Education seems to be quite satisfied with the present state of affairs, and he referred to a memorandum presented to the Department of Education last year. So far as I remember, that memorandum, while expressing dissatisfaction with the Act, admitted that the Act in itself covered the ground fairly well. What was really defective in their opinion was the administration.  Now there must be definite exemptions given under any School Attendance Act in cases of special necessity.  It may be domestic necessity or it may be some other reason.  There must be some loophole by which parents can urge special necessity to keep their children at home from school.  It rests with the district justices and not with me to see that a fair and proper interpretation&mdash;and I think that has been generally given&mdash;is given to those sections which permit parents to keep their children from school in certain circumstances.  Certainly no case has been made to me to show that the Act should be amended or that there is any necessity for amending it.  I think <Col N="477" /> everybody is agreed that the Act has worked out very satisfactorily, largely owing to the general and worthy cooperation <Col N="478" /> of the people themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is consequential on the decision, as on the 20th January of this year, to abolish the duty of 5/- per ton on coal.  The Bill, in Section 2, provides for the repayment of the duty shown to have been paid on all stocks of coal held by registered importers thereof on the midnight of the 24th January.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 is designed to provide for the repayment of the duty paid on coal dust used in the manufacture of briquettes made by the importer of the coal dust and held in stock by him at midnight on the appointed day.  This provision is necessary as the legal position in regard to such briquettes would otherwise be uncertain.  Section 3 of the Bill has been so worded as to bring claims for repayment, and declarations relating thereto, whenever made, within the ambit of the ordinary Customs law.  The Commissioners, however, will rely on the careful scrutiny of the claims for the safeguarding <Col N="479" /> of the Revenue.  That is all I have to say, Sir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an astounding piece of justice to a very remarkable class of people.  There are quite a number of people who require justice to be done to them in the matter of the results of the 5/- tax on coal.  I quite admit that one of these classes of people is the coal importers.  There are two other classes who retail coal: the coal merchants throughout the country who take their stocks from the coal importers and do the very necessary and important business of retailing coal throughout the country&mdash;the class of retailers we have been dealing with in some respects up to the present, such as the bell-men and the factors in the City of Dublin&mdash;and there are the coal consumers, some consuming coal for manufacturing and industrial purposes and others consuming coal for their household purposes.  There is not a single one of these classes that is not to-day suffering very serious injustices as a result of the policy that put 5/- tax on practically all coal imported into this country for the last 12 months; but the one class that is singled out to have this particular type of justice done to it&mdash;that is, to receive back 5/- per ton in respect of every ton of coal they held in stock on the 24th of January&mdash;is the one class which was able to surmount all the injustices of the last 12 months and which to-day, in my opinion, is reaping a very remarkable profit, all as a result of the Minister putting on 5/- tax and agreeing with the importers that 5/- was enough to take off the price of coal when he removed the 5/- tax.  The Minister has given us no idea at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about a Ministerial agreement with anybody in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is going to hear about it and the Minister is going to explain about it and to tell us why, when he is remitting the amount of tax paid on coal to, at any rate, people who held coal stocks in their hands in the country, he is remitting the 5/- tax only off the coal importers.  I have had a number of <Col N="480" /> cases brought to my mind with regard to coal merchants throughout the country.  Take the case of a man in Limerick who had 260 tons of coal in stock on the 24th January this year. He is not going to get the 5/- tax back, but a coal importer, who, say, imports his coal through the port of Cork, and who has subsidiary stores in Limerick, is going to get the 5/- back, not only in respect of his remaining stocks in Cork, but in respect of the coal in his subsidiary stores in Cork and in Limerick.</P>
      <P>Now, this has to be borne in mind: that, when the Minister refunds this money&mdash;whatever amount it is&mdash;this money has to be found from the backs of other people.  Therefore, if people are providing money to do some justice in this coal business, we want to know to whom that justice is being done and why exactly it is being done to this particular class of people.  The coal importers who paid 5/- on every ton of coal that they had in stock on the 24th January are entitled to get that 5/- a ton back, but other people are more entitled to get it back, I hold.  These are some of the points I want to put before the Minister so that he may have an opportunity of dealing with them before the Committee Stage, unless it is the Government's attitude that they are going to prevent any other people from dealing effectively with them.</P>
      <P>I consider that the Bill should be amended by the Government so that those people, who are coal merchants throughout the country and who are an essential and necessary part of the distributive machinery for distributing coal throughout the country, should get the same consideration in this matter of refund as the coal importers are getting.  I also raise the question as to why the coal importers are getting this remission of taxation at the expense of the general taxpayer when the coal importers themselves are, in my opinion, reaping an enormous extra profit arising out of the prices they are charging for coal at the present time&mdash;a position that would not have existed if the policy of the Government had not been to quota and to license the importation of coal into the country and to put on a 5/- tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Now, let us deal first with the people who retail coal.  I have a statement here, signed by four coal retailers in the town of Castleblayney, and, on Friday, 24th January, they say that they have received and signed the Government's circular presented to them by the manager of the Labour Exchange there to reduce all coals by 5/- a ton, which they say they complied with in the belief that it was compulsory.  The manager of the labour exchange in Castleblayney approached four of the merchants there and presented them with a document about which we have no information and about which we should like to get some information, and got them to sign some kind of a document about which we have no information except that it was an agreement to reduce the price of coal by 5/-. When, however, having done that, they assessed their stocks on 24th January and sent a statement to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking for the refund, the Minister for Industry and Commerce replied that he was only dealing with importers and that the persons who had coal for retail purposes throughout the country were not going to be refunded their money in any way.  I do not know how much coal they had in stock, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows.  I have had communications from other parts of the country&mdash;one where a person had bought 50 tons of coal two days before the remission of tax and who was left, on the 24th January, with 64 tons of coal on hand.  He paid his 5/- duty on that to the importer.  He is now informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is not going to get any refund.</P>
    <P>There is another case of a man in County Limerick who has probably a number of stores throughout the country, who had 210 tons of coal. He paid his 5/- duty on that but he is told by the Minister that he is not going to get any refund in respect of the 5/- duty which he paid through the importers.  The importers have subsidiary stores in that town and other towns throughout the counties of Limerick and Cork, as they have <Col N="482" /> in other parts of the country, in competition with the ordinary coal merchants in retailing coal.  The person who is an importer-retailer is going to get his money back.  I submit to the Minister that the other classes of retailers must be catered for.  They are quite as essential throughout the country as the importer and they are put in the position by the policy unnecessarily pursued by the Government that they cannot be importers of coal.  That brings me to the statement made in some of the letters, that there is in Cork and Limerick a ring which is artificially keeping up the price of coal.  At present it is 6/- more than it was 12 months ago although the prices 12 months ago included the 5/- tax.  Therefore they are retailing it at a net increase of 11/- on the price at which it should be sold, though nothing in the nature of quotas or licences has arisen during the last 12 months.  The retail merchants see that a refund of 5/- is being paid to other merchants who, they complain, are making an unnecessary profit of 11/- per ton to-day.  These retail merchants, as I say, cannot import coal.</P>
    <P>That brings us to a remarkable feature of the present situation that we are driven to contemplate by the circumstances that now exist.  Before the coal-cattle pact was agreed to&mdash;I am not going to put you in an awkward position, a Chinn Comhairle &mdash;in the beginning of last year there was a tax of 5/- on all British coal coming into this country, but there was free trade in coal generally for anybody who wanted to engage in the importation business.  The Government then decided upon the policy that during the six months beginning the 1st February last, they would allow in only 1,000 tons of non-British coal.  But instead of allowing freedom of trade to persons in this country in British coal and putting quota restrictions and licences only in operation in regard to 1,000 tons of foreign coal, the Government took the whole of the coal trade in hands and, through the machinery of licences and quotas, they formed a definite and solid ring of coal importers in the <Col N="483" /> country.  There is not a single person to-day&mdash;I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bear me out or will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;who is not a registered coal importer who can embark in the coal importing business during the next 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody can have the pleasure of registering himself on the register but no person who has not applied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce 14 days before the quota comes into operation can be given a licence to import coal.  If a person wanted to get into the position of being a registered importer, he would have to pay a fee of some amount or other but he could not get into the line of having any chance of importing coal until he reached a point 14 days before the 1st February, 1937, when he could apply for permission to import a certain amount of coal and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already told us that he issues licences in proportion to the amount of coal people have imported in the past.  Therefore the question of anybody entering into the business of importing coal is almost impossible at the present time.  The Minister may explain that there are some loop-holes in that but he cannot explain why there should be any necessity for preventing freedom of trade in British coal between anybody in this country and anybody in Britain.  He cannot say there is any necessity for putting his quota and licence machinery into operation in regard to British coal to-day.  He has created a ring of coal importers in this country of such a kind that the people who are the actual retailers and who hold stocks of coal in several places in the country, can with reason complain and say: &ldquo;Not only am I being denied the justice given to the importers but I am being denied it while the people to whom that justice is being done are charging me to-day, because of the circumstances in which they have been placed by the <Col N="484" /> Minister and his unnecessary licensing system, 11/- per ton more than I should be charged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This complaint, which reaches me from the country from the actual retailers, fits in completely with the complaint I have already made to the Minister here, that the class of people to whom the concession is made in this Bill, are at the present time charging bellmen and other factors retailing coal in the city 8/2 per ton more than the import price for last year and the import price for this year would show that they are entitled to charge.  They are people who charge manufacturers in this country 33/6 for coal which can be delivered at the quayside in Dublin at 24/- per ton, including costs of insurance and freight.  If the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks, as we think, that it is just that persons who imported coal a couple of weeks ago and paid a tax of 5/- on it, and who now have to sell it in circumstances in which at least that 5/- has to come off, should get the benefit of this Bill, we want to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance why it is that nothing is being done to give justice to the retailers who have complained of the excessively high prices I speak about.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce feels the necessity of extending justice to coal importers of the type I have described, then I think he should do something to get for Irish manufacturers a fairer deal from those importers in the matter of the prices they are charging.  We want to hear why this ring should be kept in existence now, when the Minister can fully see what has been the result of making that ring; we want to hear why it should be kept in existence now by continuing the quota system, which is not necessary for the exchange of coal between Great Britain and this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all their bitter traditional war spirit against this country, the British coal people are prepared to sell us all the coal we want, and I do not know why any Government should step in front of the people of this country and tell them how much coal they want.  If the policy is that we can get British coal, the people of this country should <Col N="485" /> be their own guides as to how much coal they want, and it is all nonsense and bunkum to have the Minister thinking of a number and writing 3,114,000 tons of coal as the amount of coal that will be allowed into this country this year from Great Britain.  If the people want more he will issue an additional quota.  As a number it means nothing, but the fact that he thinks of a number and sticks it in an Order means that he creates a ring of people whom he registers and quotas, and out of that ring he keeps everybody else.  The result is there is no chance of anybody starting to become a coal importer in order to break down the present high prices to manufacturers and the consuming public.  Amongst other things we want to know what is the necessity for the quota system which is restricting the freedom of trade in coal between the people of this country and Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which this Bill is drawn appears to be on the basis of giving to those who have most the benefits that will be provided by the measure.  It seems to be based on a desire to give only to the registered coal importers the remission of the duty which was charged upon the coal which they imported.  A similar measure of justice is going to be denied to persons just as necessary for the distribution of coal under the present system as the registered coal importer. If this Bill has any real meaning, or if it is intended that it should enshrine any particular philosophy, then it is that in respect of coal which was held in stock on the 24th January, and on which a duty of 5/- a ton was collected by the Executive Council, there would be a refund of that duty.  In applying the provisions of this Bill to a situation of that kind, the Executive Council propose to grant the remission of tax to the wealthy, large-scale coal importers and the small men in the provincial towns who are not registered coal importers will have to sell their coal at 5/- a ton less than the registered coal importer in the same town will be able to sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me cite a case which, I think, will light up the very obvious injustice <Col N="486" /> of this Bill.  In the town of Naas there is a man trading as a coal merchant. He buys his coal from a registered coal importer in Dublin.  The registered importer will secure a remission of 5/- on every ton of coal he had on the 24th of January.  The Dublin coal importer has also a depot in Naas.  He will also secure the remission on every ton of coal he had in his Naas depot.  The other trader in Naas, who buys from the Dublin importer and who takes delivery from Dublin, will have to forgo any claim to a rebate of 5/- a ton, while the man from whom he bought it and with whom he is trading in competition, is going to be allowed 5/- a ton rebate.  We have the position in that town that the man who is an ordinary, unregistered coal on the importer had 166 tons of coal on the 24th January.  The fact that it was in his coal store has been sworn to before a Peace Commissioner.  In the same town the registered Dublin importer has a depot, and he will get a remission of 5/- a ton on every ton in his Naas store on the 24th January.  The trader will have to dispose of his coal in competition with the registered importer, who is enabled by the provisions of this Bill to secure the remission on the coal he held on the 24th January.  I think that is a very obvious injustice.</P>
    <P>Instead of giving the remission generally to all persons in the coal trade who had quantities of coal on hand on the 24th January, on which they paid 5/- a ton tax to the Government, the Minister proposes to give it only to the registered coal importers, and they include many of the wealthiest people in the coal trade. The wealthiest people in the trade will derive the benefit and the small man is not going to get any remission at all, yet he is to be required to sell his coal in competition with the wealthy importers.  It seems to be a case of the more you have the more you get.  The more difficult it is for persons to bear a burden the more difficult it will be made by the Executive Council, if one is to judge by the philosophy in this Bill.  I think it is an outrageously unjust Bill.  If the ordinary coal merchant, who is not a registered importer, had bought coal <Col N="487" /> in large quantities and allowed it to remain in the stores of the registered coal importer, then the Government would have to grant a remission of 5/- a ton in respect of it; but because it was moved from the yard of the registered importer to the store of the small trader who is not registered, no remission of tax will be allowed.  That is the obvious injustice of the Bill, and it should be amended in such a manner as to extend to all persons in the trade the remission which is granted now only to the registered importer.  I think the Minister ought to agree to amend the Bill in Committee so as to ensure that the benefits it provides will be evenly distributed and not distributed in the illogical and unfair way now contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping I would hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Donnelly, Deputy Moore and some other members of the Fianna Fáil Party endeavouring to justify this measure as it stands.  I should like to support what has been said by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton.  I think it is a very unjust measure, unjust to the coal merchants throughout the country and unjust particularly in view of the fact that it must be known to the Minister that many of these coal merchants had larger supplies in stock than they would ordinarily have, because many coal merchants in the country bought larger stocks than usual, fearing the strike that was threatened at the time. I know coal merchants who were carrying practically double the quantity of coal that they ordinarily would have in their stores, and that makes the injustice all the harder to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be admitted that the ordinary coal merchant does not get the same profit, nor does he get it as easily, out of the coal as does the registered importer.  It must be admitted further that there are certain coal merchants who contracted for supplies of coal early in the season but who were not able to take advantage, not only of this remission but of the increases which were put on at a time prior to and due to the threatened coal strike.  I give a typical case in an <Col N="488" /> ordinary country town where there are four coal distributors.  One distributing centre is a branch of a well-known southern coal importing firm.  That firm has distributing branches all over the South of Ireland.  That particular firm gets full remission for all the coal held in stock at midnight on the 24th of January&mdash;not only all the coal at their headquarters but remission also in respect of every branch which they have throughout the South of Ireland. They have a branch in the town of which I speak and they got a remission of 5/- for every ton held on Friday night, the 24th January.  On Saturday morning they were able to sell their coal at a reduction of 5/- a ton to the customers. In the case of the other three merchants they find they must follow suit though they get no remission. Let this be said to the credit of the coal merchants in the country, that notwithstanding the fact that they knew, from the Order issued by the Government, that they were not to get a refund, they immediately reduced the price of coal by 5/- a ton.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this Bill is unfair and unjust.  I think the Minister will find it hard to make a case for it.  He will find it very hard to convince this House that the only case he could attempt to make would be the difficulty of ascertaining the quantities of coal held in stock by the merchants throughout the country.  That same objection can be made to obtaining particulars of the stock held by direct coal importers.  I have already mentioned that one coal importing firm has branches nearly in every town in the South of Ireland, and this firm has to get allowances in respect of all the coal they had in stock in all their different branches.  You have the position that in one town one merchant had 100 tons, another 62 tons, a third 25 tons, and a fourth 15 tons.  Now that merchant who had 15 tons might find that the 5/- per ton might be a much more important matter to him than 5/- on 500 tons to another merchant. The man with 15 or 20 tons is doing his best to make ends meet.  In most cases the profit he gets is much smaller and it is more difficult for him to work his business.  I do not want <Col N="489" /> to go into the matters that have been referred to by Deputy Mulcahy regarding the necessity for quota licences for registered importers at the moment.  I would certainly like to hear the Minister make a case for that.  The Minister might tell us why the quota is 200,000 tons more this year than last year.  Is there any necessity for it?  Could the Minister give us any information as to whether the coal merchants in this country import anything like that?</P>

I should like to hear from the Minister if he is going to explain this measure of justice to all the people who are at a loss.  It must be remembered that the coal merchants paid 5/- a ton for the coal in stock on the night of the 24th January and they are now losing that amount.</P>

      <P>It seems to me an indefensible proposition to ask the House to accept a measure like this which proposes to give privileges to one particular section of traders and deny similar privileges and rights to others in the coal business.  I have cases sent to me similar to the cases mentioned by Deputies Mulcahy, Norton and others clearly defining the injustice that would be meted out to certain people in the coal trade if the Minister does not amend the Bill in the way suggested.  As far as I can see, this Bill proposes to recoup persons who have incurred no loss. Importers, even if they have branches in the country, have incurred no loss whatever, whether the Minister remits the tax or not, but traders and coal merchants who are not importers did incur losses in very many cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I know of one particular merchant who had over £200 worth of coal in stock on the 24th of January, and who did sell it to his customers with the reduction of 5/- per ton, although he had paid the importer in advance before the fall in price. He gets recoupment from no source. He is at a loss of £60 or more on that particular transaction, while the man in a similar trade on the other side of the street&mdash;the importer, who has already, perhaps, privileges which that particular trader has not&mdash;will, when this measure is passed, be recouped to <Col N="491" /> the extent of 5/- per ton on the quantity of coal he had in stock in that town on the 24th January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>At a loss of 5/- per ton as compared with his competitor across the street.  This measure is obviously giving preference to one trader against another&mdash;the preference being given perhaps to the person who could better afford to sustain a loss than the man who does not get it.  I do not think that that proposal can be defended by the Minister.  It is putting a complete injustice on a certain section of the people.  There is another point which has not been raised.  This might possibly have led to the consumers not getting the benefit of the 5/- reduction which the Minister and which we all hoped they would get on the 25th January.  I know of no instance of the kind of case to which I am going to refer, but it might have occurred that a trader who is not an importer might have had a store in some country village, with no opposition, and it might have been open to him to continue to charge the 5/- extra.  The inducement was held out to him.  The Minister makes the proposition to him to charge the 5/-; he will not get it otherwise.  The inducement is there for any merchant in a town where he has no opposition, and he has possibly charged it because he has already paid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>To their credit, I know of no such instance.  In all the cases I know, I must say that the traders have sold coal at the 5/- less immediately the notice appeared in the Press that the price was to be reduced, but there was an inducement given to traders&mdash;if they had no opposition&mdash;to continue to charge the original price, and prevent this loss <Col N="492" /> which the Minister is imposing.  I do think that on the next stage of this Bill the Minister ought to bring in an amendment to include traders who are not importers, so that they will have the benefit of the drawback as well as the importing coal merchant. It was obviously the intention of the Minister&mdash;at least I hope it was his obvious intention; perhaps it was not &mdash;that persons who had stocks of coal on hands on the 24th January last, on which it could be proved that the tax was paid, would get the privilege of this recoupment.  I say I hope that was the Minister's intention.  That hope, I admit, is a bit dashed by this particular Bill, which makes it clear that the Minister is not going to fulfil that intention.  I do hope he will reconsider the matter, and ensure that the Bill will at least give justice to every section of the people engaged in the coal trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with this Bill, as it affects certain retailers of coal in the small towns adjoining the county which I represent.  I must say that as far as Louth is concerned we have very little interest in the matter. The importers in the various seaport towns, I presume, will automatically get a refund of the 5/- tax, but the Minister may not be aware that in several towns, especially in the adjoining county of Monaghan, the custom is that the coal is brought into the port of Dundalk, taken out of the ships there by means of the cranes, and emptied right into the the railway wagons.  The railway line runs along the harbour.  This coal never sees the yards of the importers.  It is railed right on to Castleblayney, Ballybay, and all those little towns right over to the north east.  Some of those men had fairly large stocks of coal when the notice of the remission of the 5/- tax appeared in the Press.  I can quite understand that there is a certain amount of difficulty in dealing with those people.  There would also be a certain amount of suspicion on the part of the Revenue Commissioners as to whether those people had those stocks of coal which they say they <Col N="493" /> had, but I know that many of them have testified before a Peace Commissioner that on that date they had certain stocks of coal.  I should also like to point out, in addition to what has been stated here by other Deputies in proof of their contention, that in the cases to which I refer those retailers of coal in those towns received, I believe, a Government circular, ordering them to reduce the price of coal by 5/- a ton.  Those retailers of coal immediately did so on the advice in that Government circular.  I think in this case they have a special claim, if I may make the remark, to the remission of this 5/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may argue that it is, say, agreed to pay the 5/- on all the coal imported by the coal importers and possibly he might put up the argument that those coal importers should remit the 5/- on whatever number of tons they themselves sent to those towns&mdash;the quantity of coal from each cargo which did not go into their yards.  Of course, I do not think they would do that.  I think it would be up to the Minister himself to take the word of those retailers of coal in those towns, and pay them the 5/-, because there is no doubt about it some of those retailers carried very large stocks of coal on which they have paid the old price, including the 5/- levy.  I think in justice to those retailers the Minister should take steps immediately to see that they get back that 5/-.  I do not think there is any necessity for argument about it.  Common sense alone should convince the Minister now that the right thing for him to do is to admit the justice of their claims and pay this money.  I am not going to go into the question of quotas or licences at all.  I have expressed the view long ago that, since we are committed to take British coal now, in my humble opinion there is no necessity for either quotas or licences.  Let us have free trade again in so far as British coal is concerned, and let there be the same competition as existed prior to the economic war coming into force.  However, that is a matter for the future.  The present matter before the House is one which <Col N="494" /> should commend itself to the serious consideration of the Minister.  I hope he will agree to give this 5/- per ton to those retailers of coal in the small towns who, owing to the fact that they had not been on the register of coal importers, are being disallowed this 5/- which they themselves have paid and which they have allowed to the customers on the advice of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is only justice, as far as it goes, but it is open to doubt whether justice has been carried as far as it should be carried.  This justice has been referred to by Deputy Bennett as a privilege to certain classes.  I do not think there is any privilege in it. It is only what is due to the coal importers.  It is equally due to merchants who carry stocks of coal.  I should like to know if, when the duty was imposed some years ago, the Minister took any steps to make coal importers and coal merchants sell their existing stocks without adding on the tax, or if they had the benefit of the tax immediately it was imposed on the stocks they had imported before it had been imposed, or did he take any steps to levy tax on these stocks.  It would be wrong if importers or merchants had to lose at that period the advantage of the rise in coal and to lose now <Col N="495" /> when the tax is taken off.  It would be equally an injustice to the public if the public had to pay a tax a few years ago which did not find its way to the revenue and to pay extra now for coal after the tax has been removed.</P>
      <P>The cases made by Deputy Bennett and Deputy Coburn are natural ones which have arisen.  The difficulty is to check them.  Personally I think the Minister and the Government generally have not handled this position properly. They should have fixed a date on which they could satisfy themselves what stocks were carried by importers and merchants, and allow a drawback as from that date on these stocks. Theoretically, the merchant is as well entitled to this as the importer, but it may be difficult to check now.  We know that no section of the public are all angels or saints, and that when they get a chance of making ready money they make it.  It would be necessary to check the returns now if the Minister decided, and I think he should decide in principle and in the interests of justice, that merchants should get the drawback as well as the importers.  It is for him to devise ways and means of ascertaining what stocks they carried on that particular date.  If he can do that satisfactorily he should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly the principle should be embodied in the Bill that where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister or some competent authority that <i>bona fide</i> merchants carried stocks of coal on a particular date, for which, of course, they had to pay the duty, they should be allowed the drawback.  They might not directly have to pay it, but the importer from whom they bought the coal had to pay it, and he charged it to them.  They had to pay it in the inclusive price.  When the tax was taken off, I presume they had to sell the coal as from that date without adding the duty.  That is the theory of the trade anyhow.  I cannot check it. I am afraid Deputy Bennett did not help the case when he suggested that in isolated places, where, in effect, the people were not well up enough, the merchants were able to get away with it at the big price.  There has been so much talk about this tax that I do not <Col N="496" /> think many merchants could get away with it.  While nobody can vote against the principle of the Bill, as far as it goes, I hope the Minister will give an assurance to the House that where satisfactory cases can be definitely put up by merchants they should be included in this as well as the importers.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it would be relevant to ask the Minister if he can give us any information about the coal-cattle pact, on which this arises, and if the report spread about is wrong, that it is all off&mdash;that it has fallen through.  I should like if the Minister would reassure us.  I do not know whether reassurance would be any good or not. I do not mean that for the Minister.  I do not know whether the pact is much use or not.  Personally, I shall vote against it every time it comes up, because I think it is a fraud.  The rumour is strongly current that negotiations have broken down.  I wonder if the Minister could say anything as to that.  I should also like him to tell us, as I suppose he is the accountant-in-chief of the nation, how much has England surcharged us last year by her penal tariffs on foot of this coal-cattle pact.  We sent 150,000 more cattle last year than the year before.  The year before England got all she wanted. Surely she must have got a terrible lot more last year than she wanted.  Can the Minister check up on that?  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer is not responsible to us for book-keeping.</P>

However, I know that I need not labour the point.  I am sure that the Minister sees it himself. I appreciate that the Minister may find some difficulty now, in the absence of any particular data, in checking the stocks held on January 20, but I appeal to him to give to the House an assurance that he will introduce an appropriate amendment at the right time to cover that point.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy Belton's remarks I am curious to know how this question of dutiable fuel is to be settled, or are the declarations of the coal importers, as to the amount of dutiable fuel in stock on the date mentioned, to be taken without check? With a few honourable exceptions, I have not a very high opinion of coal importers, and I would say it is almost certain that the coal importers generally will return all the coal they had in stock on the date mentioned in this Bill as dutiable coal, and it is almost equally certain that such coal was not all &ldquo;dutiable.&rdquo;  It must be remembered that this duty on coal is only a very short time in existence, and everybody knows that some of the coal importers carry very large stocks. Deputy Belton referred to coal that was in stock when the duty came into <Col N="498" /> force.  Well, it is almost certain that a good deal of that coal is still there. Coal importers do not clear out their yards periodically.  They keep renewing their supplies and if I had any responsibility in this matter I would not be at all satisfied with a mere declaration that the coal in stock was all, or nearly all, dutiable coal.  I remember that in 1920, for instance, one of the biggest coal importers in Dublin had a quantity of a particular kind of coal in hands for something like eight or ten years.  It had been bought at about 6/- or 7/- a ton and he could get nobody to buy it from him.  On account of the scarcity in 1920, it was sold as anthracite peas at £6 10s. a ton, though it was no more anthracite peas than the clay which is being ploughed to-day at Tullamore.</P>

In 1914, one of the biggest&mdash;if not the biggest&mdash;coal merchants in Dublin was working at a net profit of 3d. per ton.  While that might be altogether too small to-day, considering the great changes that have taken place in the cost of labour and other things, it suggests that at all events the margin that coal merchants are providing for themselves at present is greatly in excess of what is <Col N="499" /> required.  Not merely that, but the quality of the coal, particularly of the coal sold to the poor people in the larger towns, is altogether shocking and constitutes an injustice that should be remedied.</P>

      <P>I do not see that this has anything to do whatever with the coal-cattle pact or with the decision to take coal from England, because at all times the great bulk of our coal was taken from England.  The situation, however, calls for much more than is contained in this Bill.  The situation calls for some action to secure that coal will be sold at reasonable prices to the consumer and to ensure that the quality of the coal will be uniform for all consumers.  At present it is anything but uniform, and those to whom a fire is of more importance than anything else in the world are not able to get a decent quality of coal and have to pay what can only be regarded as exorbitant prices.  On Christmas eve in Charlemont Street, for instance, coal was being sold at 5d. per stone. To my mind, that is a thing that should call for the attention of the House.</P>

      <P>Deputies Belton and Coburn, alone of those who addressed themselves to this question of granting a remission to coal importers, appeared to recognise that there were certain difficulties in connection with the possible extension of that arrangement.  Deputy Norton, of course, attributed it to the desire of the Government to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor, and Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues merely attributed the provisions of the Bill to the general cussedness of the Government.  I am sure, however, that they all recognise&mdash;only they will not admit it&mdash;that there are obvious difficulties in the position and that the Government, if it could, would like to ensure that the remission would be granted fairly to all those entitled to it.  We have got to recognise, however, that a line must be drawn somewhere&mdash;either at the <Col N="500" /> coal importers or the coal retailers or the sub-retailers or the consumers.  If you are going to grant a remission of the duty paid, what appears to be injustice will be caused somewhere.  Some persons will get the remission and some persons will not get it, unless we are to go down to every merchant and retailer in the country and to every private person in the country and weigh their coal and try to assess the quantities on hands.  This idea that is being conveyed to the effect that the registered coal importers are merely a small number of wealthy firms is ridiculous.  There are something like 700 registered importers of coal.  As a matter of fact, anybody can become a registered importer.  There is no restriction against anybody becoming a registered importer, nor is there any power in the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refuse registration. Neither is it the fact that the position is as described by Deputy Mulcahy: that only those who are registered at the beginning of the quota period can get a licence to import during that period.  That position could only arise in the event of the total quota being allocated at the very beginning of the quota period, and that has not been the position and could not be the position, apart altogether from the fact that 25 per cent. of the total quota is distributed at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and he has been given that discretion in order to ensure that hardships will not arise or injustice be done in consequence of the fact that the allocation of the global quota takes place at the beginning of the period.  Not merely are the registered importers by far the largest number of the persons who retail coal in this country, but they are, of course, by far the most important. Coal retailers who are not importers are few in number, and the actual quantity of coal which any one of them is likely to hold in store is very small.</P>

      <P>It is extremely improbable but, in any event, you have got to realise the practical difficulties involved.  Here is one class, by far the largest class numerically and by far the most important class in relation to the quantity of coal they sell.  In respect to these we know the quantity of coal they imported.  They are the people who paid the duty.  We know what they paid.  It is possible to assess with reasonable accuracy the amount of the refund to which they are entitled.  It is possible to check up the declarations they made as to the quantity in store on the critical night, but the coal that has been sold by them to others cannot be followed up in the same way.  That coal may have been purchased by a person for his own use.  It may have been purchased for resale or for the purposes of a workshop or factory.  You cannot follow it right through the country in order to ascertain what part of it was purchased from the importer for resale, in order to give a rebate of the duty for that part of the coal.  There has been no proposal made that the rebate should be given in respect to coal bought for consumption by the person who purchased it.  That is the practical difficulty which has arisen and which always will arise when a duty is remitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two ways of dealing with difficulties connected with the removal of a duty.  One is to give long notice of the intention to remove it so as to give merchants a sufficient opportunity to dispose of existing stocks.  The other is to provide in some form for the repayment of the duty paid on <Col N="502" /> goods in stock.  In this case we desired the reduction in price to operate quickly, and therefore the device of repaying the duty to those who had paid duty on the quantity of coal they had in stock on the critical night was adopted.  We recognised in doing that that quantities of coal which had passed out of the stores of importers to those who purchased it from them might well be in existence, unconsumed, in some areas around the country, but we recognised also that it would not be possible to follow it in order to give a remission of the duty paid in all cases.</P>

The practical difficulties of adopting any other device are so considerable that the extension of the area of the remission could not be considered.  A number of other matters, in fact all the other matters raised in the course of the discussion, in my opinion were irrelevant to the Bill.  They may have some indirect relationship to it, as Deputy Belton suggested, but they can more properly be dealt with on some other occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has discussed them already, I propose to deal with them now.  He asked why we should have a coal quota at all.  First of all, because of the coal-cattle arrangement under which we pledged ourselves to take all our coal requirements for 11 months from Britain.  The only machinery we had was the Control of Imports Act, which necessitated the making of a quota and the operation of the machinery provided by the Act, but to ensure that there would not be any scarcity of coal, or any inducement to coal importers to form a ring <Col N="503" /> amongst themselves to force up prices, a quota was devised considerably in excess of what the known requirements of the country were and, in fact, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, that excess existed.  It will be even greater this year, because a further increase in the quota has been made.  In Dublin, as far as I know&mdash;in Dublin that particular allegation has been made very frequently&mdash;there is no coal ring.  There was a ring when the Deputies opposite were in office, which operated in conjunction with the colliery owners in Britain, and which went so far as to arrange that these colliery owners would not supply any merchants who were outside the ring.  The Deputies opposite had that matter called to their attention, but they took no action. That ring is now broken.  It was broken when we commenced to import German coal.  At the present time, as far as I have been able to ascertain, there is intense rivalry between the different coal merchants in Dublin.  In certain parts of the country it may happen that the supply of coal is confined to one or two people, but in Dublin, so far as I am aware, there is nothing to suggest the existence of a ring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to the Deputy's first sentence is that it is not correct.  His figures are entirely wrong.  I never denied that the price of coal has gone up.  It has gone up. I pointed out that it has gone up everywhere, in Belfast more than here. The average level of coal prices in Belfast is higher than in Dublin.  The prices have gone up in Great Britain and, indeed, everywhere, and we were not exempt from that rise.  But the Deputy has changed his position so often that it is hard to know where he is.  He started off his price campaign on this basis, that the coal merchants are not to blame, the coal exporters and coal importers are in no way open to criticism; the rise in prices was due altogether to the Government's coal-cattle pact.  That campaign was nullified by the mere <Col N="508" /> publication of the figures in relation to coal imports and prices.  Then the Deputy changed his position completely round.  He made a speech here in which he said that the coal-cattle pact was not really to blame, it had nothing to do with the rise in prices; he was not attributing the rise in prices to anything that the Government had done; in his opinion the rise in prices was due to the profiteering of the coal merchants.</P>
      <P>He was inclined to get away from that half an hour ago and he was trying to attribute the rise in prices to the operation of the coal quota, the necessity for having to register all importers and the issuing of licences. Is the Deputy's position now that the coal merchants are in the wrong and that they are deliberately profiteering to the extent of about 8/- per ton? The coal merchants tell me they are not getting a profit of 1/6 per ton. Yet, according to Deputy Mulcahy, they are getting 8/- a ton over and above what would pay them.  But the Deputy does not prove that.  He tells the House that he is in contact with manufacturers who gave him these figures.  I want these people to come before the Controller of Prices and make a complaint.  If they do it, if they give the barest minimum of information in their possession as to the prices that have been charged for coal, an investigation will follow.  But these manufacturers have not done it.  They have carefully avoided doing it.</P>

      <P>Further, they have no reason to anticipate that I am here to protect them.  If they are losing money they will presumably get out of business.  They are there not for the public good but to make a profit on their transactions.  We must see that they make only a reasonable profit. To Deputy Cosgrave and his friends, whether they are manufacturers or politicians or anything else, I give this assurance: that they need have no fear whatever that I am going to intervene on behalf of the coal merchants.  I have no desire to do it.  It would be entirely contrary to the policy of the Government of which I am a member to interfere in that way.  It was we who set up the Prices Commission.  It was we who introduced the Act giving the Controller of Prices the powers he has.  The Opposition Party opposed that Act, and the fact that it has not been more effective is due to their friends in the Seanad.  We will have a new Bill this year and we are now in the position in which we can take out of the Act the amendments which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the Seanad put into it to lessen its effectiveness. Even at present the Act is effective to control prices and to carry out investigations.  The result of the investigations can be acted upon.  All that is required is that some citizen would come forward with the complaint. When the city bellmen went to the Controller of Prices he acted on their complaints and he got the merchants to reduce the price.  There is no reason why Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Cosgrave's manufacturing friends could not come forward with a case for the Controller of Prices.  The fact that they have not done so is significant in the light of the complaints that Deputy Mulcahy has been making recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters have very little relation to this Bill, which provides for a reduction of 5/- a ton on coal in respect of which duty was paid&mdash;coal which was in the yards of the coal merchants <Col N="510" /> on the 24th January last.  The only question raised in relation to the Bill was the possible extension of the remission of the duty on coal in the case of coal in the hands of persons other than the coal importers.  The sole reason why it is impossible to put that into the Bill is that, on the one hand, it might lead to considerable fraud and, on the other hand, it would involve sending out hosts of inspectors to every part of the country to which the imported coal can be traced.  It is impossible to do that, and that is the reason why it is not being done.  In any event I am quite certain that coal merchants who are not importers were not slow to raise the price of coal by the amount of duty if they had coal in stock when the tax was imposed. These things have happened.  We cannot remove the duty and, accordingly, we are not inserting that provision in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks in one breath to-day of being misinformed. In the next moment he protests that from the information received from his own officials he is satisfied that 9/6 is not an excessive profit.  When challenged on that he hastens to add that he speaks entirely as an uninformed man with no views at all.  In the next breath he says he is satisfied that he has more information on this subject than the whole Opposition put together.  Well, &ldquo;you pays your money and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  The Minister contradicts himself bluntly and plainly in four consecutive sentences.  No matter what happens in the hereafter, one of these statements is bound to be true.  The Minister sailed on and said that he is perfectly satisfied that there were infinitely more coal importers in this country than dealers in coal who are not importers.  When the Minister can get up and make an extravagantly absurd statement of that kind and challenge contradiction it is really beyond the beyonds.  There is no shadow of a foundation for that and there is no truth in the suggestion.  Of course the coal dealers are in the vast majority.  The Minister said it was administratively impossible to check the stocks of coal in the hands of <Col N="512" /> retailers in this country.  Has he forgotten that it is only 12 months since twice in rapid succession the Revenue Commissioners undertook to check, and did check, in the case of the tea retailers all their stocks on a certain date?  If my recollection serves me right, they did it twice, and there was no difficulty about it.  The Minister turns round on Deputy Mulcahy and charges him with inconsistency that he has not adhered to the original allegations he made.  He says that coal prices are going up in Belfast and everywhere.  Surely the Minister is mistaken or else it cannot be true that the Minister desires to deceive.  Are not the facts these: That the price of coal is going up in the domestic market in Great Britain, and since we made the coal-cattle pact we have been elevated to the dignity of being part of Great Britain&mdash;the domestic market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that there is an understanding between the British Board of Trade and the Coal Owners' Federation and while they cannot hope to get a certain price for coal abroad they can hope to get it in Great Britain or in any other market like the Saorstát where they enjoy exclusive control?  They enjoy exclusive control in Great Britain inasmuch as freight is to their advantage.  They enjoy exclusive control in this country inasmuch as we have the coal-cattle pact.  They can push up the price of coal in this country indefinitely.  In fact, they can push the price of coal here up to the artificial price obtaining for British coal in Great Britain.  That, undoubtedly, has partially contributed to the rise in the cost of coal.  I want to put one simple fact before the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would get apoplexy if it were put before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average price for coal, according to the Department of Industry and Commerce returns for the month of <Col N="513" /> December, is 25/- per ton.  That is the average price for household coal, c.i.f. all over Ireland.  The price of household coal f.o.r. in six to 50 tons lots in the City of Sligo to-day is 40/-.  Let us assume that Sligo is one of the dear ports, and we will make the price for Sligo 2/- above the average price in order to make allowance for ports such as Waterford, Dublin and Dundalk. Let us say that the c.i.f. price in Sligo on the Department's figures ought to be 27/-.  Does the Minister think that 40/- represents a fair difference between the c.i.f. price for household coal and the f.o.r. price for household coal in Sligo?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be more to the point for the Deputy to tell us what was the actual c.i.f. price in Sligo?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only source of information for a person who is not in the importing trade is the trade statistics supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Those statistics show that the average price for coal over Saorstát Eireann, c.i.f., is 25/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has commercial relations with Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We may reasonably assume that there is a difference of 2/- either way.  Some ports are cheaper; others are dearer.  There cannot be more than 2/- difference in the matter of freight between one port and another on the Irish coast.  Let us assume that Sligo is the dearest port, and that they pay 2/- over the average price for all the other ports in Ireland.  That brings them to 27/-, and that is c.i.f.  You have got to remember that the price of 40/- is f.o.r., which does entail some harbour dues and cost of transport from the boat into the railway waggon.  Is <Col N="514" /> that a fair margin?  It does not appear to me to be a fair margin.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says: &ldquo;Let some citizen bring this matter before the Controller of Prices.&rdquo;  What are we paying the Minister for Industry and Commerce for?  He has £1,000 a year free of tax; he has a free motor-car; he has perquisites. The purpose for which he is there is to look after the industrial and commercial interests of the community in this country.  A reasonable line must be drawn between the personal affairs of individual citizens, and matters which affect the whole community and should, therefore, come within the purview of a Minister of State. Nobody reasonably imagines that the Minister should concern himself about the complaint of a resident in Rathmines that she was charged too much for a pound of plums, or that figs are too dear in Findlater's.  I have no reason to believe that figs are too dear in Findlater's.  I am merely giving that as an illustrative example of what I mean.  Nobody imagines that the Minister should concern himself with a case of that kind.  One would expect that the citizen should make representations to the Prices Controller, who would then look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when a case is so strongly made here that a great evil obtains; when the Executive Council decide to take off the 5/- tax, in order to make their contribution to the mitigation of what they deem to be a great evil; when they have determined to mulct the revenue in a very large annual sum, the least the Minister for Industry and Commerce could do would be, under the Control of Prices Act, to institute an inquiry into the price of coal just as he did into the price of building materials.  The Minister did, in fact, institute an inquiry into the price of building material, and I say that at no time was there ever a stronger case made against the purveyors of building materials in this country than has been made against the distributors of coal. Deputies in this House are inclined to get it into their heads that it is quite a simple thing for citizens to refer a matter of this kind to the Controller of Prices.  It is not.  If you have had <Col N="515" /> long business relations with a firm, and if they get into some kind of ring and are charging you, in common with their other customers, excessive prices, it is not a very pleasant thing to be the individual who drags that firm before the Prices Controller and puts him to the trouble of a price investigation. Men in business do not care about that kind of thing, unless there is a very grave public duty devolving upon them to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Must not the Minister have admitted that there was some serious situation in existence when he recommended the Executive Council to discard the 5/- tax?  Is not that in itself evidence that the Minister knew grave hardships existed?  Surely if he was prepared to do that, he ought to be prepared to make a reference to the Prices Commission to investigate the price of coal generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaints?  Is not every public representative in the country making complaints?  We are all making complaints.  Deputy Moore is making complaints.  Deputy Belton is making complaints.  The Labour Party is making complaints.  Surely the Minister has reached the stage when he has ample justification for referring the whole matter for public investigation by the Prices Commission. If he does that, there is an end to the whole business.  When the matter is investigated by the Prices Commission it is up to those who are suffering from hardship to come forward and give evidence.  If no case can be made, well may the Minister come back and say &ldquo;I have exhausted all the resources at my disposal to find out what this evil is and I can do nothing more for you.&rdquo;  There is one other matter to which I want to direct the attention of the Minister, and it is a very grave matter.  Reference was made here a moment ago to rings, and a suggestion was made that there might be a coal ring in <Col N="516" /> existence.  If there is a coal ring in existence it is not the only ring that is operating in this country at the present time.  I warn the Minister that this business of quotas is giving rise to rings, and it is absolutely impossible for any individual to prove conclusively that there is a coal ring or any other kind of ring. He cannot do it, because all kinds of specious justifications arise.  There is a ring of pharmaceutical chemists of the most vigorous character, which is aimed to destroy the business of hundreds of legitimate merchants in this country.  Is it held out as a ring?  Not at all.  They are combined together for a most pious purpose&mdash;to protect the public.  They are most solicitous lest anybody except a pharmaceutical chemist should sell cod liver oil or dangerous things like Scott's Emulsion.  The fact of it is that it is a ring of pharmaceutical chemists designed to prevent shopkeepers from stocking stuff of which the chemists want to have the monopoly. It is very difficult to prove that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may very well be, but at least it is true that that very kind of reply which the Minister has now made is the strength of the ring. They conceal it under a purpose which they allege is identical with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They seek to identify their ring with the restrictions placed on persons practising medicine or law without authority.  They delude innocent people like the Minister for Finance, and foolish people like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, into supposing it is this kind of ring. We who know the trade know perfectly well that the reason why they want to exclude legitimate merchants from the sale of proprietary goods is that there is a large profit on proprietary goods, and that pharmaceutical chemists want to get that profit.  They want to make some kind <Col N="517" /> of a case which will justify them in forming a ring and keeping all that profit within that ring and denying the right to any other citizen to get it.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the question of a majority verdict.  It was indicated during the Second Reading and again when the Bill was before the House last week that opinions were divided as to the advisability or otherwise of the section.  I stated on the last occasion what I felt was the view of everybody on all sides of the House, that unanimity on verdicts was the most desirable course.  I have been considering the matter since and I have consulted people who have a good deal of experience of the working of the procedure under the Juries Protection Act and also since it was allowed to lapse.  Other speakers on the last occasion expressed views in opposition to a majority verdict.  In these circumstances, I am prepared to see how unanimous verdicts will operate in all these cases and to let them continue in operation.  There is also the consideration that it is hoped that this Bill will be a permanent part of our legislation.  For these reasons I do not propose to press the section.</P>

      <P>Personally I am very sorry to hear from the Minister that these are to be unanimous verdicts.  On the Second Reading debate, I mentioned that the majority verdict is fairer for the administration of justice.  Not merely from the point of view of the prisoner, <Col N="518" /> but from whatever angle you regard it, I think the majority verdict is far and away better than the unanimous verdict.  If you have 12 men, amongst these 12 men you may get a crank, and very often they are cranks who are standing out for convictions where the rest of the jury want acquittals. I think it is a great pity that the cranks should be able to hold up other people.  As far as my view goes, I would have a majority verdict in every class of case, in capital cases as well as in other cases, because I think that the majority verdict is a better and truer verdict as getting at the real facts of the case than a unanimous verdict.  I am very sorry that the Minister is giving up the section, because if there were a division I certainly would have gone into the Lobby to support the section as it stood.</P>

Suppose you sent out a paper, calling on a person to pay a debt, which is printed on blue notepaper. A great many people in this country associate blue notepaper with a writ.

      <P>Well, who is going to decide what form of document is calculated or is reasonably likely to lead the person receiving it to believe that it was issued by lawful authority?  I know plenty of district justices in this country who would hold that a document such as I describe did in fact come within that section if, in fact, a country person were prepared to go into the box and swear that the document did create the impression on his or her mind that it was a document issued by lawful authority.  The existing law is that, if you produce a document which is a forgery or an attempted forgery, you can be prosecuted for doing so.  Is not that so?</P>

I do not see, however, why merchants and other <Col N="523" /> ordinary lay people should be jeopardised by a provision of this kind. I hold that it would be very easy to interpret this in an unfair way in regard to, say, moneylenders&mdash;although I suppose most of us would say that it might be just as well in their case&mdash;but I hold that this could be used against ordinary merchants in the same way.

      <P>The documents to which I have referred were documents furnished by solicitors in the country in regard to cases where, instead of the ordinary proceedings being taken to have the particular debt concerned collected, there was a warning to appear within seven days at the District Court.  Such a document was nothing but an attempt to deceive such people, who would not have had to appear within seven days.  I am sorry that I have not a copy with me at the moment, but it was in order to deal with exactly the same difficulty that a precisely similar enactment was passed in England a short time ago.</P>

      <P>Might I point out to Deputy Dillon that, if he <Col N="524" /> reads sub-section (1) in the light of sub-section (3) he will see that what is made unlawful is the issuing of a document calculated or reasonably likely to lead the person receiving it to believe that it was issued by, from, or by order of any court of justice, or any judge or justice of any such court, or by or from any officer of or office attached to any such court.  That is the kind of document which is aimed at, and I gather from what the Deputy said before he sat down that he is quite satisfied that, if that particular mischief is dealt with, the section covers everything the Deputy has said.  The only documents which are dealt with are documents which are calculated or reasonably likely to lead the person receiving them to believe that they had been issued by, from, or by order of a court of justice, or any judge or justice of any such court, or by any officer of or office attached to any such court.  They are the only documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I understood the Deputy to say that he had no objection to a provision which made it an offence to issue a document which pretended to be a document issued by a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the section is aimed at.  It is aimed at documents calculated or likely to lead a person to believe that the documents had been issued by a court&mdash; documents which purport to come from a court but which actually do not come from a court.  The purpose here is to deal with the type of document the Minister mentioned&mdash;a document which is so cleverly drafted&mdash;although it is not a duplicate or copy of any official form of summons at present in existence&mdash;as to lead an ignorant person receiving it to believe that the document does emanate from a court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem to me that a person who receives a document ought to be able to judge as to whether or not the document comes from a court.  If the person concerned is a person familiar with summonses he will recognise what is the nature of the document, but a person may get another class of document, such as a notice from some collecting agency, like Stubbs', or something of that kind, and that document says that legal proceedings will be taken in the future.  That is a perfectly clear document. There seems to be, however, a kind of half-way house between the two kinds of documents, and that half-way house, so to speak, seems to be where somebody sends out a document which purports to be more than a demand and which might lead a person to believe that legal proceedings would be taken.  I cannot, for the life of me, see why any person carrying on his business in the ordinary way should not be satisfied with sending out notices in the form used by ordinary collecting agencies, and if somebody departs from that form and wishes to have a particular form of his own conveying a threat, he is doing it for some sinister purpose and, in that connection, I do not think that this section goes one word too far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one point on the section.  I suggest that certain words should be cut out in order to make the intention clear.  If the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; were to be interpreted as meaning in the mind of the person sending the document then it would be all right, but when you go on to say &ldquo;is reasonably likely&rdquo; and put that in apposition to the intention on the part of the person sending it, I think it is going too far.  I understand that the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; has not an interpretation strictly of reference to the person sending it but that it goes beyond it.  In any event, &ldquo;reasonably likely&rdquo; does not carry it any further.  I do not know whether the Minister wants to get at every document which in fact does mislead but which was not intended to mislead.</P>

I respectfully disagree with Deputy McGilligan because I think the Attorney-General's view is the correct one.  That is, if a document is in itself calculated in the opinion of the court to create the impression that it has emanated from official sources, it would constitute an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 81 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 118:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 30, before Section 82, but in Part VII of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In any criminal proceedings, cause or matter it shall be within the power and discretion of the court to direct that the costs of or incident to such proceedings or any part of such costs shall be paid by the prosecutor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to enable the court in hearing a criminal charge to give costs in proper cases in favour of the person who is accused and who is acquitted of the offence of which he has been charged.  The amendment which I have drafted would cover proceedings in the District Court as well as with cases which are heard on indictment.  There are many cases in which the police bring proceedings, and in which they <Col N="527" /> fail to establish the charge, and yet the defendant has to pay the costs of his defence.  I think it is only right and proper that there should be a discretion in the court in proper cases to give to persons who have been charged with an offence and against whom the judge or jury think that the charge should never have been brought, the costs of their defence.  The normal case is a case where a man is charged with an offence under the Road Traffic Act.  In proceedings of that character, whether before a justice or a jury, the defendant is put to tremendous expense.  Almost in 99¾ per cent. of these cases it is a virtual certainty that there will be an acquittal, and yet the accused has to bear the cost of his defence.  The insurance companies do not as a rule pay the expense of criminal proceedings.  A man charged with the offence of manslaughter has to pay the expenses out of his own pocket although everybody connected with the case knows that there can be only one result.  In indictable cases, certainly, where a man may be called upon to provide 50 or 60 guineas for his defence there should be discretion in the court to direct that the costs of the proceedings shall be borne by the prosecutor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>This involves a big question of policy.  It is a reversal of the present practice under which an accused person is not allowed to recover any costs.  In answer to what Deputy Costello has stated, I may say that there is this much justification for the practice, that before any case of an indictable offence goes to a judge and jury, it has passed through the hands of the district justice who has satisfied himself or ought to have satisfied himself that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case to be answered, which means that in any event the prosecution of the accused is justified.  Deputy Costello, I suppose, will answer that this new section proposes to leave the matter in the discretion of the court and that it is only in cases where the court would hold that there was no reasonable ground for bringing the charge or pursuing it, that the judge would order the costs <Col N="528" /> to be paid by the prosecution.  I do not think the Minister is disposed to accept this far-reaching amendment. It seems to be more appropriate to a criminal justice administration Bill. One difficulty, of course, is an estimate of the expense it would involve. There are an enormous number of prosecutions, and if such a section were to be enforced and the judges were to be any way generous with costs to accused persons, it might involve a burden upon the Exchequer which would be very serious.  I do not think the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Attorney-General appears to me to be opposing the amendment, not with any great sincerity or not with any great belief that the amendment should be rejected.  It appears to me that the Attorney-General was speaking against his own better judgment.  He did bring forward an argument which I think did not carry any weight.  I do not think it carried much weight with the Attorney-General himself. Deputy Costello is not aiming at every class of case.  He is aiming at certain classes of cases.  There are cases we know which come before the district justice, and if the district justice were to try these cases himself, he would dismiss them without any hesitation. But the Attorney-General knows that the district justice cannot weigh the evidence and, though he may hear the defence put forward, if there is any case at all made by the prosecution, no matter how weak, he must send it forward for trial.  If I take the ordinary case of an alibi, the district justice cannot go into the truth of the alibi at all.  There is a considerable number of cases that the district justice sends forward for trial when he knows a jury will acquit the accused.  If he were the primary tribunal, if it came within his jurisdiction, he would not hesitate for one moment to acquit.  It is that extreme class of case that Deputy Costello is aiming at.  He is not aiming at having a general principle that in every case in which a prisoner is acquitted he should get his costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misread me if he thinks I was not serious in my defence of the Minister's attitude.  I do suggest that it would be quite unreasonable to ask the State to bear the costs of the accused in the cases which he has instanced.  The law at present makes a certain thing an offence.  The Guards get evidence which they are satisfied justifies a prosecution.  It may possibly be put before me, in the first instance, and proceedings are sanctioned.  They are instituted on the ground that apparently, from the material in the possession of the Guards, a breach of the law has been committed.  The Guards then take the formal step of bringing the case before the district justice and present the evidence.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is right in pointing out that the district justice cannot weigh the evidence, cannot listen to the defence or consider an alibi, and is only concerned with the question whether, on the facts as presented by the prosecution, a jury would be entitled to convict. In pursuance of his duty as circumscribed by the law at the moment he sends the accused forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest it would be a wholly unreasonable thing that the State, which is acting merely in accordance with the requirements of the law, should be called upon to pay the costs of an accused person who ultimately succeeds in satisfying a jury that he has an answer to the charge which, on the evidence before the prosecutor and the district justice, justified them in bringing him there.  I do not think Deputy Costello was aiming at that type of case at all.  I thought he was aiming at a case which the judge would be of opinion ought never to have been brought at all.  There are the rare cases where a mistake is made by the Guards in estimating the effect of the evidence before them or where the Guards or the prosecution, including the Attorney-General as well, do not take sufficient care to investigate the evidence and satisfy themselves that it is evidence which ought not to be further tested before being put forward by them as a responsible prosecution. In that type of case, where there has been omission to test and carefully to <Col N="530" /> examine the material at their disposal before they initiate proceedings, the judge, when eventually the case comes before him, if it gets past the district justice, should be entitled to punish the prosecution for beginning proceedings which, if they had taken proper care in examining their materials, they would never have brought.  I see some case for that and I thought that was Deputy Costello's argument; but I would not agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that in the ordinary case where the State is merely doing its duty, it should be liable to be cast in costs at the end.</P>

      <P>From a very limited experience I could give quite a number. I have heard judges say that the District Courts or some persons behind the District Courts, seem to have taken the line that wherever there is a road accident there must be a prosecution. If we have selected people for their judgment and if we gave them positions as judges and prevented them from being torn down from that position by people who, like the Attorney-General, from time to time think they should not be there, and that we have to tolerate them, we should be prepared to respect their judgment. The Attorney-General will surely agree that there are cases where undoubtedly it is an extreme hardship on a person <Col N="531" /> to have to stand his trial and get a verdict in his favour and then be faced with a bill for 50 or 60 guineas.  It is not a thing anybody could defend.  The Attorney-General asks where will you draw the line.  The amendment does draw the line.  Leave it to the courts and, if necessary, strengthen that phrase.</P>
      <P>There is a class of case that should be covered, where men are put to the ignomy of standing in the dock and put to the cost of defending themselves. There have been quite a number of cases at the Criminal Sessions that are just proceeding where directions have been got.  The number is beyond the average.  If the Attorney-General thinks the proposal is not sufficient, let him put some other check upon what he would probably consider the rather wide scope of this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a discussion in which, it seems to me, a layman would be more competent to decide the question at issue than lawyers.  The question is really one of natural justice. As is observable by anyone listening to the course of the discussion for the last quarter of an hour, it is obvious that lawyers have been assuming that a certain custom exists, and that the custom is more or less right.  The custom is that when a person is brought to trial, put in the dock and put to the expense of defending himself, in the great majority of cases even though he is acquitted he would not get his costs. That is the custom&mdash;no matter what costs he has been put to and no matter how slender the case against him is. If he succeeds in getting a verdict of acquittal he is never entitled to his costs.  That seems to me to be a most inequitable system.  We can visualise a case in which a man is wrongly put in the dock&mdash;I do not say improperly.  But a case is brought against him.  Assume a case in which a man is in fact innocent, he must go to great trouble in defending himself and in satisfying a jury that a verdict of guilty should not be brought against him.  That is the type of case that Deputy Costello had in mind in moving this amendment.  It is merely a matter of justice that when <Col N="532" /> the State fails to make a case against that man he should be given his costs.</P>
      <P>Speaking from the point of view of natural justice, without putting it much further, I would say that in every case in which the State fails to get a verdict of guilty it should pay the costs of the prisoner, who is put to the trouble and expense of defending himself. I do not say that I have had a great deal of experience in this matter. Lawyers are not the proper people to decide this question.  They have been working under the old custom for years. This discussion should take place in a full Dáil, and with a full Dáil I have no doubt that Deputy Costello's amendment would be carried by 90 per cent.</P>

      <P>Before it is withdrawn there is one question which I wish to raise, that is, a question which has been troubling me and which caused me to put down this amendment.  My question is: In considering whether or not particular members of the Gárda Síochána are effective in their duties, is the number of prosecutions brought by a Gárda taken into consideration by the authorities?  I conceive that prosecutions are brought by the Gárda, which ought not be brought, in District Courts.  It is in reference to that class of case that this amendment has been framed.  Is the position that in practice each member of the Gárda is supposed to bring a number of prosecutions every week or month, or in the course of any particular time in order to be considered an efficient officer?  If that is the case there is a necessity for some such provision as this.  I would like to have some assurance as to whether this matter is taken into account in considering the efficiency of a Gárda&mdash;the number of prosecutions he has brought in a given time?</P>

      <P>I understood the Deputy to say that district justices had wrongly taken the view that these proceedings should not be brought. Justices have made that pronouncement from the bench.  They seem to have forgotten that it was generally the case, until recent years, that where the fact that he was responsible for a death was brought home to a particular individual a prosecution had to be taken.  It was only in recent years that the rule was departed from that in every case where a man met his death by violence, the author of the violence should be brought before the court.  That system was departed from&mdash;I am not sure that it was not in Deputy Costello's time.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It was then laid down that each case should be examined, the prospects of a conviction weighed up, and the question be considered as to whether there was <i>prima facie</i><Col N="534" /> evidence to justify the finding that the person responsible for the death was guilty of criminal negligence.  That should be considered before the criminal proceedings were instituted. Deputy Costello when Attorney-General made an order that that should be the practice for the future.  I followed that rule.  There are no statistics, as far as I remember, at the moment.  But I stated previously on some other section of the Bill that as high as 50 per cent. of the cases did not go on. Deputy Lavery referred to the fact. He seemed to think that we prosecuted everybody.  I am speaking of fatal accidents.  In England recently they have reversed the old decision, which laid down the principle to which I have referred.  The practice which Deputy Costello and I followed has been justified by the House of Lords reversing what had been done previously namely that in every such case prosecutions were brought.  As regards other injuries, I cannot remember that there are any statistics available on this point.  Perhaps Deputy McGilligan would make clear what his point is.</P>

      <P>The amendment might be more properly considered under another Bill.  Is there another Bill under consideration?  It struck me when the Attorney-General was speaking that he referred to the great cost that would fall upon the State if this amendment were passed.  The cost that falls upon individuals in those cases falls upon them much more heavily than the burden which falls upon the State. If it is a matter that excites some consideration for the State surely the individual is also entitled to some consideration. If the amendment is withdrawn would the Minister consider it between this and the Report Stage?  I recollect one case in which a very large amount was fixed as bail.  The jury stopped the case.  When what is called a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made against a person in the lower court, surely it is unfair in the first place that <Col N="535" /> he should be kept in custody and put to the expense of making his defence, and when the jury stop the case he is still faced with the expense of the case. I certainly think that unless the Minister is prepared to consider it we will have to challenge a division on the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will answer Deputy Costello who asked me whether a Criminal Justice Administration Bill was under contemplation. Such a Bill is under contemplation, and has been under contemplation for some time, owning to the rather confused position with regard to a number of old Acts and so on. It is a very big question, and it has been considered by the Department <Col N="536" /> for some time.  It will have to be examined by experts before the Bill is brought in, so it will take some time before it can be introduced.  It is considered desirable that such a Bill should be introduced in order to try and co-ordinate the law and bring it into a more up-to-date form.  When the Bill is being brought in I would be prepared to consider this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 120:</P>
      <P>In page 30, before Section 82, but in Part VII of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the requirements of any statute, rule of law or practice and notwithstanding any agreement contained in any instrument authorising a reference to arbitration, whether made before or after the passing of this Act, by which an award on such reference is made a condition precedent to liability, no court or judge shall stay or dismiss any action, suit or other proceeding founded on any matter coming within the terms of such reference unless such court or judge is satisfied that such matter, having regard to the questions of law or fact involved, can be more cheaply, expeditiously and satisfactorily determined by means of arbitration than by such action, suit or proceeding.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is really put down to draw the attention of the Minister to the very unsatisfactory position in which the law relating to arbitration in this country is at the present moment.  I think the amendment only precariously survived the Ceann Comhairle's axe from the point of view of its being in order.  But it has survived it, and I am glad of an opportunity of bringing to the Minister's attention the highly unsatisfactory nature of the law of arbitration. The law of arbitration in England has been amended several times, and particularly by a recent Act.  We are relying for our whole code of arbitration on the one or two sections of the <Col N="537" /> common law procedure Acts.  Particularly in contracts of assurance there is a clause inserted that all disputes and differences are to be referred to arbitration.  The further provision is usually if not invariably added that arbitration is to be a condition precedent to a right of action in the courts.  In effect that clause means nothing more than this&mdash;that if a private person has a dispute with an insurance company he must go to arbitration; in other words he must drop his dispute, because arbitration proceedings cost him far more than appropriate proceedings would in the High Court.  Some people have an extraordinary reverence for arbitration, ousting the jurisdiction of the courts.  In fact I think everybody who has experience of arbitration proceedings, ousting the jurisdiction of the courts, knows they cost far more than a similar action in the High Courts.  That weapon is used by big insurance companies to put an end to disputes, and to stop people from bringing cases.  The people are not able to start arbitration proceedings and they are not able to find out what the result of the arbitration proceedings is when they are over, because it is well known that nobody can find out what the result of arbitration proceedings is until they have paid the costs of the arbitrator and the umpire.  They have got, as the phrase is, to lift the award, and they will not lift the award unless as a condition precedent they pay the costs of the arbitrator and the umpire and their respective solicitors.  Consequently it is almost impossible for a poor person to find out the result of arbitration.</P>
    <P>I myself had a case about 18 months ago, and at the present moment I do not know what was the result of the arbitration.  My client is not able to put up the money, and I have a very shrewd suspicion that the umpire has decided against me; consequently I am not going to advise my client to risk £200 for the purpose of allowing the insurance company, which forced us to arbitration, to discover the result themselves at our expense.  I think that is a very unsatisfactory <Col N="538" /> state of affairs.  The object of the amendment is to enable the courts to seize possession of every dispute unless the court is satisfied that arbitation proceedings are in the circumstances a more suitable method of trying the issue.  There are certain issues that can perhaps be better tried by arbitration proceedings than before the courts&mdash;technical matters like building contracts, matters arising out of engineering contracts and things of that kind&mdash;but the normal dispute should be tried in the normal tribunal. What I seek to effect by this amendment is that the courts should have the right to say in respect of each dispute: &ldquo;We consider that this dispute can be more appropriately tried in the courts by the normal procedure than by arbitration procedure.&rdquo;  It is in order to leave the matter at the discretion of the court that I seek to have this amendment inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather serious amendment to introduce into this Bill.  As the Deputy says, it really affects insurance companies more than any other body or person.  I myself would have felt inclined to agree with the Deputy with regard to his amendment No. 119, which the Chair has ruled out of order and which the Deputy judiciously dealt with in his speech on this amendment No. 120.  There seemed to be a good deal of force in this contention that there should be power in the arbitrator to award costs.  When this matter was raised by the Deputy on the Second Reading&mdash;I think I was then in charge of the Bill&mdash;I said that I thought his proposal as then put forward in his Second Reading speech was a matter which ought to be dealt with in a separate Bill dealing with arbitration.  I do not know whether the Minister is undertaking to bring in such a Bill.  It would, in my opinion, be a very good thing if we had a Bill to remedy all the defects in the law as regards arbitration.  As the Deputy pointed out, we are depending on the common law procedure Acts in this country for our arbitration procedure, and I think that the Bar Council recommended that something should be done to amend <Col N="539" /> the law generally as regards arbitration. As regards amendment No. 120, it seems to me that one difficulty would be to have a standard for deciding as to whether the questions of law or fact involved can be more cheaply, expeditiously and satisfactorily determined by means of arbitration than by such action, suit, or proceeding. It cannot be denied, I think, that arbitration is popular with certain persons.  Some people prefer to have their disputes decided by arbitrators. As the Deputy knows, it has become common form in policies of insurance that there should be a reference to arbitration before a dispute between parties is taken into court.  There have been strong objections to that, but it has been accepted as a normal provision in insurance policies.</P>
      <P>There are obvious reasons why insurance companies should prefer arbitration. Very frequently insurance companies are afraid of publicity.  They are afraid of having disputes in which they are involved with assured persons litigated in court lest, perchance, they get the name of being a litigious company and that thereby their goodwill with the public might suffer. While that may lead to companies disputing cases which they ought not to dispute, it seems to me that it does allow the decent, reputable insurance company to have their dispute when they are sometimes reasonably justified in challenging a claim on behalf of the assured thrashed out before an arbitrator with the privacy which accompanies arbitration.  The amendment seems to me practically to wipe out arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment is carried, it will practically wipe out arbitration as a means of settling disputes.  I wonder if it is justifiable for the Dáil to take such a serious decision of policy on an amendment at the tail-end of a Bill dealing with the Courts of Justice.  I imagine it would require a good deal more consideration than can be given to it <Col N="540" /> now as part of this Bill to take such a decision.</P>
      <P>I do not think any attention has been drawn to this particular section by any of the persons who considered the Bill, because this amendment did not appear until a late stage.  I imagine that had that amendment appeared as part of the Bill originally put forward by the Minister, we would have had a great deal of discussion and that some persons who were interested in preserving arbitration as a means of settling disputes would have made their voices heard.  I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to meet the Deputy on it or not, but I suggest that it is a matter in which we should walk with caution.  I do not think that it would be justifiable to take this summary method of wiping out arbitration without allowing to be heard those bodies or persons who are interested in having the method of arbitration preserved as a normal way of settling disputes.</P>

      <P>In page 30, before Section 83, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927 (No. 15 of 1927), is hereby amended by the insertion after the words &ldquo;justice of the District Court&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;or a judge of the Circuit Court whether on an application made directly to him or by way of appeal from any order of a justice of the District Court refusing such consent&rdquo; and by the addition at the end of the subsection of the words &ldquo;and such consent shall not be refused on any grounds other than a ground put forward and substantiated in evidence by such officer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will probably realise the object of this amendment. The power of granting what are known as occasional licences rests at the moment on a very slender and somewhat peculiar foundation.  They are granted under Section 13 of the <Col N="541" /> Revenue Act, 1862, not by a district justice, not by a judge of any kind, but by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who give an occasional licence, and what was required, before the passage of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, was the consent of two justices of the peace in writing, not in open court, but anywhere given at all.  The Act of 1927 merely provided that the consent that was required by the Act of 1862 should be given by a district justice after hearing an officer of the Gárda Síochána.  That went a certain distance on the road I wish to travel, but not far enough.  I cannot see any reason why this power should not be vested, as every power, practically speaking, under the licensing code is vested, in a judicial person or authority. It is true that it is only really machinery, but some time or another the Revenue Commissioners will refuse to obey an order of a district justice or of a Circuit Court judge and then the band will begin to play.</P>
    <P>We had a very good example of that recently, because one district justice, who, for some peculiar reasons personal to himself, declined to give an occasional licence for a particular function, has been repeatedly reversed on appeal by a Circuit Court judge and has refused to follow the reasoning or decision of the Circuit Court judge.  Why cannot the Revenue Commissioners also do the same thing and say: &ldquo;Notwithstanding that the Circuit Court judge has given this decision, we agree with this district justice and we will not give this occasional licence&rdquo;?  What I want to ensure by this amendment is that an application for an occasional licence will be regulated by judicial proceedings and that it will be made before a judicial personage and decided upon judicial grounds.  I put in here that the district justice is to decide for or against an occasional licence on a ground that will be put forward by the officer of the Gárda Síochána in charge of the place in respect of which the licence is asked for.  At present, district justices are open to consent or refuse to consent on grounds that appeal to themselves personally, or <Col N="542" /> their own personal privileges.  I think they should not be entitled to do that sort of thing and to use the Bench for the propagation of their personal views, but that they should act on evidence before them, the same as they have to do in every other case.  They should not air their own private views, as one man has done, disregarding the decision of a circuit judge on appeal. I want it to be entirely judicial both by the district justice, when hearing the case originally, and by the Circuit Court judge on appeal.  I think this amendment ought to be accepted, because it puts it into the power of a district justice and he must act on the evidence given to him by the officer of the Gárda Síochána.  I think we can trust the officer of the Gárda Síochána to give the district justice a clear view of his opinion on the circumstances of the area in which the occasional licence is required.</P>

    <P>This has reference to the question of appeal in County Cork, and my object in moving this amendment on behalf of Deputy O'Donovan, is to provide that the town of Bantry be added as one of the appeal towns in the County of Cork.  I need not tell the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice that Bantry is a very important place. It was well-known long before Wolfe Tone came to Bantry Bay.  It is mentioned in the Ossianic Tales as a place where Finn MacCool hunted in the old days and it is also mentioned in the old glossary of Cormac Mac-Cullinean and its name is wedded to a haunting air and a beautiful song, &ldquo;Bantry Bay.&rdquo;  All these facts, I am sure, are well-known to Ministers and Deputies on the other side.  However, to come down to the important thing: Bantry is 60 miles west of Cork City, and west of that is Castletown-Bere, whose name is linked up for all time with Donal Cam O'Sullivan.  It would be about 33 miles west of Bantry, and back of that there is a wild expanse of country&mdash;probably 16 miles&mdash;and I consider it would be an outrageous thing to compel people from that part of the country to go to Cork City to have their appeals tried in view of the fact that Bantry is well provided with <Col N="546" /> a good courthouse and good accommodation of every kind and is within a very measurable distance of the beautiful place known as Glengariff.</P>
    <P>Under these circumstances, I am sure that this amendment will be accepted by the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General.  I make a very strong appeal to them at this point, not only because Bantry is a place of considerable importance but on account of its distance from Cork City&mdash;Mizzen Head, I take it, would be about 80 miles from Cork City&mdash; it is about 40 miles from Bantry. What is more, I am assured by lawyers in that part of the country that they will provide an excellent library and that they are prepared to give every facility that could be of assistance to the lawyers and people using the court.  Under these circumstances, I am sure that the Minister and the Attorney-General will consider my amendment sympathetically.</P>

      <P>Well, the county town is now being made the appeal town in the case of every county, and Cork City seems to be the natural place in connection with the County Cork.  Apart from that, I do not think that the people in Cork City would be very pleased to have this taken away from their city.  I do not know if the Deputy wants to have two or not.</P>

      <P>I just want to mention that the various amendments to which I have promised to give consideration have been considered and will be dealt with on the Fourth Stage which will take some little time. Since this stage of the bill was taken, further representations have been made to me.  Amongst these representations is one that an amendment should be inserted in the Bill dealing <Col N="547" /> with robes and modes of dress&mdash;the robes of judges and barristers practising in the courts.  I have not had an opportunity of considering the matter fully and I am only referring to it now so that, if it can be raised on the next stage of the Bill, Deputies will have notice of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the observations of the Minister, does he feel inclined to give us any further information as to the nature of the representations which are engaging his attention?  That is one question.  My second question has to deal with the fact that I attempted at an earlier stage in Committee, before the re-committal, to raise the general question of District Court clerks' pensions. I do not think the Minister found time to refer to that question specifically.  This Bill does provide for pensions for district justices, but it was not open to me to put down an amendment to grant pensions to clerks because that would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  I should be glad to know whether the Minister has considered that question and whether he has any plans for establishing these public servants now or hereafter and if he has, has he any idea of the terms he intends to propose for their establishment?  I think what happened when I raised the matter before was that the Attorney-General who was in charge of the Bill at the time said that it was a matter more for the Minister.  Possibly I was not here at the appropriate time, subsequently, to raise it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of these men were offered establishment before and some of them have got establishment. As the Deputy realises, the great majority of these District Court clerks are not in full time positions and it is very difficult to arrange about establishing them.  If a court clerk is established he can be transferred from one place to another, being a civil servant.  We may find unless we try to amalgamate the various District Court areas, that the great majority after they have been established are people who have only two or three days' work in the week.  Some of them are farmers or farmers' sons and some are business people.  I think if the Deputy makes inquiries he will find that there are very few places where District Court clerks want establishment.  The offer was made to them and only a very limited number availed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any means of giving them some information as to what the nature of their remuneration will be for all time?  It seems that the present arrangement is something of a temporary character in which men are on a salary and which they have no certain information as to whether these salaries are graded in the belief that sooner or later some pension proposals will be brought forward.  Is it the intention of the Minister to say that such clerks as apply for establishment and get it will be pensionable officers and that such clerks as do not apply for establishment or do not get it must accept their salaries as salaries which do not contemplate any pension? <Col N="549" /> Would the Minister propose to make permanent the existing scale of salaries on the assumption that there is going to be a pension attached?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect that an established clerk who had pension rights would not receive as high a salary as an unestablished clerk who has no pension rights.  In other words, that an unestablished clerk would receive a somewhat larger salary than a clerk who is established and who can look forward to a pension.</P>

      <P>So if any case arises where a District Court clerk doing similar work is being paid less than another clerk and if he brings his case to the notice of the Minister he will sponsor it with the Department of Finance?  The Minister nods affirmatively. I want to have that recorded.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister and that is the grave injustice meted out to jurors.  Deputy McGovern referred to the matter here on the last night but, unfortunately, he did not stand up to challenge a division.  The farmers are brought in sometimes for a whole fortnight to serve on juries in the courts.  We have spent five or six months making generous provision for judges and justices and I think it is about time that we should give some consideration to jurors.  I should like if the Minister would bring forward some sort of proposal on the Report Stage to compensate jurors in some way for their time and trouble.  Will he accept an amendment of that nature?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about rings that were promoted by the Ministers of this State for the exploitation of the consumers of this country.  I have dealt with the rings and hope to deal with them frequently on future occasions.  Rings and licences are two matters with which I propose to deal at some length at a no far distant date. In conclusion, I want to say a word about the country distributors of coal who have been denied the benefits of the Bill at present before us.  The attention of the Minister may have been directed to the situation which developed in Letterkenny and in Donegal where the local distributors found themselves temporarily without coal.  The result of that was that the people suffered considerably.  Warned by that example, a number of coal distributors in the West of Ireland apprehended that with the approaching strike in the British coal mines and the coal-cattle pact being in operation, a difficulty might arise unless stocks were laid in, and, accordingly, stocks of 50 and 60 tons of coal were laid in by merchants in a moderate way of business. <Col N="551" /> The stocks of coal were not delivered at their respective stations before the Minister took off the 5/- a ton tax. That was a gesture welcomed by everybody, but he must realise that a small distributor of coal who loses 5/- a ton on 60 tons of coal has suffered a very heavy loss, and, in my opinion, has suffered a loss which will exceed the total profit which he might legitimately expect to make on the entire consignment of coal.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that a man in a small way distributing coal is making £3 a week.  It is not a small thing to walk in one morning and take five weeks' income off a trader.  He has no recourse but to go to whatever savings he has and spend them to tide him over the period of difficulty.  In Dáil Eireann, where we are all pretty comfortably provided for, £15 is a bagatelle.  When we spent most of our time talking in millions, £15 sounds nothing, but it sounds an awful lot in Ballybofey, Letterkenny, Ballaghadereen and Kilcar, and may mean a serious loss to the individual who loses it.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider whether there is not some way to assess, broadly, the loss of these distributors and to make some kind of <i>ex gratia</i> grant to compensate them for the injury which he apparently unwittingly did them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to my manufacturer.  No manufacturer complained to me about the price, but a manufacturer did complain to General Mulcahy.  He complained that the difference in price which he had been quoted, both direct from the colliery and from the coal importer, amounting to 9/6, was an undue difference.  Looking over the Trade Returns for the last four or five years, I find that the price of coal imported during the year 1935 was lower than any of the other three years, with the exception of 1934, and 1933, as to a fraction.  It was 26.34 in 1930; 26.1 in 1931; 24.22 in 1932; 22.02 in 1933, 20.52 in 1934; and 22.6 in 1935. That figure does not indicate any reason for the advance that has taken place in the price of coal in recent <Col N="552" /> months.  If there were more than 5/- a ton added on by importers, there ought to have been a bigger reduction than 5/- when the tax was taken off. It is said that there are great practical difficulties in searching out all the coal upon which duty is being paid and restoring to all the persons who have coal in stock, upon which duty has been paid, 5/- per ton.  There is no such difficulty found in the case of an income-tax payer whom the Revenue Commissioners are after in connection with any item of profit he makes in his business.  If a man in business happens to have a few hundred pounds on deposit, and does not return it in his profits, he is liable to a fine.</P>
      <P>If a man employs a person who should be registered in respect of National Health Insurance or Unemployment Insurance and does not pay, there is machinery for getting after him; if a bookmaker does not return a wagering transation, there is machinery for getting after him; and if a man has not a light on his bicycle or a tail-light on his car, there is machinery for getting after him.  But here, where the State wants to reimburse people in respect of money they have taken from them in a particular day, there are almost imsuperable administrative difficulties in restoring that money, except to a certain class.  It so happens that I know one trader&mdash;he is not in my constituency and he is not an importer of coal&mdash;who had 60 tons of coal.  He has either got to forfeit the 5/- or to charge it.  If he charges it, it is unfair in the special circumstances of the case; if he forfeits it, he does so because he stocked up his place at a particular time in order to prevent his customers being charged any increase that might arise out of this increased cost which we are told is going to come in connection with the price of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that there was a ring here some years ago.  When that ring was here, people were paying less for coal than they are paying now.  That is a ring of colliery owners.  It apparently does not affect the consumer which is the main question at issue. There is, of course, a great danger <Col N="553" /> that, in the light of this discussion, we will have a leading article in the Government newspaper in the morning about sabotage.  It was the public attention that was directed to this cost that persuaded the Ministry that they would have to take off the tax.  They have to go a step further.  It is their business, and the business of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to see that there is not an undue price charged to the ordinary consumer. Personally, I have no faith whatever in the Prices Commission.  The one single report that they issued last year satisfied me that if ever there was a joke of a commission in this country, it is it, and I think the Minister realises that himself.  In any case, assuming that it were the proper tribunal to go before, the Minister's statement here this evening, is sufficient to prevent anybody going to it, followed as it was by that most illuminating and lucid observation of his&mdash;it was a matter about which he knew nothing.</P>

      <P>I suppose on any public question he would be an optimist who expected consistency from the Opposition, and I do not think any of us on this side of the House were foolish enough to anticipate that they would display that golden quality on this question of coal.  Deputy Cosgrave has said that it was public attention compelled the withdrawal of the coal tax.  May I deny that at once?  As soon as it became clear from the revenue returns that this year's Budget would balance without it being necessary to collect the tax over the full year, steps were taken to abolish the emergency duty.</P>

      <P>It was possibly in anticipation of that that certain Deputies began to interest themselves in this question of coal.  But the Deputies who did manifest some concern in regard to this matter did, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out, direct their public discussions to the price which <Col N="554" /> was being charged for the coal and we had letters and verbose statements in the Press, all directed to prove that there had been excessive profiteering in this commodity during the latter part of last year and the earlier part of this.  They told us that there was, in fact, no shortage of coal in Dublin or in the country.  They told us that the merchants were holding up supplies&mdash;the merchants, the people who retail coal to the ordinary consumer&mdash; in order that they might exact an inflated price for the commodity.  But to-day we have not heard a word from the Opposition about the alleged unjust prices that were being charged for coal during the earlier part of January. To-day all the clamour of the Opposition has been to put into the pocket of the alleged profiteers an extra 5/- a ton.  That was what Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Dillon, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy have been crying for.</P>

      <P>Because it did feel, that if it did not want the money, the poor people particularly ought to secure the benefit of the remission of duty at the earliest possible moment. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out that when one proceeds to abolish a tax it is generally necessary to give prolonged notice in order to enable people to clear their stocks.  But we were aware that, owing to the position which had been created in Great Britain by the threat of a strike, it was possibly difficult for the poor in Dublin, and in other urban centres where alternative fuels are not easily available, to buy coal.  And instead of giving the ordinary prolonged notice, instead of deferring action as normally action might have been deferred until the introduction of the Budget, it was felt that something should be done and could be done to ensure that if the duty were remitted immediately the benefit would be passed on to the poor.  From whom do the poor in general in the cities buy their coal?  They buy it from the bellman and the bellman in general buys it here from a registered importer and, therefore, if we could make arrangements to refund to the registered coal importer the duty on the stocks which he held on the date on which the duty was remitted, the coal importer would be able immediately to give the bellman the benefit of the reduction and the bellman would be able to pass that benefit on to his poor customers.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out that in most of the country towns there are other sources of fuel available&mdash; there is timber and there is turf.  It is not so in our big cities and towns.  We were justified in doing that on another ground.  In order to prevent a situation developing here in 1936 similar to that which had developed in 1926, as soon as a strike was threatened, the registered importers were asked to stock up to the full extent of their ability and <Col N="556" /> they were carrying&mdash;the registered importers&mdash;possibly abnormal stocks at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And some merchants were carrying heavy stocks at that time, but they were not carrying them in order that the coal might be available to the whole community in time of emergency; they were carrying heavy stocks in order to make a scarcity profit.  There was, therefore, this obligation so far as the registered importers were concerned, that if they were carrying abnormal stocks we should have to see that they, having done what they were requested to do to try to safeguard us against the consequences of a strike, should be indemnified for their action.  That is the second reason, and I think that these two were convincing reasons, but that cannot be said with regard to the ordinary merchant.  Many of these merchants had fairly substantial stocks and when this coal duty was imposed in the first instance, in July, 1932, these people got the benefit of the appreciation in coal prices which then took place.  They made a profit when the duty went on and if they have lost anything now when the duty has gone off, on the whole the balance is even.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Bennett was speaking he asked why should we compel these people to sell coal at a loss, and I asked the Deputy did he mean actually that a merchant sold coal now when the 5/- a ton went off so that there was a net loss on the transaction.  The Deputy refused to affirm that statement.  The reason was that if he did he would simply be contradicting what Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Cosgrave, the leader of his Party, had just said.  Their whole contention was that the profit which a merchant makes on coal is much more than 5/- a ton.  Deputies Mulcahy and Cosgrave have both been appalled by the fact that it is alleged that coal is imported here c.i.f. at 24/- a ton and is delivered to customers at 33/6 a ton. There is only a difference of 9/6 a ton. <Col N="557" /> I am very sorry that Deputy Cosgrave has left, and I am equally sorry that Deputy Mulcahy has left, because they seemed to think that a gross profit of 9/6 a ton on the transaction was an exorbitant profit.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon agrees with that or not.</P>

      <P>Well, he washed them, and I suppose Deputy Dillon on occasion has washed his hands of the whole dirty past of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  He has nothing to do with the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  But the sins of the Cumann na nGaedheal are the sins of Fine Gael. I think Deputy Bennett was in the House in 1926 and at that time there were some transactions in coal.  They were not very profitable transactions. At the Public Accounts Committee for three or four years a great deal of discussion went on about these transactions. Deputy Bennett will remember that on occasions he talked of Polish coal.  Recently the air has been full of lamentations because we are not able to burn Polish coal or German coal. Members of the Opposition in 1933, however, were protesting strongly about the inequity of asking householders to burn rubbish from the Continent.  But in 1926 there was imported from the Continent what might be truthfully described as rubbish.  We remember that there were a couple of explosions down along the public quays because of this coal from the Continent.  On a number of occasions people were gassed by the emanations from it. Whatever we might think about German coal coming in here in 1933 and part of 1934 it, at any rate, was a combustible commodity and it was certainly superior to what was imported in 1926.  Deputy Mulcahy seemed to think that 9/6 a ton was <Col N="558" /> an exorbitant profit to be made on the sale of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1926 Deputy Mulcahy had been driven into the wilderness.  He was not then sitting on the same bench as Deputy McGilligan, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am not at all certain that Deputy Mulcahy was a very zealous member of the Party to which Deputy Bennett then belonged.  At any rate, when the question of these coal transactions came to be considered before the Public Accounts Committee we discovered that the profit per ton which the then Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to allow to members of the Coal Importers' Association on the sale of cargoes which were imported with the backing of the Government was not 9/6 per ton but 22/- a ton.  The Government took all the risks and the members of the association at that time took all the profits.  That 22/- was considered a fair and reasonable profit before the Control of prices Commission had been set up and before Deputy Lemass became Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That was the profit on the sale of coal which Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Mulcahy, who was then an humble back bencher, and Deputy Bennett, who was then, I think, a Party Whip, were prepared to allow to the coal importers.  These people, who in 1926 were prepared to allow 22/- a ton, say that a profit of 9/6 a ton now is exorbitant.  I am not prepared to say that 9/6 a ton is exorbitant, or that it is not.  I do not know enough about the business, but whatever it is, it is not nearly so exorbitant or so unjustifiable as the profit of 22/- a ton which these Deputies were prepared to allow coal importers in 1926.  It may be a coincidence that in 1932, before the present Minister for Industry and Commerce took office, most of the coal importers in the City of Dublin were tied up with the English collieries. As there was a strike breaking out in England possibly these agents and <Col N="559" /> associates of the English collieries had to divide the melon and the Cumann na nGaedheal policy seemed to be that when it came to dividing the melon there must be enough to give everybody as fat a slice as possible.  In the arrangements then existing between the English collieries and the Irish coal importers in Dublin under the ægis of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce not merely was 9/6 a ton to be regarded as sufficient profit but it had to be almost two and a half times as much as that.  I do not wish to make too much out of that, except to say that the whole of the argument which we have heard here&mdash;when we have in mind the fact that in 1926 the then Government were prepared to allow coal merchants a profit of 22/- per ton&mdash;is a dishonest one, and has no substantial foundation in fact. The whole of the attack on the part of the Opposition in the first weeks of January was that there was excessive profiteering in coal by the merchants.  The whole of their demand to-day has been to put an extra profit of 5/- per ton into the pockets of the profiteers, and we cannot do that under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is not of very great importance. It is designed primarily to bring within the scope of the Harbours (Regulation of Rates) Act, 1934, certain Orders authorising increases of charges at various harbours made under temporary legislation arising out of post war conditions, and to effect certain consequential repeals. The Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, under which those Orders were made, was expressed to expire in 1923, as were the original Orders which were made under it.  The currency of those original Orders however was extended by the Statutory Undertakings (Continuance of Charges) Act, 1923.  Both of those Acts have continued in force to date under successive Expiring Law Acts. For convenience, I will refer to them, in explaining the necessity for this measure, as the &ldquo;1920 Act&rdquo; and the &ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo; respectively.  Under the powers conferred by the 1920 Act, further temporary Harbour Orders were made, limited in duration however to the life of that Act.  By Section 2 of this Bill both the original and subsequent Temporary Increase of Charges Orders are given the statues of Orders made under the Harbours (Regulations of Rates) Act, 1934, that is they will remain in force until they are revoked or until they are modified by further Orders <Col N="561" /> made under that Act.  As the Harbours (Regulation of Rates) Act, 1934, makes permanent provision for the regulation and control of harbour charges, the provisions of the 1920 Act in this regard are no longer necessary, and it is consequently proposed to repeal the 1920 Act in so far as it authorises the making of Orders modifying harbour rates.  Certain provisions, however, relating to the revision of existing Harbour Orders made under it by the 1923 Act were made applicable to certain Canal Orders regulating canal charges which were scheduled to the 1923 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; I think my statement is understandable by the average intelligence.  It is necessary that the power and method provided for the revision of those Canal Orders should be preserved, and hence the necessity not to repeal and to continue in force for this limited purpose the sections of the 1920 Act specified in Section 1 of the Bill.  The amendment in the procedure effected in the Railways Act, 1934, was the substituting of the Railway Tribunal for the Rates Advisory Committee. Portions of the 1923 Act relating to the continuance in force of certain of the Temporary Harbour Orders being no longer necessary, it is proposed by Section 3 of the Bill to repeal them.  It is a high contentious measure.</P>

      <P>And the Minister's contribution to the debate has been &ldquo;worser and worser&rdquo; because it has made the confusion more confounded. <Col N="562" /> In an endeavour to appear spontaneous he would not take up the Departmental brief that he got and read it out verbatim, which we would have been glad to allow him to do, and there would be some head or tail to it, but proceeded to read extracts from it and, of course, no sense of any kind was communicated to the House.  How ever, the Minister will have an opportunity of checking over his statement before it appears in the Official Reports and I hope he will do such checking on it as may be necessary to elucidate his meaning for posterity.</P>
      <P>I want to ask two questions in regard to this Bill.  One is a general question. Would the Minister, when dealing with highly technical matters where legislation is exclusively by reference, ask the responsible officers in his Department to prepare a memorandum which may be circulated with the Bill?  Where a Bill consists of three or four sections, all of which are sections legislating by reference, it is absolutely necessary that a short memorandum, similar to that which accompanies the Expiring Laws Bill, should be circulated with the copies of the Bill sent to the Deputies.  Otherwise, the Minister is in an impossible position, because it is quite impossible to give a lucid explanation of legislation of this character in a statement, such as he has made.</P>
      <P>The second question I should like to ask is: Do any sections of this Bill deal with the kind of situation that obtains on the West Mayo coast, between ports like Westport and Newport, where you have Westport with fixed harbour dues and charges on vessels going into it, and, within a very few miles of it, a port like Newport, where I do not think there are any harbour dues, which seems to be constituted under some quite different kind of authority?  Is there power in this Bill, or is it the intention of the Minister, under the Bill, to regularise a situation of that character?  Has the Minister any special information about the Newport-Westport situation, and is he in a position to say whether any similar situation obtains in any other part of the Irish coastline?</P>

      <P>For the information of Deputy Kelly, I may say that this Bill does not affect the position of the Dublin Port Authority.  The rates and charges of the Dublin Port Authority were regulated by Order made under the Regulation of Rates Act, 1934. <Col N="564" /> After the war, however, when charges were increasing generally, the various harbours and piers which were under statutory control were authorised generally to increase the charges to meet the higher costs then operating. That was done by a temporary measure.  That temporary measure was due to expire in 1923, but another Act, which continued the operation of these Orders authorising the increase of charges, was continued in each year under the Expiring Laws Act.</P>
      <P>In 1934 we introduced a Bill which implemented the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal in respect of the regulation of harbour charges, and Orders are made under that Act from time to time as required. These Orders are permanent in their operation.  They do not have to be renewed in each year.  They continue until revoked or modified.  The purpose of the Bill is take all the old Orders made under the previous Act and give them the same status as Orders made under the 1934 Act. That is to ensure that they would continue in operation until revoked or modified by new Orders.  We thus get the whole position in respect of the regulation of charges and harbours standardised so that the one statute controls them all, and the power of the Minister in the regulation of them is uniform throughout.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is introduced for the purpose of authorising the use of certain standards in the custody of the Department of Industry and Commerce for the purpose of comparing and verifying other standards in the possession of inspectors of weights and measures by which, in turn, the accuracy of weights and measures used by traders, can be tested.  Weights and measures inspectors have in their possession two sets of standards of weights and measures which are termed respectively, the local standards and the working standards.  The working standards are used locally for the purpose of periodically testing the weights and measures and weighing and measuring instruments used in connection with the sale of commodities, and the accuracy of these working standards is insured by a comparison periodically with the local standards which are kept by the inspectors and which are used only for the purpose of reference and comparison. Before the establishment of Saorstát Eireann, the accuracy of these standards was tested by comparison with standards in the possession <Col N="567" /> of the Board of Trade, and this Bill is to provide that the accuracy of standards will be verified by periodical comparision with the standards in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The comparison of standards, being a matter which requires great accuracy and involving examination of a considerable number of articles which are submitted to the headquarters of the Department from stations throughout the country, must necessarily be a very slow process and, accordingly, it is proposed to allow for this comparison a period of two years from the passing of the Act so as to ensure that all such standards must be duly verified and the necessary adjustments and repairs, if required, carried out. The Bill further provides that any comparisons, which have hitherto been made for the purposes of the Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1928, shall be deemed to be valid and effective. I may say that it is the intention to introduce proposals for legislation to codify and amend the existing Weights and Measures Acts, but the preparation of these proposals will take some time.  It will be an involved and very technical type of Bill and it is desired to have this Bill enacted forthwith on that account as a temporary measure so as to ensure that the validity of the standards in use will be secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to gather from the Minister's statement why exactly this Bill is brought in at the present time.  The existing standards, I take it, are the standards surviving from the time when all standards were compared with those in London.  It is now suggested that there should be a primary standard in Dublin.  That seems to me to be a very natural arrangement.  Two thoughts have occured to me in that connection.  One is that I should imagine that the whole question of our system of measurements would have been considered very carefully by the Government before they resolved to set up a Dublin standard.  The Minister has given no indication as to whether the Government has considered the general question of whether we should <Col N="568" /> adhere to the traditional British mode of measurement or whether we should adopt the metric system of measurement. One would imagine that that question would come up for consideration when the question of transferring the standard of measurements from London to Dublin was being decided upon.  However, perhaps it is the intention of the Government, when this more complicated Bill, to which the Minister has referred, is being introduced, to review the whole question of our measurements and to give reasons for their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that, if a permanent Bill for the purpose of codifying this whole question of standards is contemplated, it might be no harm if a body of Irish scientists were now to meet a body of business men and such other bodies of men as might be interested in the matter, in order to exchange views as to whether we should adopt the old Irish standard of measurement, the current British standard of measurement, or the current metric standard.  The second question that presents itself to my mind is that the Schedule of the Bill describes the various standards, and it would appear that the Schedule of the Bill consists entirely of standards made by Messrs. Avery and one or two other British scale makers, which have been compared with the British standards and certified by the British Board of Trade as corresponding with the original standards in London.  If that is so, I do not quite understand what the purpose of this Bill is at all, because, in fact, all our standards are going to draw their authenticity from the hallmark of the London standard office, or whatever is the name of the office which confers the mark of genuineness on a measure of any kind.  Not being a scientist or a mathematician, I do not really know what was the method which ruled standards in England, but I suppose it was done by some council of mathematicians who arrived by calculation at what these standards were.  If we propose now to set up similar standards in this country, I presume that a more appropriate course for us to pursue would be to ask a group of Irish scientists to prepare a body of standards which <Col N="569" /> would be for Saorstát Eireann what the British standards are for Great Britain.  That would seem to me to be a more rational thing to do than to ask a few British scale makers to get the British Board of Trade approval for certain standard measures, bring them over here, and schedule them in a Bill as the standard measurements for Saorstát Eireann. I should like to know if the Minister has looked into this question with regard to finding out what was the procedure in Great Britain when the standards were arrived at and also to finding out whether it was not possible to adopt a similar procedure here and to see that the standards here would be Saorstát scientific standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three kinds of standards, the working standards, the local standards and the primary standards.  The working standards are compared with the local standards and the local standards had to be compared, in order to ensure accuracy, with the Board of Trade standards in London.  We propose to substitute here certain standards that we have here in Dublin and which are described in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are standards which we are satisfied are suitable in all respects and, in fact, they have been compared with Board of Trade standards.  However, the situation by which local standards either had to continue to be compared with Board of Trade standards in London or not compared at all was unsatisfactory, and therefore it is desirable that, in order to ensure that there will be no ambiguity about the situation, these new primary standards should be set up here.  As I said already, the question of a general Weights and Measures Act is under consideration and it is in connection with that Act that any change in the system of weights and measures can be considered. It will be some time, however, before that Bill can be produced. The existing weights and measures code is not very suitable to conditions <Col N="570" /> in this country and a considerable recasting of the code will be necessary, I think.  Until that legislation can be prepared, however, quite apart from the nature of the legislation, it is not easy under present circumstances to get time to concentrate upon the problems that are involved, but even if decisions upon the various questions had been made, the actual framing of the legislation would take a long time, and it is desirable to have this Bill so as to be able to regulate the position until the general measure can be produced.  I cannot say at what time that will be, but I can say that work is being done on it already.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Proposed Ground Rent Levy.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that local authorities in towns and cities should be empowered by legislation to supplement their revenue by levying a rate upon moneys received by ground landlords in respect of ground rents.&mdash;(Deputy Anthony.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate on Friday last on this motion I was making the point that having regard to the benefits which have been added by the community to ground values that the proprietors of land, particularly of land used for building purposes, were enabled by the addition of that value &mdash;a value to which they made no contribution&mdash;to secure for their land a very enhanced value.  I said that that enhanced value was a factor which entered into the cost of house building and that the provision of houses <Col N="571" /> for our people, being such an urgent problem and it being desirable to keep the cost of providing housing accommodation to as reasonable a figure as possible, it was necessary that steps should be taken by the Legislature through this motion, but preferably through a more comprehensive motion, to ensure that the community was enabled to recover from those who had lands to sell for house building purposes some of the community created assets which at present helped to swell the value of lands for building purposes.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out then, the only charge which ground rents at present bear is a charge in respect of income tax.  It cannot, I think, be said that the imposition of an income charge on ground rents results in the raking off, from the standpoint of the community, all the additional value which the community's efforts have given to the land which is used for house building purposes. It is well known that the movement of population alone produces an enhanced value in respect to land.  If a local authority decides to open up new arterial roads or to extend its sanitation scheme, if a State electrical undertaking decides to extend its lighting scheme, or if it is desired to extend a water supply scheme, every person who has land for sale in that previously undeveloped area is enabled by this muncipal development or by that kind of community progress to secure for his land a price which shows a considerable increase as compared with the former value of the land.  The increase in value which has been made possible by community efforts is one which, I think, should revert, as far as the Legislature can ensure its reversion, to the benefit of the community which helped to create that enhanced value in respect of the land.  To the extent therefore that it is possible, through the medium of this motion or any action taken upon it, to ensure that the community-created value of lands may be recovered for the benefit of the community generally, I support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise, at the same time, that there are defects in the motion and that at <Col N="572" /> all events it is only dealing with portion of a problem the end of which we cannot at present see.  Deputy Anthony's motion suggests that a rate should be levied on money received by ground landlords in respect of ground rents.  It may be possible, I think it is possible, to enable the community to levy a tribute on ground rents received by private landlords.  To that extent you may recover, in respect to existing ground landlords, a certain portion of the enhanced value which has been given to the ground rents by community efforts. But we are not dealing merely with the problem of ground rents as it exists at present.  There is another portion of the problem to be considered, the problem of future ground rents.  Any scheme which enables a local authority to exact a levy on ground rents might be easily overcome in respect to any land utilised for building purposes in future, because any landlord who is likely to sell his land to potential house builders would be able, in fixing the rate at which they would let or sell the land, to take cognisance of the charges which would have to be met out of the income which he would receive. If he has to meet 4/6 in the £ in respect of income tax and the local authority is permitted to increase that charge by the levy of an additional 2/6 in the £, we get the position where the ground landlord will be compelled to pay in the form of income tax and municipal tax a sum of 7/- in the £ on land which he lets for building purposes.</P>
    <P>With the knowledge that moneys received in the form of ground rents are subject to a charge of that kind, the ground landlord of the future can overcome the difficulty by charging a rent which will enable him to meet without difficulty the charges imposed by the Legislature and by the municipality.  In that way the position which Deputy Anthony now seeks to remedy would not be remedied and, in fact, the position might well be aggravated, because the ground landlord would thus be able to overcome any imposition which might be put upon him unless, as I said earlier, it <Col N="573" /> were possible to fix by legislation or otherwise a certain definite price which would determine the value of land, particularly for house building purposes, and more especially for the erection of houses which are in urgent demand by the working-class section of the community.  I do not, therefore, think that Deputy Anthony's motion is sufficiently comprehensive.  It only deals with the problem as it exists to-day.  It does not deal with the future problem in respect of the new ground landlords who may be able, notwithstanding a municipal levy, to escape the penal consequences of that levy in respect of themselves.  But I agree that the motion nevertheless has the merit of enabling a local authority to exact from a ground landlord just retribution in respect of the additional value which the efforts of that local authority and of the local community have added to the land. That portion of the motion is one with which I am in complete sympathy.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that there is a wider problem and it is the problem of the future ground landlord.  In that respect, I do not think the motion is sufficiently comprehensive. If that aspect of the matter is to be dealt with, we must take care, particularly in respect of land which is required for the erection of working class houses, to insure that the ground landlord is not enabled to exact from potential house builders or the local authority an enhanced value for his land&mdash;an enhanced value which bears no relation to his own individual efforts, but which is made possible by the efforts of the local authority acting on behalf of the local community. I think that not only would it be necessary, in order to deal comprehensively with this problem, to fix definite standards which would come into play in determining the value of land for house building purposes, but it would also be necessary to endeavour to provide that the sale of land for housebuilding purposes should be effected through the local authority so as to enable the local authority to become the ground landlord. In that way the abuses which are inseparable from the present <Col N="574" /> system of selling land at high prices, when there is a keen demand for land to satisfy the needs of the people in respect of housing, might be overcome and the worst evils of the present system obviated.</P>
    <P>I think it ought not to be impossible to devise a scheme by which any potential house builder having decided upon a site which he desires for house building purposes would be enabled to approach the owner, and to have the value of the land determined in some reasonable way, but bearing in mind the necessity for taking cognisance of the community&mdash; added value in respect of that value and that the local authority should then be enabled to effect the sale of the land between the builder and the ground landlord through the local authority in such a way as to ensure that the local authority would become the ultimate ground landlord. Any rate which it might fix in respect of ground rent ought to be a reasonable rate, and even if there were a surplus realised by the local authority from the sale of land to a potential house builder, that surplus should at least be used for the benefit of the whole community.  Instead, at the present time, any enhanced prices which are paid for land for house building purposes do not benefit the community in the slightest. They are pocketed by the individual ground landlord, and, not merely does he put into his pocket the value of the land, but he puts in a substantial addition to the normal value of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ultimate solution of this problem in respect of ground rents will be found in making the local authority the ground landlord, so far as that is possible, and if the local authority, as the ground landlord, realises a surplus on the sale or letting of land, we have the assurance, at all events, that that surplus value will revert to the community, and that is something that does not happen to-day.  I know, of course, that any proposal of that kind will be assailed by everybody in the community who is enabled to charge fancy ground rents for land.  I know that everybody who is able to rake off a substantial surplus in respect of his ground&mdash;the difference between the low price at which he bought it and the high price he charges to tenants of the land on which houses are built &mdash;will bitterly assail any motion having this for its object, but, even though proposals of this kind may be assailed by people who want to continue to exact exorbitant ground rents from tenants, that is not a reason why the Legislature refuse to implement a piece of legislation so necessary in the interests of the tenants, even if it should happen to be uncomfortable or financially unprofitable for those who at present derive such a substantial income from ground rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been explaining that I believe there are two problems to be dealt with.  One is the problem of taxing the existing ground rents which, in my opinion, and particularly the ground rents which have been created during the past 20 years, have been unduly high and which do not bear an adequate share of taxation.  A motion which is designed to provide municipal taxation on ground rents of that kind is one which I am prepared to support and which Deputy Morrissey of Deputy Dillon's Party is also prepared to support, since he is one of the sponsors of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the right to levy a tax on ground rents.  That is one portion of the problem.  The second portion is the position of future ground landlords who may be able to circumvent the existing income tax imposition and the municipal levy by taking cognisance of these charges upon ground rents in fixing the price for future ground rents.  I say that problem is one which will not be effectively dealt with by the terms of this motion.  I was making the point that I think the problem of future ground rents can only be dealt with by devising a scheme for enabling the local authority to become the owner of ground which is sold by <Col N="578" /> a ground owner to a potential house builder, and having the transaction a third party transaction into which the local authority would enter.  The local authority would then be enabled to let the land to the potential house builder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was any difference charged by the corporation to the potential house builder, representing a surplus on the price which the corporation paid for that particular ground, then we would have the satisfaction at least of knowing that that surplus would be utilised for the benefit of the community instead of, as at present, going into the pocket of the private ground landlord with no portion of this community created asset reverting to the municipality or to the local community.  In other words, if there is to be any surplus realised in the letting of ground for house building purposes, it is much more preferable that the surplus should be realised by the local authority which will use it for the benefit of the whole community instead of having that surplus yielded up to a person who will use it not for the benefit of the community but for his own benefit.</P>

If he does mean that, does he mean that any citizen can come in and compulsorily acquire his neighbour's land if he happens to covet it?

      <P>Deputy Dillon asked the question whether my proposal meant that a certain person who wanted to acquire a particular site for the purpose of building a house on it would be enabled to go to the local authority and ask it to compulsorily acquire that site for him, the local authority becoming the ground landlord.  No, of course, my proposal did not involve that at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the case of one individual versus another.  If I want land I have to go to the owner of it. I can negotiate an agreement with him by which I can become the owner of the land or secure the land on lease. I am not suggesting that if one avaricious citizen wants to secure land held by some other person that he should be enabled to invoke the aid of the local authority, automatically, to change the first citizen and let the second citizen in.  At present, of course, as Deputy Dillon knows, a local authority, if it requires a particular site, may take steps compulsorily to acquire it.  My proposal would not mean disturbing that practice, nor would it establish the practice of enabling one citizen to utilise a local authority for the purpose of compulsorily acquiring land owned by another citizen.  But I say that where a voluntary transaction is entered into, or where there is the possibility of entering into an arrangement between one citizen who has land to sell and another citizen who requires land for house-building purposes, that voluntary arrangement should be executed through the local authority in such a way as to make the local authority the ultimate ground landlord.  I think that is the only effective way, so far as I can see, by which a local authority could become the ultimate ground landlord.  In that way we can have some assurance that if there are profits made, or surpluses realised, in respect of the letting of land for house-building purposes, the local authority, at all events, will garner the profits or surpluses and utilise them in the interests of the community.</P>

To that extent, I support the motion, though it does not deal with the problem of ground rents in a comprehensive way.  I think that the problem of ground rents must be dealt with in a comprehensive way, though if one is to regard the declaration of the Minister for Finance at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as representing the Government's viewpoint on ground rents, we shall wait many a day before the evils arising from profiteering in ground rents are seriously attacked. However, this problem must be tackled some time.  The legislature has enacted legislation to prevent profiteering in a variety of articles of public use.  Under that legislation, there has been an inquiry into the price of house-building material&mdash;a clear recognition of the fact that the State thinks it is desirable to prevent profiteering in the elements which go to determine the cost of a house and the rent of a house.  In respect of ground rents, there has been no inquiry as to the extent of profiteering. There has been no inquiry and no legislation designed to check the very obvious profiteering that has taken place.  There has been no attempt in any legislation to prevent ground landlords renewing leases of houses at substantially higher ground rents than those which formerly obtained.  Owing to the circumstances in which the tenants are placed, these ground landlords are enabled to exact almost any kind of tribute they choose to fix.  So long as ground rents and the cost of land enter into the cost of constructing a house and the rent charged for the house, it is necessary that the legislature should be vigilant in respect of any profiteering.  Indeed, inquiry into the whole problem and the most effective way in which it can be dealt with has long been overdue. There are some very obvious evils in respect of the inflated rents which are charged for land which do not require the prolonged and careful consideration which the Minister for Finance <Col N="586" /> spoke about on another occasion. One of the methods by which the problem, as it is being felt immediately by all sections of the people, might be dealt with is that set out in the motion.  The motion, as I have said, is not drafted in such a comprehensive way as would enable the problem to be dealt with as a whole, but I regard the motion as one which makes an effort to recover for the community assets which the community have created and the value of which is now being pocketed by individual landholders.  It is because the motion seeks to recover a community-created asset for the use and benefit of the community that I am supporting it.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies opposite commented when this question was previously before the House on statements made by Deputies down the country who are in favour of some steps being taken to deal with ground rents.

      <P>I have all your learned references here.  I wonder what kind of confiscation, what I am going to relate will be thought, where a piece of bare rock in a country town in my constituency was taken over on lease for £12 a year.  The rock had to be excavated and houses were built upon it costing something like £12,000.  In order to do that £5,000 was borrowed from the bank.  When the lease expired the ground landlord who owned the rock refused to renew it for the unfortunate man who had invested £12,000 in buildings or for the bank that had advanced £5,000 on loan, but he relet the houses that he had confiscated <Col N="587" /> for £415 a year.  That is just one little case of confiscation by one of these ground rent landlords in whom we are all so interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Dublin Corporation as landlords later, all in good time.  The others showed the road and I must say the Corporation were good pupils.  In another case a ground rent of £100 was divided between 25 tenants.  An enormous amount of money was spent on buildings. Remember that all these tenants got was the bare rock on which they built 25 houses, each tenant paying his own part of the ground rent. When the lease fell in in that case the ground rent was increased from £100 to £1,862, and not alone that, but the tenants were compelled to rebuild and to alter the houses at their expense to the satisfaction of the ground landlord.  These are two cases that indicate the manner in which absentee landlords dealt with one unfortunate town in my constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The town of Cobh. Four other houses were let on lease, the ground rent being £4 on each house.  When the lease expired the rents were raised to £50, £50, £42 and £35, respectively.  I want the House to remember that the ground landlord did not lose as much as 5/- on the buildings, except to pay the collector, probably on a commission basis.  That is the manner in which that property was confiscated.  In that unfortunate town 26 shops are closed because the people could not pay the rack rents that were put on when leases expired.  There are two hotels closed there because the unfortunate tenants could not pay the ground rents levied upon them.  We have heard a great deal about decent ground landlords from all the benevolent societies that have been formed.  I would like to get down to bedrock on this question, and I would like some Deputy to give his opinion of the benevolent type of landlord that lets a piece of rock at <Col N="588" /> £12 10s. a year, and when the lease expires confiscates buildings worth £12,000 upon it, and then demands £415 a year from the new tenants. That is not confiscation at all! That is business! It is something of the same class of business that Deputy Belton mentioned in connection with the Dublin Corporation where £200 was paid for the ground, and £9,000 charged to the purchasers.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;...Now, it is well to know at the outset that the largest ground landlord in Ireland is the Dublin Corporation, and if the Dublin Corporation give £200 or £300 an acre for virgin soil for building houses, they get £9,000 or more an acre for land let to private individuals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but I would like to stop these ignorant interruptions. Deputy Belton stated here that virgin soil purchased for £200 an acre was let for £9,000 an acre.  That may be a very good proposition for the Dublin Corporation.  It may be taken that about 15 houses would be built on the acre, and that interest has to be paid on the money.  I suggest to Deputy Belton that it is not the people of Dublin alone who have to pay that money and the enormous <Col N="589" /> salaries that have to be paid to Government officials who are compelled to reside in Dublin.  They are paid by the people of the country at large, and if the Dublin Corporation farms out land that it buys at £200 at £9,000 an acre, on which 15 houses are erected, that £9,000 is not paid by the citizens of Dublin.  That enormous profit is made according to the chairman of the Estates Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  That money is paid by the ordinary people, and it affects the cost of living bonus about which we hear so much.  It comes from the unfortunate people, and it enables officials to live in Dublin and to pay the rack rents that have to be paid, because the Dublin Corporation charges £9,000 for an acre of ground on which houses are built by private individuals.  I do not care whether they are absentee landlords, as in the case of Cobh, or rack-renters, as in the case of the Dublin Corporation; it is all one to me.  The ordinary people have to pay.</P>

      <P>On the Rushbrooke estate down there we dealt with 320 tenants.  The rental was £9,000.  We gave the tenants a reduction of, roughly, 33? per cent. of their ground rents, or £3,100.  We wiped out £4,500 arrears, all in a perfectly peaceable and orderly, constitutional manner.  I might say that 150 of the leases which were not dealt with were held by the bank.  That will show you the condition of affairs into which the people were driven by the drain of ground rents.  Then we dealt with the Barrymore estate and we gave the tenants there practically an equal reduction. It was all done by arbitration.  We had to tackle a bigger problem still, and that was to bring the reduction to the ordinary man living in a house, just as when we deal with the £9,000 Deputy Belton's Corporation are collaring, the people will have their houses cheaper by £30 a year.</P>

I take it that is the plan Deputy Belton, as Chairman of the City Estates Committee in Dublin, was also working on&mdash;buying at £200 and selling at £9,000.

      <P>I do not like too much repetition, but I would wish to refer to the particular portion of Deputy Belton's remarks.  He talked about the Dublin Corporation being the biggest ground landlords in Ireland.  I would like to refer to that so that Deputies, if this debate continues for another night, may have an opportunity of refuting my statement if they can.  The position I find is that we have a community of ground landlords as was stated by Deputy Belton getting £9,000 or more for an acre of land let to private individuals.  We have it that the private individual must start from scratch at £9,000 an acre if he is to build a house in Dublin and let that house afterwards to the unfortunate official or worker who goes to live there.  Just imagine £9,000 an acre! That would be more than £30 a house for interest alone.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to make my case as fairly as I can.  As I have stated, we had to deal with that problem ourselves down in Cork and we did it after making repeated appeals here that got us nowhere.  On one occasion I had to hold the Minister for Justice here on the adjournment in order to make a case for the unfortunate town tenants of Cobh.  We are not satisfied that we got enough. After dealing with Cobh we took over the unfortunate town of Passage recently which was in the territory of the Deputies for the City of Cork.  On account of some representations that were made there as to what would happen to that particular ground landlord we found he was prepared to put his hand into his pocket to help to start an industry in the town so as to keep up the value of his property in Passage and to enable the tenants to pay the ground rent.  In Cobh we found the unfortunate tenants were paying a sum of practically £18,000 a year in ground rents.  This sum was taken out of that town by two absentee ground landlords who thought they had their duty discharged to the unfortunate <Col N="596" /> people of that town when they sent a cheque for £25 to the St. Vincent de Paul Society at Christmas. That cheque had made everything right for them, as they thought, and they were benevolent benefactors to the town.  They never bothered as to whether the people of Cobh were hungry.  All that troubled these absentee landlords was to get their rents.  However, that was stopped.  We met in Cobh, we sat around a table and the whole matter was subjected to arbitration with satisfactory results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not, but there is a question of the community benefiting to the extent of a certain fixed amount, I take it, by a rate levied. The rate is to be levied, I presume, for the benefit of the community in the particular district where the ground rents are being charged.  I am suggesting that it would be far more beneficial to the individuals themselves &mdash; instead of having that rate going to the local authority and being transmitted <Col N="597" /> to them again; very little of it, perhaps, reaching the particular individuals concerned &mdash; if they got this cut direct; if they got their 33 1/3rd per cent., the same as the tenants of Cobh got, instead of having it passed through the rates and all the rest of it.  If the corporation is anything like the Dublin Corporation, God alone knows whether or not the tenant will get any benefit at all.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Leases have lapsed in the Corporation. They are lapsing every day.  It is only this morning I posted a few orders that had been sent to me as Chairman of the Estates Committee.  We actually increase the rents when the leases lapse.  We will not relet them even subject to an increase without a guarantee of expenditure on capital outlay towards rebuilding, renovating or reconditioning.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is as bad, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, as the gentleman whose case I quoted a while ago; he not alone increased the ground rent from £100 to £1,862, but compelled the unfortunate tenants to renovate and rebuild.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We have authority in the powers given to the Corporation to do that on our own.  Sometimes certain technicalities come into it and when those operate we have to get the sanction of the Local Government Department.  When we suggest an increase in the rents, the Local Government Department does not disagree with us in imposing the increase. They have held that we have not increased the rents enough.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is done for the benefit of the builders who Deputy Belton says are entitled to the cost of development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He puts in a water closet and a pipe leading from it to the main, a distance of five or ten yards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen it done.  I can say honestly that I know that the cost of the extension of sewerage in the South Cork Board of Health area over a period of six years has been at least from £25,000 to £30,000, if it stops at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the suburbs of the city.  As to the road that enterprising builders construct between lines of houses, they put about 40 loads of stones, that are too small to be used in building and too awkward to be used for anything else, in the middle.  They may run the roller over them once and then they say the road <Col N="603" /> is made.  Then they generally get some enterprising councillor like Deputy Belton to put down a notice of motion that the road be taken over by the county council and the road is taken over.  That is another phase of the development work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order to say that the Dublin Corporation is the most corrupt body in the Free State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking is the statement in order, that the Dublin Corporation is the most corrupt body in the Free State, because, obviously, somebody may desire to reply to that remark.  Can it be discussed?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be discussed as it is not relevant <Col N="604" /> to the motion.  The question for the Chair is whether it is relevant to the motion or not.  It is not.  The second point is whether it transgresses the rules of order as referring to the reputation of some individual.  It seems to me that a corporate body cannot be said to have a reputation that can be defended in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a permissible statement in an Assembly of this kind with reference to the capital city? This speech may be reported throughout the Press of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the suggestion conveyed that members of this House are members of a corrupt body?  That is the effect of the statement made&mdash; that Deputy Belton, Deputy Kelly and Deputy Briscoe are members of a corrupt body.  How they can be members of a corrupt body and not be individually corrupt I do not know.</P>
