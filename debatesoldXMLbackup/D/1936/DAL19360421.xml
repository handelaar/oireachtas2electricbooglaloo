      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received a resolution protesting against the appointment by the Longford Board of Health of Thomas Casey to fill a vacancy in the office of the county medical officer of health; whether he is aware that the board decided originally to fill the position by open competitive examination, and that a body of examiners was appointed who reported to the board that only one of the candidates passed <Col N="1094" /> in all subjects; whether the board subsequently ignored the report of the examiners, which showed that Casey did not pass in all subjects and only secured sixth place in the examination with 42 per cent. of marks, and whether he is prepared to insist that the board will appoint to the position the best qualified candidate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention was directed to an advertisement regarding the appointment by the North Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance of two clerks of works, which was announced in the daily Press on April 8th; whether he is aware that according to the published conditions of employment, the board is insisting that these clerks of works shall possess engineering qualifications; whether the appointments will be made subject to the approval of his Department; and, if so, whether he will inform the board that there is no authority to require applicants for these posts to possess engineering qualifications, and whether he will insist on the posts being readvertised in a proper manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The replies to parts 1 and 2 of the question are in the affirmative.  For the supervision of the erection of 491 cottages under their Compulsory Purchase Order Scheme, the North Cork Board of Health decided to appoint four clerks of works at £5 per week, and two supervising clerks of works at £6 per week.  For the latter, qualifications in engineering were stipulated.  The proposal was approved by me, and the four posts were filled, being allotted to persons recommended by the board's engineer. These four persons did not possess engineering qualifications.  Only one application was received for the position of supervising clerks of works and the positions have been readvertised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it has been brought to his notice that a County Donegal employer (referred to in correspondence from his Department under Ref. No. E.B. 118520) failed to pay unemployment contributions in respect of building workers employed by him between 27th August, 1934, and the 5th October, 1935; whether he is aware that certain of the employees concerned have been unemployed since the last-mentioned date, but, because of the employer's failure to comply with the law, are deprived of unemployment benefit; whether he informed certain of the unemployed persons concerned on January 22nd last, that they were entitled to institute proceedings against the employer to recover summarily, as a civil debt, a sum equal to the amount of any unemployment benefits lost by them by reason of the employer's failure to pay contributions which, under the Act and regulations the employer is liable to pay; and <Col N="1098" /> whether he is aware that these men cannot afford the cost of instituting such proceedings which might involve them in heavy expenses, and whether, in the circumstances, he is prepared to institute the necessary proceedings on their behalf without delay; and if, pending the result of such proceedings, he is prepared to advance to the men concerned the unemployment benefit to which they would have been entitled if the employer had complied with the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is aware that the employer mentioned has defaulted in the matter of unemployment insurance contributions due in respect of 22 ex-employees.  Whilst steps were being taken to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts in regard to these persons the employer filed a petition in bankruptcy.  A claim has accordingly been lodged with the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy for payment of unemployment insurance contributions out of the estate of the bankrupt.</P>
      <P>A number of these ex-employees, who have lodged claims to unemployment benefit, have been deprived of benefit because of the employer's failure to pay unemployment insurance contributions due in respect of them for different periods from July, 1934, to November, 1935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the inspector's efforts to collect the contributions due, two of the employees concerned wrote to my Department complaining of the employer's failure to comply with the Acts.  They were informed of the position and their attention invited to Section 24 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, which gives them the right to institute proceedings against the employer to recover summarily as a civil debt a sum equal to the amount of any unemployment benefit lost by reason of the employer's failure to pay contributions which under the Act he was liable to pay in respect of their employment.  I have no power to take proceedings under Section 24 of the Employment Insurance Act, 1920, which gives to employed persons only the right to sue an employer for benefit lost by them <Col N="1099" /> in consequence of his failure to comply with the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Unemployment insurance contributions have no retrospective effect and are available for the payment of benefit only as from and including the dates on which they are actually paid into the unemployment fund, subject to the fulfilment of the statutory conditions and freedom from the statutory disqualifications laid down in the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920-1933.</P>

      <P>Following an accident which occurred to Patrick O'Leary, of Glenlough, Gortalassa, on 13th March, 1934, compensation at the rate of £1 1s. 0d. per week was paid to him up to 7th September, 1935, on which date a notice served on him under Section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, expired, a doctor engaged by the insurance company having certified O'Leary's fitness for work on that date.  The case was contested by the solicitor acting for the claimant and was referred to the court medical referee, a sum equivalent to the compensation at the rate of £1 1s. per <Col N="1100" /> week up to 2nd November, 1935, being lodged in court.  The court referee certified O'Leary was fit for many kinds of light work.  It was not practicable to offer him such employment. Compensation at the full rate of £1 1s. a week therefore continued to be allowed, and the balance due up to 4th instant was paid by the insurance company to O'Leary's solicitor on the 7th instant.  Arrangements have been made for fortnightly payments as from the 18th instant so long as legal liability exists.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a limited number of experiments has been carried out by the Government of Northern Ireland to test the value of the Spahlinger vaccine in the prevention of tuberculosis in cattle.  The general conclusion drawn from a careful examination of the reports of these experiments is that the results are not such as would enable a definite opinion to be formed as to the value of the vaccine.  I understand that more extensive tests are about to be carried out in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I am fully alive to the importance of obtaining a satisfactory method of preventive vaccination against tuberculosis in cattle and will keep closely in touch with the results obtained in tests of the Spahlinger and other vaccines which promise some measure of success.

      <P>Quota No. 16 Order, under the Control of Imports Act, applied to superphosphates, ground mineral phosphates and compound manures.  It was found, some time after the Order was in operation, that a certain substance known as nitro chalk was not being manufactured in the Saorstát and was, at the same time, subject to the quota order.  The purpose of this amending Order is to exclude nitro chalk from the scope of Quota No. 16 Order so that there will be no restriction on its importation.  It is used for manurial purposes, but not to any great extent. As it is not being made here, there is no reason why we should restrict its importation.</P>

      <P>One would have thought that, in addressing himself to a quota order dealing with superphosphates, the Minister would have dealt with a wider range of items than the particular item he has picked out.  We have not got particulars as to the production of superphosphates for the year 1934.  The information obtained in the census of production for that year has not yet been published, but <Col N="1106" /> we have the information for the years 1931 to 1933.  We find that in this industry the average wages paid to the employees fell by 20 per cent. between 1931 and 1933.  The average amount of wages paid, if we take the total amount of wages and divide it by the number of wage-earners as given us by the Minister, has fallen from 139 for the year 1931 to 130 for the year 1932 and to 111 for the year 1933.  Production in the industry has substantially fallen between the year 1931 and the year 1933.  In the year 1931, 134, 124 tons of material were produced, the value being £427,346.  That production had fallen by 1933 to 93,491 tons, the value being £300,000.  Here we had a fall of nearly one-third in production and of one-fifth in the average wages paid to the employees in an industry which is being helped in this quota fashion.</P>

The Minister has evidence before him to show that, in the case of many items subject to quota, the quota-ing of these imports and the restriction by licence have raised the price to the consumer, apart from any tariffing arrangements in force.

The same rule should obtain with regard to a quota order. This motion proposes to amend such an Order in one respect&mdash;by granting an exemption or withdrawing a prohibition. Obviously, the whole Order does not arise for discussion.  Still less does the quota system, which may be discussed on the Minister's Vote, arise for discussion now.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to have any elaborate discussion, but I do wish to point out that the quota order system has been shown, in many cases, to have increased the price of commodities.  That affects farmers, who have a substantially reduced income.  In many cases turnips and mangolds have been substituted by beet.  Yet, there is an increase of about 160,000 acres in the amount of root and corn crops grown.  One would, therefore, expect a large increase in the consumption of artificial manures.  The only explanation is that farmers, owing to increase in cost as a result of the tariffs and quotas, are unable to buy these manures.  We see an industry which is supposed to be helped by these quotas giving less employment and producing less.  In these circumstances we expect the Minister to take us into his confidence and tell us what is happening.  The Minister says that the quota order has been introduced since these circumstances existed.  Will the Minister tell us in what way this quota order is improving the situation?  Will he give us some particulars as to what proportion of the stuff that is being released from quota is imported, the extent to which it is subject <Col N="1108" /> to tariff and the amount derived by the revenue from the tariff? He might also state whether he has given us hope that this stuff will be manufactured in the country.  In dealing with a very important matter like artificial manures, the Minister is treating the House in a slighting way when he does not give us more information with regard to this industry than he has given.</P>

      <P>This Order is a formal Order of minor importance.  Its sole purpose is to exclude from the scope of Control of Imports (No. 16) Order a substance known as nitro chalk.  I should be entirely out of order if I were to attempt on this occasion to go into an elaborate explanation concerning the development of tillage, the use of fertilisers and the employment given in the fertiliser industry, as Deputy Mulcahy has asked me to do. As I have frequently pointed out to him, Deputy Mulcahy will continue to get himself into difficulties until he learns how to use properly the figures supplied to him.  If he divides, as he has done in this case, the number of persons employed in an industry on a particular day into the amount of money paid in wages in that industry over a whole year, the answer he will get will prove nothing.  I pointed that out to the Deputy before, but he has learned nothing.  He pointed that same thing again, and he arrived at the conclusion that the average wage paid in the industry had decreased. He should not have arrived at any such conclusion.  There is no relation between one figure and the other.  By dividing one figure into the other, he proves that the moon is made of green cheese, and nothing else.  Furthermore, the production of fertilisers in 1933 has nothing whatever to do with the acreage under crops in 1935.  In addition the actual amount of fertilisers produced by Saorstát factories in 1933 proves nothing in relation to the consumption of fertilisers in 1933, because fertilisers were being imported in increasing quantities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order and Order No. 19 may be dealt with together.  As Deputies are aware there are two quota Orders in <Col N="1110" /> operation under which the import of motor tyres are regulated.  Within the scope of one Order there are classes and sizes of tyres manufactured in this country, and within the scope of the other Order are classes not manufactured in this country.  The purpose of the amending Orders is to transfer some 30 sizes of tyres from the latter class, because they are now being manufactured here.  Originally imports of all tyres were regulated under one quota Order. When, however, certain classes were made here an amending Order was made, excluding from the original quota Order the classes of tyres being made here, and a separate quota was instituted for these classes. As the number of classes has increased with the extension of manufacture in the country, it is necessary to transfer from one quota Order to the other these additional sizes.  That is the purpose of these two Orders. They are necessary to facilitate administration, and to secure that licences issued for imports of the class of tyres not produced here are not used for the importation of tyres of the kind being produced here.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with Quota Order No. 1, and to give the Minister notice that by the time he comes to Order No. 19, which, I presume, he will move later, I will deal with it.  The Minister introduced a quota on tyres for the purpose of establishing the industry at Cork.  He is amending Order No. 1 now because he says there has been a certain amount of progress in the development of production at Cork.  The Minister was repeatedly asked when there was an opportunity for information on the development of the industry at Cork, to give some idea of the amount of employment being given there, the total amount of wages paid, and the relation between the total amount of production in Cork and the requirements of the country.  He introduces an amending Order now, but gives no information on points repeatedly put <Col N="1111" /> to him and that this House should have when it is giving a monopoly to a firm in this country.  I advise the Minister that by the time we come to Order No. 19&mdash;and, to some extent, the same applies to the quota order dealing with boots&mdash;it is nearly time he gave some information.  He will have an opportunity of doing so on Order No. 19.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the position concerning boots, the Deputy will appreciate that there is a difficulty on my part in giving information concerning the activities of a single firm. I think I am debarred by Statute from giving information in a manner which would enable anybody to relate it to a particular firm.  The estimated requirements for motor tyres are, I think, roughly 120,000 per year, and by far the greater part are now being produced here.  The sizes that are not produced here are unusual sizes, and are not used in any great quantity. The Deputy can take it that the bulk of our requirements are being produced here.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that any information the Deputy would get would be out of date almost by the time it was supplied, as a new industry only started so recently is obviously expanding very rapidly?  I think the Minister has no power to demand information as to the wages paid, even if it were correct to give it to the House.  Further, would it not be the case that by the time the information was collected and supplied production had so out-run the details supplied that it would be comparatively useless for any purpose?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that it would be useless for this House to know the reason why the Minister made a change of this kind in the Order?  He tells us that he made the change because production has been entered upon 30 types of tyres.  Does the Minister or Deputy Moore think that this House should not ask what was the reason, and also for facts with regard to production, quantity and value, and the amount of additional employment given at the time the <Col N="1112" /> Minister had the facts before him and decided to change the Order?  Surely Deputy Moore does not want to treat us as children.  Are we not to have information as to the total amount of employment given by any firm that is a monopolistic firm, and if the Minister proposes at some time, maybe in connection with cement, to put up proposals for a monopoly in the same way as regards tyres, surely that position is not seriously put to the House. Does he intend to come before the House when he is putting forward proposals in regard to the setting up of a cement factory, and is he going to tell us that because it is a monopolistic firm we are not going to get information as to the rate of wages or the total amount of employment?</P>

      <P>We heard a lot of talk from the occupants of the opposite benches in years gone by about bureaucracy. Here in these orders we have the very essence of bureaucracy.  This House is supposed to be a deliberative Assembly; it is expected to consider and weigh carefully the facts of every matter before coming to a decision. Are we to be asked, without being given any information, to come to a decision which will enable the Minister to amend an Order, or expand it?  The Minister asks the House to confirm this amending Order so as to enable him to extend the monopoly that is there.  The House is asked to do that, and Deputies are left in complete ignorance as to the amount of employment that is given by this firm and the amount that is paid in wages, or what, if anything, this Order, either in its original form or as amended, is going to cost.  That is just what the Minister's proposal amounts to.  I suggest that if the representatives of the people are asked to come to decisions and are expected to consider matters put before them, before they come to any decision they are entitled to the necessary information, and if the Minister has not the power to get that information he ought to seek the power without delay.</P>

    <P>The position so far as these orders are concerned is that an order is made by the Executive Council without any reference to the Dáil.  Bringing it before the Dáil in this form is really a farce.  You have taxation and customs duties imposed behind closed doors. These orders vitally affect the life of the country; they affect taxation considerably and they have an important bearing on the interests of the people as a whole, yet in regard to them the Dáil is practically helpless.  When Deputies ask for information they are told that it cannot be given by the Minister.  It is unfair that Deputies should be asked blindly to give their assent to any amendment brought before the House.  Their assent should not be asked until they are given <Col N="1114" /> whatever information they consider they are entitled to get in order to arrive at a proper decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has talked about bureaucracy.  What would be a worse example of bureaucracy than that the Minister should send a not to the Dunlop Company asking them to put into terms of employment the effect of this Order&mdash;to put into terms of employment the effect of now producing 24 x 32 tyres where previously they were not producing tyres of these dimensions?  How could any firm be expected to undertake to do that?  Their costings would be a most extravagant and absurd business if duties of the kind were forced on them. Indeed, I rather doubt that they would be able to say precisely what their employment is even with regard to tyres generally as distinct from other rubber goods.  To start off with a protest against bureaucracy and at the same time to invite the Minister to compel a manufacturer to give information of that kind is as absurd a thing as could be imagined.  I hope there is no need to ask the Minister not to yield to that sort of proposal. To accept it would certainly make the whole idea of government unbearable.</P>

In the matter of conferring powers on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, nothing is being done.  The same sizes of tyres will be controlled in respect of imports under Quota Order No. 19 instead of Quota Order No. 1.  The whole business of the manufacture of tyres has been discussed here before.

Motor tyres of excellent quality are being produced and they are being sold at prices lower than before the manufacture was undertaken here.</P>

      <P>This Order makes a technical change also and could, perhaps, be discussed in relation to Quota Order No. 29. The import of boots and shoes made wholly or mainly of rubber was subject to control under a previous quota order.  The manufacture of these boots and shoes is now being undertaken here.  We have found that for administrative convenience it is better to have two quota orders instead of one&mdash;one relating to boots and shoes made of rubber which have heels, and the other to boots and shoes of the unheeled variety.  The quantities of each class which have been produced and the quantities which are required to meet the demand of consumers in the country vary, and on that account it is considered desirable both from the point of view of the importers, as well as from the point of view of the Department, that there should be separate Orders for the heeled boots and shoes, and the unheeled boots and shoes. The main purpose of this Amending Order is to exclude from the main quota order that those are covered by Quota Order No. 29, that is, heeled rubber shoes.</P>

      <P>Again, Sir, this is a type of article that has been quoted since August or September, 1934, and it is an item in respect of which the Minister has never been able to give us any information in regard to the amount of employment given, the wages paid, the extent to which production, at the point at which the Minister now changes his Order, meets the requirements of the country or the comparative prices at which these goods are now being sold wholesale, <Col N="1117" /> compared with the import prices previously. Does the Minister not consider that he should give us that information on an occasion like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the quota order was made originally, it was primarily for the purpose of restricting the importation of these rubber boots and shoes, which in 1934 came in in very large quantities, to the detriment of the leather boot and shoe industry here.  At that time, the plans for their production in the country were in a very tentative stage, and we could not have said definitely when we hoped that these boots and shoes could be produced here.  Since then their production has been undertaken and it is anticipated that the total production of this class of footwear during the present year will be equal or almost equal to the normal demands for them within the country.  I cannot say to what extent employment is given in this particular form of production. The firm which is engaged in this production is also engaged in other lines of production, and it might be difficult, even if I had the information, to segregate employment upon these classes of boots and shoes and employment on the production of other goods.  Neither have I got precise information as to the wages paid.  I, however, noticed a paragraph in the newspapers some weeks ago to the effect that an agreement had been made between this firm and certain trade unions, which was described by representatives of the trade unions as a very satisfactory agreement, so I presume there is no complaint on the score of the wages paid by the company.  The intention is, of course, that imports of these boots and shoes will cease entirely, and that the entire quantity necessary to meet the demand for consumers here will be produced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Quota No. 19 the question was put to the House by Deputy Moore:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;How could any Minister dare to say to a manufacturer &lsquo;I am going to issue an Order as a result of what you have said, but I want you to express it in terms of increased employment or change of employment in your industry&rsquo;?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I did not quite catch the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was speaking, and I do not know whether he was less expansive on the subject than the Minister for Lands in the Seanad.  Here are some quotations from the Minister for Lands in the Seanad with regard to this Order.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Dunlop Factory in Cork came into full production of 15 of the specified sizes of outer covers on the 1st July, 1935.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A new Order was then made.  Later he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Dunlop Company has now come into full production of 30 additional sizes which are still subject to Quota No. 1 Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, at a recent date they came <Col N="1119" /> into full production of 30 additional sizes.  I think my question is an absolutely necessary question to put, and that if it were not necessary for our purposes here in considering this matter, it is a question that anybody interested in the development of the Cork industry would put.  That is, what does it mean in increased employment and wages when the company has come into full production in respect of 30 additional types of covers?  Is Deputy Moore serious in asking us to shut down our minds, even from the point of view of curiosity, to the question as to what this full production of certain types of tyres means in the matter of employment?  We are asked by the Minister to believe that they are giving increased employment, yet it is charged against Deputies here when they seek to find out what the production of these 30 additional types means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The company did not start on the condition that they would not be asked how much employment would be given.  Surely they were asked what employment they would give in the country.  Do I understand from the Minister that the company is working under some kind of an agreement with him that prevents his asking them what it does mean in the matter of employment and wages annually, when they have now got into full production of 30 additional types of tyres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the production of these tyres involves the employment of 600 or 700 people, but in so far as returns are made to me by the company, they are made because they are required to be made by law. These returns are made in such a manner that they cannot be published by me so as to reveal information relating to a particular firm.  I think it is very undesirable that any suspicion should be created in the minds of individual manufacturers that the information furnished by them, when they are required to do so, would be made <Col N="1120" /> available in a manner which would permit particulars of their concern being identified by any person getting the information.  That is one of the principles on which the legislation giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to require statistical returns is framed, that where there is only one firm engaged in an industry, or where the circumstances of the industry are such that any information published about it would lead to a knowledge of the circumstances of that one firm being made available, then the returns published must be in bulk and in such a way that that cannot happen.</P>
      <P>In this particular case there are different circumstances, because we knew what the development of this industry was going to mean in the matter of employment before we encouraged it.  We knew that the production of tyres of all kinds, motor and cycle, was going to mean employment for some 600 people.  To attempt to segregate the employment into categories; to say what number of people are employed on motor tyres, what number are employed on inner tubes for motor tyres, the number employed on cycle tyres, and particularly what number are employed on particular sizes of motor tyres, would be completely impossible, nor is it necessary, I think, that that information should not be sought and I doubt very much if it is available.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 26) Order, 1936, made on the 28th day of January, 1936, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
      <P>Quota Orders Nos. 26, 27 and 28 relate to brushes.  For the first time these Orders imposed a quota restriction upon the importation of various classes of brushes.  Quota Order 26 relates to household and domestic brushes; Quota Order 27 to toilet brushes, and Quota Order 28 to brushes other than those covered by Quota Orders 26 and 27.  The object of the Orders was to secure that the greatest possible percentage of the brushes required in the Saorstát would be produced here.  For some time past we have endeavoured to restrict the importation of brushes by means of an <i>ad valorem</i> duty.  We found that that was not completely effective.  Although it did discourage the importation of brushes and resulted in a decline in imports and an expansion of the home production, nevertheless in the year 1935, 221,929 dozen brushes, valued at £40,000, were imported.  It has been our experience during the past few years that where articles are individually of low value, as a number of these brushes are, <i>ad valorem</i> duties are not effective in limiting their importation.  Consequently, it was decided to encourage an increase in the production of brushes here to an extent sufficient to wipe out that figure from our trade and shipping statistics by means of controlling imports under the Control of Imports Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, however, fixed fairly liberal quotas for the various classes of brushes to operate during the first quota period, and it is only as production develops within the country that the further restriction of imports will be affected.  In the case of household and domestic brushes, the quota fixed for the first quota period, which continues to the 30th June of the present year, was 122,000; for toilet brushes, covered by Quota Order No. 27,251,000; and for brushes covered by Quota Order No. 28, 181,000.  We consider that, with the production of brushes available <Col N="1122" /> from the firms engaged in their production here, these quantities should be more than sufficient to secure that all reasonable requirements will be met.  The development of the brush manufacturing industry here has beer proceeding slowly for some time.  When the stimulation of the tariff was first given to the industry there was a reorganisation of the methods of manufacture in the factories.  That reorganisation, involving as it did the greater use of mechanical methods in production, had for a time an effect upon employment.  In fact, there was no increase in employment despite the not inconsiderable increase in total production; but as production continued to increase employment commenced to increase, and there has been a quite considerable increase in the amount of employment given in the industry in recent years.  It is felt that when the £40,000 worth of brushes which were imported in 1935 are produced here, a further increase in employment will be effected.  But at the moment it is not possible to give any precise estimate of the number of persons likely to be employed, because the brushes imported are of various classes and descriptions, and no one can say with any degree of certainty what classes of brushes constitute the bulk of the imports, and, consequently, what employment is involved in their production here.  The opinion generally held, apparently, is that the quality and the prices of the brushes produced here are satisfactory.  We have here a number of firms engaged in the production of brushes of various kinds.  The industry is one that is suitable to the country, one which can be fostered here, and consequently there is no reason why we should not take this step in order to eliminate the importation of these articles which is taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not tell us what percentage of the total consumption in the country these importations represent.  At any rate, he proposes in respect of a commodity that is used in every house and office and for which there is a fairly substantial market here&mdash;in respect of industries which we had here before ever a tariff was put on, industries which were able to hold their own and to give good employment&mdash;to introduce a system of licences and quotas in addition to the 50 per cent. tariff already in operation.  There can be no other reason for that except to keep up exorbitant prices.  The Minister has told us that so many hundred thousand brushes are coming in, but he gave no indication to the House as to what are the conditions under which these brushes are coming in.  Do we understand from him that they are coming in as unfair competition against brushes that are being manufactured here in this country, or that the conditions under which they are produced in the countries from which they are coming are such that they are able to compete unfairly against a tariff of 50 per cent. imposed in this country? I have not the figures by me at the moment, but my recollection is that these figures showed there was a falling off in the employment in the brush industry in this country.  Surely with such a high tariff in respect of an old established industry that held itself against competition, an industry that improved considerably when it got a small tariff or a small amount of protection when the first tariffs were put on, we should have some detailed information as to what is wrong with that <Col N="1124" /> industry now.  It is a fact that there have been substantial imports, that the average costs of the imported brushes are falling but the Minister has not directed his attention to that matter in his statement to the House nor has he directed his attention to the increasing numbers in which these brushes are being imported.  I do not think that the House, without more complete information as to the industry and more complete information as to the type of industries against which that industry is competing from outside, should in face of a tariff of 50 per cent. on these brushes give the Minister quota powers of licensing so as to further increase the price of these commodities so that the public can only obtain them at an unnecessarily high price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement forestalled me in every word I had to say.  He admitted that there was not much improvement in the matter of employment in the brush industry.  I have had opportunities recently of speaking to the workers engaged in the trade.  They tell me that their conditions have not been improved since the Minister gave practically a monopoly to the various people who control the industry here. The brush workers tell me that in the old days when they made brushes by hand they got a fair and reasonable wage and they were in employment. They say that the Minister before putting on these tariffs got no guarantee from the employers as to the question of increasing employment.  The employers have been able to introduce into the industry very costly machinery made in other lands.  The introduction of that machinery has deprived the hand brushmakers of the employment they had.  What Deputy Mulcahy and I and others want to know is if the Minister is giving increased tariffs to any industry is it for the purpose of enabling the owners of that industry to buy costly machinery and so deprive the hand workers of their employment? The intention of tariffs at all times was, I take it, to improve employment here.  If the Minister is giving special concessions to industrialists he surely ought to get from them some <Col N="1125" /> guarantee that the employees of these industrialists should be retained.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that these concessions are not given to the employers for the purpose of reducing the production of hand-made goods, and thus replacing brush-makers by costly foreign-made machinery put up in these factories at the expense of the consumers.  The consumers as a result of the tariffs imposed by the Minister have to pay high prices for the goods purchased.  It is too bad that this should be used by the firms to enable them to purchase costly machinery to be brought in from outside countries. The brush industry is one of the victims of the present system of tariffs. I think the Minister should get guarantees from all those to whom he is giving protection, so that the result will not be a reduction of employment but an increase in employment.  The introduction of this costly machinery, we know, decreases employment.</P>

      <P>I stated in my introductory speech when proposing this resolution that we have found that on <i>ad</i><Col N="1126" /><i>valorem</i> duty on articles which are individually of very low value is usually of no effect in restricting imports.  Toothbrushes were imported here from Japan at 1/- a dozen, that is 1d. each.  A 50 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> duty on these brushes was not going to stop their importation.  The same principle applies in respect of other types of cheap brushes which are imported in large quantities; so that in articles of that class where an <i>ad valorem</i> duty is not effective it is necessary to resort to the device of a fixed or flat rate of duty of so much per article, or to have imports controlled under the Control of Manufactures Act.  Where there is reason to believe that existing firms are not yet in a position to supply in full the requirements of the country, and where it is desirable to have the imports reduced for a period we find it is much better to deal with the problem by means of quota regulations than by a high duty.  Because until production is increased to the point at which the requirements of the country can be met, imports will have to take place. It is desirable, therefore, that such imports should be permitted without any additional imposition on the people using these articles.</P>
      <P>In this particular industry considerable progress has been made.  There has been a substantial increase in the total value of production.  No doubt the firms in the industry concentrated first upon the most obvious lines, those lines in the greatest demand and those articles easiest to manufacture.  The classes of brushes which were made subject to control under this Order are in many cases of an unusual type.  The Deputy will notice from the figures I gave him as to the quotas fixed for the first quota period that the greater quantity applies in respect of Class II, that is, toilet brushes and tooth and shaving brushes.  In respect of these an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at a high rate would not be effective.  In any case it is better to control imports quantitatively, and thus effect a gradual reduction in the volume of imports, than to try to do so by imposing a duty at a higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> I think the industry, which, as the Deputy reminded us, is an old-established one, is quite capable of developing so as to produce all those classes of goods in satisfactory quantities and at a price which will be equally satisfactory. In respect of certain classes of brushes which are produced here at the moment there has in fact been an export business&mdash;not a very large export business but some export trade which, at any rate, is an indication that the prices cannot be unduly exorbitant.  The purpose of this Order is not, however, to protect unduly high prices or to enable higher prices to be charged, but to deal with a situation which cannot be dealt with satisfactorily in any other way, and at the same time to secure that this £40,000 worth of brushes now being imported can be produced here instead.</P>

      <P>The Minister's remarks in regard to the comparative prices of the type of goods being dealt with in Quota Order No. 27 and Quota Order No. 26 are not in accordance with the facts.  He suggests to us that the reason why there is a difficulty about toilet brushes,. tooth brushes and so on, is that they come in at very small prices.  If there are <Col N="1128" /> goods coming in at small prices like that, why should they not be kept out completely instead of tinkering at them with quotas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by means of the Control of Imports Act that we do keep them out completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, keep them out completely; but why extend the quota system, then, to other articles? If the Minister will look at his own figures and compare the average import price per dozen of the household and office brushes with the price of tooth and nail brushes he will find that the comparative prices are: for 1935, 4/- per dozen for the one and 3/8 per dozen for the other; for 1934, 5/- per dozen for the one and 4/1 per dozen for the other; and for 1933, 5/6 per dozen for the one and 4/5 per dozen for the other.  There was not the great discrepancy between those two classes of brushes that the Minister would lead us to understand was there.  I want to oppose this Order. It is utter nonsense on the part of the Minister, who says he stands for efficiency in industry, to want to bolster up by a quota licensing arrangement, without examination or explanation, a position that is already protected by a 50 per cent. tariff.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what he means by saying that he stands for efficiency in industry at a time when he asks us to pass a quota order to give further assistance to an industry that is already 50 per cent. protected.  It is an industry which fought its own battle without a tariff, an industry that increased in employment and output with a small tariff, and it is an industry which is being damaged under a 50 per cent. tariff, and damaged to such an extent that the Minister has to step further in.  What is wrong with the efficiency of the brushmaking industry in this country that a 50 per cent. tariff cannot protect it against the rest of the world?</P>

      <P>I referred to this when dealing with Quota Order No. 4.  This is a new Order imposing a quota restriction on heeled rubber shoes which have been taken out of the previous quota in respect of all classes of rubber shoes by the amendment of Quota Order No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us in his previous remarks on this that the general purpose, or a large part of the purpose, of the quota order on rubber shoes&mdash;I take it that it particularly applies to heeled rubber shoes&mdash; was to force the people back on leather shoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the leather shoe industry was being injured by the numbers of rubber shoes that were being imported, and that he was imposing quotas in respect of rubber shoes to an extent&mdash;and, as I understood from his remarks, to a very great extent&mdash;in order to protect the leather boot and shoe industry.  When this matter was being dealt with in the Seanad, Senator Douglas pointed out&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards shoes substantially made of leather the tariff is 30 per cent.  There the Minister is not right in saying that there has been no increase in price.  Practically all the manufacturers have increased their prices this year, and traders have been notified that there will be further increases on present prices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was speaking in April, 1936.  The <Col N="1132" /> prices of leather shoes have gone up and traders have been notified that there are going to be further increases, in spite of the fact that we read in the newspapers a few days ago of a boot manufacturing company in this country that was able to make 50 per cent. profit on its year's trading&mdash;to pay 25 per cent. dividend to some of its shareholders and to put.  I think, 25 per cent. to reserve.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister is asking us to quota rubber-heeled shoes so that people may be forced back more on the leather shoes which, we are told by a Senator who has considerable experience in this matter, have increased in price within the last year, and in respect of which warnings have been issued that increased prices are going to obtain, and when, during the last 12 months, at least one boot manufacturer in the country has made these astoundingly large profits.  Who would go digging for gold in Wicklow if he can dig 50 per cent. profit out of the boot and shoe industry in this country in one year?  I should like to hear the Minister making some kind of a case for driving people back more on leather boots and shoes, if that is the profit that is being made when they purchase leather boots and shoes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does appear to be extraordinary, considering the fact that the cost of living has gone up in this country, that wages have gone down and that the purchasing power is not what it was, that the Minister should take this opportunity to bolster up in this particular way what appears to be an industry that is already making undue profits out of the people. There is not any manner of doubt about the fact that the question of boots in this country is a very big item on the poor people.  Take the case of school children.  I know of some families where the parents are not able to provide boots for their children.  I think the Minister ought to have an eye to that, and he ought to see that they have some alternative to leather boots, if leather boots manufactured in this country are too dear.  He ought to see that, if protection is given&mdash;and certainly the boot and shoe industry in <Col N="1133" /> this country has got considerable protection up to the present&mdash;the article produced should be supplied at the right price.  Instead of that, however, the Minister comes along, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, and says that one of the prime reasons that he wanted to introduce this matter was to drive the people from rubber goods to leather goods.  The Minister certainly did give the House to understand that. I think that the Minister should justify those remarks in some way, and I should like to see in what way he will be able to justify what he appears to be desirous of putting into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain that Deputy Mulcahy did not misunderstand what I said a few minutes ago. He is just indulging in the gentle art of misrepresentation.  I am also quite certain that Deputy Brennan did not misunderstand what I said.  He is simply the echo to Deputy Mulcahy. I stated that when a quota order was made in 1934 it was made because restrictions were being imposed on the importation of leather boots and shoes, and that, in order to make these restrictions effective, there had to be similar restrictions on boots and shoes of other materials.  I am sure that anybody of any intelligence will understand that.  Now, however, these rubber boots are being made here, and there is no restriction whatever on the quantities that can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that there is no restriction on the quantities that can be made here, and it is because they are being made here that the quota order is being applied now and that the quantities permitted to be imported are being reduced.  In any event, however, as I explained before, if Deputies would take the trouble to listen and to try to understand what is said, no change is being effected except a purely administrative change.  All classes of boots and shoes were subject to restriction since 1934, but, for purely administrative reasons, it is considered better to have two quota orders&mdash;one applying <Col N="1134" /> to rubber boots and shoes without heels, and one applying to rubber boots and shoes with heels, because the quantities of each class that it is desired to import differ; and the sole change that is being made in this new Order is to separate both classes for the purpose of control and to have different quotas for each class.  As I say, it is purely for administrative purposes and it does not affect the position in respect of the control of imports in any way.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 30) Order, 1936, made on the 28th day of January, 1936, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
      <P>This Order applies the Control of Imports Act Regulations to hydraulic cement.  The necessity for this Order arose out of the recent trade agreement concluded between this country and Great Britain, under which the Saorstát undertook to purchase at least one-third of its estimated requirements of cement, for the year 1936, from Great Britain.  Imports were previously controlled under the Cement Act, but, as a result of the recent agreement, it was necessary to make this Order under the Control of Imports Act so that a condition could be applied as to the amount to be imported from Great Britain.  The first quota period commences on the 30th March, 1936, and runs up to the 30th June, 1936, and the quota appointed for that period is 118,000 tons, of which 53,000 tons is to be consigned from that country.  The total quantity of cement imported into the Saorstát last year was 335,000 tons, so that it is estimated that, in the year 1936, the Saorstát will purchase not less than 112,000 tons of British-manufactured cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I am against this Order.  The Minister is now going to make the same mess of the cement position as he did of the coal position.  This quota order is introduced because of the agreement made with Great Britain this year in respect <Col N="1135" /> of cement.  The quota order in respect of coal was made last year because of the agreement made last year with the British in respect of coal.  It has since been pointed out&mdash; based, I admit, on our experience of what has happened&mdash;that the quota need only have been applied to the few thousand tons of coal that were to come from places outside Great Britain, and that, as far as Great Britain was concerned, there is no necessity for licences in respect of the coal passing from Great Britain to this country.  The case against restricting the quota of cement, or controlling by licence the amount of cement that is going to be bought from Great Britain by us here, is even stronger now than the case was in respect of coal.  We have been told by those who boost the recent renewal and extension of the agreement between Great Britain and ourselves that, although they cannot tell us what increased quota of cattle into the British market we are going to have, our quota will in fact depend on the amount of coal, cement, and other things that we buy from Great Britain.  If quotaing the coal imports from Great Britain to this country last year had never given rise to the substantially increased price of coal to the people, arising out of nothing else but the formation of the coal ring&mdash;if we had only that to guide us, the Minister should leave outside his present licensing proposals the cement that was going to be imported from Great Britain, and it should be possible for anybody who wanted to import cement from Great Britain to do so without having to come to the Minister for a licence and to argue that his family tradition in the matter of cement was to import so much and so much, and that whoever wanted to import cement from Great Britain should be allowed to import it without licence.  In the case of coal, 5/- per ton had to be planked down, and the increased prices for coal were due almost entirely to the tax that has been taken off since.  Now we have this matter of a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this quota ever saw the light, when the rumours that were coming <Col N="1136" /> from the negotiations in London suggested that cement was going to be included, these very rumours, with only an increase of 7d. or 8d. per ton at the quay-side, brought about an increase in the price of cement for the people of this country of 6/- per ton. The very breath that licences and a quota system were to be introduced brought about an increase in the beginning of February of 6/- per ton in cement above the price in the beginning of November.  I point out to the Minister that at least one person to my knowledge bought a ton of cement in the beginning of November and paid 38/- for it.  He bought a ton of exactly the same cement on the 3rd February and paid 44/- for it, although the import price between these two dates had gone up only 7d. or 8d. per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The price went up 6/- per ton.  I cannot get the Minister to face up to what was the reason for that increase, and the person who has the complaint cannot get the Controller of Prices to face up to it, with an increase of only 8d. per ton at the port.  Just on the eve of the deal with an outside country that was likely to introduce the quota system, as happened in the matter of coal, the price went up.  The Minister has made an arrangement with Great Britain that one-third of the cement imported is to come from Great Britain.  The spirit of the agreement is that we are going to get an increased quota for agricultural produce into Great Britain based upon the amount of coal, cement, and other articles that we are going to take from them.  Why should not the <Col N="1137" /> people of this country, if they want unrestricted quantities of British cement, be allowed to get them?  If there is going to be no restriction on the amount of British cement that is to come to this country, what is the necessity for applying the licensing system, with all the experience that the Minister has of the licensing system, in raising prices to the people who buy the stuff?</P>
      <P>I oppose this quota order because the British cement should be left outside it.  If the Minister estimates that two-thirds of what we may expect to be our import of cement for the current 12 months is going to be a particular figure, then I could understand his putting a quota on cement other than British, and fixing a quota of that amount.  But if the people in this country have a preference for British cement, and if the situation is that the number of additional cattle which we can send to the British market this year is going to depend in some way on the amount of cement we buy from Great Britain, what reason is there for interfering with the trade in cement between ourselves and Great Britain, and applying the quota and licensing system to it?  As I say, the Minister has had his experience in connection with coal.  The people here have paid an unnecessary increase in the price of coal by reason of the fact that the import of coal from Great Britain had to pass through a licensing system and the Minister knows it. That fact ought to have opened the Minister's eyes and a different arrangement ought to have been made with regard to cement.  At any rate, I oppose the inclusion in this quota order of the cement that is going to be got from Great Britain.  It has already caused an increase in the price here and is going to prevent freer trade in the purchase of British cement, which might give us freer trade in the export of cattle and other agricultural produce to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if the Minister can give us any idea of how long he considers it will be necessary for us to import cement.  The Minister knows that every bag of cement that goes into a building in this <Col N="1138" /> country at present means 6d. into the pocket of the Government.  There is a tax of 6d. on every 2 cwt. bag of cement.  The Minister told us over two years ago that he hoped in a comparatively short time to have cement factories working here, producing whatever cement would be required in this country.  So far as Deputies are aware, we are as near to that home-production of cement now as we were two years ago.  This Order is one of the advantages that we were told about during the discussion on the coal-cattle pact-one of the great advantages that we were to get out of that good bargain made by the Minister and his colleagues.  I do not pretend to know anything about the qualities of cement, although I have heard more than once that British cement is supposed to be superior to Continental cement.  That may or may not be so.  So far as I am concerned, I do not know.  But I do know that if British cement were inferior, or if the British are producing a cement inferior to the cement usually imported from the Continent, under this Order we would be compelled to take one-third of our requirements from Great Britain and, so far as I know, pay any price that the British care to demand, so far as that one-third is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to address himself to a few of the practical points and to give the House some information, if he has any information to give them, regarding the effects of this Order; what effects, if any, have followed since the Order was made in January and what effects are likely to be.  He should let us know whether the Government are prepared to enter into agreements compelling the people of this country to purchase from Great Britain certain commodities, irrespective of the quality supplied or the price charged for these commodities.  I wonder what would be the attitude of the Minister if he were in the position he was in, say, five years ago: if he were in Opposition, and any Government had the hardihood to bring before the House an Order such as this. Those of us who were in the House then and who have recollections of the Minister when in Opposition would <Col N="1139" /> feel inclined to say that it would be necessary to raise the front benches a bit higher to prevent the Minister from going over the top in his denunciation and condemnation of Orders such as this if they were brought before the House.</P>
    <P>There has not been a single word of explanation, not a single reason given, as to why the Government agreed to give the British a monopoly of one-third of our cement supplies.  He gave no explanation as to why it was necessary or as to what we would get in exchange.  There used to be a great deal of talk of the fiscal freedom of this country for years and years.  It was a very much debated question.  It was one of the questions upon which leaders in this country very often differed regarding, perhaps, the political settlement in this country.  The one thing upon which most people in this country were clear was that what ever political settlement took place we should have full fiscal freedom.  And we have got full fiscal freedom, but the present Government proposes to dispose of it completely and to allow it to be tied up by what some Deputies opposite would describe as our ancient enemy.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us how long this Order is to continue, or whether he has any guarantee, or is in a position to give a guarantee as to the quality of the cement supplied under this monopoly, or whether there is any check on the price that may be charged?</P>
    <P>The Minister should take advantage of this offer to tell us what is the position in regard to the long-promised cement factories, or when the people using cement are to be relieved of the 5/- per ton tax.  The Minister has been silent over this whole question of cement for the last 12 months or two years.  He was very anxious about it at one time.  He brought in a Bill, rushed it through, apparently without sufficient consideration so great was his hurry.  Then we had to get a second Bill and then we were promised three cement factories.  That proposal is suspended and he does not tell us when the construction of the <Col N="1140" /> factory is to take place, not to talk at all about production.  The Minister ought to take the House into his confidence and tell us when we are likely to get these factories and when our people are likely to be relieved of this 5/- per ton, not to mention the monopoly without any guarantee as regards quality or price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister owes some further explanation to this House as to the manner in which he proposes to administer these licences. Deputy Mulcahy, in my opinion, has made an unanswerable case.  If we were to have licences issued for the importation of cement they ought to be issued, not in regard to British cement but in regard to other cement. I put a question to the Minister for Agriculture to-day as regards the export of cattle to Britain, and his answer was that it would depend upon our purchases from Britain.  If that is so, would it not be an obvious thing for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to allow free purchase of British cement and to license purchase from countries outside to any greater extent than two-thirds?  What does the Minister say to the licensees? Will he insist that importation includes one-third British and two-thirds foreign, or will he specify a certain number of importers that are to import this amount of British cement and let others go where they like? Was not the obvious thing to say to licensees outside Britain that it was to our advantage that the greater portion should be purchased in Britain as indicated by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to coal?  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce has an eye to that side of the business.  Perhaps he has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the great danger, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, of our having to accept any quality of article offered.  That would be obviated if our importers purchased more than one-third from Britain.  Seeing the matter from any angle you like, the object ought to be to license people buying other than British cement.  The Minister could then fairly arrive at a quota for the rest of the Order, and <Col N="1141" /> could say a certain amount was reserved for Great Britain.  I want to know how is the Minister going to restrict that?  Are they to be allowed to purchase more than one-third British?  If that is not the idea, he is doing a definite injury to the export of cattle so far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned.  If he did it the other way he would be doing a good thing by allowing more to be purchased from Britain under the Order than from other countries outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion here.  The Minister may not be aware of the possibility that it may be difficult to get cement from Great Britain even of the quantities bought there.  This is the position at the moment.  There is little cement coming in here at the moment because of the demand in Britain for British cement.  If that were to continue the issue of additional licences would be absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what all the discussion has been about.  There is no restriction upon the quantity of British cement that can be imported. There is a mimimum quantity that must be imported, but any quantity in addition to that can be imported. Any person who gets a licence to import cement into this country can import as much British cement as he likes.  The restriction requires him to import a certain amount of British cement so that our agreement with Britain can be carried out.  A person can get one order for British cement, and one for cement on which there is no restriction as to the source of importation.  It is necessary to have that arrangement in order to keep the position under control and to ensure that we carry out our trade agreement and because the Control of Imports <Col N="1142" /> Act, which is the only machinery we can utilise for that purpose, so requires. The brilliant idea Deputy Mulcahy had for dealing with the matter was not so brilliant after all. In fact, we are doing what he suggests and, in any event, there would not be the slightest difference, in effect, between what he suggests and what is being done.  Deputy Morrissey's suggestion that we must buy a certain quantity of British cement at any price they may care to charge is entire nonsense, as usual.  If the British cement exporters should attempt to exploit the position by increasing unjustifiably the price charged for their cement on importation here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then there would be a situation in which we should have seriously to consider the termination of the whole agreement.  In so far as the importation of coal is concerned, and the effect of the licensing arrangement on the price of coal, I shall merely comment on the fact that Deputy Mulcahy has once again changed his position.  He has tried to make himself a national hero on the question of coal prices and I have never been able to nail him down to the ground on which he purports to stand.</P>

      <P>It was being sold at an uneconomic price, and I warned the House then that that was not likely to continue.  It has stopped.  The Danish, Belgian and German producers have got together and decided to eliminate the competition which gave us cement at that very low price.  That does not mean that the price of cement is unduly high.  The price has gone up, but it has not been demonstrated that it has gone up unduly.  The price which prevailed here was regarded as uneconomic. It was uneconomic, and it was lower than that at which cement could be produced.</P>

In fact, a group in Great Britain got the bright idea, on one occasion, of exporting British cement from London to Dublin and re-exporting it to Liverpool.

      <P>The control of imports regulations in respect to cement have nothing whatever to do with the question of price.  Everybody who cares to do so can register himself as a cement importer, and, subject to the control of imports regulations, licences for the importation of cement are issued to those who apply for them.  There is, of course, the condition, in order to carry out our trade agreement which we regard as beneficial, that one-third of the quantity of cement imported over the whole year must be of British origin.  If, however, importers decide amongst themselves to import two-thirds of their cement from British sources, there is nothing in the control of import regulations to stop them.

This motion represents a formal change in the method of controlling the importation of cement, due entirely to the fact that it is necessary to provide for the fulfilment of our trade agreement with Great Britain, which requires us to import one-third of our total cement requirements from that country.  There is no reason why there should be any further disturbance in the cement trade than is involved by that change. There is no restriction as regards country of origin in respect of the other two-thirds of our cement requirements. There is no limitation on the quantity of cement to be imported, nor is there any reason why the operation of the Control of Import Regulations should facilitate any movement on the part of cement exporters to get higher profits from cement.  The increase in the price of cement to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred is a thing I deplore but which I cannot control. It merely means that we have been brought into line with all European countries and must buy cement from the cement cartel until we can produce it for ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason was that cement would be supplied only on that understanding.  The three producing countries from which we were getting cement, Denmark, Germany and Belgium, increased prices by 6/- a ton and supplied importers only on condition that it was sold at the price fixed by them.  That is the reason.  That price may or may not be an economic price. The price which prevailed here previously was regarded by the cement manufacturers as entirely uneconomic. Whether the present price is unduly high or unduly low it is not possible to say.  In any event we cannot control it. One thing we can do, and that is to arrange as speedily as possible to produce our own supplies.</P>

      <P>There are two quotas and consequently two licences which importers can apply for.  In respect of one licence there will be a condition that the cement must be imported from Great Britain, and on the other licence there will be no such condition.  The cement can be imported from Great Britain or any other country, as there will be no binding condition as to the country of origin.  The question of arranging for the issue of licences, so as to involve the least possible dislocation in existing trading methods, has been discussed with the organisation of cement importers.</P>

      <P>How will the Minister insist on one-third of the imports coming from Great Britain if he does not do so in a particular way?  If a man wants to import 100 tons of cement is the Minister going to insist on one-third coming from Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a total quota fixed until the end of June, and our estimate of the total amount that must be imported during that period is divided into two parts.  All the cement may not be imported, but on the reasonable assumption that it will be, a specified quantity must come from Great Britain.  Persons applying for licences can get them on one quota or the other.  Ordinarily persons get licences for requirements under the general quota and also under the special quota, or <i>vice versa</i>, but in the case of cement it may not be necessary to insist on that all the time.  In any event, we will take steps to see that the minimum quantity of British cement is imported.  Probably it will not be necessary to take any special measures to that end.  Quite possibly a proportion of the quantity of cement that will come under the general quota, without restriction as to country of origin, will come from Great Britain, and that our importation of cement will in fact exceed the figure fixed for the special quota.  So long as we have at the end of the year carried out our undertaking, we will have fulfilled our part.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £29,975 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that the &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; items of this Estimate, namely, those comprised in sub-heads A, B, C and D, are virtually the same <Col N="1151" /> in amount as they were 12 months ago. They call for no special comment by me, save perhaps a warning that should there be enacted during the present financial year a rather comprehensive measure dealing with our inland fisheries, the preliminary drafting of which is now in hands, it may be necessary to expand somewhat the administrative and technical staffs for this Service with a consequential increase in the provision now made under these four sub-heads.</P>
    <P>Coming to the heading of &ldquo;Sea Fisheries,&rdquo; I think it will probably be more convenient for all if I deal conjointly with it and the heading &ldquo;Sea Fisheries Association of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; that is to say, with the items covered by the four E sub-heads and the four G sub-heads, respectively. The amount set down at E (1) is less by £30 than the previous year's figure, because in the meantime the Gárda Síochána have found it possible to take over the collection of fishery statistics at a few more of the points where heretofore small annual fees had been paid to local persons for such work.  Sub-head E (2) is unaltered from last year.</P>
    <P>From the figures set out at sub-head E (3), it will be observed that the Master and officers of the fishery cruiser have now been placed on an established and pensionable basis, a status long enjoyed by those engaged upon duties of a similar character elsewhere.  The reduction of £250 in the provision for stores and maintenance is explained by the fact that during 1935 this vessel underwent an exceptionally heavy overhaul, and the figure of £3,750 is considered to be adequate for the coming year.  It is difficult to measure closely the requirements for the item General Expenses, which relates mainly to the operation of the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, 1933, as expenditure upon it is liable to vary considerably one year with another; but in view of actual outlay made during the past couple of seasons, the provision has been reduced from £500 to £200 this year.</P>
    <P>I may say that since taking over the fisheries services just two years ago there is perhaps no subject upon which <Col N="1152" /> so much advice has been tendered to me by correspondents as this one of sea fisheries protection.  There are those who hold that the work can be done effectively only by fishery cruisers of adequate tonnage, and there are others who believe that the solution of the problem would lie in the provision of a number of small, fast craft located at various points on the coast.  At all events everyone is satisfied that the effective patrol of our entire coastline by one cruiser is not possible.  The present vessel, which has been in commission since 1908, although well preserved, is past her first youth, and any delay that has arisen in giving effect to the intention already expressed by me more than once of providing a second cruiser is to be explained by administrative considerations as to the best method of dealing with the matter.  Should we, for instance, dispose of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; and replace her by one or two new vessels, or should we continue her in commission for some time longer and charter a second vessel as her consort on patrol duty while we are planning a permanent arrangement for the efficient policing of our exclusive fishery limits?  I incline to the latter alternative, and am having steps taken accordingly.</P>
    <P>Turning now to sub-head G (1), I have to explain that when the Sea Fisheries Association began to function in April, 1931, an understanding was reached between the directors of that body and the Minister for Finance whereby a grant-in-aid of not less than £10,000 per annum was to be provided by the Exchequer towards the administrative expenses of the Association during the first five years.  The amount was raised to £11,000 last year in view of certain exceptional expenditure which was anticipated but which did not in fact arise.  The provision for the coming year has been set down at £10,000, but the directors have been notified that the Association must gradually become self-supporting in this matter of administrative expenses, and that this Exchequer grant will henceforth be reduced somewhat year by year.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with sub-heads G.2 and G.3 together, because in practice  <Col N="1153" /> the operations of the Association that are financed from moneys provided on these sub-heads are, to a considerable extent, interwoven.  It will be recalled that the primary objective in setting up this body was to provide a means of enabling our fishermen to obtain boats and gear on terms other than those of repayment by fixed half-yearly instalments guaranteed by substantial sureties who, in view of the unsatisfactory results to such persons under the former loan system, would not readily be forthcoming.  The hire-purchase system of the Association is essentially one in which the fisherman works the chattel hired to him under the guidance of the Association to the extent that his catch is marketed for him, and from the proceeds a certain share is retained by the Association in liquidation of the member's liability. It is undoubtedly the case that, owing to the Association having started work at a time when the herring shoals had (we all hope temporarily) deserted our shores, the returns from hire purchase transactions have not been as good as was expected.  If, however, Deputies will turn to sub-head H of this Estimate, that is &ldquo;Appropriations-in-Aid,&rdquo; they will observe that the estimated repayments by the Association have risen from £3,000 last year to £4,500 now.  That this is a reliable and firm estimate is shown by the fact that the figures furnished in similar circumstances in respect of the preceding two years have, on each occasion, been somewhat exceeded in practice.</P>
    <P>One feels, therefore, that the Association is justifying its existence.  Of course, these results by way of repayments from hire-purchasers have only been made possible by the development of marketing operations by means of the funds made available to the Association at sub-head G. 2.  This provision which has been reduced from £12,000 to £10,000 must of necessity be a gradually diminishing one, as, while preliminary expenses upon the opening up of new centres and the initiation of schemes are a fair charge upon public funds, such efforts must aim at being commercially sound and in that way become a lessening charge year by year upon the Exchequer.  An increase of £2,000 is shown in the figure at G.3 <Col N="1154" /> for repayable advances, so as to enable the Association to discharge certain commitments to members in respect of boats and gear.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G.4 provision is made for repayable advances in connection with structural works of development. One of these is the construction near Gortnasate, County Donegal, of a storage pond for lobsters and crayfish which, when in operation, will enable the Association to obtain for members resident in that area much better returns for their shellfish than, owing to the absence of organised marketing, has been possible heretofore.  Another work long in contemplation which, originally, had been marked for financing from this source, was the setting up of a cleansing tank for mussels. This project has been so long under discussion that one can easily understand the note of discontent that is being sounded by those concerned in the industry at the delay that has occurred.</P>
    <P>The explanation of that delay is simply one of practicability, and, after consultation with those who have specialised on the subject, I am convinced that the only effective method of dealing with this matter would be to have the mussels taken over from the gathers by the Sea Fisheries Association, by whom the shellfish would be cleansed or purified at a centrally situated and properly equipped plant before being despatched to market.  The plans and the bills of quantities have been prepared for such a plant, a site has been on offer, and there only remains the question whether our mussels, when duly certified to have undergone such cleansing process, will be assured of entry to those markets from which, on the plea of being a danger to public health, they have been debarred.  The process of convincing the medical officers of health at many of these centres on this point must be a gradual one; but, obviously, until an assured outlet for the mussels after the cleansing process has been obtained, those charged with the care of Exchequer funds will naturally be slow to provide the money required for erecting such a plant.  It only remains to say that negotiations are still actively proceeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> Before leaving this subject of our sea fisheries I should like to say that while we have gone through a bad spell for the herring fishery, there are definite signs of a revival, and my Department is doing everything possible to ensure that markets shall be available if and when the shoals once more materialise on our coasts.  As regards the mackerel fisheries, once the mainstay of our fishermen in the south-west, it is unfortunately the fact that even if this fish returned to our waters in anything like the quantities that prevailed in former years, the difficulty of marketing the cured product would be immense.  Owing to changes in public taste in the United States of America, the demand for that commodity has fallen off in what had been our principal market.  With a view to developing other markets, a bounty was paid for a limited period last year upon consignments of pickled mackerel sent to countries other than Great Britain (which does not buy that commodity), and a certain temporary fillip was undoubtedly given to the industry, payment of the bounty having been made conditional upon the guarantee of a minimum price to the fishermen whose mackerel was taken for curing.  The results, however, were not conclusive; and I am favourably considering an application received for a renewal of the arrangement by way of further trial.</P>
    <P>As regards the demersal or trawl fisheries, I should like to record my opinion that there is here a very fine opportunity for properly utilised commercial capital.  The home market, now supplied from cross-Channel sources, is a very valuable one open to exploitation by a well-organised Saorstát trawling company.  I recommend this thought to the consideration of our capitalists.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inland fisheries, the expenditure proposed on them is set out under the four &ldquo;F&rdquo; sub-heads. At F.1 an increase of £850 is shown over last year's provision, of which £600 represents an addition to the aggregate amount provided for issue by way of grants to boards of conservators, some of whom have been in grave difficulties during the first couple of <Col N="1156" /> seasons as regards the maintenance of protection as their areas.  The other £250 of the increase is in respect of the payments to local bodies whose income from rates has been adversely affected beyond a certain point by reason of the payment direct to boards of conservators of so much of the rates as are assessed upon fisheries.  At sub-head F.2 a reduction of £120 is shown as compared with last year.  It has been decided to discontinue the arrangement under which a fish hatchery at Blackcastle, on the Boyne, had for some years been subsidised from State funds, experience having shown that this hatchery was not suitable for the supply of ova to Saorstát rivers generally, as had been in contemplation when the subsidy arrangement was made.  The other sub-heads, F.3 and F.4, show no change as compared with the previous year's figures.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, expect me to say something about the report presented by the Inland Fisheries Commission some 12 months ago and as to my intentions, by way of legislative proposals, following upon consideration of that document.  These proposals which, as I stated earlier, are now at the stage of preliminary drafting, have not yet been formulated to a degree that would permit of my referring to them in anything but general terms. When speaking on the subject here last July, I expressed the hope of introducing such proposals within a year from then, and I now think that my intentions in that respect will be duly fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The report itself was circulated quite recently, and most Deputies have, no doubt, read it through, although perhaps many of them may not yet have found time for a critical examination of its contents.  It will probably suffice for our present purpose if I call attention to the summary of recommendations which appears at page 47 of the report.  It will be noted that the major recommendations include the setting up of a body corporate to be known as &ldquo;The Central Fishery Board,&rdquo; by whom the fisheries generally (with the exception of private angling rights in the upper waters) would be worked and administered, by whom the salmon, trout and eel would be captured and <Col N="1157" /> marketed, and by whom a predetermined number of salmon would each year be permitted to reach the upper waters for the provision of angling sport and for the maintenance of stock. That Central Board would normally operate by means of trap weirs, one of which would be erected on each salmon river.  As a corollary, all netting for salmon, trout or eels except such as might be undertaken in exceptional circumstances by the Central Board would be abolished.  Incidentally the boards of conservators would be abolished and replaced by local managers acting under the Central Board and assisted in each case by an advisory committee constituted differently from the present boards.  Furthermore, all estuarine salmon and trout fisheries, all eel fisheries, and all fishing weirs would be taken over and administered by the Central Board.</P>
    <P>While, as I have already stated, I am not now in a position to do more than discuss the question in very general terms, I should like it to be known that I find myself unable to accept the proposal for the abolition of all netting. It is undoubtedly the case that some degree of restriction upon netting as now practised is necessary, but anything done in that direction will be designed so as to inflict the minimum of hardship on those concerned.  I am not satisfied that this scheme for the general use of trap weirs on our salmon rivers is practicable.  At any rate, unless and until some years' experience had been had of the working of such a trap weir it would be very unwise to commit ourselves to any such system. As regards the proposed Central Board, my view is that it would not be desirable to have in existence a body with administrative functions while at the same time bearing the responsibility of developing fisheries on a commercial basis.  At any rate I do not feel that the supersession of the present Board of Conservators by local managers (with the aid of advisory committees) working under the proposed Central Board would be an improvement on the present system; and it follows that there would really be available none of the work or responsibilities which the report envisages as being allocated to the Central Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> There are a great many relatively minor but really important matters dealt with in this report, many of which I would propose to have reflected in the forthcoming Bill.  These matters. together with the question of acquisition by the State of certain estuarine and weir fisheries, are, however, all at the moment the subject of examination by means of inter-Departmental discussions, and I feel that Deputies will agree with me in suggesting that it would be more appropriate to refrain from any detailed or definite statement upon them until I come to introduce the contemplated legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in the name of Deputy Fionán O Loingsigh&mdash;that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. A few minutes ago, just before I came into the House, I heard a discussion in the Lobby amongst certain members of the Dáil.  The query was put as to whether this was to be the last Estimate that would ever come before this House for fisheries.  The reason suggested was that fisheries had ceased to exist in this country and that therefore an Estimate was no longer necessary. This applies to the whole fishing Vote, but my remarks will be directed more or less to the particular matter of sea fisheries in this country.  I sympathise with the Minister in having to bring in an Estimate like this, because it is a matter about which I am afraid he knows very little and of which he has very little practical experience.  I know the Minister has little experience of fisheries and of fishing people. Fishing is a highly specialised form of knowledge, and I do not think the Minister is qualified to administer the Department dealing with it.  Another reason why I submit this Estimate should be referred back is because of the amount of money in the Vote. The amount is altogether inadequate, and it is out of proportion altogether to the importance of the subject. Just think, for an industry which should be second next in importance to agriculture in this country we have an Estimate for the measly sum of less than £45,000.  For a Department which is supposed to be run adequately and satisfactorily this is grossly inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> The history of the sea fishery industry in this country has been rather a melancholy one, and whatever remarks I may address to the Minister with reference to the present inept condition of this industry would apply with equal force to the Departments that administered this industry in the past.  Going back to many years before the Free State was ever set up, there is no doubt but the sea fisheries of this country were in a declining condition.  I remember well&mdash;taking my mind back nearly 40 years to the time when I was a boy&mdash; that as far as the Association of the Irish people and the Irish fisheries were concerned, the fisheries were exploited more or less in the interests of the foreigners who came to our shores.  I was brought up in a fishing atmosphere, but the fisheries were run at great profit to Manxmen, to the people of Lowestoft, Scotland, and to a great extent also to the advantage of Frenchmen.</P>
    <P>We have now arrived at the position that we are able to do what we like in the matter of our own fisheries.  We can do what we like with our own money.  We can set up a board that will deal with this important subject in a more sympathetic manner than that in which it has been treated up to the present.  Last year this Estimate went through without any discussion whatever.  The fisheries were thought of such little importance that this Vote was bundled up with other Votes and passed through here almost without a word.  For that reason it is no surprise that to-day we should find people in the Lobby here wondering whether this was going to be the last Estimate ever brought in for fisheries. Since Fianna Fáil came into power fishing has ceased to exist.  At one time certain ports were valuable from the point of view of the landing of fish and the landing of the general wealth extracted from the sea.  As I have already pointed out, a little over £44,000 is altogether inadequate as an Estimate for fisheries.  The Minister has just been telling us that the Sea Fisheries Association must look forward to the time when certain moneys <Col N="1160" /> will no longer be available to them and when certain developments must take place so as to make the industry self-supporting. I think that in no country in the world are fisheries self-supporting. It is an industry that must always be subsidised.  It must be subsidised with a view to keeping the boats and the gear of the fishermen in an adequately effective condition.</P>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries Association has done, I must admit, very important work.  It has addressed itself particularly towards developing amongst the Irish people a taste for fish.  It has been stated that one of the reasons for the falling off in this great industry is that the Irish people will not eat fish.  Now that we are cut off from the British markets and have to jump a high tariff wall, our outlets for fishing are very small.  At the same time the amount of fish our fishermen are able to get is very little and is not at all adequate to meet the wants of the country.  It is an extraordinary thing that with the large coastline that we have the imports of fish last year more than doubled the value of the fish landed by our own boats.  If I am not mistaken, I think the imports of fish amounted to £300,000, and the full value of the fish landed by our own boats was something like £146,000.  In addition to this I find that in the last two years the number of men engaged in fishing has fallen from 12,000 to 10,000&mdash;that is a falling-off of 2,000 men in two years.  That certainly shows that the industry is declining and that the sea has less attraction for our fishermen.  In considering a subject like this the first thing that enters into a person's mind is the inadequacy of the protection afforded to our fishermen. The Minister has admitted for the first time and rightly admitted, that the Muirchu is altogether out of date and ineffective for the protection of our fisheries.  That boat is manned by a very excellent crew but the coast line of Ireland is altogether too large a sphere for one boat to be able to control in a proper way the activities of foreign trawlers.</P>
    <P>Various ideas have been put forward for the protection of our shores. Aeroplanes, small motor boats, and so <Col N="1161" /> on have been mentioned.  I agree with the Minister that such things are not practical.  What we want is the class of boat that will stop at sea under the same conditions as one of the modern trawlers.  Such a vessel would need to be well engined and strongly built. I should like to give the Minister a practical suggestion; we might consider the provision of at least three boats, one to patrol the south coast, another to patrol the east coast, and another to patrol the west coast.  They should be boats of the type employed during the War as mine sweepers; the class of boat that would stop at sea in any class of weather, equipped with wireless and carrying a crew of from ten to 20 men.  Some time ago a suggestion was made with regard to the creation of the nucleus of an Irish navy.  That idea was laughed at by some people, but I think it might become a practical idea if we could consider the formation of a small fleet of three or four boats that would give adequate protection to our shores, and be able to keep off the marauding trawlers that are still coming in night and day, fishing under the very noses of our fishermen, and depriving them of the living to which they are entitled. Apart from the harm that these foreign trawlers do, there is the trouble of getting any inshore fish.  These boats scrape the spawning beds, particularly on the south coast, and inshore fish are very difficult to get now.  The white fish that used to be so abundant along the coast are very difficult to get now, and most of the fish that we in the south of Ireland get is imported from Milford or Grimsby.  The irony of the thing is that most of that fish has been caught along the coast between the Fastnet and the Tuskar Rock.  One of those is in the Minister's constituency and the other is in mine, so we should have a sort of common interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a Bill was introduced by the Minister and passed into law. It was supposed to afford adequate protection and improve the facilities we already had for keeping those trawlers outside the three-mile limit.  I do not think that this law has been in any way effective or has in any way helped <Col N="1162" /> to decrease the destruction done by these trawlers, so I would again emphasise the necessity for doing something with regard to those trawlers and doing it in a very decisive way.  The Minister has suggested that there is an opening for the investment of private capital in a trawling company that would provide fish for our Irish market.  I do not think that is feasible at the moment, and I will go back to another point which is very important.  Owing to the decline infishing, we have lost our fishing instinct to a terrible extent, and the young men along the harbours of our coast who should be trained up in the ways of their fathers in the fishing line have been forced to go to other parts of the world to earn the living which they could not get at home.  I have already spoken of the decline even in the last two years of about 2,000 in the number following the sea as a vocation.</P>
    <P>The Minister perhaps may ask me where we are going to get the necessary money.  I believe that nothing can be done with regard to the reestablishment of fishing as an adequate industry in this country unless it is done in a big way and a bold way, and to do that you must get money.  I would consider that a yearly sum of any less than £250,000 would be no use. That could be used for the development of the protection which I have outlined, and funds should also be given to the Sea Fisheries Association to develop their ideas with regard to providing nets, gear and boats.  Something must also be done with regard to training our young men to get back into fishing habits.  A lot of them have gone away and joined the British Mercantile Marine.  Some of them have gone to England to do railway work and other work of that kind away from the sea altogether.  There is a population on our coasts to which this industry of fishing should be a valuable one. This problem should be tackled in a big way.  We have been tinkering with it in such a manner that the industry is practically extinct.  No matter how well administered the Fisheries Department may be, and no matter how active and enthusiastic the members of the Sea Fisheries Association may be, they cannot do anything tramelled as they <Col N="1163" /> are by lack of funds.  Where are we going to get the money?  That is a practical point, and it is not for me to make any suggestion to the Minister. I accept no administrative responsibility for the provision of this money, but if we look back at some of the other estimates we will see how the expenditure and personnel of other Departments have been increased.  In the personnel of the Revenue Department there has been an increase of 500 since 1931-2 and that one Department alone is costing over £100,000 extra.  If you go down through the list of estimates you will find other Departments in which there has been increased expenditure on a similar scale.  It may be warranted by circumstances; it is certainly warranted or rather excused by a policy of which we cannot approve, and that brings us back again to the existence of the economic war.</P>
    <P>On an Estimate such as this I suppose we cannot enter into a discussion on the economic war, but it does bear on fisheries as well as it bears on agriculture, because our best market for fish, when we had a really good fishing industry in this country, was found in London, Leeds, and the other big cities in England where we sent our mackerel.  The Minister says that mackerel have now ceased to attract fish eaters, but I think there is always a market for mackerel if they can be caught.  There is also a market for herrings and any other sort of fish you can catch in this country.  Even the rough fish that we will not eat here would always find a market in England if we had not the senseless tariffs caused by the senseless policy of the Government.  The Fisheries Department must be up-to-date.  Boats that were effective some ten years ago or more would be absolutely out-of-date in this year, and for that reason a Department like the Fisheries Department should be kept thoroughly up-to-date. You must provide new methods, and you must train the young men to take up fishing.  There is a market for fish, and all we want is a better understanding with our neighbour. With regard to the three-mile limit, which is the most we can adequately <Col N="1164" /> patrol at the present time and outside of which we have no control over those trawlers, I think that by a proper understanding with our neighbour in Britain an arrangement could be arrived at by which the territorial limit with regard to fishing could be adjusted, and we could have a sort of convention which would help both our neighbour and ourselves to make more use of the fishing laws.  There should be a little give and take and a better understanding with regard to the protection of fishing grounds within the three-mile limit, or whatever limit may be fixed.  Our coast bye-laws also require revision.  I suggest to the Minister that they are very mixed up. There are too many of them, and they are too complicated in certain ways. This is a matter which I have often asked the Department to turn its attention to.  I suggest that these bye-laws relating to fishing, and to trawling particularly, should be codified and simplified.  I think it should not be impossible to have a code of laws that would apply to the whole coast, instead of having the number of laws we have at present.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with this Department which I think ought to be remedied.  Some years ago&mdash;I think, in 1931&mdash;the then Minister for Fisheries brought in a Bill for the remitting of certain loans which were granted to fishermen and fishing-boat owners for the provision of boats.  These boats after some years were found to be useless.  They were of a type that were no good and that did not suit modern conditions, and, in some cases, the fishermen were not able to repay the loans.  At that time, a very strong appeal was made by the Opposition, now the Government Party, to wipe that slate clean, and to remit all the arrears due in these cases.  The then Minister did not see fit to do so, but that was five years ago, and the condition of things has, of anything, got worse.  The men who were unable to pay then, are very much less able to pay now.  These men who are still engaged in the fishing industry, and who would be active in it, are unable, by reason of the debts hanging over their heads, to take up <Col N="1165" /> fishing in the way they would like to take it up.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would remind the Minister that some of the persons who had their debts remitted on that occasion were men who had given up fishing, and who had put their money into land, but those who are now being pursued by State Departments&mdash;State solicitors, and men of that type&mdash;are men who are still engaged in fishing and trying to make something out of it.  I recommend these men to the mercy of the Minister, and, through him, to the mercy of the Department of Finance, and I ask to have these loans remitted.  That was part of the present Government's policy in 1931.  The clean slate was advocated very strongly by President de Valera, and supported by Deputy Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is better acquainted with the fishing circumstances of the Irish coast than any other man in this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the bounty on cured mackerel, the Minister says it was not very successful last year.  I beg to differ from him on that point, because, from what I have learned during my visits to some of the sea-ports around the south-west coast, I believe that all the cured mackerel were cleared from those ports last autumn.  That would not have been the case if the bounty had not been given, and the Minister might very well consider the question of a bounty on all fish that we would export&mdash;not only for autumn cured mackerel, but for spring cured mackerel and fish exported in every form.  It would give a great incentive to the trade, and would help us to build it up.  It would not be a very big thing and it would be something that would repay the country very well in the end, because it would help many of the 10,000 people around the coast who are depending on fishing for a living.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the Minister should go to the Executive Council and put before them the fact that fisheries at the present time are simply a joke, and that an Estimate of £44,000 for such an important industry is farcical. He ought to get more money, <Col N="1166" /> and tackle this question, if he is really serious about it, in a very big way. Of course, I know that the Minister has not very much direct acquaintance with fishing, and without the direction of a strong man, with knowledge, I am afraid this Department can never be made to go ahead.  We need to change the psychology of some of our fishermen, too.  We must get hold of some of the younger men and give them more imagination and put more drive into them.  We must make our fishermen understand that the fish will not come to them, but that they have to pursue the fish.  We have got into such a state that we believe the fish ought to be brought into our harbours, and that the fishermen should have nothing to do but to catch them.  Our fishermen must have more initiative and that can be encouraged by Departmental guidance and control.</P>
    <P>In that direction, I think a little more push and pep ought to be put into the Sea Fisheries Association, with a view to getting them to do more in that line.  The Sea Fisheries Association, however, will not be able to do it unless they get more money.  More money is wanted for fishing, and it would be better for us to lose £200,000 in fishing than to lose it in&mdash;I will not say wild-cat schemes&mdash;but in such ill-advised schemes as the Minister had for marketing and the finding of new markets which he adopted in regard to agricultural produce.  We have the Atlantic all round us; we have the men if they can be trained.  All we want is the material advantage of up-to-date boats and the opportunity of teaching our people up-to-date methods.  In that way, I believe fishing can be brought out of the terrible condition in which it is at present.  It is really non-existent in most ports where it once was a flourishing industry.  It cannot be made a flourishing industry unless it is tackled in a very big way, with drive behind the effort.  Without the drive, and without money to help, there is no use in tinkering with it by bringing in an Estimate of such an inadequate amount as £44,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the last speaker when he says there is not sufficient money <Col N="1167" /> at the disposal of the Minister to enable him to develop fishing as it should be developed.  I also agree with him when he says that in a great many places that were known as fishery ports in the past, very little fishing is being done at the moment.  I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to show his earnestness in this matter he should approach the Executive Council with a view to getting more money to enable him to develop the fisheries as I know he has it in his mind to develop them.  In dealing with the question of the patrol of our coasts, the Minister was very indefinite.  He did not tell us what he proposes to do in the near future to protect our coasts.  He confined himself to comparing certain methods which had been put before him.  I think the Minister knows quite well that adequate protection is not being afforded at the moment.  He need only go to his files to find letters from his own constituency &mdash; I know they have been sent repeatedly from time to time &mdash; pointing out that on the south-east coast there are continually a number of foreign trawlers to the detriment of the fishermen from Courtown right around to Carnsore Point, on the Wexford coast alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have liked to have heard the Minister telling us something about the effect of the recent visit of the Muirchu to the Saltee Islands, immediately after the altercation which took place between the French trawlers and the Kilmore fishermen. I suggest to him in all earnestness that he should approach the Executive Council with a view to getting more adequate protection for our coasts. As Deputy O'Neill has pointed out, a great many people who had been engaged in fishing in the past have given it up in disgust because they were not being adequately protected and not being provided with proper markets.  Some people will say, and I think the Minister has said, that there is not the demand for fish in this country that there is in other countries.  I do not hold with that <Col N="1168" /> view at all.  There is a demand, a greater demand than most people think, and that demand is not being catered for.  I live in a sea-port town, the town of Wexford, and I think I would be right in saying that for nine months out of the year you cannot get fish in Wexford.  There certainly must be something wrong when such a state of affairs exists, in view of the fact that there are plenty of fish outside in the bay.  I suggest now, when there has been investigation into the inland fisheries, the Minister ought to get somebody with a proper knowledge of sea fisheries to go into the whole matter and find out what is really wrong and what is the best method of harvesting the fish which is certainly immediately outside our shores.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's statement, he referred generally to the findings of the recent Commission on Inland Fisheries, and told us that a comprehensive Bill was in course of preparation and that he hoped it would be introduced during the coming year.  In that connection, I do hope that the Minister will not do anything to implement the suggestion contained in the recent report of the commission to the effect that net fishing should be prohibited.  The Minister is very familiar with the position that prevails in his own constituency, where men in Oylegate, Edermine, Ferrycarrig, Killurin, Wexford, New Ross and other towns are entirely dependent on net fishing for a living.  The Minister is aware of the conditions there and he knows that there are 3,000 or 4,000 people depending on net fishing in the inland fisheries in Wexford for a living.  I am glad to note that the Minister has stated that he is not going to adopt all the recommendations in their entirety, especially with regard to netting.  I know that the Minister has been in close touch with the people down there in recent years and that he knows the feelings of the men down there, and I feel that he will act accordingly.  I must say that it is very hard to understand the mentality behind that suggestion in the report, in view of the fact that there are so many people unemployed in the country.  In many parts of the country, <Col N="1169" /> where inland fishing is good in summertime, thrifty people are able to make a living, as a result of the fishing during that time, sufficient to keep them for the rest of the year, and one shudders to think what would happen to them if that source of livelihood were to be cut off.  I therefore suggest to the Minister that that particular portion of the findings of the commission should be turned down, and I would also urge him to go thoroughly into the question of the protection of our fisheries and of providing a proper market for the fish when caught.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the development of fisheries here will have to have regard to the home market. I do not agree that there is a market across the Channel, to the extent that there used to be, at all events, for Irish fish.  When the market was good across the Channel, the kinds of fish principally exported were mackerel and herrings, and we know that the European market for these kinds of fish has practically disappeared.  Even the British Government themselves have been trying for the past 12 months to get markets in Europe for their herring fleet.  I understand that they succeeded in a certain extent on the Continent, and that has made it all the more difficult, I believe, for this country to find an outlet in Europe for our herrings.  Therefore, I say that the absence or the practical disappearance of an outside market for the types of fish we used to export has necessarily given us a new outlook on the development of fishing here at home.  When speaking with fishermen on the West coast in connection with this matter generally, I find that they have in mind the very profitable mackerel fishing that existed during the War period.  I find that they have particular regard to the War period. Well, I do not think that that can be hoped for again, and for that reason I think they should have particular regard to the home market.  As a matter of fact, the Sea Fisheries Association has been trying to get the fishermen back to trawl fishing and to producing a class of fish for which there is a demand here at home.  They have been trying to get them back to <Col N="1170" /> the old type of fishing that they had long ago, and they have also developed trawling to a certain extent by the issue of boats.  I think that that would have to continue, and I do not think there is a very great market across the Channel, because there is a very large part of the cross-Channel fleet, as we know, in our fishing.  As a matter of fact, some years ago some of them were on hire or on charter here by the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
      <P>There are two alternatives.  Either the Government has got to continue its present policy of trying to encourage the development of inshore fisheries, or else get out of the business altogether and leave it to commercial people to develop the industry on the same lines as fishing is run across the Channel.  If we merely have in mind the production of the amount of fish that we require for our own use here at home each year, it is quite possible that that could be done much more effectively by commercial undertakings such as the Dublin Steam Trawling Company; but I do not think that would be wise.  I think we ought to reserve the largest possible part of it for the inshore men, but there you are up against the difficulties.  The previous Administration had to introduce a Bill dealing with a loan plan in connection with fishing, and a good deal of the loans were wiped out.  I think that, in some cases, that Act was rather generously interpreted, but I think that we would be up against the same prospect in connection with any new big issue of loans.  There is a lot of money out now under the new scheme of the Sea Fisheries Association, and I do not think that the results are as good as one would like them to be.  I know that part of the coast I represent has not got very generous treatment, and in the last 12 months or so a rule has been put into operation whereby a person seeking an engine or power craft must put down one-tenth of the cost.  Well, there are not many fishermen able to do that, and I should like to see that rule wiped out for a period.  I also hold that the Minister should insist that those parts of the country that did not get fair treatment in the matter of motor-boats should get special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Certain parts of the country have got a number of boats and the returns, as I say, have not been as good as one would have liked.  Of course, I am not saying that other parts of the country would be any better, but fishing is a very up-and-down industry, and, as I say, the only sheet we can catch on to now is the home market for development. I do not think it would be wise that an arrangement, such as the new co-operative marketing arrangement under the Sea Fisheries Association, should be operated on a basis of seasonal fishing such as herrings and mackerel.  It can only have a basis on all-the-year-round fishing, and nobody operating a scheme of that kind could possibly do well if he had to depend on mackerel or herrings, because the idea, in my opinion, would be to develop the general type of fishing, get the people back to the old type of fishing, even if it is going to be carried out, as it must be carried out, by the newer methods of the all-the-year-round fishing.</P>
    <P>I agree to a certain extent with the Deputy on the opposite side who said that a larger amount of money will have to be spent if the desired results are to be achieved.  At the same time, I do not think, in view of previous experience, that a great deal of complaint can be made about the caution displayed by the Government.  After all, they have had the experience of the Fisheries (Revision of Loans) Act under which large sums of money were wiped out.  In that case, of course, if boats were issued to applicants they had to get two bail bonds.  A new system was found under the co-operative marketing whereby instead of getting bonds the applicant for the boat signed a marketing arrangement under which he handed over his fish to the Sea Fisheries Association and they marketed it for him and deducted a certain percentage against the charges on the boat.  That has been, in my opinion, an experiment that is well worthy of further trial.  As I say, it has not produced the results that we would like, but at all events, it is a very good alternative to the old arrangement.  I think it was the <Col N="1172" /> general experience that where a purchaser of a boat defaulted, the bail bonds were of very little use to the Department.  I am sure that has been the experience of the Department of Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that the Muirchu ought to be scrapped.  I do not think it is at all fit for its purpose. It cannot be on three coasts at the same time and these foreign trawlers know the Irish coast possibly better than the Irish people themselves. It is not easy to catch them. Short of the alternative boats suggested by the first speaker, I think there ought to be some better co-operation between fishermen and the Civic Guards and, if possible, the military. I think it ought to be possible for specially selected Guards, or soldiers where possible, to get the use of rifles at short notice, and if there is a Sea Fisheries Association boat, or any other boat of that kind, there ought to be an arrangement made whereby it would be placed at the disposal of the Guards where it is necessary to chase these poachers.</P>
    <P>I like the idea of the three boats suggested of the mine-sweeper type. If it were possible, I should like to see a double-purpose boat, that is a boat which will protect the fisheries and also engage in fishing itself, possibly in the nature of a training boat, on occasions.  Whatever the alternative to the Muirchu is to be, I think it is advisable that an alternative should be found.  It is not possible for it to give the service which we expect of it.  I think it ought not to be beyond the ingenuity of the Department to find an alternative type of boat which would suit.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, I think, to lay down the law about the revival of fishing. Everybody must admit that it has been a very difficult matter, particularly in post-war years.  I do not think that it is fair to say that the economic war is responsible for the present position. If Deputies will refer to the reports, they will find that 1927 was the peak post-war year, and we have had a steady decline since 1927, which was five years before the advent of the present Government.  It is only fair that <Col N="1173" /> it should be recognised that the economic war has not been responsible for the decline.</P>
    <P>I think that the present system of co-operative marketing is a good one. It gives the Department a grip on the hire purchaser of a boat which it had not previously.  I should like to see greater risk taken in the matter of providing these boats, with, of course, proper discrimination as to who should be accepted as purchasers.  I should like to see the scheme further extended, particularly in those parts of the coast which have not had the advantage of the facilities up to this. The present policy should be continued of developing the fishing with an eye on the home market and afterwards we can possibly look further afield.  With certain alterations, the present policy is not a bad one.  I should like to see a more generous expenditure of money and I would appeal to the Minister, if at all possible, to wipe out the deposit of 10 per cent.  Which applicants for a motor-boat must now pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether we have a quota for herrings under the German trade pact.  I agree with Deputy O'Neill with regard to the Vote.  He stated that somebody said that this was probably the last Vote for this Department.  If it is not the last, it should be the last, because, so far as I can learn from any source, sea fishing in this country is dead.  If the weather was warmer.  I would suggest that Deputies should go out after warble flies instead of wasting time discussing this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to enumerate the reasons which have brought about the entire collapse of this industry.  I sincerely regret its passing, but so far as I can see there is no life in it, and I see no prospect for it.  There are various reasons for that, I suppose. The decline began shortly after the war and has gone on year after year since, until it has now almost completely disappeared. So far as winter fishing is concerned, anybody who was foolish enough to invest money in the curing of the fish and who was able to hawk them round the country in a lorry probably disposed of 200 barrels, but the <Col N="1174" /> remainder lie in stores.  If these are not disposed of before the end of this month they must be put into cold storage.  From inquiries I made I find that it is utterly impossible to ship them anywhere.  It is a sad thing to have to say that to-day it is almost impossible to sell 300 barrels of herrings.  If that is true, it is a terrible commentary on the fact that we are voting £44,000 here for this Department.</P>
    <P>I notice that £14,000 is going to be advanced for the purpose of purchasing boats and gear for the Fisheries Association.  It is simply waste.  If it is a fact that herrings cured in Ireland are utterly unsaleable, then I think it is unfair to men round our coast, who know the facts at present, but they do not know the prospects of the future, to induce them to purchase boats and gear to the value of £14,000.  I venture to suggest that they will not make one penny out of it so far as herrings are concerned, except in the case of loads caught and sold fresh.  I suggest to any prospective borrower of that money, so far as my views go, not to avail of it.  The next fishing we are to have round our coast is the matge, May fishing.  Our boats are entirely unsuited for the May fishing which has to be done 15 or 20 miles from the coast.  Our boats are too small to go out after that catch.  That fishing is mainly done by Scottish trawlers.  In this connection I join with Deputy O'Neill in saying that if a substantial attempt is to be made to deal with this matter, then, a substantial sum of money must be found.  It must be made a business proposition no matter where the money comes from. We will have to provide larger boats if we are to go out 25 or 30 miles from the coats.  And it will be found that, having provided these boats and gear and crews, we will be unable to provide a market for the catches.  Certainly the smaller boats are unable to take part in the matge fishing for herrings. I suggest that, in the main, our boats, even if they had 1,000 barrels, so far as the matge herrings are concerned, will not sell one barrel, by sending them abroad.  There are some inquiries from America and Antwerp and one or two inquiries from Czecho-Slovakia. <Col N="1175" /> But they are very slow in buying, or taking up a decent order, and they are slower still in offering a decent price for these herrings.</P>
    <P>This Department seems to have entirely collapsed since it was taken over by the Minister for Agriculture. It may have been his bad luck or that he struck a bad patch or that he came in at a fatal hour.  But, certainly, so far as this industry is concerned the fatal hour has arrived.  It is sheer waste of time to be discussing this industry in its present condition.  One could waste an hour in destructive criticism as to what is being done but that is rather futile.  On the other hand one who has no responsibility in the matter with regard to doing anything or who cannot do anything, does, perhaps, leave himself open to criticism in making any constructive suggestion. But I do earnestly join with Deputy O'Neill in suggesting that one of two things should be done; one is that this Department should be closed down, or alternatively that some other Minister, or some other man, should take a grip of the Department, and that a substantial sum of money should be given to him to put this industry upon its feet.  Otherwise it is a question of sheer waste of money in the main.</P>
    <P>To talk about this industry is futile unless we are going to put it on its feet in a substantial way which will mean providing a substantial sum of money.  Deputy O'Neill suggested £250,000 annually.  It may be, as years go by, that a yearly sum of £250,000 might do, but at the commencement a very much larger sum would be necessary. One difficulty might be that after you spent a substantial sum of money you could not now get the crews to man the boats.  The older men are too old to fish to-day, and the younger men have dropped off.  There is no attraction for any man to fish.  The only thing would be to do something that would strike the imagination of the young men around the coast whose fathers had been fishermen.  It would be a very bold step to take and it could only be taken with money.</P>
    <P>Talking about the protection of the <Col N="1176" /> coast, everybody knows our coasts are not protected.  It is a matter of common knowledge.  But if we left the industry to die why bother about protecting it?  Are we going to protect it?  That is one of the questions that should be joined up with the question of putting the industry on its feet.  I was rather struck with the suggestion of Deputy O'Neill of buying two or three boats of a very effective character for the purpose of patrolling our coasts. I made a suggestion, two or three years ago, that rather substantial boats, well engined and fast, which could be used for the dual purpose of fishing and protecting the fisheries, should be purchased.  These boats at one moment could be acting as a sort of decoy, fishing or pretending to be fishing, and could be ready to start off at a moment's notice on learning of the presence of foreign trawlers During the war Germany gave us an idea of this sort of thing, and it was very quickly followed and adopted by other countries.  I do not know much about boat building or about navies, but I would agree with the need for providing boats of that sort.  It would be a very good idea if we could get an effective boat of that kind, well built and well engined that could serve the double purpose of fishing and patrolling. If by wireless, for instance, it was ascertained that there were no foreign trawlers along the coast, such boat could pursue her productive work of catching fish.  But at the moment it is all an idea.</P>
    <P>In this country we have a huge coastal population.  They have been living round the coast coupling farming with fishing all their lives, but they never seem to have got a solid grip of fishing.  The fact is they are half small farmers and half fishermen.  They do some winter and May fishing for herring. They spend a month salmon fishing and then they come back to work on their plots.  This State will not have a fishing industry unless it has a body of men who will take up fishing as a profession, man their boats and pursue the fish during all the seasons of the year.  If the fish are not to be had around the coast of Ireland, then there should be a body of <Col N="1177" /> Irish fishermen who would follow the example of the Scottish, Norwegian, French and English fishermen and go elsewhere in search of the fish.  This business of waiting for a shoal of herring to come into the bay, catch a few of them, put them into barrels and then sit down until the next shoal arrives, will never create a fishing industry&mdash;an industry which will assure the foreigner who wants a supply of fish of efficient service.</P>
    <P>It would be idle to go into the items of this Estimate because the only question at issue is whether or not we are going to vote this money.  In my opinion, we should not do so.  The Minister is not entirely responsible, seeing that this industry is only a short time under his control.  But the industry is dying and it will be dead if the Minister remains much longer in office.  What I do not like in connection with this Estimate is not so much the money involved but the absence of any indication from the Minister in his opening speech that he is about to make a bold effort on behalf of the industry.  That is why I blame him.  Before we had a Government of our own in this country, Irishmen made a very bold effort to keep this industry on its feet.  When the Treaty was signed in 1921, the fishing industry was by no means negligible, notwithstanding that the country had not a Government of its own.  All the big Powers are spending enormous sums of money on their fishing industry. England, France and Germany are voting large sums for the development of their fisheries.  The militaristic-minded person may say that that money is being voted for an ulterior purpose&mdash;to train seamen.  But while there may be an ulterior motive, what the men are engaged at is fishing. Our fishing industry is almost dead. Why?  Because these countries are spending these enormous sums on the building up of efficient fishing industries. Our industry is so impotent and weak that it is disappearing in this contest.  It is in the position of other industries which are crushed out by huge combines.</P>
    <P>I was told along the coast a few days ago that, now that no provision was made for the fishing industry in our <Col N="1178" /> trade pacts, there will be no May fishing. What prospect is there for young men to go into the industry?  It is futile to ask them to do so.  Deputy O'Neill suggested that the Sea Fisheries Association had developed a taste for fish amongst the people.  My experience does not confirm that.  Along certain bays during the winter, men who caught fish were prepared to sell them cheaply.  But the people jcered at them when they came along with small carts and they told them that they had plenty of free beef.  The Minister for Agriculture is in that capacity killing an industry for which he is responsible in another capacity.</P>
    <P>I notice on a slip in the Report on Inland Fisheries the statement that the cost was £1,030 and the cost of printing £127.  It is, therefore, a rather costly document, but it is really not worth the paper on which it is printed. There is only one suggestion which could be adopted from the practical point of view.  That is a rather interesting suggestion.  It is that one of the men on this board which it is proposed to set up should be a person with legal knowledge and that another should be a man with experience in the sale and handling of fish.  I was certainly tickled when I read that clause.  It makes one smile to think that one of these three men who are to look after the fishing industry is to be a man with legal training.</P>
    <P>The main suggestion of the Tribunal is that drift-net fishing for salmon should be abolished.  That shows that the men who made that recommendation were either utterly ignorant or indifferent.  The suggestion was that we should wait until the fish come up to the neck of the river, scoop them up and put them into boxes.  Anybody who knows anything about fishing&mdash;I do not suggest that I know a lot about it but I know a little&mdash;is aware of what occurs in a dry season.  When there is no fresh water up the river, the fish know that, though they are not in the river.  Therefore, they remain out in the bay&mdash;sometimes a considerable distance out&mdash;and, ultimately, if they find that the season continues to be dry and that there is no use in their hanging about, they go back to sea.  This <Col N="1179" /> commission, which was set up by the Government and for which this money was voted, makes this suggestion! That is the one constructive suggestion they put up for dealing with this industry.  We have had three very dry seasons.  There were limited periods during those three years when there was a run of fish but, in the main, there was no run of fish.  Large numbers of salmon which would have gone up these rivers in the ordinary course lay out at the mouths of the bays and finally did not come up the rivers at all.  The suggestion, nevertheless, is that we wait at the mouth of the river until those fish come up, put out a net and catch them.  I am very glad the Minister has turned that suggestion down.  There is another proposition about the construction of weirs for catching fish.  I do not know what inspired that. Apparently the whole thing is a question of slaughter, like the attack that is being made this year on warble flies.  They were to be killed and, apparently, there was to be no trouble about it.  Fish at the estuaries were to come to the neck of the rivers and traps were to be made for fish higher up, and then, apparently, men were to be employed with sticks to knock these fish on the back of the neck. There is a society in this country for the prevention of cruelty to animals which might get busy there.  I regret the condition into which this industry has fallen.  For many years I have been interested in it, directly and indirectly.  A great friend of mine gave some of his best efforts to sustain the industry, but I feel glad that he is not alive to-day to see the depths to which it has sunk.  I desire to support Deputy O'Neill's proposal, that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the remarks of the Minister relative to the mussel-fishing industry, and although County Meath has a very small coast-line, yet the fishing industry there is of a substantial character.  Considerable hardship has been inflicted upon people there owing to the action of medical <Col N="1180" /> officers in various towns in England refusing to certify that mussels entering the markets are free from sewage. I was glad to hear the Minister stating that the proposal for the erection of a cleansing tank for the purification of mussels has not been lost sight of, and that bills of quantities and plans for such a tank are in hands. I was also glad to hear that negotiations are proceeding with a view to securing the consent of the medical authorities in England to admit mussels that have passed through a purification tank without undergoing any further inspection, or purification process. Although negotiations in that respect may be proceeding, I would like to know from the Minister if any headway has been made during the past 12 months.  Local fishermen engaged at the mouth of the Boyne at Mornington, inform me that they are satisfied that a market exists across the Channel for the mussels, if they are purified.  A number of towns which were hitherto supplied from Mornington have made inquiries as to the possibility of obtaining supplies, following the erection of a tank to purify the fish.  I know that the reason these markets were restricted in the past ten years was not the Minister's fault.  They were closed before this Government came into power and the previous Government was unable to take effective steps to have the restrictions removed.  It is well known that 200 people make a living by fishing for mussels in Mornington, especially during the slack period of the winter months, while in spring and summer they are engaged in net-fishing for salmon at the mouth of the Boyne.  I was pleased to learn that the Minister has the interests of these net-fishermen at heart, and that it is not proposed to take away their means of livelihood.  If there is delay in securing the consent of medical officers in England to the admission of mussels to the markets there, I think the Minister should take into serious consideration the advisability of having a small tank erected at Mornington. The most effective method of dealing with the position, as stated by the Minister, would be to have the industry taken over by the Sea Fisheries Association, especially from the point <Col N="1181" /> of view of marketing.  In case there is any more delay, seeing that the market is there, I ask the Minister seriously to consider the question of erecting a small tank.  The original intention was to have a tank erected on lines somewhat similar to one at Conway, in North Wales.  Last summer I saw a rather small tank which was erected on the River Ribble in Lancashire, and it appeared to me that the expense would be small.  Such a tank could easily be adapted to suit the requirements of the fishermen in County Meath.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister is doing his utmost to secure a market which was lost a few years ago for our fishermen. Grants were given by the Department during the winter months in recent years for the extension of the musselbeds at the mouth of the Boyne, and as these are now ready for harvesting it would be a disaster if this potential source of wealth was lost to these fishermen and to the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy McMenamin has fairly accurately expressed the opinion of most people in this country with regard to the Government attitude towards the fishing industry.  Everyone is unanimous that they are not serious in anything they might do in regard to this industry; that in fact they do not care twopence for it; and are quite content to see it gradually die.  I think it would be far decenter if they stopped the farce and did not propose to expend this large sum of money doing nothing. We cannot discuss with very much use the report with regard to inland fisheries which was mentioned by Deputy McMenamin, but I am glad to see that the Minister is not prepared to accept it, at any rate, in entirety. A question has already been raised by Deputy Corish, with regard to tidal waters, and estuary net fishing.  There are other items in the report which are equally unsatisfactory.  I think it has been received unfavourably in all parts of the country and I do not think we are likely to hear very much more about it.  I certainly do not envy the Minister if he has to produce a Bill regulating inland fisheries, because the whole subject is so complicated and <Col N="1182" /> local conditions are so different on each river that to prepare legislation capable of dealing with the whole situation and to generalise regulations would be extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>So far as sea fisheries are concerned, apparently the Government are not serious in their desire to remedy the situation.  They have allowed fishermen to suffer as a result of the economic war.  One Deputy suggested that the economic war had nothing to do with the decline of the fishing industry. That is not so.  Deputies know perfectly well that although fishermen, as such, have nothing to do with the land annuities dispute, they have had to pay their share of the land annuities through taxes imposed on the fish exported.  The Minister ought to be well aware that, during recent years, trawlers, particularly British vessels, have waited outside the three-mile limit at night and Irish fishermen have gone out surreptitiously to them to sell their fish at a better price than they could secure by selling them in Ireland and then having them taxed when sending them over to England.  That was a very common practice for some years; I do not know if it still continues. It certainly disproves the suggestion that the economic war has had nothing to do with the decline in the fishing industry.  In view of the fact that fishermen have nothing to do directly with the land annuities dispute, I think they should have got bounties corresponding to the total amount of the taxes imposed on their exports of fish.  That has not been done.  It was only after a year or two that in some particular categories a small bounty was granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to protection, it is universally agreed that it is a farce having only one boat to patrol the whole Saorstát coastline.  It is rather interesting to recollect that some six or seven years ago, when members of the present Government were here in opposition, they carried on a great agitation because of the inadequate protection given to Irish fisheries. Hardly a week passed without some question being submitted or some speech being made by persons who are now Ministers, criticising the then <Col N="1183" /> Government for inadequate protection of the fisheries.  This Government have been in office for several years and, if anything, the situation is worse than it was, because the present Government have done absolutely nothing.  For instance, it was during the term of office of the last Government that the Lough Foyle fishermen were attacked by their opponents across the Border. Deputies then in opposition, Ministers in the present Government, commented very strongly on the attitude of the authorities, but what have they done to protect the rights of the Lough Foyle fishermen?  Have they sent the Muirchu into Lough Foyle to protect these rights?  They have not.</P>
    <P>Along our southern coast there are French trawlers and also great numbers of English trawlers operating. Along the South Wexford coast there are English and French trawlers frequently seen.  They travel the coast practically the whole way to Waterford and Cork.  Off West Cork large fleets of Spaniards come with elaborate equipment and they settle down for a long stay in our territorial waters.  Around the Blasket Islands Spanish fleets have been operating. They bring doctors and a whole staff with them for protracted periods of poaching on our property. Then in the North we have the Scottish and the English poachers.  The Government really ought to take very definite action with the object of properly protecting our sea fisheries. In Scotland they are very careful about protecting their sea fisheries. Not alone do they protect up to the three-mile limit, but they go to a far deeper extent than three miles. Deputy O'Neill suggested that three substantial boats might be of assistance. I think that would be possible, if they were fitted with wireless and if there were spotters along the coast, perhaps spotters in small flying boats who could keep in wireless communication with the larger boats, informing them where raids would be taking place.  It would be only by such means that they could directly intercept the raiders.</P>
    <P>The Government know that this is <Col N="1184" /> a big question.  If they want to tackle it properly, as they are doing in England and Scotland, in Iceland, Scandinavia and other countries, money will have to be spent.  The whole thing will have to be gone into thoroughly and it will have to be an industry organised on a national scale.  It will be a very big undertaking. Apparently the Government are anxious to funk that responsibility and therefore I do not see why they should bring forward this Estimate, which is only a waste of money.  I will draw the Minister's attention to what happened in his own constituency, and I expect it will happen again.  In view of the absence of Government assistance to defend the rights of the people, the people arm themselves as best they can and shoot at the raiders who poach on their fishing grounds.  In view of the failure of the Government to defend national property, I think it is only right that the citizens should take it on themselves to protect that property. It is a poor commentary on the way the Government carry out their duties when it is left to the fishermen themselves to do what the Government should be doing for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Neill, in commencing his speech, said something I thoroughly agree with.  He said that I do not know as much about fisheries as I should know.  I am always anxious to learn, but with all due respect to the Deputy, I did not learn very much here to-day about fisheries.  There were very few suggestions made that could be regarded as constructive.  Deputies pointed out that things are bad.  Perhaps I am willing to admit a thing I know.  I know the position fairly well in regard to fisheries, but I have not got very much help in the way of a suggestion that might bring about an improvement. Deputy O'Neill and other speakers criticised very severely the amount of money allocated to fisheries; they said that it is entirely inadequate.  I had to listen for four days to criticism here for providing too much money for agriculture.  That was the gist of the speech of every <Col N="1185" /> Deputy on the Opposition Benches&mdash; what did I want with £2,000,000 for agriculture?</P>

      <P>Of course I will not be refused it.  Deputies opposite will not refuse me anything, but they might be averse to find the money by taxation. Deputy O'Neill gave figures of imports and he mentioned £300,000 and he said the value of the fish landed was £140,000.  These figures are not far from true but they give a very false idea of the position.  The fish imports, it is true, were valued at £315,000 in 1934, but they included £130,000 worth of canned fish and cured fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was fish, but if we are going to deal with fish let us deal with fish caught at home.  The Deputy said that the value of our sea fish was £140,000 but yet we exported £238,000 worth.  If we caught only £140,000 worth, we could not have exported fish to that value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also dealt with the inadequacy of protection.  He suggested that we should have three boats &mdash;a very good suggestion, but I do not know that three boats would be necessary. It has been assumed, because the Muirchu has been fortunate enough to catch certain boats inside the fishery limits, that, therefore, there is a great deal of poaching going on and that the <Col N="1186" /> protection is not adequate.  I do not think that is a very sound argument. If we had six boats it is quite possible that we would occasionally catch a number of poachers, but it would not be a good argument to deduce from that, that the protection was not sufficient. We have a sufficient Civic Guard force, and one cannot say that because the Civic Guard happen to arrest a number of offenders now and again that the force is inadequate. The fact that a poacher is occasionally caught does not prove that the Muirchu is not sufficient protection, although I am prepared to agree that we should have more protection.  As I said in my opening statement, I am considering getting another boat.  I think the two boats should be given a trial.  Since the Protection Act was passed, which gave our protective forces more powers to deal with delinquents, there has not been nearly so much poaching as before the Act was passed.  In fact poaching has disappeared to a great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill mentioned a fact with which we are all, of course, familiar, namely, that people in Cork have sometimes to send to Grimsby for their fish.  That is quite true.  On the other hand, Deputy O'Neill and Deputy McMenamin spoke of the fact that foreign trawlers were coming in and taking away our fish, which does point certainly to the necessity for commercial enterprise in our midst. Remember it is not my business or the business of the Department of Fisheries to catch fish.  It is our business only to protect fisheries.  If we are not doing that adequately, the criticism is justified, but certainly no criticism can be levelled against the Department on the ground that the fish are there and that nobody has caught them. That is the business of commercial enterprise, not the business of the Department.  If it is true that foreign trawlers are catching our fish and bringing them over to Grimsby and that we are buying them back, then it is commercial enterprise that is at fault and that is a criticism which should be levelled against the commercial community in this country and not against <Col N="1187" /> me.  In the speech which he made, even Deputy O'Neill did not say that the trawlers were coming within the three-mile limit and taking fish.  What he implied was that they come within sight catching that fish and, incidentally, perhaps injuring the fisheries for our own people inside the limit.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill said that he would like to see a Vote of £250,000, and Deputy McMenamin said that that would not be enough.  What would they do with that money?  After all three boats should provide adequate protection. That would cost £16,000 or £18,000 more.  What is going to be done with the rest of the money?  It is suggested that we should lend out more money for boats or rather that we should provide more money for the Sea Fisheries Association and let them lend it.  I believe the experience of the Sea Fisheries Association is that a great many of the boats on which they lent money are lying idle and not fishing at all.  They cannot get in the instalments and the people are offering them back the boats.  How then could they use more boats or more money even if they had it at their disposal? It is very easy for any Deputy to get up and say that we should have a Vote of £250,000 for fisheries, but I should like to hear them suggest how that money is going to be spent and spent to good purpose.  That is the trouble; it is not suggested.</P>
    <P>The British market, we were told by speakers opposite, is the best market for our fish.  That is true only to a limited extent.  In fact when we were getting big catches of fish in this country, herring and mackerel formed a very big part of them, but they were not marketed at all in Britain.  The herring was sold principally in countries like Russia and Germany and the mackerel in America.  Now because these markets are supplied from home sources, and are dwindling, as far as we are concerned, we find it difficult to get rid of our herring and mackerel. We never had any large market in Great Britain for either mackerel or herring.  The tariff on fish entering Britain as a result of the economic war <Col N="1188" /> has not been responsible to any great extent for any injury to our fisheries. In the first place our herring or mackerel, and our lobster to a great extent also, are not sent to Great Britain.  The tariff on wet fish is 10 per cent.  The tariff on shellfish is 30 per cent, but as against that there is a bounty given so that the economic war cannot be responsible to any great extent for any decline there may be in our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I think perhaps what Deputy O'Neill said about our by-laws being complicated is justified.  The matter is being examined in the Department to see if we could not have them simplified and codified to a great extent all round the coast.  In regard to the matter of the remission of loans, there was some criticism to the effect that we should have been more generous in wiping out these loans, but I think no Deputy will complain that any sort of reasonable settlement suggested in any case was turned down.  When I say &ldquo;reasonable settlement,&rdquo; I mean reasonable settlement taking the circumstances of the borrowers into account, not the value of the boat, but the circumstances of the borrowers; in other words, what they can pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill did not, I think, hear my opening statement very well.  I did not say in my opening statement that the bounty on cured mackerel was not sufficient.  I said the results were not conclusive, that one year's trial was hardly sufficient, and that I, therefore, proposed to consider sympathetically the renewal of the bounty for another year.  There is a demand, as Deputy Corish pointed out, in Wexford and in other towns like it, for fish sometimes when fish cannot be got. The supply of fish is a very different matter from the supply of other commodities. If we take even chickens, a farmer knows that there is a market for chickens on a certain day.  He can go out, select his chickens, kill them and prepare them for the market and bring in about the number that is required.  It is a very different matter with fish.  On some occasions the fishermen catch far too little, and on other occasions far too much.  It is particularly difficult in this country <Col N="1189" /> where there is a large consumption of fish on one day in the week, on Friday. Most of our people are obliged to eat fish on Friday.  As a rule they do not eat it on any other day.  There is also the fact that we have a small population.  They have a very big population in England.  Fish is landed there from many places.  It is sent to a big market, and there is a big population to be supplied.  In England they have various ways of getting rid of a surplus that, of course, would be impossible in a country such as ours with a small population.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I do not want to go into any details with regard to the net fishing which is dealt with in the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  The question as to whether there should be any restriction on net fishing is one that can be fully discussed when legislative proposals are put before the House.  I do not think that Deputy Bartley gave a very good reason for the scrapping of the Muirchu.  He said that she ought to be scrapped because she is not able to be on three coasts at the same time. I am afraid it would be impossible to get any boat capable of doing that. Perhaps it is a reason why we should have more boats like the Muirchu or, if you like, more unlike her.  At any rate, according to the views of some Deputies, she is not adequate for the purpose intended.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Bartley said, that our fisheries have been going down since 1927.  For 1934 a report on the inland fisheries was, published, copies of which were circulated to Deputies.  If they will glance at the graph on page 14, they will see that in 1927 the quantity of fish caught was 650,000 cwts.  In 1931, when we still had a benevolent Government in power and when there was no economic war to contend with, the amount of fish caught was about 230,000 cwts.  That was the drop that took place between 1927 and 1931.  If Cumann na nGaedheal had continued in office the graph to-day would show that no fish at all were being caught.</P>

      <P>No.  The graph shows that during the years when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was in power there was an alarming drop in the quantity of fish caught, while since we came into office the decline has been gradual.  Deputy McMenamin asked me if we had succeeded in getting a quota from Germany for herrings. So far we have not.  We have pressed Germany very hard for a quota, but so far they have declined. I am sure Deputies read the papers and, consequently, are aware that Germany is a very powerful country.  In these circumstances we cannot do any more than press them to give us a quota.  I have not lost hope of getting a market for our herrings, whether from Germany or some other foreign country.  I believe there is a good chance of success in that direction.</P>

To do so might strike their imagination, but may I ask what would we do with the money?

The Deputy suggests that, for the purpose of dealing with these foreign trawlers, the boat might be innocently fitted out and then when it came near them throw up its sides and put a gun on them.  I do not think it would be quite as easy as all that.  As Deputies are aware, the people operating these foreign trawlers know our coast very well.  They would soon get to know the boat, so that as far as the decoy part of it was concerned, no great advantage, I think, would result.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin spoke very much in the same strain as Deputy O'Neill.  While both of them said the outlook for fishing in this country was as black as black could be, they went on to advocate the spending of a few hundred thousand pounds more on it. That seems to me to be an irresponsible attitude for any Deputy to adopt. Unless we feel that there is a future for fishing, then, surely, we ought not to spend any more money on it.  I think that there is a future for fishing, and that the outlook is not at all as black as the Deputies attempted to make out.  I do not see how I could possibly ask the Dáil for money for fisheries unless I was in a position to tell the House how I propose to spend it.  The Deputies suggested that another £250,000 should be voted for the fisheries, but they did not point out how the money should be spent. Deputy McMenamin blamed the people in his constituency who were receiving free beef for the decline in fishing. He said that they were not going to buy any more fish because they could get free beef.  It is some satisfaction to those of us who sit on this side of the House to learn from Deputies opposite that we have improved the condition of the people to some extent, even if in doing so we have injured the fisheries somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism of the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission that we had from Deputy McMenamin was <Col N="1192" /> made up of a lot of fatuous statements. He talked about salmon being caught in a box and slaughtered.  Whether a salmon is caught in a box or in a net, it is slaughtered, so where does the difference come in?  I cannot understand the attitude that is being taken up by these great moralists on the other side.  The Deputy made a lot of fatuous statements about the people who have devoted themselves earnestly to this question over a long period and who have brought in a report containing what they regard as good constructive suggestions for improving the present situation.  These suggestions, the result of serious investigation, are swept aside by futilities of the sort to which Deputy McMenamin treated the House this evening.  I do not think that is fair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly asked me if we were making any headway as regards the sale of mussels.  We are.  We have induced a few more local authorities to agree that the mussels would be quite healthy and pure if put through the process that we have here for their treatment.  The point, however, is that we have not got a sufficient number of local authorities to agree so as to justify the expenditure that would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made a rather bloodthirsty speech encouraging the fishermen of the south to attack the foreign people with guns.  I do not want to offer any comment on that. Deputies perhaps do not understand exactly what the position of the Minister for Fisheries is with regard to the development of the fisheries.  I take it he is bound to protect the fisheries and, to that extent, to see that there are plenty of fish there for the fishermen to catch, but it is the job of the fishermen to catch the fish and not of the Department of Fisheries.  The fishermen, on the other hand, may say that they cannot do that because they have not got the boats and the gear.  The Sea Fisheries Association comes in there.  They are prepared to help any honest fisherman who wants to make fishing his career by lending him a boat and gear on very favourable terms. Those are the most favourable terms <Col N="1193" /> at which it can be given.  As to this business of marketing, the Sea Fisheries Association will help the fishermen to market their fish inside the country.  As far as the Minister for Fisheries is concerned, I want to say that I have tried to protect the market here against the imports of a certain class of fish.  I have done that so as to preserve the home market.  I have further tried to arrange for quotas in foreign countries.  We have not succeeded in getting those quotas to the extent that we would like.  That applies, of course, to all arrangements with other countries.  We do not do as well as we would like to do.  I have hopes that we may be able to arrange for quotas for herrings this year.  The outlet for mackerel is not so good.  The United States market was the greatest market we had for cured mackerel, but they are not importing now from any country.  They are importing some, but the market has dwindled down to almost nothing.  Consequently we will find it hard this coming year to get a market for cured mackerel.  I do not think there were any other points raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl aon chúis le bheith mí-shásta mar gheall ar shláinte an phobail fá láthair acht táim cinnte gur féidir feabhas mór do chur uirri fá réim cliste ealadhanta.  Má deintear scrúdú ar statistic bheathadh agus bháis na ndaoine, is léir go bhfuiltear ag dul chun chinn go mór, mar atá sé le cruthú asta gur rugadh níos mó daoine agus gur cailleadh níos lugha díobha anuiridh ná athrú anuiridh.  Ba lugha <Col N="1195" /> an ráta bháis ná in aon bhliain go dtí so a bhfuil statistic le fagháil mar gheall uirri.</P>
    <P>Ins an mbliadhain 1933 cailleadh 65 naoidheanáin ar gach míle naoidheanán a rugadh.  An bhliadhain 'na dhiadh sin, cailleadh 63 fá'n mhíle, agus is lughaidhe um 10 per cent. an uimhir sin ná an meadhon-uimhir ins na deich mbliadhantaibh roimhe sin (1924-1933). Ní misde a rádh gur ins na bailtibh amháin a thárla an laghdú ins an mbliain 1934.  Ar na ceithre cathrachaibh is i mBaile Atha Cliath is mó' a tháinig an feabhas.  Táim deimhneach gurb' iad na scéimeanna i gcóir máithreachais agus leas na leanbh atá fá ndeara an scéal do bheith amhlaidh. Do réir tuairime an dochtúra atá i bhfeidhl na hoibre sin, is iad na neithe so im' dhiaidh is mó atá freagarthach leis an bhfeabhas&mdash;(1) Teagasc i gcúrsaibh máithreachais fá'n scéim um leas na leanbh; (2) Iomad deagh-bhainne atá le fáil anois i gcóir naoidheanán; (3) An feabhas atá tagaithe ar thighthibh na ndaoine.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom ámhthach a rádh nach bhfuil aon laghdú tagaithe fós ar uimhir na máthar a cailltear gach bliain le linn breithe cloinne dóibh i naimhdhéóin a bhfuiltear ag déanamh chum sláinte na máthar do chosaint. Tá gach dream ar aon intinn mar gheall ar an tairbhe atá ag dul do leanbhaibh as ucht an bainne a gheibheann siad gach lá fá'n deontas £90,000.  Do bhí an scéim so i bhfeidhm i rith na bliadhna so caithte ar fud na tíre acht amháin i ndhá bhaile.  Tugaim fá ndeara go bhfuil ughdaráis aitiúla ann a chaitheann furmhór de'n deontas i rith an tsamhraidh.  Níl aon amhras ná gur mó an tairbhe do na leanbhaibh an bainne saor a bheith le fáil aca ins an geimhreadh nuair bhíonn an bainne daor agus gann, agus atáim ag iarradh ar lucht ughdarás áitiúla an t-airgead so do chaitheamh ins an t-slighe ar mhóide a leas.</P>
    <P>Do bhí scrúdú leanbhaí scoile tré dochtúirí ar siubhal sa bhliain 1925 i nocht gconntae deag agus i gceithre cathracaibh, agus do cuireadh 80 per cent. de leanbhaibh scoile na tíre fá'n scrúdú sin.  Leathnóchtar an scéim so ar fud na tíre go léir i mbliana.  Do <Col N="1196" /> soláthruigheadh béilí scoile ag trí is dachad de lucht ceannais baile agus ag a sé cinn do choimisinéiribh baile.

    <P>Táim ag iarradh breis £4,500 i gcóir leighis na heitinne.  Táthar chum scéim leighis do chur ar bun i gConndae Longphuirt agus annsin beidh scéimeanna dá leithéid i ngach conndae agus i ngach cathair.

    <P>Táthar ag dul ar aghaidh go maith leis na scéimeannaibh a bhí ann cheanna agus tháinig méadú beag ar an méad daoine tháinig futha anuiridh seachas an bhliain roimhe.  Do b'ionann ráta báis do bhárr an ghalair so ins an dá bhliain.  Má's rud é nach ndearnadh aon chéim ar aghaidh le ruagadh an ghalair ó n-ár measc, is é mo thuairim nach bhfuighfear luach saothair ár niarrachta go hiomlán go dtí go mbeidh a mhalairt de scéal ar fad againn maidir le cúrsaibh comhnuidhthe an phobail i gcoitcheannta. Mar adubhairt mé go minic cheana, is iad tighthe maithe bun agus bárr na seirbhísí i gcóir leas sláinte an phobail.  Tá sé riachtanach orm mar sin iarradh ar an Dáil bheith fialmhar arís fá'n gceist so.  Admhuighim gur ualach mór ar an bpobal é an t-airgead atá 'ghá éileamh agam chum tighthe nua do sholáthair acht ní mór do'n ghlún atá anois ann an t-ualach so do ghlacadh orra ar leas an ghluin a thiocfaidh 'na ndiaidh.</P>
    <P>Thugas eolas cruinn do'n Dáil le déidheannaighe mar gheall ar thighthibh a tógtar le daoinibh priobháidheacha agus le cuideachtaí maitheasa puiblidhe.  Mar sin, ní gádh dhom anois acht tagairt do dheanamh do na tighthibh atá 'ghá soláthar ag lucht ughdarás aitiúila.  Go dtí deire Márta do tógadh 11,455 de thighthibh i <Col N="1197" /> mbailtibh agus i gcathrachaibh fá'n Acht do ritheadh sa bhliain 1932. Díobh san cuireadh 7,140 ar leathaoibh i gcóir daoine do bhí 'na gcomhnuidhe roimhe sin i dtighthibh ná raibh oireamhnach do'n chine daonna.</P>
    <P>Tá oifigigh leighis na gCondae ag cur suime mór ins an scéal so agus bím féin ag tafaint gan staonadh ar lucht ughdarás aitiúila na droch-thighthe so do leagadh comh luath agus atá áit chomhnuidhthe eile réidh i gcóir na ndaoine do bhíodh ionnta.  De ghnáth bíonn cíosanna ó leath-choróin go dtí ceithre scillinge (gan rátaí) le díol as tighthibh a tógtar i gcóir daoine mar sin agus socruighthear an cíos i dtreó is go mbeidh sé ar chumas na ndaoine an cíos atá leagtha amach do dhíol agus gan ualach ró-throm do leagadh ar ráthaibh na háite.</P>
    <P>Bíonn ballaí stroighne agus slinnte stroighne ar fhurmhor de's na tighthibh seo.  Atá ballaí saoirseachta i gcuid aca agus ballaí brící i gcuid eile agus atá slinnte nádúrtha ar chuid mhaith díobh.  Táim toilteannach i gcomhnuidhe glacadh leis na rudai so muna mbíonn a luach go ró-árd.  Ní mór a rádh amhthach go bhfuil breis ó £18 to £29 i gcóir ballaí agus ó £8 go £12 i gcóir ceann slinnte ins na tairiscínti tógála a fuair lucht ughdarás aitiúil le déidheannaighe.  Nuair cuimhnighthear gur ionann £10 i luach tógála an tighe agus trí pingne sa mbreis ar feadh cúig bliain triochad, béidh sé léir do chách go gcaithimíd bheith socair i nár n-aignibh nach bhfuil aon dul as againn luach na dtighthe do laghdú an oiread agus is féidir linn chomh fada agus beidh obair mhaith agus ádhbhar maith ionnta.</P>
    <P>Do cuireadh fiosrucháin speisialta ar bun ar fud na tíre chun deimhniú d'fhágháil ar an slighe 'na sheashamh na tighthe a raibh slinnte stroighne mar cinn orra i gcoinne doininn an gheimhridh. Is é toradh na bhfiosruchán sin gur sheas na slinnte go maith daingean i naimhdheóin na fearthainne agus na gaoithe.  I dtrí áiteannaibh ámhthach, do deineadh tubaiste le linn na sneachta.  Do b'é cúis an tubaiste sin ná nach raibh na slinnte go maith agus atáim sásta gur ceann tighe foghanta slinnte stroighne má's rud é go ndeintear <Col N="1198" /> na slinnte do réir na rialacha oifigeamhalla agus go leagtar iad ag ceárdaibh cliste.</P>
    <P>Chuaidh costas tógála tighte i laighead anuiridh acht tá comharthaí ann go bhfuil sé ag dul beagán in aoirde arís.  Go dtí deire Márta tógadh 5,837 de thighthibh sclábhuidhe fá'n Acht a ritheadh sa bhliain 1932.  Bíonn cíos dhá scilling sa tseachtmhain nó mar sin ar na tighthibh sin.</P>
    <P>B'é 6,500 meadhon-uimhir na bhfear a bhí ag obair ag tógála tighthe do lucht ughdarás aitiúila gach mhí i rith na bliana agus bhíodh timcheall 5,000 fear ag obair ag tógáil tighthe eile. Chomh maith leo sin, bíonn timcheall cúig míle eile ag obair ag deanamh ádhbhar tógála agus gléas tighthe.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a rádh go bhfuil feabhas mór tagaithe ar chursaibh airgid na n-ughdarás áitiúila toisc go bhfuiltear ag tabhairt níos mó aire do bhailiú an airgid atá ar dul dóibh.  Do b'fearr an cor do bhí ar an scéal ag deire mí Nodlag ná a bhí ins an dá bhliain roimhe sin ag an am cheana.  I rith ráithe deiridh na bliana so caithte, bailigheadh níos mí ná milliún púint do sraiteannaibh do bhí amuigh.  Ag deire Mí Nodlag bhí 57 per cent. des na sraitheannaibh amuigh i gcompráid le 66 per cent. ag deire na bliana 1934 agus le 60 per cent. an bliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Ag deire Márta, 1936, bhí 28½ per cent. des na sraitheannaibh amuigh i gcomparáid le 31 per cent. an bhliain roimhe sin.  I gconntae is fiche bhí an bailiúchán níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé an bliain roimhe sin; i gcúig conndaithe, bhí laghdhú beag san mbailiúchán, agus san gconntae eile ba bheag an difríocht a bhí ann.</P>
    <P>This Estimate makes provision for a net expenditure of £1,204,652, of which a sum of £1,052,990 will be spent on social services.  The provision for such services shows an increase of £95,400 as compared with the past year.  The main increase under this head is in respect of grants for housing.  I have on previous occasions made it clear that the provision of improved housing accommodation will necessitate increased demands upon the State for some years to come.  Increased <Col N="1199" /> provision is also likely for the special medical services for which grants are provided in this Estimate.  These services are expanding throughout the country, and I expect that in the next few years considerable progress will be made in bringing them up to a higher standard.  During the past ten years a good deal has been done to lay the foundation of an up-to-date public health system.  From the commencement of the present financial year the services of county medical officers of health will be available in every county. Under the direction and supervision of those officers there will be provided the requisite machinery for safeguarding the health of the community.  Henceforward it will be possible in every county to institute measures for the medical inspection of school children, to establish maternity and child welfare arrangements, and generally to promote schemes of housing and sanitation and take such other measures as are necessary to combat disease and improve the health of the people.</P>
    <P>The state of the public health is not unsatisfactory, but I feel that a considerable improvement can be effected under skilled medical guidance. The vital statistics of the year 1934 which are the latest available, indicate improved conditions as they disclose a rise in the birth-rate and a fall in the death-rate as compared with the preceding year.  The number of deaths in 1934&mdash; 39,083&mdash;was 1,456 less than the number registered in 1933, and the deathrate&mdash;12.97 per 1,000 of the population &mdash;constitutes a new low record for this country.  This is all the more encouraging in view of the fact that the incidence of mortality in this country has since 1927 shown a practically continuous downward trend, subject to some temporary setbacks.  In comparison with the above-mentioned figure for 1934, it is to be noted that the average death-rate for the decade 1924-1933 was 14.39 per 1,000 of the population.</P>
    <P>The order of greatest incidence in regard to mortality for the year 1934, as disclosed by the standardised death-rates per 1,000 of the population was as follows:&mdash;Cork County Borough (17.98), <Col N="1200" /> Dublin County Borough (17.03), Limerick County Borough (16.49), Dublin County (15.87), Waterford County Borough (15.60), Louth County (14.65), and Wexford County (14.13).  The lowest standardised death-rates were recorded in the following counties:&mdash; Mayo (10.14), Clare (10.39), Leitrim (10.73), Roscommon (11.22), Donegal (11.44), Sligo (11.51), and Cavan (11.60).</P>
    <P>The infant death-rate in the year 1933 was 65 per 1,000 births.  For the year 1934, the rate was 63 per 1,000 births for the whole country, which is 31 per cent. lower than the average rate for the ten years, 1901-10, and almost 10 per cent. lower than the average rate for the decennial period from 1924 to 1933.  The improvement in the year 1934 as compared with 1933 was entirely in the urban areas, the respective rates for the urban and rural areas being 78 per 1,000 births in the urban, and 55 in the rural areas. Of the four county boroughs, Dublin City shows the greatest improvement since 1931.  In that year the rate of infant mortality was 94 per 1,000 births as against 80 for the year 1934.  It has to be borne in mind that the boundaries of the city were enlarged in 1931, and it is not possible to say to what extent that extension may have contributed to a lowering of the death-rate. I am satisfied that a good deal is due to the work of the maternity and child welfare service in the city which has developed very much in the past few years.  The medical officer in charge of the scheme, in his report for the year 1934, expressed the opinion that the principal factors which contributed to the improved conditions were: (1) Educative propaganda in mother-craft under the child welfare scheme; (2) the large quantity of good quality milk now available for infant feeding; (3) improved housing conditions.</P>
    <P>Up to recent years, public health as a subject was not much considered, and, therefore, not much attention given to and very little advantage taken of measures which are conducive to public welfare, especially those connected with child welfare and safeguarding the health of mothers during pregnancy and confinement.  Much valuable work has been done by health <Col N="1201" /> visitors under child welfare schemes to induce mothers with children requiring treatment to avail of the services afforded under the schemes, and the increased attendances at welfare centres in the large centres of population are evidence that the services provided are being more fully availed of.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, there were 20,198 mothers and 32,747 children on the visitation registers at the commencement of 1935 and 4,390 additional mothers and 16,829 children were added in the course of the year, making the total numbers dealt with under the scheme 24,588 mothers and 49,576 children. The attendances at the babies' clubs comprised 39,038 in respect of mothers and 45,194 in respect of children.  The aggregate number of visits paid by health visitors to mothers and children in their homes during the year was 218,145.  In the Cork, Limerick and Waterford County Borough scheme, there were 3,920, 2,672 and 1,157 mothers dealt with during the year 1935, whilst the numbers of children treated were 5,213, 5,868 and 2,295 respectively.  The number of visits to mothers and children in their homes in these districts during 1935 were 13,508, 9,499 and 6,203.</P>
    <P>The increased attention which has been devoted in recent years to safeguarding the health of mothers has not, however, succeeded in reducing the death-rate for maternal mortality. The chief factor affecting maternal mortality is puerperal sepsis and 104 deaths were attributed to that cause in 1934 as compared with 80 in 1933. The increase in mortality was common to both urban and rural areas.  In one urban district, the death-rate reached as high as 10.03 per 1,000 births, but this was due to an epidemic which originated from the admission to the maternity ward in the county hospital of an expectant mother who was subsequently found to be suffering from a mild attack of scarlet fever.  The county medical officer of health took active steps to combat the outbreak and with the co-operation of the local medical practitioners the disease was arrested.  The outbreak resulted in six deaths.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> The aggregate death-rate in urban areas from all puerperal conditions was 3.71 per 1,000 births in 1934, as compared with 3.19 in 1933, while the aggregate death-rate in rural areas was 5.25 per 1,000 births in the year 1934 as against 5.17 in 1933.  The problem is a difficult one, and is common to most countries.  It is in the fuller development of our hospital system, and in the provision of greater facilities for prenatal and post-natal care that we can hope to bring about a decided improvement.</P>
    <P>Many reports continue to be received on the benefits derived by young children from a daily ration of milk provided under the grant of £90,000.  The approved schemes for the distribution of free milk were administered during the past financial year by the sanitary authorities with the exception of two urban areas.  There has been a tendency on the part of some authorities to spend the greater proportion of the grant allocated to them in the summer months.  A supply of free milk is of greater value in the winter period, when milk is scarcer and dearer, and local authorities are being asked to secure the best results possible in the administration of the grant.</P>
    <P>The conditions embodied in the free milk supply scheme as regards preference for tuberculin-tested milk, frequent inspection of milk contractors' premises, dairy cattle and methods of milk production, and the carrying out of tests for cleanliness and quality of the milk have had a very beneficial effect in educating milk producers as regards the necessity for improvement in their methods of handling and distributing milk.  It has also educated public opinion as to the desirability of obtaining a purer and better milk supply, and has, therefore, prepared the way for the operation of the legislation recently passed.  Regulations under the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, are being prepared, and I hope to be in a position shortly to fix the appointed day bringing into operation the major portion of the Act.</P>
    <P>Approved school medical inspection schemes were in operation in 1935 in the four county boroughs and 18 counties. The number of school children <Col N="1203" /> who came within the ambit of the schemes represented over 80 per cent. of the elementary school-going population. The extension of this service to the whole country will be completed in the present year.  The number of school children inspected in 1934 was 114,087. The following defects were ascertained: Dental, 36,786; tonsils and adenoids, 23,514; defective vision and other eye defects, 17,459.  The number of children treated for dental defects were 35,183; for tonsils and adenoids, 5,943 and for defective vision, 8,788.  The schemes are developing along satisfactory lines and are proving of great value to the school-going population by removing many defects which would otherwise remain unattended to.</P>
    <P>School meals were provided by 43 urban authorities and 6 town commissioners. The average daily number of children provided with meals was 24,047, and the total number of meals supplied was 4,275,169.  In the Gaeltacht meals were provided in 316 schools and the average daily number of children in attendance was 17,717. The total number of meals provided was 3,003,985.</P>
    <P>For the treatment of tuberculosis an additional provision of £4,500 is required.  A scheme is about to be started in Longford County.  There will then be in every county and county borough approved arrangements for the domiciliary and institutional treatment of the disease.  Extended facilities for treatment have been made available by the establishment of local sanatoria in most of the counties and county boroughs.  New institutions have been opened recently in Limerick City and at Rathdrum.</P>
    <P>The existing schemes are being administered satisfactorily.  The number of cases treated during 1934 was slightly greater than the previous year. The rate of mortality was the same for both years, being 1.17 per 1,000 of the population.  The progress made in combating the disease seems to be slowing up, and I am inclined to the view that full benefit from the expenditure on tuberculosis and other public health services will not be derived until a <Col N="1204" /> radical improvement has been brought about in housing conditions.  As I have said on previous occasions, good housing is at the foundation of all the social services.  It is well, therefore, that this Estimate includes a generous provision for the furtherance of housing schemes in the present year.  There is a heavy financial obligation being incurred, but it is a burden that the present generation should willingly bear for the benefit of the generation to follow.  It is essential, too, that increased attention be given to sanitary improvements.  In this respect progress was well maintained in the carrying out of public health works.  Grants amounting to approximately £100,000 were allocated for water supplies and sewerage schemes.  Loans advanced for the carrying out of such schemes amounted to £214,000.</P>
    <P>In the recent discussion of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I gave full particulars of the progress made in the erection of houses by private persons and public utility societies.  I will now deal with building by local authorities.  The number of houses built up to the end of March last, under the 1932 Act in urban areas was 11,455, of which 4,099 were completed during the previous 12 months.  Of the total number completed, 7,140 were for the rehousing of persons removed from clearance areas or from houses unfit for human habitation. The total number built by the Dublin Corporation was 3,573, of which 1,244 were for rehousing.  Cork Corporation built 646, of which 507 were for rehousing.  Dun Laoghaire Corporation built 403, of which 339 were for rehousing.  Limerick Corporation built 412, of which 405 were for rehousing, and Waterford built 300, of which 194 were for rehousing.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made by urban authorities in connection with the clearance of unhealthy areas and the demolition of unfit houses.  Up to date, 3,564 houses have actually been demolished, and the number in respect of which clearance orders or demolition orders have been made is approximately 5,000.  The county medical officers of health are taking a keen <Col N="1205" /> interest in the elimination of the slums and unfit houses, and the necessity for ensuring that all unfit houses are demolished as soon as alternative accommodation is provided for the occupants, is being continually impressed on local authorities.  The rents charged for houses provided for rehousing usually range from 2/6 to 4/- per week, exclusive of rates.  Careful consideration is given in all cases to the fixing of rents so as to ensure that the weekly payments will be within the means of the prospective tenants and at the same time secure that an undue burden will not fall on the rates.  The houses provided for persons who cannot pay the full economic rent are generally let at 5/6 to 7/6 per week.  In Dublin, rents are usually at the rate of 2/6 per room.</P>
    <P>The form of construction used is generally concrete walling with concrete tiled roofs.  In certain cases masonry and brick walling have been approved, and native slates have, in a number of cases, been used.  I am always prepared to approve of the use of brick, stone or slates, where the prices quoted can be regarded as reasonable.  In recent tenders received by local authorities, the extra cost for brick walling averaged £18 to £29 per house, and the extra cost for slated roofs was £8 to £12 per house.  When it is remembered that every £10 of capital cost per house means a weekly charge of 3d. over the loan period of 35 years, the necessity for ensuring that building costs are reduced to a minimum consistent with durability and good workmanship will be apparent.</P>
    <P>Special reports have been obtained in all areas showing the effect of the recent severe winter storms on houses roofed with concrete tiles.  It has been found that the roofs satisfactorily withstood the rain and wind storms.  In the case of three schemes, serious damage was reported as the result of snow blizzards.  These cases have been specially examined, and it has been ascertained that the damage was caused by defective tiling.  I am satisfied that concrete tiles, when manufactured in accordance with the official specification and fitted by competent tradesmen, make a satisfactory roof covering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> Building costs for 1935 were lower than in previous years, but recent tenders received in a number of areas show an upward tendency of from 5 to 10 per cent. on 1935 figures.  The number of labourers' cottages built under the 1932 Act up to the end of March was 5,837, of which 2,091 were built during the previous 12 months.  These are being let at about 2/- a week.  The number of men employed on schemes promoted by local authorities averaged 6,500 per month.  On houses that are being built and reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies, employment is being afforded to about 5,000 men, making approximately 11,500 men directly employed on house-building. About 5,000 additional men are employed in the manufacture and preparation of building materials and appliances.</P>
    <P>Increased provision has been made in the Estimate for the cultivation of allotments. There is likely to be a considerable increase in the number of plots to be provided during the 1936 season.  To date schemes have been confirmed in 58 centres, embracing 4,000 allotments.  The total number to be cultivated will be about 6,000.  The general increase in the activities of local authorities under the Allotments Act may be attributed to the increased publicity afforded the schemes by the Press and local agencies, and also to a keener interest by unemployed persons in work of this kind.</P>
    <P>For the financial year just commenced increased provision has been made by county councils for road maintenance. The amount to be raised for the maintenance of main roads is £845,357, being an increase of £10,749 over the amount provided last year. The amount to be raised for county roads is £686,676, which is in excess of last year's provision by a sum of £4,181.  There is also an increased provision of £34,985 for the surface dressing of main and county roads.  I am glad to say there has been no falling off in the attention that is being given by local authorities and their staffs to this important branch of the public services. Throughout the year there was close co-operation with the Department to secure the maximum value for the <Col N="1207" /> expenditure incurred from rates and grants.  The condition of streets in towns has been receiving special consideration, grants having been made in a number of cases.  This matter is being pursued and reports are being prepared as a guide in the allocation of future grants.  The receipts from motor vehicle duties for the year ended 31st March, 1936, amounted to £1,000,000 as compared with £942,000 for the previous year.  Road grants allocated last year totalled £766,000, and it is expected that grants of a similar amount will be made during the current financial year.  During the past year further regulations were made under the Road Traffic Act, 1933. These regulations, entitled the Large Public Service Vehicles Regulations, 1935, are applied to large public service vehicles in addition to the regulations made in 1934 as to construction, equipment and use of all mechanically propelled vehicles.  The 1935 regulations deal with a variety of matters such as the calculation of passenger accommodation, the size, stability, turning circle, springs, brakes, steering mechanism, tyres, steps, entrances, seats, internal lighting, ventilation, etc., of large public service vehicles. The regulations deal also with the equipment of such vehicles and require them to carry first aid dressings and fire extinguishers.  Court clerks notified the Department of 125 cases of disqualifications or other endorsements under the driving licence provisions of the Act during the past year.  The notifications were duly circulated to the licensing authorities.  Under the compulsory insurance clauses of the Act there were only three cases during the year of specific complaint as to refusals by companies except on onerous terms.  In two of these the Department took the matter up with the companies concerned and a reasonable settlement was arrived at.  In the third case the complainant dropped the matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a general improvement in the financial position of the county councils due to a better collection of their revenues.  At the end of the December quarter the position <Col N="1208" /> of the rate collection showed an improved position as compared with the preceding two years.  In the months of October, November and December the outstanding rates were reduced by over £1,000,000, and at the end of December 57 per cent. of the rates was outstanding as compared with 66 per cent. at December, 1934, and 60 per cent. at December, 1933. At the end of March, 1936, the percentage outstanding was reduced to 28½ per cent. as compared with 31 per cent. outstanding at March, 1935, and 36 per cent. for the year before.  In 21 counties the collection was better than in the previous year, in five counties there was a slight falling off, and in the remaining county the proportion outstanding was much the same as the previous year.</P>
    <P>Preliminary steps for the preparation of planning schemes were taken during the year by the Corporation of Dublin; the Corporations of Clonmel, Dun Laoghaire, Sligo and Wexford; by the councils of the urban districts of Arklow, Bray, Ennis, Galway, Howth and Killarney, and the councils of the Counties of Dublin and Waterford. With the exception of these areas there appears to be a lack of interest in planning.  Useful discussions on the subject have taken place amongst the professional associations, and the prominence which has been given in the Press to the matter helps materially to bring about increased interest in and a better appreciation of the public advantages to be derived from a careful planning of the growth of our towns.  The preparation of a planning scheme is a slow process.  The social and economic conditions of the district to be planned have to be carefully surveyed and careful forecasts made of future development.  Consultations between the planning authority and the owners of land and others interested in development will be necessary so that the planning scheme may secure as full a measure of agreement as is possible.</P>
    <P>A large measure of control follows upon the passing of a resolution deciding to make a planning scheme.  The planning authority has from that time <Col N="1209" /> the power to grant permission for works to proceed, or it may prohibit any particular work which would be likely to contravene any of the provisions which it is intended to embody in the scheme.  Only in two cases of special prohibitions have appeals been made to me.  In one of these the prohibition, not being validly made, was inoperative.  The other case, which is concerned with the prohibition of the inclusion of a shop in the plans for the reconstruction of a house in a public square, is at present being investigated. The small number of appeals would indicate that a considerable measure of agreement is being secured. In Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire Borough a good deal of necessary control over development has been secured since the passing of resolutions deciding to make planning schemes with the assent of those engaged in constructional works.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan has a motion on the Order Paper that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  There is also a motion in the names of Deputies Everett and Pattison that the Vote be reduced by £100 in respect of item F1. That motion does not appear on the Order Paper through an oversight and not through any fault of the Deputies. There are, therefore, two motions.  In theory the motion which has been submitted by Deputy Brennan affords an opportunity of discussing the policy of the Government, but, as Deputies have realised, it is impossible to separate such a motion from the Vote itself. Hence the established procedure is that the discussion on the Vote and on a motion to refer back proceeds together. During that discussion Deputy Everett and Deputy Pattison will be afforded an opportunity of raising the matter set out in the motion which stands in their names.  When the Minister has concluded the debate a division, if required, will be given on the motion to refer back&mdash;that is, on the question of policy&mdash;and, when that has been disposed of, an opportunity will be given to Deputy Everett of having a division on the point raised in his motion, and finally on the Vote itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I am doing so for various reasons which I shall endeavour to set forth. Firstly, let me say that it seems an extraordinary thing that while last year I felt obliged to complain of the enormous increase in personnel and in salaries, wages and allowances, I have to make the same complaint this year.  It would appear that the Minister for Local Government, as well as other Ministers, feel that the right policy is to appoint any amount of officials and pay them at the public expense.  We have had ample evidence of that.  Of course, the Minister may think that it is perhaps one way of redeeming the pledge of providing employment, but it is a very expensive way of doing it.</P>
      <P>This year we have an increase in the actual number of persons employed at what I might call headquarters of 44, in addition to an increase of 39 last year.  That increase includes various types of officials from high-salaried officials down to messenger boys.  The Minister has seen fit even to increase the messenger-boy staff.  Last year there was an increase in salaries and wages of £7,810 and, in addition to that, this year we have an increase of £9,406.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not endeavoured to justify that increase in any way.  He said, of course, we have social services, but he has provided this increased money almost entirely for housing which ought not to increase the personnel at headquarters.  The whole thing, as presented here in this Estimate, with its list of officials and salaries, gives the lie direct to what the Minister and his Party promised when they were seeking for power in this country.  Then they gave the impression that they were going to cut down expenses, particularly those of the big-salaried people in this country, and that they would give equal efficiency at <Col N="1211" /> a lesser cost.  They told us they were going to provide various local services, including de-rating, which if it had been provided would alter this Vote and the liabilities of the people to an enormous extent.  We have not had any of these things.  On the contrary, we have a piling up of officials and a piling up of salaries.</P>
    <P>I drew attention, last year, to one particular Estimate which struck me all the time as a kind of sinecure&mdash;that is the Housing Board.  If it was a sinecure last year it is more of a sinecure this year.  It would be a joke except for the fact that we have to pay for the joke.  I have been endeavouring to find out, for the last couple of years, what the Housing Board is doing and I cannot find any record of work for which they are responsible.  The board consists of a chairman with £1,000 a year, and two part-time members with £500 each, inclusive.  I do not know whether my memory serves me rightly, but I think that one of those members for whom we are providing £500 a year has ceased to be a member of the Housing Board for some time.  People will remember a kind of scare, or perhaps I might call it a kind of housing scandal, that occurred at Castlebar.  One member of the board became very critical of the Minister and his Department, and I think that that gentleman has ceased to be a member of the board, and I do not think his place has been filled.  But not only are we making provision for his salary, but we are increasing the travelling allowances.  Last year it averaged £225.  This year the figure is £250.  I think the Minister ought to tell us what really this Housing Board is doing.  The Minister has his legal advisers, and prominent officials, and I do not think there is any necessity whatever for this board beyond providing jobs for three or four people.  That was always my impression of the Housing Board, and that is still my impression.  But having placed people in these positions the Minister does not know how to get rid of them.  I maintain they are an expensive luxury, and unless they are serving a definite purpose their services ought not to be continued, <Col N="1212" /> and they ought not to be left as a drain upon the public purse.</P>
    <P>Looking through this Estimate it seems an extraordinary thing that the Minister and his Department find it necessary to increase, to such an alarming extent, the number of officials required.  The Minister has not told us anything about that.  But we have a kind of rehash as to the type of offices that certain officials fill. Perhaps that is all to the good. Perhaps the Minister has very good reason for that.  We find people who were &ldquo;principals&rdquo; last year are &ldquo;heads of sections&rdquo; now, and vice versa.  Their salaries are altered and increased.  Junior executive officers have been increased; clerical officers have been increased, and other heads have been reduced.  As a kind of adjustment that may be all right, but I think the Minister should have told us something about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured to tell the House that the position of the local authorities in the country has improved generally.  I would very much like to feel that that was so. But I am afraid, when we consider the real situation which exists in the country, on reading the reports of the meetings of the local authorities, we cannot feel reassured that local government is out of danger.  The Minister might also have told us that, partly because there were large withdrawals or withholdings of money from the local authorities last year, the Exchequer felt obliged to make certain advances to local authorities which will not be forthcoming again.  Some time ago, speaking on the question of the amount of money withheld from local authorities for annuities, the Minister for Finance told us that the sum of £550,000 was made available to the local authorities partly because that money had been withheld.  Of course the money really belonged to the local authorities, but according to the Minister for Finance it was not mature for release at the time.  If the Minister for Finance felt last year obliged to release £550,000 to relieve, in some way, a very serious situation that existed in the country at the time, and if there is no such sum of money or <Col N="1213" /> income of that nature coming to the county councils in the future, I am afraid the position we see in the country is not very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Last year, notwithstanding the fact that £716,000 had been withheld from the local authorities, there were still 18 or 19 of the 27 county councils who had to have a further curtailment of the agricultural grant this year, due to unpaid annuities.  I do not think, in view of some of the disclosures made to the House quite recently, particularly by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Morrissey with regard to certain people who had not paid their annuities, that the Minister for Local Government or any of his followers would say that the unpaid annuities were due to a rates or annuities campaign; because Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Morrissey said in this House that when the Longford and Tipperary County Councils made investigations as to the councillors in both these bodies who had unpaid annuities it was found that it was only Fianna Fáil councillors who had not paid their annuities.  I am not saying that they were dishonest, although I have before me a statement from the Fianna Fáil chairman of the Meath County Council saying: &ldquo;These people were public defaulters out on a campaign of plunder.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy permit me to interrupt him for a moment? He has mentioned three cases in Longford.  In one of these cases the roof was off the house and the man was rated for the house as a place of residence.  In another case there was a legal dispute between the man concerned and his brother about the division of land and, therefore, these cases were awaiting decision.  That explains some of the cases mentioned by the Deputy.  I made inquiry since the charge was made in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A charge was not made in the House and I am not making a charge now.  I am merely repeating the statement made by Deputy MacEoin that the only members of the county council who had not paid their annuities were Fianna Fáil members. I did not say that they were dishonest. <Col N="1214" /> I took very good care to say that, in my opinion, they were not dishonest.  We cannot be out of the wood even yet when, out of 27 county councils, only eight or nine have improved their annuity position since last year.  Eighteen or 19 county councils had additional money withheld this year as compared with last year.  We have various indications in the newspaper reports of local authorities that expenditure is on the increase.  If it were expenditure of a type which would be reproductive or non-recurrent&mdash;expenditure for which there was some special reason&mdash;it would not be alarming, but we get an example in Offaly, as reported in the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> of 30/1/36. The chairman of the council stated that the present rate of expenditure on home assistance was £11,531 for the current year, or an increase of £2,500 on the estimated amount.  That is not very encouraging.  If there is one thing more than another which points to the inability of the people to meet their demands, it is the fact that we have got to increase home assistance. Notwithstanding that, we have additional demands.  Deputy Donnelly told us recently that, in the county which he represents, the rate is down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In what respect has it come down?  Is it on road expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of county councils and county councillors who have endeavoured to take down road expenditure at the expense of the labourer.  The Minister commended to-night the action of county councils which have maintained or increased their road expenditure.  I can tell the Minister that that is not due to any desire on the part of the county councils to make better roads.  It is due to the fact that they do not want to let down the labourers who cannot get any other work, notwithstanding that Deputy Donnelly and his Party were to call people back from America to do the work available here.  If Deputy Donnelly's council or any other council has reduced its rate by <Col N="1215" /> reducing road expenditure, I do not think it is good policy.  I am afraid they will pay the money out in some other way.  If they do not do that, somebody else will.</P>
      <P>I notice by the <i>Echo</i> of January 26th, 1936, that the estimate of the board of health in Wexford involves an increase of 2½d. on the rates.  That is very discouraging from a county like Wexford, which has been held up here as a model county, a county which has gone in more than any other county for the tillage policy advocated by Fianna Fáil.  According to the report of a meeting held on some date prior to January 25th, 1936, the extra burden placed upon the board of health will mean an increase of 2½d. on the rates in Wexford. That, the paper states, is partly due to the fact that the average cost of the 4lb. loaf in the five institutions in which bread is bought for the half-year ended September was 6.75d., while the average price for the half-year ended March, 1936, was 7.67d. There was a steady increase in the average cost of maintenance in the county home for the past 1½ years, the cost having risen from 2/11¾ during the half-year ended March, 1935, to 3/7½ during the half-year ended September and to 4/1 for the three months ended December, 1935.  That is a situation which the Minister ought to take into consideration. When some of his fellow-Ministers come into the House and tell us that the cost of living is not going up in this country at an alarming rate, I would refer them to the report of the meeting of the Wexford Board of Health.  One of the members, Miss Ryan, said: &ldquo;None of the items in the estimate can be reduced.  They all knew that the cost of living had gone up.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also here the estimates of various other bodies, including mental hospitals, and they have all gone up. In the reports of these meetings all over the country you find that three-fourths of the time is spent in discussing the rate situation, the collection of cottage rents and the annuities situation. The Minister has had on various occasions, as disclosed by these publications, <Col N="1216" /> to warn local authorities that they must use the whip&mdash;and use it hard&mdash;to get in the rates.  On one occasion I saw where an inquiry was made as to whether the rate collectors were seizing the stock of the farmers. Perhaps it is necessary on some occasions to do that.  I have here a report from the <i>Tipperary Guardian</i> of a meeting at which the arrears sheets were presented to the county council. The report states: &ldquo;In the examination of the individual cases, attention was drawn to the fact that two rate-payes who owed large sums were tillage farmers and had sold wheat and beet.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that the reason they were hauled up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not likely, because at least two of these farmers adopted the Fianna Fáil progressive policy.  They were two of the people who went in for the policy that the Minister for Agriculture and that Fianna Fáil generally say is paying, and paying well.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was suggested that cheques from the sugar company and for wheat belonging to these farmers should be garnisheed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of these, as far as I am aware, were Blueshirt farmers.  They were two of the people who are farming after the Minister's own heart, and in the way that Fianna Fáil would like them to farm.  Apparently they had not paid their rates or were not inclined to pay them.  Perhaps the money is not in beet and wheat that we are told is in these crops.  Perhaps Deputy Donnelly knows as much as I do about them, or as little.  I grow wheat, not beet, and I heard complaints in my district that there is no money in beet.  They do not appear to be of any great help to the farmers of Tipperary to pay their rates, though they have been beet growers and wheat growers.  Practically all local authorities in every corner of the country, from Killarney Mental Hospital to Monaghan, are complaining that the estimates are up, that money, and more money, is demanded.  That being so, I do not know how it can be said that the capacity of the people <Col N="1217" /> to pay is increasing.  If we take the farmers from Tipperary as the standard, men who are farming after the Fianna Fáil idea of farming, I am afraid even they do not feel that the capacity to pay is increasing.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention. I do not know if the Minister referred to it, as he made his speech partly in Irish and partly in English, but I understand from the Ceann Comhairle that we can include in the discussion the administration of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is covered by Vote 41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>I expected that the Minister would inform the House, owing to the fact that the administration of that Act was very unsatisfactory, that it was his intention to introduce certain proposals for changes that are sadly needed as regards the widows of artisans who had not agricultural holdings, and of others who had small agricultural holdings but got rid of them.  The Minister knows that the position I am referring to is a very glaring injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The building of labourers' cottages is going on apace all over the country and I am sure the Minister has had various complaints about faulty construction, due possibly to faulty supervision.  As I referred already to what I may call the discreditable affair at Castlebar I do not think there is any need to elaborate on it now.  Everyone knows what I was referring to, and the situation that existed there.  It was certainly a situation that was not creditable, in my opinion, to anyone concerned, either in Castlebar or in the Department.  I am afraid there will be a recurrence of that type of work all over the country.  I have here a report of a meeting of the Galway Board of Health, which was presided over some time ago by Deputy Beegan.  I presume this report is from the engineer in connection with contracts.  The following are some of the items:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ballinasloe: I am convinced that the supervision was not sufficiently stringent in this area.  I have been continually making adverse reports on these cottages, but, so far, no improvement is noticeable.  The finish is definitely bad.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ballybrit (Oranmore): I found it necessary to have a number of walls knocked.  Work on this site carried out in a very careless manner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ballyquirke: This job is being carried out in a most unworkman-like manner.  Some of the work is not plumb, and every species of block from broken bats to 12-inch blocks were being used.  The proper detail was shown on the plan, and I fail to see why the matter was not noticed and rectified before my inspection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Taking the report from Templemore, where the tenants attended the meeting and complained of the cottages, this discussion took place:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Harrington: I was in these houses, and I can tell you they are in a bad way.  I think we should receive this deputation.  The rain is coming down in these houses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on the report says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" />&ldquo;Mr. Fitzgerald: The tenants undoubtedly have a grievance.  There were two or three of them in with me, and from what they told me they are suffering a great hardship. The mattresses were actually wet from the rain coming down.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These houses were built at an enormous cost to the State.  As a debt is left hanging on the State, the Minister or his Department should see that such a type of house is not put up, and that all houses are properly built. Certainly houses such as are referred to in the reports are not an asset.  I am afraid those who come after the Minister will not be inclined to throw bouquets if there is going to be an enormous charge for repairs.  Every newspaper contains reports of board of health meetings at which there are complaints about houses and about them being smoky.  I suppose that cannot be remedied by inspection in the first instance, but I know that people are suffering very grave hardship owing to the fact that the chimneys are defective and that the outside structure is bad.  That is especially the case when an engineer comes along and has to get walls knocked down, and as in Templemore, where members of the board were forced to admit that even the mattresses were wet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Then we have in other places a threat from some of the weekly tenants of the new houses to refuse to pay rates.  The result is that the collection of rates is backward.  The whole matter is discreditable and it is tying a kind of mill-stone around the necks of future local authorities. On the whole, I am afraid we cannot compliment ourselves on the efficiency or the capable manner in which those houses are finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer and on which I really would feel obliged to move here that, because of the type of administration carried out by the Department, this <Col N="1220" /> Vote should be referred back for reconsideration. The Department of Local Government, possibly in conjunction with other Departments, notably the Board of Works&mdash;possibly it is general Government policy&mdash;have notified local authorities that certain grants are being made available to them for certain works, provided no person is given employment on them unless he is on the dole.  To my mind there is nothing more likely to cause downright demoralisation than that kind of instruction and the imposition of that type of condition upon local authorities.  Has it come to this, that decent young men in this country who have refused to go on the dole, who have refused to draw public money or to accept free beef, are going to be denied employment simply because they have refused to do these things? Is that what we have come to?</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Donnelly and the Minister for Local Government well remember the old Sinn Féin days and the period later on when the Free State Government was set up.  They will recollect, I am sure, that one of our greatest ambitions at that time was to wipe out the workhouses, the poorhouses as they were called, to wipe out the stigma which was supposed to attach to the inmates there, to take the brand off the clothes of the inmates of the workhouses.  Now it would seem that we are getting back on all that.  The Minister, in conjunction with other gentlemen in the Government, thinks that our self-respecting, decent young men ought not to get employment on public works where a grant is made unless they are already drawing the dole.  I say that such a state of affairs is scandalous, yet that is the type of thing that Fianna Fáil has given us. In this country latterly we have the type of mind that feels that money ought to be got for nothing.  It does not matter how it is got; it does not matter whether people have to make wrong statements or whether affidavits have been made which are not correct. The main thing is to get on the list, draw the dole, and once you become a mendicant at the State's door you can get employment, but not otherwise.  I <Col N="1221" /> had hopes that at least the Local Government Department would not descend to that type of thing.</P>
    <P>The situation is that the people who tried to wipe out the workhouses and to abolish the old conditions that prevalied here are wondering have their efforts been worth while.  I remember, when first I became a member of a local authority, poor people in need of relief would come to the back door at night so that they might not be seen by their neighbours, and so that it might not be known that they were a drain on the rates.  The people had self-respect then, and they felt the stigma of being publicly supported. They felt keenly having to look for anything, no matter how needy they were, in case it might cast a slur on them or that it might be said they were depending on charity.  What do we find at the present day?  All over the country we find at the employment exchanges men lined up from dawn till dark endeavouring to get their names on the unemployment list, or endeavouring to draw the dole, partly because some of them want money, and partly because some of them want employment and cannot get it otherwise.</P>
    <P>This is a matter upon which I feel very strongly.  It is a matter in regard to which the Government ought, even now, to pause and consider.  If the people are to be deprived of their initiative, if they are simply to wait to be told by the Government what they are to do in every avenue of life, if they are told to wait around the corner to see if they can get the dole before they are entitled to get work, then you have surely destroyed the best characteristics of the Irish people. I do not think the Minister can offer any kind of satisfactory explanation for that condition of things.  I think the sooner he and the other members of the Executive Council realise that that condition of things is going to create in this country a type of person who will not be a good citizen, who will be other than a good citizen, the better for everybody.  When they come to realise that fact, it may possibly lead to a decision on the part of the Minister to alter the condition <Col N="1222" /> accompanying those grants, and if he does alter that condition, then he will have done something in respect to which I will be inclined to throw him a bouquet.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in one respect.  I am glad that the county medical officers of health are being installed in every county.  I believe that that type of administration will do a lot of good.  I suggest that, in so far as he can do it, the Minister should facilitate county medical officers of health.  I do not think there is very much more that I want to say.  I desire to emphasise the two matters upon which I have dwelt.  One is the inefficient manner in which cottages are being built, and the other is the question of the conditions applying to the grants.</P>
    <P>There is one matter upon which, possibly, the Minister feels there is very divided opinion.  That is the proposed regulation with regard to the retiring age.  Local authorities do not really know where they are in regard to that matter.  In my own county we have had a discussion about it, and there are varied opinions as to what the Minister is going to do, whether he is going to do anything, or whether he has done it already.  The Minister, in reply to a question in the House, said he was quite open to accept and consider the opinions of local authorities. I think that we are all convinced that he has already fixed the age at 65 years.  Personally, I think that 65 is an age which ought not to be fixed.  I think it is too young.  Some of our best men are still good, long after 65 years of age.  I trust that, if local authorities do give the Minister the benefit of their opinions in a matter like this, he will give them the fair consideration which they warrant.  I am moving, for the reasons I have stated, that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(An Clár): The Minister is in this favourable or unfavourable position, that I should like to find fault with him for the things for which Deputy Brennan probably would praise him.  Deputy Brennan told us that the erection of cottages is going on apace <Col N="1223" /> throughout the country.  The trouble is that it is not going on half as fast as it should.  One can only argue in these matters from the known to the unknown.  I want to say that the Minister ought to be very well aware of the housing shortage in my own county.  I have repeatedly brought to his notice by way of question and by way of letters to his Department that, notwithstanding the fact that there were about 1,000 houses asked for in the three schemes initiated&mdash;I should rather say, adumbrated&mdash;by the Clare Board of Health, there are not 100 built yet.  That is to say, that where there were 1,000 cottages needed, the Minister has not taken sufficient steps or precautions to see that more than 100 were built after the three years.  It is nearly time that the Minister woke up to the realisation that we do want these houses, and there is legislative provision by which he can force the board of health to build these houses. It is all very well to say to me, when I set down a question and follow it by supplementary questions, that the board of health are doing certain work, that they have initiated three schemes and that they have had difficulties in respect of contractors, materials and many other things.  These difficulties will not smooth the lot of the people who are living, perhaps, six or ten in one room.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell us about the slums in the Coombe and in Gloucester Street, or in the cities of Waterford and Limerick.  There are some slums in the country districts in my county which are just as bad as the slums in these industrial centres.  I want to avail of this opportunity to put it to the Minister that it is high time he took upon himself the power conferred on him by legislation, to come in if necessary over the head of the board of health and build houses for the labourers of the county.  I want to put it to him that he has sufficient power under legislation to come in and build houses over the head of the local authority.  I want him to take the necessary steps to do that, or at least to take the necessary steps to <Col N="1224" /> force the local authority to build houses where they are necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan made the most amazing statement I have ever listened to regarding the employment of people for works carried out under grants.  He said that there should be no regulation that these people would be recruited from the lists of those registered for unemployment assistance. He told us that it was demoralising to recruit these people from the unemployment list.  Does he think that it would raise the standard of morality or the moral tone of these people to leave them longer on the unemployment list?  My fault with the Minister is that he is not insisting sufficiently strongly on these people being taken from the unemployment register. There again I argue from the known to the unknown.  I argue from what I know definitely and specifically that there are people employed on these works who are not taken from those on the unemployment register.  Representations have been made to me from various parts of my county that in various districts, small villages and towns where there are 40 or 50 people unemployed, farmers with 40 acres, 30 acres and 20 acres are brought in to work on roads and schemes carried out on grants given by the Local Government Department and operated by the board of health or the county council. If Deputy Brennan thinks that the people about whom I have spoken, farmers with 40 acres, 30 acres or 20 acres, should be allowed to compete with poor people on the unemployment register, I would sooner have the present Minister in office than Deputy Brennan.  I want to see these people taken off the unemployment register and put to work on these schemes even at the inadequate wages which they are getting under these grants.  I want the Minister to bear in mind that these people are not even put in competition with farmers.  They are often passed over by the local authorities, and his Department is not unaware of that.  His Department is not at all unaware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's method of investigating complaints forwarded to his Department in this respect leaves much to be considered.  When a complaint <Col N="1225" /> is made to the Minister that on certain work carried out under the board of health or the county council people in receipt of unemployment assistance are not being employed as against people with visible means of subsistence&mdash; land, property and other means&mdash;the Minister's Department sends down a questionnaire or a letter of some kind to the local authority.  That list of queries or complaints, whatever form it may take, finds its way into the hands of the person responsible for doing the thing that is complained of. One finds an engineer in charge of a water scheme, a housing scheme or some such work under the board of health or the county council, and that man, for some reason best known to himself, employs people who are not intended to be employed under the Government regulations.  Somebody makes a complaint to the local public representative or somebody else, and a report reaches the Department. What happens?  A copy of that person's letter or some remarks from it are sent down to the local authority. The local authority invariably sends that to the engineer against whom the complaint is made to investigate his own delinquencies.  The result is that you get a letter in about a fortnight or three weeks saying that the complaint has been investigated and that everything is done according to regulations.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to investigate these complaints, and I have told the Department that I shall take every opportunity in this House and elsewhere to raise this matter until that method of investigation is done away with.  Either a senior officer of the Department, somebody who is capable of weighing the pros and cons, must be sent down to make the investigation or the Minister must say definitely that he is not going to investigate the complaints. In the first instance I make the charge that people are not taken from the unemployment assistance list to work on these schemes.  I make the further charge that there are 1,000 working people in County Clare, some with families of three, four, five, six and seven children of different sexes, living in one room&mdash;some of them adults, fully grown.  Notwithstanding <Col N="1226" /> the fact that there have been 1,000 applications for houses in the county, the board of health has not yet built 100 cottages.  I ask the Minister does he think that that is a proper way to administer the Act passed through this House, or is he going to allow these people to rot in these slums much longer?  If he is, then he had better say it, but if he is not it is nearly time that he took the action that this House gave him the power to take, and go in over the heads of the local authorities and build houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intervening in the debate on this Estimate for this reason, that a few weeks ago, in reply to Deputy Dillon, who stated that he could see no evidence of slum clearance on the north side of the city&mdash;I think if the Deputy opened his eyes he would have seen some evidence anyhow&mdash;the Minister said that he was not at all satisfied with the rate of progress made, and that if such continued the slum question in Dublin would not be settled in his time.  He made much the same remarks in the Seanad.  These remarks implied, whether the Minister meant it or not, a charge of negligence, more or less, against the municipality of Dublin.  I do not think he really meant that.  I think that his own eagerness to see the slum question settled, at any rate in his time, prompted him to make remarks that more or less insinuated that the corporation was not doing its work as well as it might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These remarks of the Minister got very widespread attention from the Press, and in consequence of that a feeling of uneasiness began to spread amongst the people who are most interested in the abolition of the slums: that is those who have to live in them.  That might easily bring about in this city a set of circumstances that we would all regret, because we, and by we I mean the municipality, have by our efforts in recent years, at any rate, brought home to almost every tenement room in Dublin that there was good hope of relief, and relief soon.  Consequently, it became my duty as chairman of the housing committee to have circulated in the Press a statement to <Col N="1227" /> the effect that I proposed, when the Estimate for the Minister's Department came up, to bring the question of housing in Dublin before the Dáil. In doing that I would like to point out that the corporation was restored, if I can call it a corporation, in October, 1930, after, I think, a six years' reign of commissioners.  It was on the day after Stephen's Day of that year that the corporation housing committee had its first meeting.  That housing committee is simply an advisory body.  We have no power to say &ldquo;do this or do that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;do not do this or do not do that.&rdquo;  Our function simply consists in making recommendations to the City Manager to do such things as we think he might do.  At that particular period there was a Housing Bill going through this House. It was introduced by the late Government and was not passed into law until August or September of 1931. Under it certain additional powers were given, but not sufficient to enable us to surmount the difficulties with which we were faced.  By the time it came into law and we had its provisions examined, the present Government came into office.  They immediately introduced a Housing Bill which was much more comprehensive than the one that preceded it.  That Bill took some months to get through the Oireachtas.  I do not think it became law until eight or nine months later, so that, practically speaking, at least a year and a half of our tenure as a housing committee was more or less concerned with making plans for the future.</P>
    <P>I should explain to the House that when the British were in power here and had the old Local Government Board at their disposal, the old housing committee, of which I also was chairman, prepared a chart for its members in order that they might see at a glance how long it would take to have houses built on a slum area in the city, acting as quickly as possible under all the Acts of Parliament which then governed house building and which were administered by the old Local Government Board.  That chart showed that from the day the medical officer of health declared an <Col N="1228" /> area a slum area, one that was not fit for human habitation, until the first brick of the new house was laid, a period of three years elapsed.  The Bill which the present Government introduced and passed into law reduced that period to about 18 months or a little less.  That is the period that now elapses from the date on which an area is declared a slum area and the date on which the corporation can give a contract for the building of new houses.  It takes almost 18 months before all the legal formalities are complied with: for the checking of every room in that slum area, finding out who are the owners entitled to compensation, the assessing of compensation and the payment of it.  I remember that long ago I advocated in the corporation that the proper way in which to handle the slum question was this: that the moment the medical officer declared an area insanitary, the corporation should step in immediately, take possession of the site, and leave all the acts prescribed by law to be carried cut afterwards.  The question then arose as to what we really had to contend with.  In March, 1932, the City Manager inserted an advertisement in the papers asking people who might require houses to apply to the Dublin Corporation for those that were then being built or which had been built in portion of Cabra and on Ballybough and Clonliffe roads.  I do not think the City Manager had any idea of what he was going into.  Perhaps it was foolish of him to do it, perhaps it was not.</P>
    <P>There were then about 500 houses altogether to be let, and in response to his advertisement he received 8,659 applications.  These 8,659 applications took many months to investigate and to schedule.  When that was all done we found that nearly all of them lived in one room and that 752 of them were tuberculous families living in one room in basements.  And we had only 500 houses to deliver.  Goodness knows that was bad enough but there was worse.  We found it necessary, out of the 500 houses that we had to deliver, to hand over 246 of them to tenants of the purchased houses belonging to the corporation.  These were houses that <Col N="1229" /> had been built during the previous years.  They were purchased houses let to people at payments from 11/1 to 17/1 per week, the tenants to pay the rates, keep the place in repair and to pay the insurance.  That was all very well in theory but when it started to be worked out in practice it was not so well, because the amount of money that the working man had to spend every week in the way of rent and other charges was too much for his wages.  The tenants, therefore, got in arrear.  Some of them got into arrear through misfortune, unemployment and sickness.  However, it was necessary in order to relieve the City Manager of the responsibility of having wholesale evictions on these city estates where there were purchased houses to hand over 246 of these 500 new houses to these people who were in arrear.  We then had to divide the remaining 254 between 8,659 families who were applying for them.  In the Seanad recently a member said&mdash;and I thought the Seanad was dead or dying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He proved that by saying that they were going to die like the old French aristocrats who, when ascending the steps of the guillotine took off their hats and saluted that particular instrument.  That member made a courtly bow, took off his hat to show how he would do it.  I would have returned the bow myself only that I am a bit stiff in the back.  Well, if they are dying like gentlemen I hope they will get a good wake and that all their friends will turn up to kiss the corpse and that they will be buried like gentlemen.  Here is what one of them said some time ago: &ldquo;The Dublin Corporation are putting up very good suitable houses.  Their contractors are not faced with any great difficulty in the matter of using a large proportion of Irish materials.  I agree, of course, that as far as the Corporation houses are concerned, there is a good deal of <Col N="1230" /> supervision to ensure that the right quantity of Irish material goes into the houses.  As regards the people who require the houses I must say that the slum dwellers&mdash;those to whom many politicians owe their positions&mdash;are fairly well catered for.  I want, however, to put this to the Minister&mdash;that it is about time that the old citizens of Dublin should get fair treatment in the allocation of the new houses.  It is not fair to other residents, born and reared in the slums, to see men coming up from the country and getting Corporation houses in preference to them.&rdquo; He went on then to give examples of families who could count fifty years' residence in the city and who, from the number of children in the family, were entitled to get Corporation houses.  He mentioned one case where the mother was delicate.  The apartments in which they were living were condemned by the medical officer of health as unfit for human habitation. &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these people were living in a slum in Mountjoy&rdquo;; and then he went on to say: &ldquo;I did everything in my power but without success to influence the Corporation to give one of their houses to this family.  We can all see Civic Guards getting Corporation houses.  They get them in preference to people living in slums and to people with small wages.  As a result of the refusal of the Corporation to give that family a house the mother has since died and the children are now motherless.&rdquo; That case was carefully investigated by an official of the Corporation and there is no substance in it.  The family never lived in a basement.  The poor mother died, it is true, but it was from heart failure.  There were not a large number of children; there were two boys and a girl who were living in a fairly airy room, which was divided by a partition for sleeping purposes. The City Manager could not deal with the case at the period.  Since he is only dealing with cases where a large number of children with their father and mother are living in one room he could not deal with it.  I think he is now dealing with seven children cases. At that time he was dealing with cases where there were 12, 11, ten and nine children in the family.  I give that <Col N="1231" /> as an illustration of the class of talk that is going on.  When a Senator makes a statement like that what can you expect from people who are not Senators?  We have this class of talk going about that there are people coming up here from the country and getting houses, and we have it that Civic Guards are considered before other citizens.  I submit that a Civic Guard is entitled to a house the same as the next man or at least his wife and children are.  Because, after all, this housing question is a woman's question and a Civic Guard's wife and family are entitled to get a house if they comply with the conditions laid down by the City Manager.  I do not think many Civic Guards have Corporation houses.  Where they are occupying such houses I think they are purchased houses from the Corporation. Now, this question of the country people coming up to Dublin and walking into a house brings me to this point, that it would be well for the representatives here from county constituencies to warn their people to secure habitation, at any rate, before coming to Dublin.  I say that because the conditions under which they have to live if they sink down to the slums in Dublin are infinitely worse than they would have to endure in the country notwithstanding what Deputy Hogan stated here a few minutes ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is for the Dublin Corporation now to say whether they are prepared to take the needful steps to accomplish the object so eminently desirable from the points of view of public <Col N="1232" /> health and the well-being of a considerable proportion of its denizens.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bringing the Corporation face to face with their responsibility in this matter! I do not think there was ever any body constituted in this city or in any other city in the world which was ever brought face to face with any problem, so constantly and so terribly, every day of its life, as is the Corporation with this question of the slums.  There is scarcely a member of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, except, I might say, those who live well outside the city, who has not, day in and day out, for at least six days in the week, a constant stream of people coming to him looking for Corporation houses&mdash;all sorts and conditions of the poor, many bringing with them terrible evidences of the conditions under which they live.  Many of them come in with clear glass bottles in their hands in which are filthy sewer slugs that crawl up the wall at night, and horrible looking beetles of a colour that I could not describe.  The children are brought in with their faces all marked with bug bites.  At night the mothers have to tie a cloth over their faces in order to protect them. As for evidence of sewer rats, over and over again have I got it.  Over and over again have those people implored me: &ldquo;Mr. Kelly, do not let us have to put in another summer here.&rdquo;  Just imagine, when all other civilised people live under decent conditions and enjoy the summer, that is the time the slum dwellers hate most, because that is the period when the vermin are the most active.  Face to face with our responsibilities !  Every day in the week most of the members of the Corporation are faced with those things.  They are faced with the imploring cry: &ldquo;Take us out of this terrible place.&rdquo;  Why is this happening now?  It is because they have become alive even now to the terrible conditions under which they have lived for years.  When asked &ldquo;How long have you lived in that place?&rdquo;  the reply very often is &ldquo;20 years,&rdquo; or perhaps &ldquo;15 years.&rdquo;  In reply to the question &ldquo;Could you not have got a place out of it?&rdquo;  They often say, &ldquo;Oh, we did not think of it; we tried and failed; we did not know.&rdquo;<Col N="1233" /> They know now.  It has been brought home to every one of them in every room and basement in Dublin.  They are all anxious to get out of them, and we are anxious to help them.  Now, I am blaming nobody; I am only stating the conditions under which the Corporation had to work and has worked.  This very same newspaper published at least one article from me in connection with the conditions under which people live in the slums of Dublin.  Now their memories are so short that they want to make out that we are not face to face with our responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    <P>The same issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> says here under the heading, &ldquo;Poets at Tyburn&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At 9 o'clock on the morning of February 20, 1749, six men were hanged, drawn and quartered on Tyburn Hill.  Of these, one was a smuggler, one was a highwayman and two were forgers.  The remaining two, whose names were Usher Gahagan and Terence Connor, suffered for the crime of filing guineas.  Gahagan was a native of Westmeath and had been educated at Trinity College.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The other was a cultured man too, although it did not state that Connor was educated at Trinity College. Those two men along with two others were executed for filing guineas, or coining money.  It would be a good job if there were two journalists killed along with them.  It would make room for others.</P>
    <P>There was one flaw in the Bill, and I am sorry the Minister was responsible for the Bill.  The Minister was a member of the Corporation for years, and he knows as much about housing conditions in Dublin as I do, or very nearly as much, but there was one flaw in his Bill, and I said so in the Corporation when it was up before. The flaw was that the Bill should have contained a clause providing that the Corporation should have a steady supply of money.  It should have guaranteed the Government's credit to the Corporation to get money.  We agreed to build 2,000 houses a year for five years if it were possible, but that <Col N="1234" /> agreement was conditional.  It was conditional on getting money, on getting materials and on getting men&mdash;three conditions necessary for most enterprises in this world.  Those three conditions were defaulted in.</P>
    <P>Actually you might say that the present Housing Committee did not begin to operate properly until 1933. A loan was floated then for £650,000. The stock was issued at 96, at 4¼ per cent. interest.  There was over £3,000,000 subscribed for that loan in less than two days, and we wanted only £650,000.  That was a good start. The next loan was for £1,000,000.  It was offered at 96, but the interest was reduced to 3½ per cent.  The public subscribed 88.2 per cent., and the underwriters were left to find the balance.  The next loan was in March, 1935, and this was for £1,350,000, at 3½ per cent. interest, and issued at 93. Only 56½ per cent. was subscribed, and the underwriters had to bear the remaining very large portion.  The banks then decided in effect&mdash;they did not use the blunt words I am going to use&mdash;that they could not be expected to saddle such responsibility if they were to do their duty to their depositors. There was the difficulty. Our 1935 programme involved an expenditure of £1,090,000 to get on with our jobs.  We could not do it.  All the loan that we asked for, £1,350,000, was mortgaged.  Contracts had been placed and builders were working away.  We never laid a brick of the 1935 programme, because we could not get the money.  We tried every resort. We had a deputation to the Minister for Finance last July, and I think he stopped with us for nearly an hour and a half discussing ways and means of raising money.  He advised us to try every means.  I asked him whether, if we failed, we could look to the Local Loans Fund for relief.  He said &ldquo;I think you can,&rdquo; but he advised us not to be in too great a hurry.  I remember making the remark to him, as we were coming away that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, would not be pleased to hear him give that advice, and that he was all for hurry.</P>
    <P>We members of the Corporation have some control over finance&mdash;not complete <Col N="1235" /> but some control&mdash;and the Finance Committee of the Corporation decided they would not look to the Local Loans Fund.  They sent applications to various insurance companies in England asking if they would lend money to the Corporation for housing purposes.  I believe they got one loan of £250,000 at 4 per cent.  The other companies stated that they could not lend money as they had not the means, and I believe one company was blunt enough to say: &ldquo;Even if we had the means, we would not give it to you.&rdquo; Every effort was tried, and I believe the City Manager, who had £350,000, £360,000 or some big sum like that on deposit for the payment of contractors as bills became due, and which was not wanted for some time, made application to the Local Government Department for leave to use that money for the time being, and stating that when things would settle the matter could be made right.  I believe the Department would not agree to that as it was not legal.</P>
    <P>I am merely introducing that as evidence that we tried everywhere, but we got no money for the whole year, and we could not build the houses. Fortunately, the Minister for Finance turned up trumps in the end, and our last loan in January, 1936, for £1,000,000 at 4 per cent. was oversubscribed in a few hours.  More power to him.  So far, the outlook now is all right, but what have we to do? In March, 1934, it was estimated that 18,000 families, almost entirely housed in one-room dwellings, were in need of better accommodation.  Since that date the Corporation have provided 2,600 dwellings, and it may be assumed now that the number awaiting improved accommodation is approximately 15,000 families who are living in one room and basements in this city.  There are 1,600 basements in the City of Dublin occupied to-night.  I do not suggest that the whole 1,600 are unfit for human habitation, but I do say from my knowledge that the larger number are and should be closed up.  Life in them, and the conditions under which the people live in them, are beyond description.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> In the tenements themselves, especially where the young men and women are growing up, the situation is very bad.  A sheet has to be hung across the room at night to divide the sexes, and sometimes the boys have to go out on the lobby while the girls undress and vice versa.  Sometimes the overcrowding is so dreadful that the very smell of the room sickens one.  A reporter came to me one day, after hearing me make some statement on this subject.  He asked me was it really true, and where would he go. I recommended him to go to a certain street on the north side.  He went there and he came back the next day and told me: &ldquo;I got sick.&rdquo;  I asked: &ldquo;Do you mean figuratively?&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;No, physically sick; I had to leave.&rdquo;  That is our job, and when that job is completed we will probably have the position the Minister would like to have.</P>
    <P>But how are we going to do it?  Are we sure the money will be there to carry this out, and, if we are sure of the money, what about the other difficulties? What about the difficulties of labour?  I have a report dealing with that very matter from the city architect.  I cannot lay my hand on it just at the moment, but he points out the difficulties he had, firstly, with regard to the supply of materials, and, secondly, with regard to the supply of labour, more especially in connection with plasterers.  It was very difficult to get plasterers.  They worked all right, but the supply was not available.  I am sorry to say that some of the speculative builders in this city offered better wages and better terms to plasterers, and, naturally, these men worked where they got the best money.  You cannot blame them for that, but that brought about a fairly long delay in some cases.  This report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been advised by the housing architect that an extension of the contract period was granted on the Mercer Street, Hanover Street (Section 8), Donnelly's.  Orchard and Greek Street contracts, owing to the delays experienced by contractors in obtaining delivery of materials.  The contract period was extended by five months on Crumlin <Col N="1237" /> (Section 1 and 3 contract), and an allowance of ten weeks was made on Greek Street contract, due to the shortage of plasterers.  Also on the North Lotts and Hanover Street (Section 2) schemes permission was given for the employment of plasterers without the necessary residential qualifications, and on Crumlin (Sections 2 and 4) for the employment of non-local carpenters and plasterers.  At Cook Street, apart from the extension granted to Messrs.  Meagher and Hayes on account of extra works, an extension was also given to the contractors on account of the dispute with the plasterers and the delay experienced by builders in obtaining delivery of materials.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Sims further advised that if the difficulties with regard to finance and labour had not arisen, and further contracts could have been placed early in 1935, the seriousness of the situation which arose during that year of having semi-completed houses on hands owing to shortage of skilled labour, would have been avoided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have material here that would probably keep me speaking for an hour, but what I want to make clear here to-night is that the Corporation has done its work, and if causes over which it has no control have operated to prevent further building being carried out, the Corporation is not to blame.  I say, unhesitatingly, that I never worked with a more competent body of men and women, or a body of men and women so wishful to do this work, so anxious to avoid all delays and so earnest in their job, as the present housing committee of the Corporation.  Nothing has ever divided us.  We all recognise that this question is a great human question, because this blot on Dublin has lasted for generations.</P>
    <P>During the rebellion year of 1798 an order was issued from Dublin Castle that on the hall-door of all houses within the city there should be either a printed or written list of the inhabitants, so that officials of the Castle, soldiers or others, could see at a glance who lived in the house. The Reverend Mr. Whitelaw, who <Col N="1238" /> was then Rector of St. Catherine's Protestant Church, sought permission of the Castle authorities to go into these houses himself, because, he said, he was so interested in the names on the doors as he was passing through the streets&mdash;especially the streets of his own parish&mdash;that he was anxious to see the people who lived in them.  Sometimes these names were so badly written that they were hard to decipher.  Permission was given to him by the Castle authorities, and from that May until December he pursued that job in the city, and went into all those old tenement rookeries that then existed and that still exist, and took down notes of the conditions under which the people lived, and of their surroundings. As a result of this, he published an account of the horrible conditions under which the poor people lived, and I am sorry to say that some of the old lanes and cul-de-sacs that he then described are still in existence, and still inhabited, and that the same conditions are there, only that they are 100 years worse.  You can count that up&mdash; 100 years worse.  No attention was paid at all to the people living in the slums of the City of Dublin during the century.  There was agitation for Emancipation, Repeal of the Union, and a whole lot of other things, but no attention was paid to the people living in the slums.  Now and again some philanthropic man or woman endeavoured to direct public attention to those conditions, but never with much success.  After one of the cholera epidemics with which the unfortunate city was afflicted about 100 years ago, a Doctor Willis tried his best, in his time, to get something done, but nothing was done, and I have a cutting from a newspaper, published so late as 1886 or 1887, when the then Corporation built the first block of Corporation buildings in Benburb Street, and wonder was expressed at the idea of a council going in for Socialism.  It was held at the time that the provision of places for the poor to live in was a matter for private enterprise, and it was not until an Act of Parliament was passed by the British House of Commons for the housing of the working classes that <Col N="1239" /> and kind of genuine attention was paid by local bodies here to that matter of the housing of the working classes.</P>
    <P>I have so much information here that, probably, to-night I shall be lying awake thinking of a lot of other things I should have said.  However, I cannot help that.  Take the case of Aldborough House, which is at present in the occupation of the postal authorities. I think it occupies about 2½ acres. A deputation waited on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs about three years ago in connection with its acquisition. The Minister received us very warmly indeed, and his officers gave us every encouragement.  In fact, so much was I delighted with the interview that, although I seldom shake hands with anybody, I shook hands with the Minister when we were leaving, and I think I shook hands with his assistants also.  I shook hands with the whole crowd.  Well, that was three years ago, and we have not got it yet. The last thing I heard about it was that they want £7,000 an acre for it. Well, the Corporation is not going to give it, and I now publicly withdraw the shake-hands.  It is the only thing I can do.</P>
    <P>I say this to the Minister: You say you are not satisfied; well, then, take the job on yourself.  You have a Housing Board.  You have engineers. You have staff and everything else at your command.  I can say this without the slightest hesitation: you will not get the job done better.  The men who are working under the City Manager or the officers of the Corporation could not be excelled in the work they are doing in that direction.  However, as the Minister is the man to be pleased and as he has a natural anxiety, as I have, to see this infamous blot wiped off our city, which is the capital of our country, then let him take on the job himself.  He could take over the Corporation staff.  He could not get better men.  Speaking for myself personally, and I am sure I can speak for every member of the Housing Committee&mdash;certainly for every member who attends to his job&mdash;we would be very glad to be relieved of the responsibility. From the City Manager down to the porter who receives messages, or <Col N="1240" /> the three or four porters at the door, who are overwhelmed every day with people coming from all parts of Dublin looking for houses, we would be all glad to be relieved of the responsibility. We do not want to be relieved of it, however.  We are not anxious to be relieved of it.  We are willing to go on, but we want recognition that we are doing the work and that it is no fault of ours if it has not been done.</P>
    <P>In concluding this rather lengthy statement I have made, I wish to give figures as to the slum areas to be dealt with now&mdash;this is dated 27th March.  The number of families to be dispossessed immediately amounts to 4,519.  The number of houses to be demolished amounts to 17,094, and the number of houses proposed for erection is 4,678.  That is the immediate job we have now settled to go on with. I hope I have conveyed to those who were good enough to listen to me for so long that this is a terrible evil in this city and that it is up to us all, no matter from what part of the country we come, to help to have it wiped out.  As I said, it has been a reproach for centuries, but it is a great work. No men could be at better work, and that is why we wish to continue.  We do not want to try to continue unless we are assured that we are going to get the help that is needed, principally that to which I have alluded.  I do not think any Deputy will refuse to vote any money to get rid of the conditions which exist in our capital city. Believing that, I have made my statement. The Minister has the right to reply to what I have said and to what other Deputies will say.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of the principle of city managers.  I believe in democracy and democratic government of the city by the citizens.  Of course, it is very hard to know what democratic government is.  I looked up the dictionary the other day and I saw that democracy meant government by the people.  That is the same meaning as it had when I looked it up a few months ago&mdash;it has not changed.  I do not really know what democracy is.  We on this side of the House were elected by the people. Deputies on the opposite side say that we are the worst Government that ever <Col N="1241" /> existed, and they were elected by the people.  Some other Deputies are more or less nondescript, and they also were elected by the people. There are four or five such Deputies.</P>

      <P>However, I wish to close my remarks by paying this tribute to the City Manager.  He has done everything that mortal man could do&mdash; working under certain physical difficulties, I regret to say&mdash;by action, by words, by advice, by warning to solve this housing problem.  He has acted a great part in this housing campaign that we have gone on with for the last few years.  As I have already said, his officers have also done well, and my last words are a tribute of respect to the devoted men and women who act on the housing committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly has told the House that one of the difficulties, in fact the difficulty, of the corporation was its inability to raise money. He turned to the Minister towards the end of his speech and said: &ldquo;If you do not like the way we are doing the job, take it on yourself.&rdquo;  Did it ever occur to Deputy Kelly that he and his colleagues might put the Minister in the same position, might put the national Exchequer in the same position as he finds himself in the Dublin Corporation to-day?  Does he ever realise when protests are made against extravagance along other lines that those who protest against extravagance protest because they are thinking of the very problems that are perplexing and overwhelming Deputy Kelly and his colleagues at the present time?  Is he now beginning to realise that unrestricted national extravagance may be pleasant for the time being, but it makes it impossible to carry out reforms which Deputy Kelly and I know must be carried into effect, if a peculiarly pernicious type of revolution is not to be precipitated in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly says: &ldquo;Where are we going to get money?&rdquo;  Give me the money that is squandered on the cultivation of beet at present and I will wipe out every slum in Dublin in five <Col N="1242" /> years.  I do not want to stray outside the relevance of this Estimate, but I want to point out to Deputies on the far side that folly in one Department of State may result in tragedy in another.  Reckless spending on worthless enterprises by the Government for the purpose of purchasing a transient popularity, or for the purpose of covering up defects in their general political policy, may result in depriving the persons, who are living among the lice, the rats, and the bugs described by Deputy Kelly, of the opportunity of protecting their children from the diseases and death that follow on accommodation of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is six years ago since I invited some of the Minister's colleagues to the King's Inns, standing in the centre of one of the worst slums in this city, to join with me in advocating radical reform in the matter of the housing of the tenants of the slums of this city.  I said recently in this House, to the great indignation of the Minister for Local Government, that I can see very little improvement in the tenement problem of this city since the Government took office.  To-night Deputy Kelly tells us that there are 15,000 families&mdash;not individuals but 15,000 families&mdash;living in one-room tenements in this city alone, and he goes on to tell us that there are 1,600 families living in basements, with sewer slugs, as he describes them, rats, lice, bugs and vermin of all kinds, making it necessary for mothers to wrap the heads of their children in cloths before they put them to bed. Does that represent any material improvement on the conditions obtaining in this city when I spoke about them six or seven years ago in the King's Inns?  I do not think it does.</P>
    <P>Now, tributes of a pretty generous character were paid to the Minister and his Department over his housing policy in rural Ireland during the last four years and he certainly deserves credit for the energy with which he pursued that policy.  But it is time that this House faced facts.  The building of houses in rural Ireland is a perfectly simple business.  All you have got to do is to go out into the open country, take the land and put the men <Col N="1243" /> to work.  The money is raised from the rates and from the moneys made available to the Minister by this House for the purpose of making grants.  There is no complexity in the problem at all.  That easy task has been vigorously prosecuted by the Department of Local Government.  But if I may compare the whole housing problem of the Government to a dam across the river of progress, one half consists of silt and mud and that represents the rural housing problem. That can be dug away without any serious bother or difficulty.  The other half of the dam is represented by rock, and that is the problem of city tenants. To remove that requires blasting and it requires hard work.  I say that up to now it has been tackled with nothing more formidable than a blunt pickaxe and it is time that that half of the dam was tackled with the resolution to dispose of it finally and for all time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly wails, and properly wails, about the want of money.  We have spent £20,000,000 sterling in the prosecution of the economic war during the last four years.  Could we not have solved the whole housing problem of the City of Dublin for less than that? We could have taken every one of these people out of their basements; we could have levelled every tenement house in this city and we could have provided every tenant with a room in a flat building or a house on the outskirts of the city for less than £20,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <P>£20,000,000 have been squandered.  Does Deputy Donnelly now understand the measure of his own crime in being party to that squandering?  Does he now understand what that crime has cost this country, when he hears the description given by Deputy Kelly and when he hears from Deputy Kelly that the only thing that is preventing the remedying of that state of affairs is the lack of the money that Deputy Donnelly and his <Col N="1244" /> colleagues have thrown away?  It is a poor thing to-night to read of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British House of Commons triumphing that he has got £400,000 more than his estimate out of the Irish people.  And because he has got it, there are people being plagued with rats and eaten with vermin in the basements of tenement houses in Dublin.  Deputy Kelly says that there is a body of earnest men ready to do the job if they have the facilities.  Deputy Kelly rightly says that every Deputy in this House is prepared to vote any money that is necessary to do the job, but the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance meet Deputy Kelly when he goes to them on a deputation and, with devious answers, they put him off, and, suggesting that he should seek for the money here, there and everywhere, will not tell him why they cannot provide it.</P>
      <P>Did Deputy Kelly ever ask himself why the Minister for Finance puts him off?  Did he ever ask himself why the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not feel himself in a position to insist that Deputy Kelly will not be put off?  Does he not know as well as I do that Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, does not relish the thought that his own neighbours live in the vermin-ridden rooms that Deputy Kelly has described?  Does he not know that the Minister for Local Government is as anxious as I am, or as he himself is, to get these people out of these rooms?  Does he ever ask himself why they will not give the one thing that will make it possible to get these people out within the next 12 months?  They cannot do it, because Deputy Kelly and his colleagues are squandering the national resources, and the money that ought to be spent taking these people out of the basements and the tenement rooms is being spent fighting President de Valera's war.  I am not going to dwell on that aspect of the situation any more.</P>

      <P>I believe I would be fully within my right in so doing if I desired, but it is unnecessary to argue it any <Col N="1245" /> further, seeing that I have said what I wanted to say.  There is force and there is substance in Deputy Kelly's final words.  He said that if the Corporation of the City of Dublin are unable to grapple with this problem, albeit that they have the goodwill to deal with the problem had they the means, I say is the Government's duty to take the solution of that problem upon their own shoulders.  Let not this House forget that, grim as is the situation in the City of Dublin, it is not peculiar to the City of Dublin.  I was recently in a small city like Limerick, and I walked down one of the quays there, and I found on the side of the river in Limerick tenement houses just as bad as you would find in Gloucester Street or Lower Gardiner Street in this city.  Limerick is a city to any part of which you could easily walk from the outskirts in 15 minutes.  If they cannot get land in the city it does not seem to be conceivable that any workman would object to taking a house on the outskirts of the city if the alternative was to live in one of the tenement houses that I saw. The Minister has been in office for four years.  He cannot acquit himself of the failure to deal with the slum problem in a city like Limerick, because there the extremely complex question of acquiring vacant land within the city boundary, which afflicts the Dublin Corporation, cannot possibly arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the slum conditions in the City of Cork are extremely bad in certain areas.  I think I am right in saying that one of the parochial clergy, certainly a clergyman of standing in the City of Cork, used language about the Cork tenants which was sensationally strong.  Does the Minister feel that he has discharged his duties in this regard by sitting silently by?  Does he think that exaltation of the local authorities is enough when he is well aware that the local authorities are faced with the problem of being unable to get the money, as is the case in Dublin? Deputy Kelly very fairly says: &ldquo;I do not desire to blame anybody.&rdquo;  There is no suggestion that there is some dark and horrible Fine Gael conspiracy in the Dublin Corporation to discredit <Col N="1246" /> the present Government.  Of course, some people might say: &ldquo;These wicked people are desirous of keeping the people in the slums in order to promote dissatisfaction with the Government.&rdquo;  Deputy Kelly acquits them of that.  He says: &ldquo;I know them and I think they are doing all they can, all that is humanly possible, to get these people out of the slums, but they have not the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this country presents a solvent exterior to the world, can anyone doubt the capacity of the national Government to raise any money that may be necessary for the abolition of the slums?  If this country has the external appearance and the internal reality of solvency, can anyone believe that there will be a word of criticism from any part of this House to any proposal by the Minister to raise whatever money is necessary to get rid of the slums?  Does anyone doubt that there is any section of our community in Ireland who would object to any sacrifice that they would be called upon to make in order to satisfy themselves that no woman would have to wrap her infant's head in a cloth to prevent its being eaten by vermin in the night?  I am prepared to say now that if we can see solvency in front of this country, the Minister may rest assured that he will get from every side of this House all the help and co-operation he wants in taking every step that may be necessary to abolish the tenements of the City of Dublin and other cities throughout the Saorstát, and substitute decent houses for the people.  I think the time has come to realise this, that decent houses are as urgent a necessity for the people of this State as any other social service that can be named.  Nobody would dream of leaving a pump in a rural area which was well-known to be poisonous.  No question of money would be raised by anybody if the problem was to remove that source of disease.  I move to report progress.</P>
