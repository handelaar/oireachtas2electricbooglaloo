      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if Miss Arabella Mary Ivy Standing (Card No. 69117) who has been ill since 4th February will receive payment of National Health Insurance benefit for her hospital expenses, also what the payment of 5/- received on the 21st March was intended to discharge; if he will state when a further payment will be received and to what rate of benefit is Miss Standing entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Miss Standing submitted a claim for sickness benefit to Cumann an Archais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte on 14th February, 1936, in respect of incapacity for work as from the 12th idem.  Benefits payable during the benefit year commencing the 6th January, 1936, are governed by the contributions paid during the contribution year ended 7th July, 1935.  Miss Standing had no contributions to credit for that year up to the date of her claim, when she surrendered her card for the first half-year of 1935. Her 2/34 period card is still outstanding, and, whilst she states that it was sent to the Society in January, 1935, there is no record of its receipt by the Society and the insured person has not produced evidence of its surrender. Owing to the absence of the 2/34 card and the late surrender of the 1/35 period card, Miss Standing was, in accordance with the Arrears Regulations, 1921, suspended from all benefits for a period of four weeks from the date of surrender, i.e., until the 13th March, 1936.  At that date she became entitled to benefit at the rate of 5/- per week only, owing to the operation of an Arrears Penalty of 7/-, which reduces full sickness benefit (12/-) by a like amount.  The payment of 5/- received by Miss Standing on the 21st instant represents one week's benefit for the period 13th-19th March, inclusive, and a further payment of 5/10 covering the period from 20th-27th March issued on the 28th instant. Hospital benefit is not a statutory benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, but an additional benefit provided by certain of the former Approved Societies who, on <Col N="527" /> valuation, were found to have a disposable surplus.  Miss Standing was a member of the former Prudential Health Insurance Society, and, as that Society did not provide any additional benefits, she is not entitled to hospital benefit from Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing this Estimate, travelled over the whole ground of agriculture and gave us figures for imports and exports.  But, right through his whole explanation, the knife was prominently in evidence.  It seems that the mentality of the present Administration with regard to agriculture is to be able to say &ldquo;we have no surplus.&rdquo; They are not so much concerned with the increase of production and the building up of the productive capacity of the country as they found it, but that they should be able to show there is no surplus. When they have no surplus they consider they have reached their objective. The Minister seemed to be jubilant over the fact that he almost reached that stage, and, in proof of that, he mentioned that the price of export licences now had gone down to normal as it were.  One would think any Minister for Agriculture in this country, who could not regulate the business of exportation so as to prevent drovers, who never owned a beast in their lives selling export licences in the markets, would find no satisfaction in the fact that there was no market for export licences now because we have reached such a stage that we have no surplus to export. The Minister overlooked the fact that from the time he was a boy, and slightly before that time, the productivity of this country had increased owing to the generous use of fertilisers and that the carrying capacity of the land, both in crops and live-stock, had increased, but that since he has come into office it has gone down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at a dinner a short time ago where a few songs were sung.  One of these songs remained in my mind although I am not very musical.  I thought of it when the Minister was giving us his views on agriculture when introducing this Estimate.  The name of the song was &ldquo;The Legion of the Lost.&rdquo;  It struck me that that song would accurately depict the condition of agriculture under the Minister's régime.  He has not much concern for livestock.  He treated us to <Col N="538" /> a long discourse on the killing of old cows.  These old cows were killed and sent to Roscrea or somewhere else to get them out of the way.  That is all right, but at what cost to the country? Killing calves was another point he dealt with.  I have here a letter which I received this morning from the Minister's own constituency.  It is a bit long to read but it says, amongst other things, that they have not enough young cattle in Wexford.  The Minister proposes to take money from his own constituents in Wexford&mdash;for some of this money is coming, indirectly, from them&mdash;for the killing of calves this year.  Is the Minister living in a world of reality?</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, in the Dublin market, store cattle sold at a higher rate than fat cattle.  Why?  Because there is an increased demand for store cattle. Why is there an increased demand for store cattle?  Because the baneful effect of the Minister's policy of slaughtering calves is bearing fruit.  A Government that seeks to administer the main industry of this country, and provides as a remedy the limiting of its output, is a Government that does not seem to grasp what its functions ought to be.  We are told that the Government is doing other things.  It has introduced us to the growing of tobacco.  It has talked a lot about the experiments made in the growing of tobacco.  It is estimated that 10,000 acres would provide us with all the pipe tobacco, cigarettes, cigars and snuff that we use in this country.  We were told 10,000 acres would be enough. People acquainted with the potential yield and consumption of tobacco realise that 10,000 acres of land would give us all we require, and that not an ounce need come in from outside.  The Minister admitted, when introducing his Estimate, that the revenue would lose 10d. a lb. in remission which had to be given on home-grown tobacco.  Is it not like a joke that the revenue pays 10d. a lb. to persons to produce an article that is only worth 5d.?  Deputy Eamonn Donnelly raises his eyebrows at that statement, but it is a fact.  If it is not a fact the Minister made a wrong statement.  I am not questioning his statement, but the Deputy may. In addition to that, we are losing 1,000 <Col N="539" /> acres of land in Meath, the finest land in the world.  That Meath land is included in the 10,000 acres devoted for the growing of tobacco.  10d. a lb. would work out at between £25 and £30 per acre, and we are taking in this 1,000 acres of good land as well.</P>
    <P>Apropos of a question that I put here last week, as to the recoupment of agriculture for the money agreed to be paid by the President under the coal-cattle pact, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, recited a whole litany of things that the Government were doing in other directions for agriculture, and to recoup agriculture for that valuable contribution to the British.</P>
    <P>Tobacco was one.  Is tobacco grown, under the conditions I have explained, a recoupment for any money that is paid as a tribute to Great Britain? Sugar beet is another.  We are told that they have given the farmers a market for so many thousands of acres of sugar beet.  I hope Deputies were here to listen to Deputy Norton's speech in this debate on Thursday last.  He mentioned several counties, including beet-growing counties, where even £1 per week is not paid to agricultural labourers. Is beet growing under these conditions a substitute for the agricultural conditions we had prior to the present Minister taking office?  It is by their fruits we shall know them. There is no need to go into statistics in regard to beet cultivation.  Deputy Norton did not give an accurate picture of the whole position, because he was speaking from the angle of hired labour on farms.  I challenge Deputy Donnelly, who represents beet-growing counties, to contradict me when I say that people growing beet extensively in Leix and Offaly are producing it by the slave labour of their own families.  I have it from local people in Leix and Tipperary that it was a common thing during the beet harvest season, when the hired labour left off in the evening, for both the men and women of the farmers' families to work at the beet into the night.</P>
    <P>Are these the conditions we are to have in agriculture?  Does the Deputy <Col N="540" /> who said that the whole fault with agriculture was that the agricultural people were too lazy, still subscribe to that?  He is absent now.  Perhaps he is growing a bit lazy from mixing with farmers here.  Because a market is created at a huge price for sugar produced in this country under those conditions, we are told that that is a recoupment to agriculture.  The Government are quite entitled to make those experiments, but they are not entitled to make one section of the community pay for the folly of their experiments.</P>
    <P>Next we come to wheat, which was also dealt with by the Minister.  My Wexford correspondent this morning informed me that they could not get in the winter wheat&mdash;they were short of seed&mdash;and the wheat they got in was a failure.  I do not know how true that is.  But, under those conditions, we are told by the Government that as compensation for the abrupt change in the agricultural economy, for the tribute to Great Britain of £5,000,000 in agricultural produce, and for the coal-cattle pact and its predecessor the economic war, 26/- per barrel is fixed as the price for wheat.  It is important to note that that is fixed at a time when the world price of wheat is about 14/- per barrel.  The Minister did not think it worth while to dwell on the livestock trade, into which millions of the Irish taxpayers' money have been pumped for the last 30 years to improve the breed, beyond trying to show that we have not now a surplus of livestock for sale, as if he were delighted with the fact.</P>
    <P>We are told that tillage is the policy of this Government&mdash;that we should produce for our own requirements. On the broad principle of that I am in agreement with the Government far more than with the Opposition.  But apart from whether that is a good or a bad policy it has certain implications. After having endeavoured for a long time to demonstrate to the Minister and his colleagues that more tillage means more live stock, they have accepted that fact.  Certainly more tillage means a lot more food for live stock.  An area of land under grass <Col N="541" /> will not produce the same amount of food for live stock as an acre of tillage. No matter what economy is practised, from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the entire produce of the tillage must be fed to live stock before being available for human food.  More tillage, then, must of necessity mean more live stock.  It follows from these premises that if you are going to have more tillage you must not slaughter your live stock; you must conserve and increase your live-stock population. Has the Minister taken leave of his senses when he stands up here and boasts of the slaughter of old cows and calves, and in the same breath tells us that he stands for a tillage policy?</P>
    <P>Let us see what his tillage policy is. Take his wheat policy, for instance. If you take any man growing wheat on any sort of a scale for the last three or four years, you will find that with him it is wheat this year, wheat the next year, wheat the year after, and wheat the year after again.  There is not a scrap of difference between that sort of agricultural economy and Bill Sykes going into a bank, holding up the staff and taking the money.  In this case Bill Sykes is, so to speak, taking the money value that lies latent in the soil of this country, some of which is the product of years of labour and a heritage from preceding generations. He is taking away the fertility of the soil in two or three years to bolster up a policy that would not be tolerated in any civilised country. When you take away the fertility of the soil, what have you left?  Nothing, and that is what the policy is coming to.  The particular point I want to make is the absolute inconsistency of reducing the live-stock population and saying, at the same time, that you advocate a tillage policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to wheat, I should like the Minister to deal a little more comprehensively with it, and to show how wheat at 23/- to 26/- a barrel of the prescribed standard is in itself a substitute for the conditions that obtain in agricultural economy.  When considering that price of 23/- to 26/- a barrel, he must bear in mind the loss sustained in respect of the old cows that are being slaughtered; he must <Col N="542" /> allow for that big loss; and equate it with what he considers an improvement in the one crop which he claims yields a cash return to the farmer, namely, wheat.  If by some extraordinary physical revolution wheat could take the place of live stock for export, I should like to know where he could export it to and get a price for it.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister's duty, in dealing with agricultural conditions, to have some consideration for either added burdens or the loss of advantages enjoyed heretofore.  He knows that with the increasing overhead charges on agriculture, and the annual tribute to Britain, we had a further loss last year by the reduction of £100,000 in the Agricultural Grant. He told us triumphantly that the fees under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act were to be reduced by half, a reduction which he put, I think, at £140,000.  It would be interesting to know what justification there ever was for that charge, and why any butcher should be called on to pay £1 for the slaughtering of a beast, 5/- for a sheep and 2/6 for a lamb.  The Minister wants to convey to the House and to the country that he has done something wonderful for agriculture by reducing that monstrous imposition by half.  He should, with apologies to the House and to the country, have abolished it altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister thought fit to bring in a Seeds Bill here recently.  I supported that Bill because I consider that it was long overdue, but I cannot understand why he does not follow that up in a scientific way.  I notice that the endowment for the Faculty of Agriculture in University College is the same as last year, and, I think, the same as it has been since the faculty was established.  Is the Minister's idea of seeds nothing more than the handling of seed by shopkeepers just as they handle tea and sugar?  I do not want to go into any detail with regard to seed breeding, but I want to draw attention to the fact that seed and plant breeding in this country are under the control of University College, Dublin, through the medium of the Faculty of Agriculture.  I know a <Col N="543" /> little about the conditions under which that was established.  At the time of its establishment, a committee was set up by the governing body of the University to handle the matter for the governing body.  What that committee recommended was adopted <i>in globo</i> by the governing body.  Both the committee and the governing body were satisfied that a properly remunerated professorship should be given to plant breeding, but there was a difficulty in finding a suitable man for the job in this country.</P>
    <P>It was, however, intended to keep the matter under consideration and to have a professorship instead of a lectureship some time in the future. That is nearly ten years ago.  The Minister for Agriculture, who claims to be pursuing a policy of tillage in this country, came into office four years ago and I should like to hear him, or any apologist for such inconsistencies, telling the House how any policy of tillage can be pursued in this or any country in the world at present without having a properly equipped plant-breeding organisation in its experimentary colleges.  The plant breeding in Glasnevin has shown no extension for ten years.  The seeds we put in are in the main imported, but, without exception, they have been bred in foreign countries.  What is the Minister doing about it?  Of course, this kind of thing is too heavy and too dry for platforms, but it is the very quintessence of agriculture and the Minister is neglecting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks he is doing all that is to be expected by seeing that merchants importing seed in bulk label it in small parcels, and by his passing an Act here that will ensure that those small parcels are properly sealed and certified.  I think I would be right in saying that if the sugar factories, about which we hear so much, refused to supply us with sugar-beet seed in the morning, we would have no sugar beet this year.  That seed comes from the Continent.  What would be the position of our factories if a European war broke out and we got no seed?  We are told that sugar-beet cultivation here is an insurance against such a <Col N="544" /> contingency.  We are paying for the insurance, but when it comes to the policy being honoured, it will not be paid.  We are paying the premiums every year, but the policy will not be honoured.</P>
    <P>Further, on the question of sugar-beet cultivation, the Minister showed a terrible lack of appreciation of the necessity for a scientific cultivation of sugar beet, when he gave way to an agitation for a flat rate for sugar beet. I forget whether, when the Act was going through the House, it was provided that the price should be regulated by sugar content.  As far as I can remember, the price was fixed at 30/- per ton on a 15½ per cent. sugar content.  I think that is embodied in the Act, with a provision for a payment of 2/6 for each 1 per cent. of extra sugar content.  I do not know whether it was quite legal, in face of that provision in the Act, to depart from paying for sugar beet on that basis. A serious point arises in that connection&mdash;that factories supply the beet seed, and the agreement was to pay for the beet at a flat rate per ton.  I should like to know from the Minister whether there was any guarantee that the same kind of seed would be supplied? I would further like to know from the Minister whether anybody knows the name, the variety or the strain of the sugar-beet seed which he has planted, what is its source, or under what conditions the seed is saved.  These are all important matters, and if we do not know sufficient about them, or if we do not control them, we do not control the industry for which we are paying a very high price.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his Party intend to carry this economy to its logical conclusion, I wonder do they look ahead as to where they are leading the country?  Producing articles that are, under existing circumstances, not economic is, under modern conditions, hardly advisable, to say the least. How do they expect to utilise the land of the country?  Wheat at 23/- or 26/- per barrel cannot be sold in any country in the world outside this. Does the Minister contemplate a surplus of that crop?  Sugar beet at the <Col N="545" /> price at which it is produced here will not find a market in any other country in the world.  Are we going to develop on the lines of producing a surplus of that?  Is the Minister not aware that a couple of the Leinster counties would feed the whole of the Free State?  If we come down to that limited economy what are we going to do with the rest of the country?  This policy is having its reactions even on the model county which the Minister represents.  After explaining the condition of the wheat crop, my correspondent this morning informs me that the Flying Squad is busy every day collecting annuities and rates in the Minister's own constituency. With two countries in full cultivation we could feed the whole country.  We shall grow beet, wheat and oats&mdash;for what?  The calves are all killed and the old cows are all killed.  What shall we do with the oats?</P>
    <P>The Minister went through the farce of bringing in a Cereals Bill to fix a price for corn.  There is only one price that can be fixed for corn.  Corn itself, outside perhaps the small quantity used for porridge, is not used for human food.  Some barley is used in brewing, not a terrible lot.  Outside porridge and beer, this limited market for oats and barley, there is only one market, and that is the animals we produce with that feeding stuff.  Now, the Minister can write on the blackboard and say that the price at which oats will be sold shall be 15/- per barrel, but if the price of the animal which is fed on that oats does not equate with 15/- per barrel for the amount of foodstuffs consumed by him, there is no use in the Minister fixing that price.  That price can only be determined by our export trade. The Minister made an admission here quite recently&mdash;of course it was true if the Minister never had admitted it &mdash;that our export trade regulates prices on our home trade.  The export prices for our meat regulates and controls the price of our corn, and all the feeding stuffs that we feed to animals to fatten them.  That is the only control.  Then our Minister for Foreign Affairs signs a coal-cattle pact <Col N="546" /> under which £4 5s. 0d. per head, the first fruits of the Irish earth to the value of £5,000,000 sterling, must be surrendered to John Bull every year before we get anything.</P>
    <P>The Minister fixes by rule of thumb or in some mysterious way a fixed price &mdash;a remunerative price&mdash;and we have all this balderdash about corn.  If there is slavery in any business or in any country in Europe it is in this country at the present time.  It is the slavery of the small, the middle, the fairly large, or what might be called the small-large farmers and their families.  Those of us who come from the country know the system that obtains there.  A family grows up until they arrive at 17, 18 or 20 years, when the eldest either remains on the land, or with the other members is sent away to the professions, or perhaps given a passage to some foreign country.  Some of them may go into the Guards, some may become doctors or civil servants, but even the cost of sending one fellow to America requires some money.  There is no money there to do that now, and the Minister knows it.  You have in this country what might be called a glut of people in the small and medium sized farms.</P>

Normally they would have <Col N="547" /> scattered and be making a way for themselves in life, but now they have nowhere to go and they have nothing to do but waste their time on these farms.  It is the slave conditions that is keeping the Government's pot boiling. Deputy Norton spoke of wage earners in agriculture who are not able to get £1 a week.  He said that if £1 a week was offering in Kildare, a labouring man would walk ten miles to get agricultural work.  In Offaly I suppose the same man would walk 20 miles and get work.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will go into that question when he is speaking, and that he will not do the platform stunt and bluff at which he is such an adept.  There is no use criticising the Minister's policy if we have not some standard to set up that we think would make a policy.  The only fear I have is of the incompetency of the Government; the mad frolic of endeavouring to run a one-sided agricultural economy; the madness of endeavouring to develop tillage at a time when a tribute has to be paid to Britain by our livestock, and the idea that is gaining ground amongst Government supporters that the plough means the destruction of the bullock.  That is the vision they have built up&mdash;the land for the people and the bullock for the road.  Of course, politicians that are fond of haranguing the people will adopt that slogan, as it is good dope for the unthinking mob.  In this House people are supposed to think.  As Ministers are supposed to think, I should like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, if he subscribes to the doctrine of destruction of the bullock, and, if so, to explain in what mysterious way he contemplates developing tillage without the aid of bullocks.  Let the Minister take any rotation in agriculture he likes, four, five or six years' rotation, and no matter how he works it out, he will find that outside the narrow belt near Dublin, and perhaps near Cork, at least 80 per cent. of the produce of tillage must be fed to animals.  I say <Col N="548" /> that 80 per cent. of the producer of any industry must command a profit, as the other 20 per cent. cannot look for a market, especially in agriculture, that will command a profit if there is going to be a loss on the 80 per cent.  I have always been in favour of a tillage policy.  I heard Deputy Dillon, in his speech, make a statement with which I am in entire disagreement.  He can correct me if I am not conveying the true meaning of what he said, but substantially it was that we could never and should never endeavour to put through an agricultural economy to produce food strictly for human consumption. With that I am in entire disagreement.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that he is entirely mistaken.  If he refers to a passage in my speech he will see that the inference could not be drawn that I suggested that the agricultural industry could not produce food for human consumption.  I would be glad if he explained any passage in it which created that impression.  I used no words that could be so interpreted.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy did not intend to convey that impression that is the end of it.  I would be very strongly in support of the Minister in other respects, and I cannot be very much against him even now, but this cannot be done.  One crop has very often to support another, and if there is a bad season for one it may be a good season for another, so that on the balance farmers might come out all right.  But to go into agriculture, knowing at the beginning that even if the best happens only one crop will yield a return, then I say agriculture cannot survive on that.  I do not want to go back on the question I discussed earlier, that wheat is robbing the soil of its fertility.  It is doing that at the present time.  Nothing is being put back into the soil to compensate it for <Col N="549" /> what is being taken out.  Therefore, I say it would be better not to grow a barrel of wheat in this country under present conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows from his experience during life that the best label that could be put on a farm that was being offered for sale in the past was this: &ldquo;This is land that has been well farmed for a number of years and is in good heart.&rdquo;  That was a familiar phrase on sale bills in the past.  I do not say that the auctioneers who used it were always telling the truth.  That is immaterial to the point that I am making.  The use of the phrase, at any rate, showed what the people appreciated.  What farm that is growing wheat now can be labelled as being in good heart?  Can any land anywhere that has been growing wheat for a number of years be labelled as being in good heart?  If the fertility is being robbed out of the soil, it will take at least two generations&mdash;that is if it ever can be done&mdash;to put that land back into good heart again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an advocate of tillage, and I would like to see an agricultural economy pursued in this country that would result in more tillage.  I think it would be a good thing if we produced more wheat for use amongst ourselves. I think the same with regard to sugar and fruit and a lot of other things that we are importing.  We could produce most of these things ourselves, and I think we should do so in order to meet the demands of a growing population. We must find employment for that growing population.  That employment must be found on the land, and it must be remunerative.  There are people who say that tillage does not pay here. I agree with that point of view, but then I disagree with those people as to what should be done just at that point. My view is that if it is found that tillage does not pay, then there is a problem at that point and people should not run away from it.  Why does not tillage pay?  That is the problem that any Government in this country should address itself to.  They should not run away from it by adopting something else.  For instance, they should not adopt grazing if they find tillage does not pay, but should sit down and ascertain why tillage does <Col N="550" /> not pay.  They should make up their minds that tillage must pay here, as it does in every other country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to force tillage here at a time when we have this terrible drain of £5,000,000 a year being taken out of agriculture; at a time when it is admitted by all that the big end of agriculture, the livestock industry, is unremunerative.  The Government, instead of leaving that branch of agriculture to private individuals, are running it at a loss and killing it.  Why should a man who keeps a cow for 20 years, an old unprofitable animal, be compensated for it by having a tax levied on his more up-to-date neighbour?  People of that type should be made learn in the school of experience.  If they are not prepared to look after their own business and make it pay, then let them get out and leave it to men to carry on this branch of the industry who will apply their brains to it and mind it.  I am afraid that the surfeit of incompetence that is being shown in trying to &ldquo;put over&rdquo; a tillage programme now, when it is impossible to carry on farming here at all, will sour people, and that at another time, when normal conditions are restored, popular opinion will be dead against tillage.  That, I am afraid, is what will be the result of the surfeit that the country is getting of high tariffs, of more tariffs still higher.  The people will get such a does of protection that, I believe, in a few years' time you will have them clamouring wildly for free trade.</P>
    <P>Cannot the Minister look around and see where it is all leading to?  I would be inclined to wager with him that not in his lifetime had he seen, until within the last year or so, the bailiffs out in the County Wexford collecting annuities and rates.  I do not think he will deny that.  They were out in North Wexford yesterday, and they left one cow to give milk where there was a family of nine children.  They took every other tail that they found on the land.  In another case, where there were no young children, they did not even leave one cow.  That is the constituency that the Minister represents, and will he deny <Col N="551" /> what I have stated?  They are doing the same in my own native County of Longford.  I do not see a representative from that county in the House.  I have received another letter from a person in Westmeath.  This person paid £50&mdash;an annuity payment&mdash;at Christmas.  Now there is demand for more annuities as well as a demand for rates.  The writer of this letter is a widow woman, and her trouble is that, as her valuation is too high, she cannot get home help.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Dublin County Council yesterday we dealt with the estimate of rates for the county for the coming financial year.  The arrears of rates amount to £90,000.  We knew that that was inevitable three years ago, and it was at that time that the Government paid 20 guineas a day to lawyers to get us mandamused to strike a rate that we knew could not, in the circumstances, be paid.  We adopted a rate yesterday that is about £9,000 more than last year.  The position, therefore, is that we are looking to get from the people in rates in the next financial year £290,000, while the arrears that are being carried over amount to £89,000.  That is the position at a time when we find that both the high courts and the low courts are chock full with civil bills for rates, seeking judgment mortgages to get them registered on the lands, so as to save the council from old arrears. These are the conditions under which agriculture is being carried on at the present time.</P>
    <P>We had the leader of the Labour Party last week complaining here of the rate of wages that is being paid to agricultural labourers.  All that one can say on that is that the hens are coming home to roost.  The position is that agriculture is being carried on under conditions at present that both those who sit on the Government benches and the Labour benches are responsible for.  We were mandamused in the courts, and we had to strike a rate that we knew could not be collected. The Minister's agents are now going around through the county saying that it is Deputy Belton who is responsible for having these judgment mortgages <Col N="552" /> registered.  That kind of thing worked for a time, but it will not work again, as we will show the Government in June.  I see Deputy Donnelly smiling.  I hope he will be there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might like to see his pretty image reflected when talking over a bog hole in his constituency, but I would remind him that there are no bogs in the County Dublin.  That is a lucky thing for the Deputy.  In normal conditions Deputy Dillon's amendment proposing to refer back this Estimate would be a silly one. But when we think of the conditions under which agriculture is being carried on, with butter kept up at a fictitious price, because the producers are being taxed 39/- per cwt. to keep it up at that price, that same butter that is costing the Dublin labourers 1/5 a lb. can be bought at 1/- a lb. by the Manchester and Liverpool labourers. The Minister and his Party say: &ldquo;Look what we have done for the butter producers.&rdquo;  What have they done?  They fixed a price, and they are trying to maintain a price, and that will give the milk suppliers 4d. a gallon. That is based on 102/- a cwt. for butter. The wholesale price is fixed at 141/-, with the suppliers paying a tax of 39/-. How does that help the producer? The old cow has to be dumped, the aborted young cow has to be dumped, and the throat has to be cut of the young calf.  I could go into details of the costs and losses in that connection. I put the loss represented by that at 2d. a gallon.  With 2d. a gallon for milk, with a market for the old cows and the aborted cows at prices that they would fetch five or six years ago&mdash; with these losses recouped the farmer would be as well off and have as much of a return by supplying his milk to the creamrey at 2d. a gallon as he has in present conditions when he is supplying it at 4d.  In the altered conditions the town worker would not have to pay 1/5 a lb. for butter and would not have to use&mdash;and this has no connection at all with the Minister&mdash;what is referred to in North Dublin, my constituency, as Maggie Ryan&mdash;a reference to margarine. <Col N="553" /> So much for dairying and all we hear about it; so much has the Government done for dairying, namely, nothing.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to one or two points, more on the trade line and on the job line rather than on agriculture proper.  A short time ago I put down a question to the Minister for Local Government about a young clerk in the Dublin County Council office, who was there for three or four years.  It was suddenly discovered by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that he could not be retained and he had to go. I raised the matter on the adjournment and the Minister's explanation was that there should be freedom to fill all those appointments; the cook's son and the duke's son, so to speak, should get equal treatment.</P>

      <P>Perhaps what I said came too quickly after.  There are shipping inspectors appointed down there, jobs given for political services rendered.  It is strange that when a councillor of ours boasted that he would see that this young clerk that we had would be kicked out of office, he was able to go to the Minister and get a brother of his own kicked into a shipping inspector's job at the North Wall.  I hope the Dublin daily paper that thought fit to write a leading article based on the principle that we were informed by the Minister for Local Government he worked his Department on will see fit to give space to another leading article on how the Minister for Agriculture fills the jobs of shipping inspectors at the North Wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A gentleman comes over here from Germany, and I think he has some understudies from Paddy's land helping him to buy cattle in the market.  I have been informed that on what is called the Christmas market day, which is the second market before <Col N="554" /> Christmas, that gentleman bought only a few cattle.  At the next market he also bought only a few, but at the succeeding market he bought 800 cattle, and it was astonishing the number of Fianna Fáil cattle that turned up to that market.  I wonder was it the cattle or the owners knew that the Germans were out for buying that day?  If those gentlemen are going to buy 700 or 800 cattle, why are there not more of them about?  Why are there not more buyers provided? Two buyers set out to buy cattle, and it is not known by the public how many cattle they are going to buy. The people who have cattle to sell cannot wait until the two buyers have covered the market, with the result that those buyers buy a certain number out of each stand.  Some people are in the know as to the number that will be bought, and the cattle that are left on the stand are driven round and put on another stand before the buyers come on again and then they take another pick.  Can the Minister who controls this not have a regulated number that they will buy?  If they are buying a large number, he ought to know and he should arrange for sufficient buyers to cover the market, say within an hour, and enable all sellers to take advantage of the German demand for cattle.  All the taxpayers have to pay their whack of what the trade with Germany is costing this country, and surely every citizen should get an equal opportunity of any advantage there is in that trade?</P>
    <P>The Minister was reducing, as he generally is, the amount of subsidy that goes to the German trade, to the Spanish trade, and to the Belgian trade; but I think the country should know a little more than they do know about the trade with these countries, and that they should be let know who is paying to send any stuff there at all.  I do not want to go into reciprocal arrangements that have been come to with foreign countries&mdash;particularly Spain&mdash;in connection with this Estimate.  We will deal with that on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. However, we want to know what are the conditions of that trade agreement with Spain.  We want to know <Col N="555" /> what we are getting for our eggs as a result of that trade agreement.  We want to know who is shipping the eggs, and we want to know what Deputies, if any, have any interest in the shipping of these eggs.  I respectfully submit that these are things that we are entitled to know.  I hold that we are entitled to know why cases of oranges are twice as dear in this country as they are in Great Britain.  However, Sir, I shall develop that question in the debate on the Vote for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, however, I think it is a very good suggestion to have this Estimate referred back, and I, personally, should be very glad to see it referred back; but, of course, the tied majority will not allow it to be referred back.  However, even if the Vote will not be referred back, at least the discussion will have the effect of making the Minister see the ground he is travelling upon before he gets a rude awakening.  I cannot understand how a man from the land, such as the Minister for Agriculture is, if he had any backbone, would allow himself to be dominated, as, apparently, he is, by &ldquo;townies&rdquo; who, at present, seem to be able to control the agricultural community and to bring the agricultural community of this country down to the level of the worst conditions that obtained in the Southern States of America before the liberation of the slaves.  At least, it will be admitted that the slaves in the Southern States of America were well-fed, and that cannot be said in connection with the families of Irish farmers to-day.</P>

      <P>Possibly, but Deputy Belton has occupied practically three hours, between to-day and the last occasion, in speaking on this matter. Deputy Belton, in the course of his speech, said some rather funny things, but of all the funny things he said, his final statement appeared to <Col N="556" /> me to be the funniest; it was, to the effect that the Minister should not allow himself to be dominated by &ldquo;townies.&rdquo;  Well, all I can say is that one of the most unfortunate things that the &ldquo;townies&rdquo; of Dublin did was to send Deputy Belton in to represent them in this House, because, since he came in here, night, noon, and morning, the whole theme of his arguments, such as they are, has been the woes of the agricultural population.  Now he says that the Minister should not allow himself to be dominated by the &ldquo;townies.&rdquo; Presumably, the mere &ldquo;townies&rdquo; of the North City of Dublin do not want food or clothing or anything like that. I suggest that Deputy Belton would be well advised, from his own point of view, to speak with a little more respect about these so-called &ldquo;townies,&rdquo; and to regard them, or at least to speak of them, as if they were human beings.  The Deputy should remember, at least, that they have control of the section of the country that he is supposed to represent. I noticed that, when Deputy Belton started to speak the other night, there seemed to be a rather strange alliance between himself and Deputy Norton.  It appeared to me that Deputy Belton seemed to be patting Deputy Norton on the back in connection with the question of wages of agricultural labourers.  Deputy Belton has made many changes in political life.</P>

If, however, the agricultural policy of the Government is wrong&mdash;and I make a present of this argument to Deputies MacEoin, O'Sullivan and Brennan, and any other Deputies on the other side&mdash;why is there such a hunger for land?  Why is there a land hunger if the present agricultural policy is wrong?  They keep telling us that the whole agricultural policy is wrong, but they do not tell us why there should be this hunger for land.

      <P>My point is that I cannot reconcile the argument that the present agricultural policy is wrong with the arguments put forward at the last Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  I do not know that we should waste many minutes in this House discussing this Estimate.  I happened to get the official Clár of the last Ard-Fheis, and I see precious little difference between the agricultural policy of the Opposition and the agricultural policy of the present Government. We read that they would restore farmers their market to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I remember reading other items in their programme.  I remember reading of a guaranteed price for beet, and there is also a guaranteed price for wheat; there was provision for a peat scheme, and protection and assistance to help to carry on the dairying industry.  I think the present Minister has taken a hand in that.  But there is a big thing.  I admit it.  I do not think we had in any programme we put before the people promises on the same scale as this.  On the matter of the present system of agriculture in this country we read in their programme &ldquo;to provide an agricultural reconstruction loan at not more than 3 per cent. interest.&rdquo;  I hope when Deputy Cosgrave, the leader of the Oppositions, is speaking he will tell this House how it is proposed to do this.  I hope he will tell the House when he proposes to do it, on what scale he proposes to do it, and how that scheme is to be administered.  That is a very big thing&mdash;to float a loan, to hand it over and distribute it amongst the farming population.  I do not think that in our palmiest days&mdash;and I made some promises&mdash;I ever made on ever suggested, at any time a thing like that, nor do I think did any Minister of the Government ever suggest a thing like that.  We have this flotation of a new grant, a reconstruction loan to finance agriculture.  At the Ard-Fheis there was also a lot of talk about &ldquo;more division of land in order to help the agricultural community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was something in the programme to make &ldquo;provision for a scheme that will ensure a living agricultural wage for the agricultural workers.&rdquo;  That seems to be portion of the programme in which Deputy Norton agrees with the Opposition. The Deputy said that he wanted this Estimates referred back because the Minister would not introduce legislation to provide better wages for the agricultural workers.  That was Deputy Norton's reason for moving that the Estimate be referred back. I hope if Deputy Cosgrave goes back <Col N="560" /> to Cork again at any time that he will offer to float a loan to help the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not know, but I read it.  I was not at the meeting. Deputy Belton has a great advantage over the rest of us here.  He is a triplex politician.  He is in the Corporation, he is in the County Council, and he puts the two together and comes in here.  He has three platforms. One of them will be slipping away from him in June, but he will still have the Corporation and the Dáil.  If he had been at the Ard-Fheis his answers in the matter of the reconstruction loan would be: &ldquo;What about the £50,000,000 that Deputy Cosgrave paid away to the British?&rdquo;  If we got that £50,000,000 we could float a reconstruction loan.  But I will say this, that so great is the animus and so great is the vindictiveness of Deputy Belton against this Front Bench that he would rather let those £50,000,000 go than ask a question about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only making that comparison.  I was a little bit surprised to hear the speech made by Deputy Norton.  I thought he was on wrong lines the night he made his speech about agricultural workers, but I was sure of it when I heard Deputy Belton applauding him.  If what the <Col N="562" /> Deputy said is true&mdash;that hundreds and hundreds of people are living in the conditions in which the Deputy said they were&mdash;surely to goodness it is not necessary to wait until the Minister for Agriculture will introduce legislation about agricultural wages. Surely the Deputy could introduce a private measure here.  Some of the Labour Deputies have felt keenly on this matter.  I have read some of their speeches.  I have read where Deputy Everett said in Wicklow that never again would he put those Ministers in the jobs in which they are at the moment.  Well, that is pretty magnanimous. I was surprised at that attitude on the part of the Labour Deputy.  I was more surprised when I heard Deputy Norton appealing to this House to refer the Estimate back. I remember the grounds on which he relied.  I do not think Deputy Norton should stand for a policy of that kind. I did not think he would stand to gain anything by referring the Estimate back.  What is more, if the Government is wrong in that particular item to the extent of sacrificing the workers, certainly by all means oppose them; and I would go a little bit further and not only would I oppose the Government on that Estimate, but on every other Estimate, and I would do my damnedest to put that Party out of office.  No political party can get anywhere by riding two horses at the same time.  I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan agrees with that.  I was surprised when I heard Deputy Norton say that he would vote for referring the Estimate back on the grounds of agricultural wages.  About three years ago I was speaking in this House on an agricultural Estimate when Deputy Cosgrave had moved a vote of censure on it.  On the 15th November, 1932, Deputy Cosgrave spoke on the policy of the Executive Council and particularly the agricultural policy, which was the same then as it is now.  He moved this motion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil censures the Executive Council for its continued failure satisfactorily to adjust differences between it and the British Government and for pursuing <Col N="563" /> a policy which has caused grievous injury to the agricultural industry, serious damage to the export trade of the country, heavy loss to the country and greatly increased unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is brought forward in this solemn hour of the State's misfortune in deepest earnestness and in the full conviction that if the country is to be saved from appalling suffering and perhaps irreparable loss the people must get rid of the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>About three months afterwards the Government went to the country and came back, on the same policy, with a clear-cut majority over the combined Parties in this House.  Did that change Deputy Cosgrave or the Opposition? No.  Deputy Belton was as bad this afternoon as he was then as regards the agricultural policy of the Government. At the Parliamentary election in 1932 and again in 1933, and at the local elections in 1934, the policy of the Government was confirmed, and, notwithstanding these verdicts in favour of the Government, we have all this criticism and the old cry that the country is going to rack and ruin. Four years ago there was no hope for this country; according to Deputy Cosgrave, the people could not pay their debts.  Rates could not be paid, land annuities could not be paid, and the country could not last another six months.  To-day, as the result of the administration of the Government, the rates are going down.</P>

I was leading up to the point that, notwithstanding all that Deputy Cosgrave said, he was defeated at the parliamentary elections and at the local elections, and yet we have this performance going on this evening and we shall, I suppose, have heavy and weighty criticism from the Opposition benches on the whole system of agricultural economy.  Everybody knows there has been a change in our agricultural economy.  Deputy Belton described it rightly when he said there had been an abrupt change.  Everybody knows that.  Everybody knows that certain people have suffered inconvenience and that some people are not exactly in the position in which one would like to see them. But while this Government is doing its best to meet contingencies and exigencies of that kind, it is the duty of the opposition to help, instead of hampering and impeding them and trying to convey impressions that should not be conveyed.  Deputy O'Sullivan knows what I am driving at.  There is no country in the world to-day which has ever been in an international conflict&mdash;and this is an international conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is an international conflict, and I remember reading a book in which it was stated that Government policies were fashioned, to a great extent, on what was suggested to them by the Opposition. The job of the Oppositions is to criticise, but it should be constructive criticism.  When a country gives three verdicts against a certain alternative policy, is it right, or patriotic, still to hamper and impede and try to cross the path of the people responsible for the administration whose policy was confirmed on these three occasions?  I admit that there has been a change in the whole agricultural system.  That meant a very sharp jolt.  I detest throwing bouquets at anybody and, most of all, at my own colleagues. But there are two members of the present Government who have done more than two men's work in an valiant a manner as it could possibly be done to tide over the transition period and to make the country what we want to make it&mdash;self-sufficient.  One of these Ministers is the Minister for Agriculture, and the other is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>There is one section of the community I am really sorry for, as represented in this House.  During Deputy Belton's remarks one would think that he was the leader of the farmers in this country.  I do not know whether the dispute has yet been settled as to whether Deputy MacDermot or Deputy Belton was really the leader of the Farmers' Party that was brought into this House, but that particular Party has my utmost sympathy, and I expressed that sorrow several times.  Here are decent men coming in here from their farms, coming here to put their views as best they can.  What is happening? Deputy Belton has led them in one direction; Deputy MacDermot in another.  Both of them agreed to lead them into Fine Gael.  Now the two leaders are out of Fine Gael and the farmers' Deputies are in it.  They will vote for the referring back of this Estimate, because they are tied to the Party which their leaders led them into&mdash;the two leaders who came out of it themselves.  Surely anybody should have sympathy for a Party like that&mdash; decent men, deliberately fooled by people who think themselves leaders of the farmers, but cannot agree as to who is the real leader.  They went off to join what they thought was the big Party and become big guns, leaving their followers in the lurch.  The followers are still there, the boat is still there but the tide is gone.  I do not think that is the correct quotation, but it is very near it.  Deputy Belton made another extraordinary statement &mdash;that the country might suffer from a glut of people.  I took down the words.</P>

Whether or not there are people living in the farmers' houses of the country with nothing to do, the Deputy should not say there is a glut of people.  That is what some big English statesman at some time said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Lord Salisbury said that Ireland would be as scarce of the Celt as Manhattan Island of Red Indians.  He got rid of the glut of people, too.  This Government's agricultural policy and industrial policy and the whole combined policy of the Executive Council is going to see that any glut of people&mdash;to use the eloquent language of Deputy Belton&mdash;will be looked after and cared for in the country.  Deputy Belton gibed at the policy of the land for the people and the road for the bullocks.  It is certainly one of the grandest mottos ever put up.  Even if it takes another 100 years, as Deputy O'Leary might think, before the population will be what it was and the population of the cattle will be what it was, it is well worth trying for.  I was referring to the Farmers' Party who sit behind Deputy Belton.  The other night when he began his speech in this House, there <Col N="569" /> was one of the most amusing spectacles I have ever seen.  He got stuck for some pungent argument, and, of course, as great causes have great advocates, and great men to espouse them, as soon as the Deputy got stuck he was instructed by that wonderful type of agriculturist, Deputy Alfred Byrne, Lord Mayor of Dublin.</P>

I never saw anything more farcical, and never heard anything more ridiculous.  Behind them sat the representatives of the farmers of the country.  I should like to repeat, now that Deputy Cosgrave is in the House, that they were led into his Party by Deputy Belton and Deputy MacDermot. The poor men are still in that Party, but the two leaders who led them in are out.  Strange things occur in this country many a time.</P>

I wish to associate myself with the Minister in that congratulation.  It is an extraordinary thing to occur to the leader of the Opposition, who said here that this <Col N="570" /> country was down and out three and a half years ago.

      <P>That is quite true.  I am glad Deputy Belton reminded me, because Deputy McGilligan here the other night twitted the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on not broadcasting the prize-winning bull.  It was something like the financial bull made in 1923.  I do not want to go back again to the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  I had not the privileges of being present in the House when Deputy Dillon spoke; he is one of the vice-presidents of that organisation.  I do not see such a terrible difference between the official programme of Fine Gael and the programme of the Executive Council. Deputy Cosgrave smiles.  I read over those items before the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, and I do not see any great difference at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I sit down perhaps I may say this.  My friend and distinguished colleague, Deputy Mrs. Concannon, and myself, occupy a rather unique position in this House.  We are the only two from the Six North-Eastern Counties who have never been members of either this Ministry or the other.  It is no congenial task for me to be here in this Dáil this afternoon debating with anybody in the Opposition an Estimate which is applicable to Southern Ireland.  I am sure my colleague will agree that we would much prefer to be doing possibly worthier work than this sort of things, <Col N="571" /> and I believe we have unnecessarily lost quite a considerable amount of time.  I want to make an appeal to Deputy Cosgrave this afternoon.  We are being twitted in this House that we should be at home in another part of the country, but I want to say that the Opposition still has one grand opportunity, if they would make up their minds; they have still an opportunity of standing by the Government in its opposition as regards the English at the moment.  It does not matter whether it is a question of the agricultural economic system or the industrial side.  Whatever the rights or the wrongs, it is an international conflicts; and the leader of the Opposition and his Party would serve their country much better by standing by the Government, than by this perpetual opposition in the hope that things may improve in the long run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to a speech from one of the readiest debaters in this Dáil.  Yet on this occasion he did not in any way give us his ideas or views upon this Estimate.  It is clear that he had nothing to say in favour of this Estimate.  I gathered from the efforts that you, Sir, made to keep him to the Estimate, that it was even the opinion of the impartial Chair that he had nothing to say on the Estimate, and that he said that nothing.  He had nothing to say about the Estimate but he had a great deal to say about Deputy Belton, Deputy MacDermot, and other individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Deputy should not attribute to the Chair any opinion the Chair has not expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but the Chair had on several occasions to intimate to the Deputy that he should address himself to the Estimate. When the readiest debater on that side of the House can bring forward no argument in favour of this Estimate I should say that is plenty justification, if there was no other, for the attitude that we on this side take towards it.  If anyone could justify the policy of the Minister it <Col N="572" /> would be the Deputy who has just sat down.  But he did not attempt to do so.  He attacked Deputy Belton and Deputy Norton, but the arguments they brought forward remained uncontroverted.  Deputy Donnelly referred to a chance remark of Deputy Belton about the glut of people in farmers' houses.  He did not refer to the argument that Deputy Belton used, and others used, about people flying from the country. I wonder is Deputy Donnelly ignorant of the fact that people are flying from the country because they cannot find employment on the land.  Is the Deputy ignorant of that?  He referred to Deputy Norton's attack upon the rate of wages paid to agricultural labourers.  Did he attempt to show that, under the present policy pursued in the country, there is a proper wage paid, or that a proper wage can be paid?  He was shocked at Deputy Norton for raising that question, and he drew quite a proper conclusion, namely, that in view of these facts there is no justification for Deputy Norton's general support of the Government when this is the result of their policy.  That was a sound conclusion as against Deputy Norton.  It was perfectly cogent, and nothing could be said against his argument there.  There is no justification for people who know agricultural conditions, and who know the wages that agriculture can pay&mdash;Deputy Donnelly did not attempt to deal with that question&mdash;supporting a party or government responsible for such a policy.  There I hold Deputy Donnelly was quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly told us he could see no difference between our policy and the policy of the Government. He went very quickly over the first paragraph he read, namely that of restoring the market.  And because we say we will continue the wheat subsidy he sees no difference between our policy and that of the Government. There is a tremendous difference.  The Party opposite has made wheat growing a comparatively attractive proposition&mdash;I shall explain what I mean by that in a moment&mdash;for the farmer in two ways.  First by paying a very high bounty&mdash;that is the positive <Col N="573" /> way&mdash;and next by the method of making any other policy on the part of the farmer entirely uneconomic. Many of a farmer has no choice except to ruin his land by growing wheat upon it year after year, because the Government has made any other use of the land uneconomic.  The Government has induced people to go in for this policy; it has forced them to do it.  The farmer is induced to adopt this course by bounties, subsidies, and by making the cattle trade uneconomic. Any Government that comes after them must take note of these facts.  They must honour the bond of their predecessors.  I admit all Governments do not do that.  But they can make cattle pay so that farmers will have a real choice between subsidised wheat, and getting back to a sound policy.  And so with the various other items in which Deputy Donnelly professed to see a resemblance between our policy and the policy of the Government.  There is no such resemblance because the whole foundations of agriculture are being cut away by the present Government. Deputy Donnelly was surprised at Deputy Norton.  Why did not Deputy Donnelly refute the arguments put forward by Deputy Norton on the question of wages?  In a long speech in which all kinds of irrelevancies were introduced why was not the question of agricultural labourers' wages attacked by Deputy Donnelly?</P>
    <P>It might be some justification of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture if Deputy Donnelly could show that there was a tremendous increase in employment on the land, and that higher wages were being paid.  If he could have shown that he would have refuted Deputy Norton's argument. Did he attempt to do so?  Not for a single instance except to express his pain and surprise that men who supported the Government should now turn on them.  Why has Deputy Norton turned on them?  Because the facts made him do so.  That is the point; but Deputy Donnelly did not deal with that although he had every opportunity of dealing with it.  He attempted to prove that the farmers were well off and that there was a hunger for land.  What does that <Col N="574" /> prove?  If that argument is good then the condition of the farmers in the &rsquo;70's and the &rsquo;80's were ideal.  Deputy Donnelly apparently did not know that there was a hunger for land under the old landlord system.  Is that proof that things were then satisfactory and that they were so good that we must try to restore them now?  If there is little difference between the Government policy, and the conditions that existed in the '70's and '80's, when there was also hunger for land, is the Deputy just asking for a return of the old landlord system?  It was quite as good as the Minister's policy of to-day. Deputy Donnelly, who is one of the best debaters on the back benches, or for that matter on the front bench opposite, had nothing to say except to confine himself to the speeches of Deputy Norton, Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Cosgrave.  He had nothing to say in favour of the Minister's policy.  He had nothing to say in favour of it because there is very little to be said in favour of it. Deputy Belton, in the course of his speech, referred to some distant time when the Minister for Agriculture was a boy.  The time is not so distant; the Minister has not ceased to be a boy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister usually characterises speeches in regard to his policy as political speeches, and says he will not answer political speeches.  I listened to the Minister's statement and to his defence&mdash;shall I call it a defence?&mdash;of his policy. Deputy Donnelly felt wiser and did not attempt to defend it.  I say this for the Minister: If a stranger came into the House, knowing nothing about the affairs of this country, he certainly would not have known that it was the Minister for Agriculture in Saorstát Eireann that was talking.  He made no reference to the real facts and to the real state of affairs with which the country is faced, in introducing his Estimate.  If a stranger came into this House he would be under the impression that the main portion of the agricultural industry was in a flourishing condition.  He would never be able <Col N="575" /> to get from that statement the remotest inkling of the real facts of the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnelly referred to the duplication or triplication of the rôles filled by Deputy Belton.  What about the duplication of the rôles filled by the Minister&mdash;herd and wolf at the same time?  This is the first time that I heard of these two rôles being combined. Here for the first time we have a Minister whose business is to act as herd, and who is behaving like the wolf in killing the calves.  That is a duplication that is certainly unique and of which Fianna Fáil might be proud&mdash;the herd and the wolf combined in one person.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the farmers, it they any longer take any notice of what the Minister says, will be thankful for any improvement he can show in any portion of his Department.  I think they will be thankful when they hear the Minister trumpeting the fact that if certain things continue and if a certain policy goes on, he hopes to make a very considerable sum for the country in the sale of butter&mdash;as much as £100,000.  But the Minister, who boasted of £100,000 as a considerable sum, pays very little attention to the loss of some £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 in trade.  He is careful about the pennies, but he lets the pounds take care of themselves&mdash;not with the proverbial consequences that are supposed to follow from that particular policy.  Millions can go in return for what in modern international affairs&mdash;Fianna Fáil are very international, I gather from Deputy Donnelly&mdash;would be called a gesture.  The Government can throw millions away for a gesture, and the Minister who is largely responsible for that will come here and boast that he hopes to send the trade in a certain commodity up by £100,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnelly referred to the alleged giving away by Deputy Cosgrave of £50,000,000.  Nothing of the kind was done.  In any bargain which we entered into with the British Government we gained millions for this country.  How many millions has Deputy Donnelly's Party paid to them during the last three or four years?</P>

      <P>Apparently it does not matter if you cannot help it! If it goes up to £100,000,000 or £200,000,000, as long as you do not consent, it does not matter!&mdash;you can wash your hands of it like Pontius Pilate.  Are we to be told that the country ought to rejoice at the millions being paid away because Deputy Donnelly did not give his consent and neither did the Government!  He holds that it makes no difference that the country has paid out all that money! It is a matter of no consideration to these high-minded people, who want to make a magnificent gesture and fight this war to the last farmer.  What does it matter to them?  They did not consent to it!  Did you not?  Your coal-cattle pact was something remarkably like consenting to it.  I will admit that even £100,000 will be received joyfully by those who expected nothing from the present Minister.  They may lose millions, but the chance of spreading £100,000 over the unfortunate farmers is something, at all events, of which the Minister can boast.  We heard nothing of the real facts of the situation so far as the main industry was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister began his opening speech very modestly.  He opened the book of Estimates and said there were a couple of things that required explanation. He said that there were some increases that required explanation, and he went on to deal with the increases.  He jumped down to some sub-heads far down in the list, but he skipped sub-head A.&mdash;Salaries.  That was an extraordinary omission on his part.  We listened to the Minister for Finance some nights ago making an elaborate comparison between the years 1931 and 1935 and 1936.  Why did the Minister skip this sub-head A, which shows a tremendous increase? In 1931-2, the year to which occasionally Ministers refer, salaries and wages in this Department came to £117.000; in 1935-6, £161,000; and in 1936-7, £180,000.  In other words, in 1935-6 there was an increase in salaries and wages of £43,000, and in 1936-7 there is an increase of £63,000 over 1931-2, or <Col N="577" /> an increase of 54 per cent.  The Minister in his statement might have tried to justify that increase.  He might have put himself the question, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government might put themselves the question, is that increase justified as a result of the Minister's policy?  He had nothing to show for that enormous increase in salaries and wages alone.</P>
    <P>I will not refer now to the promises about reducing the running expenses or to the placards all over the country about the high salaries that were paid and the amount paid out in salaries.  I shall turn to one very definite question &mdash;is there any value given for this increase of £ 63,000?  Why did not the Minister try to justify that in dealing with the Estimates?  Is the position of agriculture to-day in comparison with 1931 and 1932 so improved as to justify an increase of 54 per cent. in salaries and wages?  Will Deputy Donnelly go to his constituency, which appears to be the Eden of the Free State from everything he says about it&mdash;although Deputy Norton does not think that and he represents a neighbouring constituency&mdash;and justify that?  Is the condition of agriculture during the caretakership of the Minister sufficient to justify that increase?  Why, the condition to which he has brought agriculture would nearly justify the wiping out of the whole Department, as he has almost succeeded in wiping out half the agricultural industry in the country.  But instead of these Estimates for running that policy being down by half, they are up by over 50 per cent.  That is a matter upon which the Minister was modestly silent and upon which we did not hear anything from his very able and eloquent pleader at the back.  During that time in which the salaries and wages alone increased by over £60,000, or over 50 per cent., as compared with 1931-32, the export of our agricultural produce has gone down by £11,000,000 or £12,000,000.  That is the net reduction. Even when you take into account the increase in some items, on the whole it has gone down by £11,000,000 or £12,000,000.  The Minister responsible for that feels no shame in coming to the House and saying: &ldquo;I want 50 per <Col N="578" /> cent., i.e., over £60,000, more in salaries for the running of this Department than was necessary under my predecessors.&rdquo;  That is having an agricultural policy, and that is the policy in favour of which Deputy Donnelly does not think it necessary to say a single word.</P>
    <P>Even if you admit that there has been a decrease in certain imports into this country, the adverse balance in that respect is still tremendous&mdash; £7,000,000 or £8,000,000, at least, and even if you put everything in the way of cutting off imports to the credit of the Minister's policy&mdash;and that is a very doubtful concession&mdash;there is no justification.  The money is wasted, and worse than wasted.  It has been utilised under the Minister's direction to kill agriculture in this country and not to promote it, and it costs 50 per cent. more to do that than it did to keep agriculture in a healthy condition in our time.  No wonder the Deputy has nothing to say in favour of that policy, and no wonder he found it much easier to attack other Deputies than to defend the policy of the Minister. He has my fullest sympathy.  I quite understand the tactics, but he might at least have given one or two sentences to justify the policy of his Minister.  A mere statement of his belief, and a mere statement of what will occur in the future, is not a justification in what is supposed to be a deliberative assembly.  We saw, however, his idea of where he would like to see Deputy Belton.  Hitlerite Germany&mdash; once people have given a vote for the Government, let no dog bark.</P>

      <P>We hear about the amount of employment. Has there been such an increase in agricultural employment as a result of the magnificent policy of the Minister? Has the Government done such a lot to keep the people on the land at home?  The people on the land do not seem to know it; otherwise, they would not be flying out of the country in large batches as they are doing, perhaps not from Deputy Donnelly's constituency but certainly from mine. Even Deputy Donnelly cannot pretend that they are flying out of the country because they were opponents of the Government, or because they voted against them in 1932 and 1933.  That county is paying for its faith in the Government, and the glorious future, and in the statement that this Government was to find employment for everybody in this country&mdash;employment in the town and on the land. They are finding no employment. There are fewer fully paid agricultural labourers getting wages at the present moment than there were in 1931 and 1932, or at least that was the position in 1935.  There may be a few more part-time employees taken on.  There is an inducement at present, I know perfectly well, to farmers to see that their sons are registered as working on the farm, because they get relief of rates and there is no surprise in the figures showing an increase in the number of farmers' sons employed on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told when we refer to the figure of 130,000 that there is no comparison to be made with the figures in our time because now there is an incentive to people to register as unemployed. You cannot have it both ways.  If there are 9,000 farmers' sons &mdash;and that is the total figure&mdash; returned as employed on the farm, it is because there is a very good inducement to return them, but it is not proof that there are more employed. But take the most favourable figures you like from the returns made by the Government.  Where are the hundreds of thousands that were to be put in this employment on the land?  Is there any pretence that they are put into employment on the land?  Is there any pretence that the Minister's <Col N="580" /> policy has led to a great increase of employment?  Is there any pretence that the few extra people who are claimed to have been put on the land have not been put on the land with intense suffering for the population as a whole?  There cannot be even a pretence.  A hive of industry was to be made on the land!  The people have to fly out of it because there is no employment, and if there is employment, the farmer cannot give wages that can compare with those given in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is no excuse for members on the Labour Benches supporting a Government that has made that policy inevitable.  He was quite right and he certainly gave a very courageous and characteristic return to the Labour Party for all the help they had given the Government, when he expressed contempt for a policy of that kind and when he reminded the House that people cannot safely ride on two horses.  Nobody could be more contemptuous, except a certain statesman in Europe, who apparently appeals to Deputy Donnelly, in dealing with other Powers, than he was in dealing with the Labour Party this afternoon.  It is not my business to defend the Labour Party from the Deputy.  There is a lot of truth in the argument and a certain amount of force&mdash;a great deal more force than there is in the argument about the alleged hunger for land.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any policy with regard to alternative markets?  We used to hear a lot about them.  We were told nearly three years ago&mdash;I forget whether it was two or three years ago, but it does not matter&mdash; that he had found them.  The egg trade knows the kind of alternative market the Government has got. What are we doing in these alternative markets?  We are sending good cattle to Germany for bad prices and sending good eggs to Spain for bad prices.  I was going to say &ldquo;bad money.&rdquo;  That is the external policy that is going to keep the young men and women on the farms!  No wonder they are flying out of the country. The Minister has just one policy, so far as our external trade is concerned. <Col N="581" /> It is to secure, so far as in him lies, that in a couple of years we shall have nothing to export.  Then we shall be independent.  That is the way the fakir in India makes himself independent of external circumstances.  There is a lot of the fakir about the Minister for Agriculture and possibly that is the reason he appeals so much to Deputy Donnelly.  That, however, will scarcely satisfy the economic sense of the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's policy goes on our cattle will be soon museum pieces. That is the logical conclusion of it. The Minister's idea is that you increase the value of cattle by diminishing their numbers.  That is like the idea of a youngster when he starts to become interested in stamp collections. There is a stamp known as a Mauritius stamp.  It is not very beautiful, but it is worth an enormous sum of money because it happens to be unique.  The Minister is going to improve cattle in the same way; he is going to make them as unique as possible.  That is his policy and his only policy.  What is the result? Destruction of the wealth of the country and securing the beggary, not merely of the present but of the future.  That is the policy of the Minister and the Deputy must know pretty well that that is what it leads to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton made a vain effort to get information to-day.  I am sure it will be a vain effort, because I have often made the effort myself and have put the question deliberately to the Minister.  Deputy Belton will be no more successful in getting a straight answer from the Minister.  His arguments were sound.  They were arguments used by the Minister himself, arguments which he boasted he stood over&mdash;that if you want more tillage you must have rotation of crops and you must have more cattle.  The Minister said that was his policy.  Does Deputy Donnelly accept that policy?  Is that the policy of the Minister or not? Again and again we have tried to get from the Minister an answer to that, in order to find out on what leg he was standing.  Was he standing on the leg of more tillage and more cattle or of <Col N="582" /> more tillage and less cattle?  He has enunciated both policies in this House and he has enunciated both policies outside it.  The arguments in favour of the original policy of the Minister&mdash;the policy he set before us when he was in Opposition, the policy that he represented in this House for 18 months&mdash; were absolutely irrefutable, namely, that you cannot have more tillage or that you cannot have a successful tillage policy in this country unless you have more cattle.  He made a change in that policy but he has given no justification for that change except, again, the magnificent gesture of carrying on the economic war with Britain.</P>
    <P>It is not motives of agricultural expediency that has made the Minister change his policy; it is purely political reasons&mdash;the man who objects to political speeches!  He has given way entirely to political reasons because he wants to continue the magnificent gesture of the economic war.  Deputy Belton tried to get an answer from him but he will not get it.  He tried again and again to get information that would help him to decide which statement of policy the Minister stands by.  Both statements he enunciated in this House and one is contradictory of the other.</P>
    <P>Everybody ought to look with sympathy to the tillage experiment of the Minister.  But even Deputy Donnelly ought to ask him to give it a chance.  No matter how loyal Deputy Donnelly and other Deputies on the Government Benches are to the Ministry they ought to ask the Ministry to give their own policy a chance.  They are not giving it a chance at the present moment.  You cannot have a successful tillage policy without a cattle policy going hand-in-hand with it.  You cannot have increased tillage, and in the long run it cannot be made successful, without having an increased cattle policy.  The Deputy knows it and the Minister knows it.  At least he knew it before the exigencies of the economic war compelled him to somersault and change his mind completely.</P>
    <P>The Minister found a flourishing cattle trade in this country.  He has <Col N="583" /> set out to destroy it.  If he did not, the Government did.  I take it, whether it is his own policy he is pursuing or not, it is the policy at the moment he represents, and he has done a great deal to destroy that trade.  He has brought about a state of international relations between this country and Great Britain that has done a great deal to destroy it.  As if that were not sufficient, as if the pressure of that war were not sufficient to do it, he has set out to bribe the people into destroying that trade by offering them so much for each calf skin.  In his speech here on the last day he told us that that was a voluntary scheme, and that no farmer need slaughter his calves if he did not want to do it. What choice does the Minister give the unfortunate farmer?  Does he expect the unfortunate farmer to have a longer vision of the future than the man who should have a long vision of the future in agriculture, namely, the Minister himself?  He knows the Minister's policy has made that calf practically worthless.  There again, just as in the case of wheat, by a policy of pressure, of tyranny if you like, and of bribery he has forced and cajoled&mdash;there is a combination of both force and cajolery&mdash;the farmers into aiding and abetting him in destroying the future wealth of the country and in undermining it.</P>
    <P>What is the policy that the Government stands for&mdash;not the policy in this item and that item, not their interference with, and the creation of endless confusion in, the bacon industry but their policy as regards agriculture as a whole?  What is their real policy as regards the relation between tillage and cattle?  The Minister has always shirked that issue.  At one time he talks of more tillage and more cattle and again of more tillage and less cattle.  Now when the House is asked to vote 50 per cent. more in salaries, Deputies are certainly entitled to ask what is the Minister's policy.  How does he conceive the relation between tillage and cattle? Does he think that in the long run he can successfully carry through an increased tillage policy and yet <Col N="584" /> diminish the number of cattle in this country?</P>
    <P>Nobody will deny that there are items in this Vote that would in normal circumstances be accepted.  Of course they would.  Nobody can deny that the Department of Agriculture, in spite of the Minister has done excellent work and will continue to do it.  Nobody can deny for instance the usefulness of getting after the warble fly but, on the other hand, nobody can deny that the Minister has considerably nullified the work of the Department. I understand that he got a certain amount of encouragement on the warble fly from &ldquo;the enemy,&rdquo; his colleagues on the other side, in connection with this particular matter. What we do hold, and hold strongly, is that, excellent as has been the work of the Department, it has been to a large extent nullified by the policy of the Minister.  Into a Department that was working excellently he has come and interfered with it in such a way&mdash;I do not mean in individual matters&mdash;that a great deal of the officials' work must go for nothing.  What are you raising your prize cattle for? That policy is not explained to us either by the Minister or Deputy Donnelly. What are we doing it for, if their progeny is to be slaughtered within a certain number of days after they are calved?  Is it for that purpose we vote money to the Department of Agriculture?  As far as we can judge, the Minister has followed no policy, except a destructive one of that kind.  I put it to the House that you have here an Estimate in which wages have been increased by over 50 per cent.  The Department which now requires 50 per cent. more wages and employs considerably more of a staff than it employed before, is carrying on a policy that is destructive of the agriculture of this country, which it ought to be the business of the Department and of the Minister to conserve and to improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion to refer back this Estimate. I shall do so for one simple reason, that the international conflict which so aroused the enthusiasm of Deputy Donnelly does not arouse my <Col N="585" /> enthusiasm at all.  On the contrary, I suggest it is a patriotic duty to be little that conflict, to turn the minds of the people against it and to put an end to it as quickly as possible. I support the referring back of this Estimate, because I think the most useful thing the Minister for Agriculture could do, the most important duty he ought to fulfil, is one that I am in fact sure he is not fulfilling. In my opinion, he ought to play the part of the importunate widow, and in season and out of season besiege his colleagues, and represent to them that as long as they continue the dispute with Great Britain his Department does not get a fair chance, and that it is impossible for him to do the work he ought to be doing.  I believe that conflict is capable of settlement, and I believe the Minister for Agriculture ought constantly urge an effort at compromise being made, or failing that, a serious attempt to secure arbitration.  If they insist on having an international court of arbitration, let them declare a republic and claim an international court as of right.  If they are not prepared to do that, let us get a Commonwealth court, and let him and his colleagues ensure that a chairman is chosen on whose fairness they can rely.  I admit that a Government of which Deputy Cosgrave was the leader is not in as good a position to obtain a settlement with Great Britain as the present Government, because after all it was not they raised the question of the validity of the agreement under which these moneys were being paid, and they are precluded from challenging the validity of that agreement. The present Government need not yield on their point of principle; they can continue to disagree with the view that these moneys are due to Great Britain; but, as a business proposition, and in view of the fact that the British are collecting the moneys, and that so far as we can see they will be able to go on collecting them indefinitely, they can say they are prepared to offer something less than the full payments now being exacted.  Until there is some evidence that the Minister for Agriculture has taken that line with his colleagues, I see every <Col N="586" /> reason for supporting the motion to refer back this Estimate.</P>
      <P>At the same time I do not wish to associate myself with all that has been said in criticism of him and his Department. I have a higher opinion of his energies and his abilities than has been expressed by a good many members of the Opposition.  I cannot, for instance, accept the picture painted by Deputy Dillon, a picture in which he put on the one side the farmers as they were before the present Government came into office, in which he described them as standing upon their own feet, earning their own living, asking nothing from anybody except to be given a free field, and then, as against that, he painted them to-day as despoiled and demoralised by the policy of the Government.  I think it would be difficult to exaggerate the difficulties under which farmers are suffering to-day, and difficult to exaggerate the miseries under which agricultural labourers are living to-day, but it is not fair to say that the whole of that situation has arisen under the present Government and as a consequence of the administration of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My memory goes back to 1932, when I contested a constituency in this State for the first time.  I was invited to undertake that enterprise by an organisation in County Roscommon which had been called into existence by the violent discontent of the farming community in that county with conditions as they then were.  When I arrived I was presented with a printed statement of their views and policy, which was very far from according with the statements now made by Deputy Dillon, that they were asking nothing from the Government except to be left alone; that they were standing on their own feet, earning their living and holding their heads high.  In fact, I remember that amongst the demands which were formulated in that policy was one that a moratorium should be declared upon the collection of the land annuities for two years, and because I resisted that particular item and said I would not accept it, I was very nearly not selected as candidate. It is all the more curious that it should <Col N="587" /> be Deputy Dillon who painted the picture which it is so difficult to reconcile with my experience, in view of the fact that the bright particular star of the organisation which invited me was no other than Deputy Dillon himself. The policy which had been formulated had doubtless in the main been formulated by his hand, and I was only invited to stand as the representative of that organisation after Deputy Dillon had declined to do so, because the prospects of getting in in County Roscommon seemed poor. Therefore, I cannot accept the view that all was well with the farmers before the present Government came into office, although I predicted rightly at the time that things would become much worse for them under the policy adumbrated by the Fianna Fáil Party. I used to adapt an ancient fable which I think was fairly relevant to the situation.  I described how the frogs in a certain pond had been so impressed by the dignity of a certain log that they decided to select it as their king. Times got hard and the feeling grew that the log was not doing as much for them as it might do, and that a more active monarch could be discovered. They accordingly searched round and eventually found a stork and selected the stork as their king.  Then of course they discovered that the stork made his breakfast off frogs every day.  I pointed out that when the frogs remonstrated with the stork on this behaviour he replied that he had an economic war with the neighbouring pond and that it was necessary for him to consume his subjects in order to keep his strength up for battle.  I venture to think that that forecast of what would occur has been borne out by events.</P>
    <P>The real complaint against the agricultural policy of the present Government is the economic war, if that is the proper expression for it.  As for the picture of the Minister for Agriculture, as a bull in a china shop, drawn so eloquently by Deputy Dillon, as one trying all sorts of absurd fantastic expedients upon the poor farmers who desired nothing other than to be left alone, I do not agree with that at all. I think the condition of farming in this <Col N="588" /> country was such that experiment was called for, and that the Government would have been lacking in its duty if it had not made such experiment. Experiment must proceed by trial and error.  No doubt mistakes have been made.  Mistakes will be made, but the idea of making experiments was a sound one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit that some of the experimeits have failed.  Really, the best answer to this wholesale criticism of interference by the Government is the answer made by Deputy Donnelly this afternoon, when he pointed to the fact that the official policy of the Opposition proposes to continue the bulk of the experiments, if they came into power.  I do not blame them for that. I think it just emphasises the fact that the real difference between those who criticise the Minister for Agriculture and those who do not is that we who criticise him are entirely against the financial dispute with England and feel that no serious effort is being made by the Government to bring it to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The curious thing is that by far the greatest achievements of the Government in relation to agriculture have been the two trade agreements of this year and last year with Great Britain, which are really within the purview of the Department of Industry and Commerce but with which the Minister for Agriculture must have had a great deal to do.  It is significant of the all-important part that our trade relations with Great Britain play in our economy that the whole of the Minister's various experiments and schemes put together, and the whole of his trade agreements with countries other than Great Britain, have had considerably less effect for the benefit of our agriculture than have the coal-cattle pact of last year and the coal-cattle pact of this year.  It was not until these agreements came along that any impression was made on the constantly increasing adverse balance of trade between ourselves and Great Britain.  Now, there has been again in this debate a certain <Col N="589" /> amount of sneering at these trade agreements.  I must say that I feel that, in the interests of commonsense, it is time that that sort of thing should be stopped.  The great inconsistency of the Government in relation to the economic war did not begin with either of these trade agreements.  It began on the first day they decided to give export bounties on agricultural goods exported to Great Britain.  From the moment the Government did that&mdash; that was in 1932&mdash;they committed that fundamental inconsistency; they started that business of riding two horses, which Deputy Donnelly says is so fatal to any Party.  But as for these recent arguments, they have been of decided benefit.  About 10 days ago Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, whom I see here, told the people in the County Mayo that this last agreement constituted a desperately bad bargain. The day before yesterday Deputy Hogan told the people of the County Galway that the agreement constituted a very good bargain, and that the only mistake was that it was not enlarged. The agreement has been described in this House by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan as a shameful measure.  In the other House it was described in favourable terms by Senator Blythe. Now, I think it is time that these contradictions should end, because I really do believe that for anybody who stops to think and who wants to see the economic war finished, it is ever so much more sensible to praise these agreements than to damn them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>As far as I am concerned, I certainly have no uneasiness of conscience after praising these agreements.  The trade figures&mdash;the results of these agreements&mdash;speak for themselves.  Now, I think that one of the most interesting speeches in this debate, perhaps the most interesting speech, was that made by Deputy Norton, who has been forced by circumstances to <Col N="590" /> give serious attention to the appalling condition of the agricultural labourers in this country.  It is too often forgotten by those who are fond of talking of the difficulties of farmers in England, that, at any rate, the farmers in England are able to pay their labourers what, according to our standards, is certainly a good wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton mentioned the other day that the lowest wage paid to agricultural labourers in England was 33/- a week. I myself had seen, a few weeks ago, a letter in the London <i>Times</i> from somebody who was agitating about the deplorable condition, as he considered it, of the British agricultural labourer. This advocate of the agricultural labourer said that his wages sometimes fell as low as 35/- a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I think that 21/- a week plus an acre of land and a cottage at 1/6 a week probably brings our wages to as good a figure as theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well&mdash;he knows just as well as I do&mdash;that there are plenty of people in this country working as agricultural labourers getting £1 a week or less, without any acre of land or any cottage&mdash;just £1 a week bare, and less than that in many cases.  I challenge any informed Deputy to deny the fact that there are plenty of labourers glad to get 20/- a week, plenty who cannot get it in this country and have to take less, and that without any extras at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> Now you, Sir, put Deputy Norton in a serious difficulty when he was speaking on that topic by asking him whether agricultural wages could be remedied without legislation.  He did not know what to say, because he did not want to confess the truth.  Of course, they could be remedied to a considerable extent without legislation, but he did not wish to confess that the only way in which that could be done without legislation was, in fact, by settling the financial dispute with Great Britain, and that he, Deputy Norton, the leader of the Labour Party, has every bit as much power to do that as the Minister for Agriculture himself.  His pressure would, I am sure, be quite as effective as that of the Minister for Agriculture.  I think, however, that it is very fortunate that the Labour Party have been forced to become vocal about the appalling wages that are being paid to agricultural labourers, and I hope that they will eventually be driven to the logical conclusion from that state of things and will exercise their influence against jingoism instead of always being, as heretofore, in favour of jingoism: that they will try to get the Government to make an offer of compromise to Great Britain instead of going on with all the clap-trap about a great international conflict, all the humbug about lowering the flag and the rest of it. Deputy Donnelly made a painful accusation against me of having left the farmers of this country in the lurch.  It is a rather vague expression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy certainly left Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used that phrase but, in any case, he well knows that my cleavage with the Fine Gael Party was not on any agricultural subject.  He also equally well knows that if the farmers who, with me, joined that Party, wish to leave it, there is nothing on earth to stop them; there is no necessity for me to pull them out.  His accusation against Deputy Belton was even more unjust, because, so far from leading any <Col N="592" /> farmers into the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Belton was actually elected as a member of Deputy Cosgrave's Party. I do not think that Deputy Belton has ever been elected as an independent member to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This debate has taken much the same course as previous debates on the Estimate for agriculture, one side saying &ldquo;every day in every way we are getting better and better,&rdquo; and the other side saying &ldquo;every day in every way we are getting worse and worse.&rdquo; In point of fact, the real difference between us is as I have described it. Deputy Belton has pointed out that by constant repetition of the same crops you take the heart out of the soil.  I think that perhaps he forgot that by constant repetition in a two and a-half hours' speech of the same arguments you take the heart out of the Dáil. But, at any rate, I felt myself so despondent after his effort that I shall take profit by his example and say no more than I have already said.</P>

      <P>Deputy, MacDermot has prefaced his reasons for supporting the motion to refer this Estimate back by stating he believed it was the patriotic thing to do.  The Deputy evidently thinks that the patriotic thing to do in this country is not to support the Government in anything they are doing.  That is his idea of patriotism, right or wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Right or wrong, go in with the other Party&mdash;that is Deputy MacDermot's idea of patriotism. There is an idea of patriotism in another country, &ldquo;Right or wrong, my country,&rdquo; but Deputy MacDermot endeavours to introduce a new idea of patriotism in this country, and it is &ldquo;Right or wrong, my country I'm against you.&rdquo;  He expects Deputies to believe that that is a serious view he holds, and that he is quite sincere in expressing it.  He said the Minister should spend his time trying to convert all the members of the Party and get them to go against the Executive in the continuance of the <Col N="593" /> present economic dispute.  He thinks it would be good patriotism on the part of the Minister to stab his own colleagues in the back and get the rest of the Party to throw out the Executive Council.  That is the second step in Deputy MacDermot's patriotism.</P>
      <P>The Deputy did not trouble to criticise the Estimates.  He gave us a long history about himself, a sort of detailed history of how he got into politics, how he agreed with Deputy Dillon, and subsequently disagreed with him, and so forth.  Let me seriously suggest to Deputy MacDermot that we have either to give in completely and say we have been absolutely wrong in our attitude claiming that we have certain rights in this country, and hand over the whole place to other people and tell them we have no right to exist here unless the control comes from outside, or continue our present policy. I believe the Deputy's idea is to try by subtle means to use this House to get the people of the country to adopt his idea of patriotism.  Every member of the House, realising there is a dispute on, a kind of war, if you like, called an economic war, must recognise that it is his duty to back the country and the Government and to see that the best and not the worst will be got for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a different kind of conflict were in existence, if it was a war such as has been fought on the Continent, when the resources of the State would be used to create machines of war for the purpose of destruction, and when those machines and human beings and property and resources would be destroyed in such a conflict, and there would be a piling up of huge debts which would be placed on the shoulders of the people&mdash;in my opinion that is the form of patriotism to which Deputy MacDermot would subscribe and in connection with which he would say there should be no surrender. The economic war now in existence is the type of war that will either spell disaster or success for the country, and it is Deputy MacDermot's duty to be patriotic to this country and, even if he felt that the Government were wrong&mdash;and many <Col N="594" /> people in other countries feel their Governments are wrong when they have a physical war&mdash;he should not try to get the people to sabotage the Government; he should at least try to give some idea to the people outside that there is a certain unity here and a feeling that eventually success will come to the country and the Government.  At least he should not wish the country ill, even if he wishes to bring the Government down.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is supporting the motion to refer this Estimate back, and he says he is doing so purely out of patriotism.  I contend that that is not patriotism in the ordinary sense. If criticism is made of the policy of the Minister in regard to certain experiments or changes in the system of agriculture, that is quite legitimate and a person is perfectly entitled to voice his opinion.  I would not have intervened were it not for the fact that Deputy MacDermot has tried to introduce into this country a new form of patriotism which in essence means letting your own country down.  I trust that the line the Deputy followed will not be pursued by others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly interesting to listen to the last two speakers.  Deputy Briscoe talked all the time about patriotism and sacrifice. I would like to know what sacrifice Deputy Briscoe is making in connection with the present situation. Does he want the farmers to be the only people to make all the sacrifices? There is one thing I do not like to be talking about and that is patriotism. There is a lot said about it and in my opinion it is lacking in sincerity. My old leader, Deputy MacDermot, is in the happy position that he can criticise everybody.  He spoke about the 1932 election and the dissatisfaction that existed then against the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. I venture to tell the Deputy, and the House, that when Fianna Fáil are as long in power as the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were&mdash;if ever they remain so long&mdash;there will be a jolly sight more dissatisfaction with them.  I know there was dissatisfaction with the last Administration, and <Col N="595" /> why should there not be, considering the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party?  The people were told they would get derating, there would be no land annuities, there would be work for everybody.  I know that a good many farmers supported Fianna Fáil in 1932, but I promise you they will not do it the next time.  That is one promise I am prepared to stand over.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that a decent lot of people like the Irish farmers have been brought to their present position. There are very few in this House really acquainted with the situation. There is a lot of talk over the radio in the way of barrack stories and so on.  Let me tell the House this story.  I was at the annual general meeting of our creamery society some days ago and the manager made a statement to the effect that one of the hardest things he had to contend with was people coming to borrow money in order to pay the flying squad who tour up and down the county.  I do not make any statement over which I am not prepared to stand.  I have been told of farmers coming for £5 and £10 and it is well known throughout the country that creamery societies have been lending money to farmers to meet rates and annuities. They will not get money from the banks or the shopkeepers and the Minister is in a position to know if the Agricultural Credit Corporation are prepared to give any assistance to the farmers.  I have a letter in my pocket showing the position in that respect and it is a sad commentary on the whole situation.  There is a lot of talk about no rates and no annuities, but that is all nonsense.  The Government should make up their minds, and I put it even to Deputy Donnelly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>And we were paying them before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  We were paying them before that, and has not President de Valera himself admitted that it is now causing even more hardship? What is the use of blinding our eyes to these things?  I did not intend, when I started speaking, going into this kind of, what I might call, high politics.  I wanted to get down to the Estimate itself.  In that connection, I read a statement of the Minister when he was talking about the dairy industry and I put it to the Minister now, and to anybody else in this House&mdash;is the founding of our agricultural economy on that basis a sound policy at the present time?  Is it a paying proposition? The Minister's statement was the first statement I looked at when I came to this House.  I remember where he said that it cost at least 5½d. to produce a gallon of milk, and it must be remembered that that was at a time when you could get a good price for a calf.  I say that the dairying industry was never a paying proposition except for the young stock.  The Minister said last week that the price of young cattle &mdash;of young stock&mdash;had increased recently. So it has.  The price of young stock has risen because they are scarce, but so has the price of feeding stuffs. Only the other day I read a paper by some gentleman who was talking about the egg trade, and I think that his statement sums up the position of the agricultural industry in this country at the present time.  In the course of his statement he said that, apart from the generally depressed conditions, the Cereals Act had resulted in a great increase in cost of agricultural feeding stuffs.  Will the Minister deny that? The gentleman to whom I am referring goes on to speak of the time when the Minister&mdash;or, if not the present Minister, some other Minister&mdash;was talking about the great market in Spain for eggs.  What does that mean to us? We were told that Spain was to take so many of our eggs.  I heard that theory about our eggs and about that market expounded not so long ago, but you cannot deny the facts.  This gentleman is, evidently, a man of <Col N="598" /> experience, and he, as well as farmers, such as I am, know the facts.  Does Deputy Donnelly deny that the export of our agricultural produce at such prices will have an adverse effect on the wages of agricultural labourers in this country?  Does Deputy Davin deny that?  We all know that the first thing a farmer will do, if he finds that he cannot pay his way, is to cut his expenses, and that the next thing he will do is lower the wages of the agricultural labourers he employs, or else disemploy a man.  We all know that, even if the beet and wheat policy were to be pushed to its logical conclusion by the Government, it would not solve the problem of the Irish farmer.  That is so, and I am sure that it will be admitted by everybody here; and I can tell the Minister that, if the farmer feels that there is a reasonable chance of getting a profit out of the production of beet, or of wheat or of anything else, the farmer will go into it.  The farmer will grow beet or wheat, or any other crop if he thinks it will pay him.  He will have a try at it, anyhow, and no amount of denunciation, either from me or from the Minister for Agriculture, will stop the farmer from going into the production of any such a crop if he thinks it will be a paying proposition.  He will try it anyway.  That is my experience of farmers.</P>
      <P>Now, it is funny to hear Deputy Donnelly and the Minister for Agriculture standing up here sometimes and trying to tell the country that the farming position is all right.  That was the thing they tried to do, and that was what they tried to justify from that side of the House.  But what does the great Minister, about whom Deputy Donnelly a moment ago was so proud&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;say about conditions in the country?  What has been the stock phrase of the Minister for Industry and Commerce up and down the country, when opening the various factories that he has been opening from time to time?  Is it not that all the industries are dependent, fundamentally, on the agricultural industry?  Does he not say that on practically every occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> Did he not say that there was one thing wrong with the farmers, and that that was the price they received for their produce?  Did he not say that that price was too low, and did he not ask for the help of industrialists in the country to put the price of agricultural produce on a fair basis?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  What is wrong with it?  There is this much wrong with it&mdash;that there is no use in Deputy Donnelly or the Minister or anybody else saying that the farmer is getting a fair price, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce says otherwise. What was the first step that should be taken in order to be sure that the farmers should get a fair price?  I quoted the price of milk in connection with a creamery with which I am associated.  That creamery paid over £7,000 in levies last year.  What am I getting for it?  We know what the producer gets and what the consumer has to pay.  If you want to stand over that, well and good.  As was pointed out by Deputy O'Sullivan, the increase in this Estimate has gone up by 50 per cent., and I ask myself, as a farmer, what benefit do I get out of that Estimate?  I ask myself: Do I, as a farmer, get any benefit at all out of that Estimate?  I cannot say that I do.  I cannot say that I get one halfpenny out of it; and Deputy Donnelly knows how he condemned the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the past; does he not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>We all remember their cry: &ldquo;Return us once again and we will settle the economic war.&rdquo;  Everybody knows that the wheat policy, the beet policy and the tillage policy of the Government are not going to solve the agricultural problem.  The Minister can guarantee 14/- or 15/- a barrel for barley but he expects another farmer to buy that barley and produce something. Is not that the situation?  He expects the other farmer to fatten cattle, produce poultry, beet or anything else from that barley.  How can it be done?  Well, it simply cannot, and it is not being done.  In most cases production has gone down considerably. I know very well that all <Col N="601" /> those engaged in the bacon industry in the country are very satisfied with that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what about the producers, the farmers?  The people, as I said, in the bacon industry are satisfied with the position.  They never made more money than they are making at the present time.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to look into the situation more clearly than he has looked. I do not believe that the farmers are getting anything like a square deal in the whole situation.  If I am asked on what commodity produced to-day are we getting the cost of production, I really could not answer that we are getting it on one single article at the present moment.  I could not name one article of agricultural produce that is paying.  If pigs are paying just at the moment they have not been paying for some time back.  I tell the Minister I see a very serious situation growing up with regard to the production of bacon pigs.  I used to know small farmers and cottiers who were feeding bacon pigs.  In the old days the pig was termed &ldquo;the gentleman that paid the rint&rdquo;.  Now there is scarcely a small farmer in the country or a labourer who has not gone out of bacon production.  In my district the production of bacon pigs is now centralised amongst the millers.  That is due to the high cost of feeding stuffs.  If the Minister wants to remedy the situation I am giving him a suggestion as to how he can do it; I am giving it to him for what it is worth.  I am here to tell him what the situation is in the country.  It is not any great pleasure to me to stand up here and paint the picture which I put before the House as regards the farming community.  I know hard-working industrious farmers who are now in very poor circumstances indeed.  I know that from the creamery manager.  If the Minister himself wants to know anything about it he can make inquiries through his own Department from the shopkeepers, bankers and others.  I hope my remarks will help in bringing home to the Government the seriousness of the present situation.  I ask them how do they think that rates and annuities can be met by the farmers.  They cannot. The Government ought to make up <Col N="602" /> their minds, for it is their problem. Every day we see the bailiffs going out seizing the last beast the farmer has. The peculiar thing about it is that in the ultimate resort it is the cattle that are so much despised by the Fianna Fáil Party, that are seized by the bailiffs in order to meet these rates and annuities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can speak with some little authority on the agricultural situation.  I have been listening pretty attentively here to the speeches made by other Deputies.  Hearing those speeches one who had no knowledge of the country previous to the Fianna Fáil Government's coming into office would gather the idea that agriculture at that time was in a flourishing condition. The fact is that the agricultural community were very much dissatisfied at that time with the agricultural policy pursued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  That was the policy of total dependence on the British market during the ten years of the Cumann na nGaedheal régime. That policy reduced the country very considerably.  During those years the prices of cattle, pigs, corn and all agricultural produce fell.  I can well remember going to the local fairs with young pigs and being offered during the Cosgrave régime a price of 9/- or 10/- apiece.  Barley was sold at 10/- to 11/- a barrel, and oats at 8/- to 9/- a barrel.  During that period the land annuities were fully collected.  When the people got into arrears there were cases where they were sold out and evicted.  That is just an indication of the conditions that prevailed during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go further back, when the cattle trade was at its height, it was found very often that when the farmers had cattle fit to sell there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in parts of England.  The ports were then closed and the farmers saw that being totally dependent on the British market meant that they were dependent on a very shaky market altogether.  They had even to take bad prices for lambs, sheep, cattle and pigs owing to the outbreaks which occurred from time to time.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up at that period to <Col N="603" /> encourage the policy which had been adopted and, when the farmers were complaining that prices were gradually falling and that they could not make ends meet, the only encouragement given them by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, was to tighten their belts, stick it out and keep one more cow and one more sow, so as to increase production.  The farmers worked night and day and their conditions were not improved. When Fianna Fáil took office, many farmers who were already bankrupt made the excuse that it was the change of Government and the change of policy that caused their downfall. During the regime of Cumann na nGaedheal, if a man was not able to pay his annuities, he did not boast about the fact; he concealed it.  If he was not able to pay his rates, he did not boast about it.  He would be ashamed to let his neighbours know of his inability.  With the change of Government and with the organised campaign for non-payment of rates and annuities it was considered something to be proud of not to pay one's rates or annuities.  I believe that that campaign has done much to make it difficult for the farming community to change over to the new policy.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I thought that Deputy Belton knew a lot about practical farming, but the more I listen to him the more I am satisfied that he knows very little about it.  Deputy Belton says that fattening land is not suitable for wheat growing, and that wheat cannot be grown year after year on the same land.  I do not suggest that it would be good policy to grow wheat year after year on the same land, but it is my experience that most of the pasture land of this country would be improved by tillage and the putting in of crops, even if the land were to go back into grass.  It would make the land healthier and more suitable for carrying cattle and sheep, especially at the present time, with the development of the trade in young cattle.  Cattle do better on land which is freshly laid down to pasture than on some of the old land which has not been tilled for years and years.  I recognise that the <Col N="604" /> conditions of the farmers and farm workers are not as good as they should be.  I realise that the life of the working farmer&mdash;the man who tills his land and carries on a system of mixed farming, the man who has reared young stock in the past&mdash;is a hard one, as is the life of the worker employed on the farm.  At the same time, I think that Deputy Norton has not a proper understanding of rural conditions or the conditions of the agricultural worker.  I think the picture he painted of the condition of the agricultural workers was much exaggerated and was not helpful either to agriculture or to the agricultural worker.  I should be as anxious to give to the workers engaged in agriculture&mdash;whether farmers or farmers' employees&mdash;as good conditions and as high a standard of living as town workers and business people in the towns enjoy.  All my life I resented the conditions under which the working farmer and agricultural worker had to live.  They had always to work long hours, and their remuneration was very small.  Not alone had the farmer himself and the farm worker to do this but, in order to carry on, every member of the family had to act similarly. That was so during the time the other policy&mdash;the cattle policy&mdash;was in operation. Every member of the family of the farmer who tilled his land and reared young stock had to work hard, and the people who derived the advantage from their work was the big grazier.  He had a higher standard of living.  His wife had not to go out and work on the farm.  But every member of the family of the working farmer and agricultural worker had to do their part on the farm.  That position always existed in the rural areas.  We are anxious to get over that difficulty and to improve the standard of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and I am sure the great majority of the working farmers and agricultural workers in my constituency are satisfied, that the agricultural policy and industrial policy which the Government are doing their utmost to put into operation are the only policies which will bring about these improved conditions.  The agricultural <Col N="605" /> community realises that the problem is a difficult one and that it cannot be solved, as Deputy Norton suggests, by merely setting up a wages board.  It is realised that conditions are gradually improving.  I could give indications of how they are improving. At present, in the County Kildare big areas are being divided by the Land Commission.  Wherever estates have been divided the agricultural worker has got consideration.</P>
    <P>Many agricultural workers have been given holdings of from seven to 21 or 22 statute acres.  I am very glad to notice the good feeling that exists between the agricultural workers and the farmers.  I have known cases where farmers have lent their horses and implements to the agricultural workers to till their land and put in crops of wheat.  It is in that line that I think the problem of improving the conditions of agricultural workers can best be solved. It is by, as far as possible, giving the agricultural worker a few acres of land, and letting him produce with the co-operation of the farmer his own wheat, pigs and poultry, that the problem can best be solved.  At the present time I can see no better way of improving the conditions of the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>I admit that the wages paid to agritural workers in Kildare are small in comparison to those paid to town workers, but they are not anything like as bad as Deputy Norton suggests. I think he stated that a man would have to walk a good many miles before getting work from a farmer at £1 per week.  I believe that is not true.  In certain parts of the county at the present time it is impossible to get an agricultural worker at 25/- per week.  I would not be satisfied with even that wage for an agricultural workers, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce and every member of the Executive Council have stated that the price of agricultural produce is too low in the country.  I am told that 80 per cent. of the population of this country is engaged in agriculture.  There was a complaint by Deputy Belton to-day about subsidising our surplus of butter.  We have a surplus in practically all our <Col N="606" /> agricultural produce.  We have a surplus in our cattle; we have a surplus in pigs; we have a surplus in butter.  With the exception of wheat we have a surplus in all our agricultural produce.  We have to take what we can get on the foreign market. Everybody knows it is only by the subsidies which the Government have given that we have maintained those price levels.  The industrial part of the population, apart from the agricultural community, would not be able to bear the cost of giving either the farmer or the farm labourer a high cash wage every Saturday night.  The farmer could not hand his wife two or three pounds; neither would it be possible to give the agricultural worker that wage.  He should get that in order to put him on the same standard as the workers in a protected industry.  I should like if that situation could be brought about.  The Government is gradually bringing about that situation by their industrial development.</P>
    <P>In the north side of Kildare, which is a very bad area, where the workers always had to depend on agriculture, during the regime of Cumann na nGaedheal there were hundreds unemployed. There was then no advantage in registering at the employment exchange, and their conditions were very poor.  The only possibility they had of getting work was from the farmers.  There was a surplus of workers on the market at that time, and I think many men worked for far less wages then than since Fianna Fáil came into office.  What has affected the situation there is that, owing to the development of the turf scheme, many men who had to depend on agricultural work in the past are now independent.  The bogs were drained for them, and many men who previously had to depend solely on agricultural work now have their own lorries and are carrying their turf to the town.  Further, at Ticknevin, in the northern portion of the county, a briquette factory has been established. At the present time I am told that up to 150 men are employed there&mdash;men of the agricultural worker type, who had to depend solely on agriculture in the past.  I am informed that their wages <Col N="607" /> are from 30/- to £2 a week.  That has its effect, and must have its effect, on agricultural wages in the district.  I do not deny that the agricultural workers have suffered with the farmers, but there is one thing which I did admire during the last two or three years, and that is that the agricultural workers stood solidly behind the Government in their fight.  They would not be satisfied to settle on the terms that Deputy MacDermot suggests; they would be the last people in the world to suggest a surrender at this stage.</P>
    <P>The real solution of the problem&mdash;it is a solution that has worked out satisfactorily as far as it has been tried&mdash;is to make the agricultural worker the owner of a few acres of land.  It is only in that way that conditions can be improved.  In that way the worker will be able to produce his own food, and there will be fostered and encouraged the spirit of co-operation between him and the farmer.  I should not like to see a situation developing such as there was in Kildare ten or twelve years ago.  During the war period, when there were big prices for cattle, etc., the wages of agricultural workers went up to a very high standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see the agricultural workers raised above the standard of a wage earner.  I should like to see him on his own holding, developing co-operation between himself and the farmer.  As I was saying, during the war period the wages went up to a comparatively high standard. The agricultural workers were organised <Col N="608" /> in one union, and a certain element of the farmers were organised in another.  That was all right while high prices prevailed for cattle and corn on the British market.  In 1922 and 1923 there was a slump in the price of barley, on which the South Kildare farmer mainly depended; barley was almost unsaleable.  Then, although the unions were strong at that period, a clash occurred, and very much suffering was caused both to the agricultural workers and the farmers through demanding of the farmers what they were not able to give.  The result was that all the unions dissolved.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the price the farmers are getting for wheat; I do not say it is a wonderful price.  I am not satisfied either with the price for beet, nor am I satisfied with the price for any of the farmers' produce.  I admit that it may be difficult, and I realise that it is difficult, for the Government to give the farmer a price for all his produce that would enable him to pay a wage which would put the farm worker on the same level as the protected worker in a protected industry.  The only solution I see for the problem is to try to develop this co-operation between the farmer and the farm worker by giving the farm worker a few acres of land which he would be able to manage.  Where that has been done the system has worked out satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Sitting on two stools, if you like.  I want to make quite clear to Deputy Donnelly the position of this Party, which he seems, either consciously or unconsciously, to misunderstand. This Party has publicly committed itself to back this Government in putting into operation its political programme on major political issues.  In doing that they are quite conscious of the fact that they themselves support the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="609" /> in those matters, and realise that the overwhelming majority of the electors gave the Government a mandate to put their political programme into operation.  Let me point out quite clearly to Deputy Donnelly&mdash;and it is well understood&mdash;that this Party, neither inside nor outside this House, ever promised to back the Government's wage-cutting policy, or its financial policy in many respects.  I hope the Deputy knows the relations that exist between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party on wages issues.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harris suggested that Deputy Norton did not understand the conditions in rural Ireland. He also suggested, and I do not think he was right, that Deputy Norton contended that the wages of agricultural labourers could not be improved or stabilised through the machinery of an agricultural wages board.  Deputy Harris is quite wrong in that.  I would like Deputy Harris, or some of his colleagues, to quote from any speech of Deputy Norton where he made that admission.  We are not opposing this Vote for any political purpose.  If the Minister for Agriculture will get up and declare that he is prepared to take the necessary steps to improve the conditions and wages of agricultural labourers, and indicate the manner in which he is prepared to do that, we are not prepared to press this motion to a division or to vote in favour of the reference back of the Estimate.  I think the Minister should make his position, and the position of his colleagues in the Cabinet, clear upon this matter.  Our final attitude, as to the way we will vote, will be guided by the <Col N="610" /> answer the Minister gives to the case put forward by Deputy Norton.  I do not say that the only way to improve and stabilise the conditions and wages of agricultural labourers is through the machinery of a wages board.  Deputy Norton has not made the admission that Deputy Harris suggested.</P>
      <P>We have here, in one Estimate, a sum of £2,180,000 set aside for the purpose of improving the prices of agricultural produce in this country. It is set aside for the purpose of guaranteeing prices to farmers for certain articles of production, such as beet and wheat, and for the purpose of guaranteeing them a market and other advantages.  Will Deputy Donnelly, or any other agricultural expert from Fianna Fáil, indicate in what manner any portion of that Vote, under the heading of bounties and guaranteed prices to farmers, will find its way into the pockets of agricultural labourers?  Deputy Harris does not seem to know what is going on. He does not, apparently, read the statistics and the information supplied to him as a Deputy of this House or he would not make the statement that the agricultural labourers are not in the position as set out by Deputy Norton. Deputy Harris is supplied with the same information as Deputy Norton and every other Deputy.  That information, and the statistics supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce, show that between the years 1931 and 1935 there is an average reduction in the wages of agricultural labourers of over 3/- a week.  I would ask Deputy Donnelly to get a copy of that document, and to educate Deputy Harris as to the position of agricultural labourers upon this question.  The information is there.  If Deputy Harris studies it perhaps he will tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who supplied the information, in what way it is inaccurate.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am not very much concerned as to how the improvement in the wages of agricultural labourers can be brought about so long as some steps are taken to improve their conditions and that there comes to the agricultural labourers some of the benefits passed on to the farmers by way of bounties and guaranteed prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Is there any Deputy who would suggest that of the millions of money voted for the farmers some portion of it should not find its way into the pockets of the agricultural labourer? Does Deputy Donnelly suggest that all this revenue should be given to the farmers, and that out of the millions of money they received for the last three years none of it should go to the agricultural labourers, and that their wages should be still further reduced?  If not, will Deputy Donnelly, the next time he speaks, indicate in what way some portion of these benefits to the farmers received through bounties, and guaranteed prices, should be passed on to the agricultural labourers or what effective steps should be taken to improve the condition of the agricultural labourers.  I want some practical suggestions from Deputy Donnelly and Deputy Harris on this matter if they claim to be sincerely interested in the condition of agricultural labourers.  Let us have the reasons as to why they do not agree with the suggestions put forward by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this Estimate because we know that the Government Party are delaying a motion put on the Order Paper to discuss this matter of wages.  This Party put down a motion calling upon the Government to set up an agricultural wages board for the purpose of stabilising the wages of agricultural labourers.  Private Members' Time has been taken by the Government after consultation and agreement with the Opposition.</P>

      <P>At any rate, Private Members' Time has been taken and the motion we have on the Order Paper, for the purpose of discussing this particular matter, has been delayed, and apparently will be delayed, according to the tactics of the Whips, for some time to come. We have taken the opportunity of ventilating this matter because we know that the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for the present <Col N="612" /> policy that has led to the condition of agricultural labourers at the present time.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has criticised this Party, and has alleged that we must shoulder the whole share of the responsibility for the existence, and continuance of the economic war. Life is not long enough for one to endeavour to convince him that that is not the true position.  The Government Party got a clear mandate, and no one knows it better than Deputy MacDermot, to withhold the land annuities.  The Government adopted that policy, and continue to adopt it, because they believe that an impartial tribunal will not be set up for the purpose of investigating and finishing the dispute on that particular matter. Deputy MacDermot seems to think that he is the only person who can find a solution of the controversy between Britain and Ireland.  What does he mean by a compromise?  If Deputy MacDermot will give me some more enlightenment as to what he means by a compromise, I shall have no hesitation in saying how I stand personally in regard to the matter.  I am sure the Party with which I am associated will have no hesitation in telling him what they think of the terms of his suggested compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in his coming here and reminding the House and the country that because we will not support this compromise we are responsible for the continuance of the economic war.  Personally, I do not think we will ever find that tribunal of saints and scholars which some people seem to think will be the only body of people in the long run to settle this economic dispute.  I hope such a tribunal will never be found, because I personally believe, and I think my colleagues also believe, that this economic war or financial dispute will have to be settled in the long run by negotiation between the contending parties.  If I had responsibility&mdash;and on this I am only speaking for myself&mdash;with the knowledge I have that such a tribunal will never be found, I would be prepared to do what bigger men in charge of bigger <Col N="613" /> countries have already done.  If we cannot find that tribunal or if we cannot see any hope of finding that tribunal, which some people are looking for as the only means of settling the dispute, I would have no hesitation in saying to the Prime Minister of Great Britain, &ldquo;I am prepared to make a token payment in consideration of our alleged liabilities and in the hope that some time or other, by means of a tribunal or by direct negotiation, a final settlement of the matters in dispute will be arrived at.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran said the farmers were the only people who suffered as a result of the economic war.  Of course, he was overlooking the fact that the agricultural labourers have suffered, even according to statements made by his own front bench colleagues, to the tune of at least 3/- a week.  He did not indicate&mdash;I suppose he deliberately ignored it&mdash;in what way he was prepared to take steps to improve or stabilise the conditions of the agricultural labourers. He prefers to taunt the Labour Party and the Government with the fact that the economic war, or the agricultural policy of the Government, has had the effect of reducing the wages of agricultural labourers on an average by 3/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Curran referred to the attitude of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I would appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to make inquiries in this matter, and the proper way to make inquiries is to call for returns showing for the last year, say, the number of applications sent in to the corporation for loans and the number of such applications which were declined without giving any reasons.  In my capacity as a Deputy I come across communications from a considerable number of people, and I certainly know of cases&mdash;I can give particulars if the Minister is prepared to go into the matter&mdash;where solvent, hard-working small farmers applied to the corporation for loans within the past few months and were turned down without any reason being given.  One small farmer in my constituency, whom <Col N="615" /> I have known since my school days, than whom there is no more industrious person, made an application to the corporation for a small loan within the last couple of months and was turned down without any reason being given.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran also dealt at length with the position of the people in the dairying industry. I dare say he has a great deal of personal knowledge of that matter. There is money provided for that purpose in this Estimate and the Minister has some responsibility for it.  I disagree with Deputy Curran when he says that the dairying industry has not benefited to any extent from the policy of the Minister for Agriculture. The Deputy knows as well as any other intelligent Deputy that the Minister is responsible for setting aside for this financial year and also for the next financial year a sum of £750,000 for the purpose of subsidising that industry and, by subsidising it, ensuring a much higher price to dairy farmers for their milk than could be given to them if there was no economic war and no bounties and subsidies for that industry.  I should like to hear the Minister say what justification there is for giving a subsidy for £750,000 to dairy farmers and allowing them to pocket the whole of that money and, at the same time, reduce the wages of the agricultural labourers; or what steps he is prepared to take to improve or stabilise the wages of agricultural labourers employed by the dairy farmers who are getting a subsidy to the tune of £750,000 per annum.  I understand that if there were no economic war and no subsidies or bounties given, the price paid for milk to the dairy farmers would be about 1½d. less than it is at present.  If Deputy Curran has made any study of the position from that point of view, and if he admits that the figures are correct, he must automatically admit that the policy of the Minister in regard to the dairy farmers has brought considerable financial benefit to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan, who is an expert on the value of old cows, will be able to give some information to the <Col N="617" /> House when he comes to speak.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister in announcing a reduction of the levies to be paid in the coming financial year by butchers, and, at the same time, increasing the price of the cheap beef to those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance and home assistance.  He is going to increase the price of beef to the poorest section of the community in order to reduce the levies payable by butchers, who, according to my information, have been getting fairly decent profits out of the business they carry on.  It is the kind of arrangement of which I personally do not approve.  If the Minister is convinced that there is a good case for reducing the levies payable under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, he should not do it at the expense of the people who are getting cheap beef, because if the beef is to be bought at the price indicated by the Minister in his speech, I would not call it cheap beef, because it will be very little less than the price being paid by public institutions for beef of the same class.  I think he should have got the money from some other source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harris also seemed to think that the provision of employment for some of our young people in rural areas and, appearently, for some of the people of the agricultural labourer class, is going to help to force up the existing rate of wages of our agricultural labourers.  I do not see how that is going to be done automatically, at any rate.  So far as I can see, the majority of the factories in the rural areas and the provincial towns are giving employment, in the main, to girls and women, the proportion, so far as I can find out, being one male to every three females. The majority of the factories are not taking into their employment persons of the agricultural labourer class, and that ought to be clear to Deputy Harris.  It will be much clearer to him if he makes inquiries in the towns in which factories are working in his own area.  I know that any of the factories established in towns in my constituency are giving employment only to girls and women, and to suitable unemployed men from the towns in which the factories have been established and <Col N="618" /> not to the agricultural labourers who have suffered a reduction of 3/- per week in their wages between 1931 and 1935.</P>

It was indicated by Deputy Donnelly, I understand, that we were opposing this Estimate for political reasons.  We are doing no such thing. I make this offer to the Minister, that, if he will indicate to us what steps he is prepared to take to improve and stabilise the wages and working conditions of agricultural labourers, we are prepared to consider the question of voting against this Estimate.  The speech made by Deputy Norton, indicating that we were going to vote against this Estimate, was made for <Col N="619" /> the sole purpose of endeavouring to find out from the Minister what definite proposals in that regard he is prepared to put forward.  If the Minister cannot give a definite indication and show in what way he is prepared to do that, after almost 18 months in which to consider certain proposals, we are going to support the amendment to refer back the Estimate.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to follow the several Deputies who have spoken in discussing big issues of agricultural policy which are so important to the country, but I hope I will not be thought to be speaking on an unimportant matter if I direct the attention of the House for a few minutes to one side of the functions of the Department of Agriculture, namely the bearing which the work of that Department may have on the public health of the country.  There is no doubt that the care of the health of the stock of the country is a matter which has not merely an effect on economic interests but has a direct effect on the health of the people in certain particulars that are of great importance.  Within the last 12 or 18 months, the House devoted a good deal of time to the protection of the health of the country in regard to one particular disease, namely, tuberculosis, as conveyed by cattle.  It is rather regrettable that we have very little information as to the view the Minister and the Department take of their duties in respect of the protection of the population against the conveyance of this particular disease from cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, however, a welcome step was taken by the Department when investigations were made as to the incidence of tuberculosis among cattle in the country.  The matter was one of great importance. When the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Milk Supply carried out inquiries some eight or nine years ago, and made its Report exactly eight years ago, it pointed out that it was in considerable difficulty as there were no complete statistics relating to the incidence of tuberculosis among cattle in the Saorstát.  They made various attempts to get an estimate <Col N="620" /> but they recognised that their estimates were very faulty.  Since that time, until the recent investigations conducted by the Department, no further information was available which would give information either to scientific workers or to the public, as to the actual incidence of the disease among the cattle of the country.  It was, therefore, an investigation of the utmost importance which the Department entered upon.  Our only knowledge of the result of those investigations was given by the Minister on 3rd January of this year in an address to the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association.</P>
    <P>I should like to read one or two paragraphs from the report of that speech as it appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the following day, Saturday, January 4th, 1936.  The Minister is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had been told that if they could have a scheme for the elimination of tuberculosis, they would have not only the advantage of a pure herd, but also no surplus cattle.  It would be found on minute examination that that was a very big problem.  They had had investigations carried out to see what was the incidence of tuberculosis.  They might succeed in speeding up the present machinery in that respect, but to contemplate the elimination of tuberculosis would cost many millions of money, would require more veterinary surgeons than they had in the country, and would take many years to accomplish.  And having done that in order to maintain their herds tubercular free, it would take a large annual Vote and at least 300 veterinary surgeons for all time. He did not want to give any impression that there was any need for alarm with regard to tuberculosis. Their investigations had shown that things were not by any means as bad as they had feared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the only information that has been given to the public as to the result of the investigations.  Recognising the considerable importance of this question, on the 12th of this month I asked the Minister if he would make <Col N="621" /> public the results of the investigations carried out by his Department on the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle.  His reply on that date was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The investigations carried out by the Department on the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle were undertaken only in very small areas.  They were not sufficiently widespread or exhaustive to warrant publication of the results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last week I again addressed a question to the Minister asking for information on certain specific points as to the incidence of tuberculosis in certain classes of cattle, particularly milch cows.  The Minister referred me to his previous answer, and in reply to a further question, while still refusing to allow the results of the investigations to be made public, he promised that they would be made available to anybody doing research or scientific work. That is a step forward for which we should be thankful to the Minister, but I submit it is entirely inadequate and that, whatever may be the importance or unimportance of the investigations, this House and the public generally are entitled to have the facts made known.  The Minister himself, in his answer to my question in this House, said that they were not sufficiently widespread or exhaustive to warrant publication, but they have been sufficiently widespread and exhaustive to determine his policy, and the House should be put in a position to judge whether his policy in the matter has been a correct policy or a mistaken policy.  It is impossible for the House to form an opinion on that question as long as the facts by which his policy is determined on this matter are concealed from us.</P>
    <P>The paragraphs I have read from the Minister's speech are certainly curious. He begins by saying that they had been told that if they could have a scheme for the elimination of tuberculosis they would have not only the advantage of a pure herd but also no surplus cattle.  Who had told him that?  The Inter-Departmental Committee of eight years ago stated in the very early pages of their report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied that the presence of tubercle bacilli in milk is a <Col N="622" /> grave danger to the health of the community, especially the children. . . .The eradication of tuberculosis from cattle is a primary necessity, not alone for securing a pure and wholesome milk supply for home consumption but in the interest of our greatest industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are told that by the Inter-Departmental Committee, who were concerned with two matters&mdash;one, the health of the community, and the other the protection of what was then our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement, a statement which it is very hard to understand, puts forward two apparently contradictory views.  He states that the eradication of tuberculosis, a step advised not only in general terms by the Inter-Departmental Committee but advised by them with reference to specific plans to be carried out, would cost many millions of money and would require more veterinary surgeons than there are in the country.  He stated that it would require 300 veterinary surgeons for all time.  Then he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He did not want to give any impression that there was any need for alarm with regard to tuberculosis. Their investigations had shown that things were not by any means as bad as they had feared.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently, when the Minister started the investigations he feared that it would cost many millions to eradicate tuberculosis.  Later on, he says that the problem was much smaller than he had anticipated.  It is impossible for this House to form any estimate of the true position in regard to tuberculosis when we find two such contradictory statements made by the Minister in almost successive sentences in a public speech.  It may be suggested that in drawing attention to this matter, one is causing unnecessary alarm.  The cause for alarm has been given by the Minister, who tells us that the problem is so large that it would take millions of money to deal with it.  Yet it is a problem which the Inter-Departmental Committee said required to be solved.</P>
    <P>The Minister's further statement that <Col N="623" /> the problem is less than he expected only increases one's anxiety as to what is the exact position.  I submit, Sir, that where there is a problem like this on which there is not any definite knowledge available to the public, knowledge which has been regarded as extremely important by the Inter-Departmental Committee which studied the subject a few years ago, knowledge for which scientific workers have been looking for many years without any opportunity of obtaining it, when that knowledge is in the archives of the Department, this House and the public are entitled to it.  It may be that when we get that information or see the results of the investigations, we shall all agree with the Minister that these investigations were carried out on too small a scale to enable any conclusions to be formed from them.  That is a matter on which we have a right to form our own opinion.  We cannot take it from the Minister that the results are not alarming if, at the same time, the problem is such as would require the expenditure of millions of money.  I hoped by questioning the Minister to obtain some information on this matter, but apart from his welcome statement that he would make the information available for scientific workers, the Minister has not made any advance at all towards the demand that this information should be made available for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We have one Fianna Fáil Deputy in Deputy Harris who is honest enough to agree that the policy of the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, was the policy best suited to this country.  He admitted that.  I believe Deputy Harris is right.  It is a pity that more Fianna Fáil Deputies who agreed with that policy will not make their minds known to the Minister for Agriculture. Deputies coming from the country parts know what conditions are there. I know several other Fianna Fáil Deputies who pretty well believe as Deputy Harris does.  The policy of Fianna Fáil in relation to tillage is too fast.  The change is entirely too big. You cannot get a policy such as Fianna Fáil has adopted into line in <Col N="624" /> a few years without at the same time driving out live stock or killing the live stock trade.  It may be all right for a few Ministers in Dublin to believe that it can be done.  When people try to put it into practice down the country it fails.  The sooner Fianna Fáil realises that the better for themselves and for the country.  It is being pushed a bit too far.  Take County Galway, where there are 10,000 or 11,000 acres under beet.  The great trouble there, according to practical farmers, is that the live stock trade is dying away, both in sheep and cattle.  They say they are tilling the few fields they have year in year out, and that a position will be reached in four or five years when the land will be valueless from continuous cropping and for want of farmyard manure.  That is the position in the west of Ireland.  Deputy Harris said that prices of live stock and produce went down under Deputy Cosgrave's regime, but that there had been an improvement under the present Government.  That seems rather strange, from an examination of the figures.  Under the late Government the average price of cattle was £16, while the average price a month ago, for the same class of beet, was £8.  That is what we have to look at. It is the same with the sheep industry. Galway is a county that produces practically one-fourth of the sheep population of the Free State.  The export duties on these sheep as well as the 5/- on each animal that was collected from the butchers by the Government would more than pay the rates in County Galway for one year. Looking at it in that way, the position is certainly very sad.  Yet Ministers will be found saying that tillage is necessary in order to give employment to farmers' sons and daughters.  In the years 1931 or 1932 the quota from this country to the United States was about 2,000 and it was not filled. From Mayo, Galway and Kerry every week numbers are now flying to England looking for work.  You have practically the best type in the country going away every Friday.  There have been special trains.  I know one case in County Galway where 600 left in one week.</P>

      <P>They left that area in a week.  There are railway stations in Galway.  I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the sub-head dealing with agricultural schemes in congested districts.  It will be found that in agriculture alone there is an increase for officials and salaries of £15,500.  Under one sub-head that concerns the congested districts there is a decrease in the Estimate of £1,976.  It will be found that on every occasion when Estimates deal with the poorer districts they suffer.  That happens under each of the Departments. The same thing will be found in Fisheries and in the congested districts of the Gaeltacht.  It is the same with shelter belts, fruit trees and schemes to encourage reclamation. Fancy an Estimate of £10 for a scheme to encourage reclamation in Galway.  Did anyone ever hear anything more disgraceful on the part of a Government than is supposed to help the poorer districts and the people who find it hard to live?  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the position.  I think Deputy Harris put it fairly plain.  He does not agree with the present policy.  As far as I could learn from the Deputy's speech we are moving too fast in one direction&mdash;that of turning to tillage and doing away with live stock.  From questioning farmers I find it is their <Col N="626" /> belief that the two should go hand in hand.  I ask the Department to make a note of that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Pigs Marketing Board which comes under this Estimate, I should like to ask the Minister not to rush the marketing of pigs direct to the factories.  I have received strong resolutions from County Galway that that policy would harm both farmers and the small towns.  I made enquiries about the matter from people who send pigs now and again to the factories.  I met a man who sends a lorry of 14 or 15 pigs to the factory and he gave me the returns.  Now and again, for Class A1 pigs, the price was 38/- per cwt.; for suitable pigs 35/- per cwt., and others were graded down to 33/- per cwt.  Then there were the non suitable or factory type which were sent back to the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position that we are in in this matter is that it is very difficult for the ordinary farmer at the present time to find out what is a suitable factory pig.  At one time, if you are standing on a fair you may find buyers giving 36/- or 38/- per cwt. for a 12 stone pig while a smaller rate will be paid for a heavier pig.  In a month's time, if you are again standing on a fair you may find the position reversed&mdash;that the higher price will be paid for the heavier pig and the smaller price for the lighter pig.  In these circumstances it is very difficult for a farmer to know what type of pig is going to bring the best price. He will not know that until he sends the pig into the market, and then the return to him may not be satisfactory. Our farmers will need a good deal of training before they will have knowledge sufficient to enable them to know, from one week to another, the right weight of pig to send to the market.  There is another obstacle also in their way.  It is not every farmer who is able to send half a lorry load or a wagon or two of pigs to the market.  The result is that he has to depend on the factory as to the price he gets for his pigs.  I believe myself that we ought to go slow in this matter.  It will cause a good deal of dissatisfaction to farmers because they will not be satisfied <Col N="627" /> with the prices they get.  If, however, they are able to bring their pigs to the market, and that you have competition for the pigs from amongst the buyers present the producers will be better satisfied.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate because I am of opinion that there are plenty of speakers on the Government side better qualified to speak on agriculture than I am.  But, while the words of Deputy Brodrick are ringing hot in the ears of Deputies, I would like to remind him of his inconsistency. The whole trend of his speech was to the effect that, as a result of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, we are moving too fast in agricultural matters, and that we are killing the live-stock trade of the country. I think that is an honest summary of the Deputy's arguments.  This is the last day of March.  About 14 days ago Deputy Brodrick, in a debate in this House, asked the Government for God's sake&mdash;these were the exact words he used&mdash;to continue the bounty on the seed potato industry in the County Galway, and proudly boasted that it was a branch of the agricultural industry which the County Galway farmers had started themselves.</P>

      <P>My only reason for intervening is to remind Deputy Brodrick of his inconsistencies.  There is no use in a Deputy standing up here one day because it is fashionable to do so, because it suits, and because he thinks that it is good propaganda, and asking the Government to subsidise agriculture, that being, according to him, the only hope for the farmers of County Galway, and in a fortnight's time coming in here and on the Vote for the Minister for Agriculture saying that the policy adopted by the Government is so bad that if you do any tillage you are doing what is wrong unless you keep a bullock the same as you did in the years gone by.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister for Agriculture is rather to be commiserated with and for many reasons: for no reason more than the nature of the advocates put forward from his own benches to support his policy.  The Minister comes here with his policy, and who are the Deputies who rise to support it?  We had Deputy Donnelly.  It is news to me that the Deputy, who, no doubt, is a man of considerable ability, knows much or indeed anything of Irish farming.  But if Deputy Donnelly knows little, how about Deputy Briscoe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;speaking in a debate on agriculture?  He was one of the persons whom the Minister, with difficulty, drew into the discussion on his behalf.  We then had Deputy Harris.  In the part of the Deputy's speech which I did hear, he was damning the Minister with very, very faint praise indeed.  Perhaps some better advocate may come along later, having solaced himself during the last day and a half with a pipe of foreign tobacco.  But a certain Deputy whom I now see sitting opposite to me certainly does know more about agriculture than any other Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches, and he possibly may intervene later.  I hope that we may hear his views.  I think that the views of Deputy O'Reilly on tobacco, for instance, would be very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion on this Estimate has, in some respects, been a very interesting one.  One of the most interesting speeches which I have heard for a long time in the Dáil was delivered from the Labour benches by Deputy Norton on Thursday night.  I rose to speak after him, but was not called upon, to do what I had never done before, and that was to express my approbation of almost all&mdash;certainly three-quarters of what was contained in his speech.  Deputy Norton's speech showed a new and a very welcome departure on the part of the Labour Party from its previous attitude. <Col N="629" /> Since the Deputy is the leader of that Party, I take it that his speech shows a very real change and a very real alteration on behalf of the whole Labour Party towards the Government.  Three-quarters, if not more, of what was contained in Deputy Norton's speech could have been delivered, and has been delivered, from these benches.  It is quite true that, as far as our positive agricultural policy is concerned, Deputy Norton did not advert to it. But, as far as what I may call our negative policy is concerned&mdash;as far as our criticism of what out of politeness I shall call the series of makeshifts and temporary expedients which the Minister for Agriculture indulges in a policy&mdash;our criticism of that policy which so often comes from these benches was strongly re-echoed and stoutly reaffirmed by Deputy Norton in his speech.  I was very glad to hear him do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton attributed the fall in agricultural wages entirely to the agricultural policy of the present Administration, and I think that beyond all question he was right in that.  The fall in agricultural wages is a direct result of the policy which has been adopted by the Minister for Agriculture. I welcome the remarks that were made by Deputy Norton, and the fact that the Deputy has now been compelled, by the events that have happened, to admit the complete failure of the agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil.  I have no doubt that it was the cogency of the facts which Deputy Norton produced that prompted the Minister to intervene with the remark, which was justly censured by Deputy Byrne, in which he described Deputy Norton's speech as a piece of hypocrisy. I do not believe that at all; I do not agree with the Minister; I do not think it was hypocrisy; I think it was an honest belief, an honest statement of an honest opinion which had been forced upon Deputy Norton by the pressure of events.  When I say that, it is not a question of my thought being fathered by my wish.  I believe it is absolutely so, and I would like to say in passing that Deputy Norton has expressed his difference with the <Col N="630" /> Government, not on a minor matter, not even on a grave matter, but on a vital matter of policy affecting this State.</P>
    <P>No matter what may have been said in the past, nowadays not even from the Front Government Bench is the proposition denied that agriculture is the mainstay of this State, our most important industry.  What affects agriculture affects most dearly our interests and Deputy Norton now agrees with us that in that most vital matter the policy of the Ministry is bringing poverty to persons who are endeavouring to make their living out of the land. It is a matter of grave concern for the Labour Party.  It does not matter what you may do to the branches if you poison the roots; you may trim, you may spray, you may prune and do anything else you like to improve the various branches of our industrial life, but if you poison the roots, the branches must in time wither and decay.  Poison agriculture, destroy agriculture, as is the policy of the present Executive, and the whole of your industrial fabric fades away.  When the purchasing power of agriculture goes, all your industries fade, and it is on that vital issue that Deputy Norton and the whole Labour Party have departed from their friendship with, their admiration of, and their adherence to the Government.  I trust, I hope and I believe that they will show for the future&mdash;because I do not think Deputy Norton's speech was hypocrisy at all&mdash; a very much better and, therefore, a very much more adverse attitude towards the Government's policy than they have done up to the present.</P>
    <P>Let me turn back after that digression to the question with which I was dealing; that is, the question of the fall in agricultural wages, which is a matter of very grave concern.  It is quite possible that Deputy Norton in stating his case did slightly overstate it.  It is quite possible that in the figures he gave he did not in every case take into consideration the value of the support and maintenance which workmen may get in their employers' houses.  I say that is quite possible. I have no doubt that the Minister, grasping, as I expect he will grasp, at any little debating point, may make <Col N="631" /> that point in reply.  But I am completely in agreement with Deputy Norton that, great as is the fall in the value of agricultural wages which the Government figures show, there is in fact a very much higher fall.  I agree with Deputy Norton in that statement.  I do not believe the 3/- a week, which is the average fall since the Government came into office, is the true fall.  I believe it is higher than that, but I am willing to accept the official Government figures, which indicate 3/- a week as being the average fall in agricultural wages.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, willing to adopt Deputy Norton's figures and his arguments and, in the further remarks I make upon this matter, I am simply adopting what Deputy Norton says and in some respects supplementing it.  I wish to supplement it especially in two matters.  Deputy Norton left out of consideration entirely the fall in the purchasing power of money owing to the raised cost of living.  The true rate of wages for a workman is what he can get with the money he receives.  A nominal £1 a week may represent under different conditions very different things to that particular working man.  At the present moment there is not only a 3/- a week fall in the nominal value, the sterling value if you like, the currency value of the wages he is receiving, but there is also a very big drop in the purchasing power of even the reduced amount that he receives, because the value of the commodities he has to buy, his tea, sugar, tobacco, and especially&mdash; and the Minister is mainly responsible for this&mdash;the rise in the price of the flour he has to buy, reduces the purchasing power of even his reduced wages still further.</P>
    <P>The labourer is losing in both directions. He is being paid a lesser sum and even that lesser sum has not the same purchasing power as an equivalent sum would have had before the Minister came into office.  We have heard this drop of 3/- a week spoken of very glibly.  I would like the House to consider for a moment what a drop of 3/- means to an agricultural labourer.  I would like Deputy Moore <Col N="632" /> especially to consider this, because of his interventions.  I would like the House to consider what a drop of 3/- a week to a man with £1 a week means&mdash;a drop from 20/- to 17/-.  It is not a cutting away of luxuries; it is a pruning down of the very necessities of life, the preventing of ends that were with very great difficulty made to meet, the preventing of those ends meeting at all.  It is bringing very great hardship and misery into the homes of these labourers.  I wish the House would bear that in mind.  It is not a nominal thing; it is a very real catastrophe.  Deputies seem to talk of it very glibly, but I do not think there are very many on the opposite benches who endeavour to realise what that drop does mean to these people, to realise that a person able to get along with a certain amount of, to use a classic phrase, frugal comfort, is now being driven off that standard of frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>Think of the unhappiness it brings into these homes, the wretchedness of the father and mother in these cottages. It is not a matter to be lightly considered.  All that has been brought about by the present agricultural policy of this Government.  Deputy Norton is perfectly clear upon that, and he is, in my judgment at any rate, absolutely right.  I think when we come to consider this policy of the Government the best way in which we can estimate it is by contrasting it with what was the policy founded and based upon years and years of experience and which was in existence in this country before Fianna Fáil came into office.  That policy may be put very concisely in this way: that you based your policy, practically all over the country&mdash;and I am quite willing to admit that, although there are certain parts, here and there in the country to which different principles may apply, there are also small areas in the country to which different principles must be applied&mdash;but, taking the country in general, the sound principle was that you based your agriculture policy on the sale of live stock and on the sale of live-stock products, and that you produced that live stock and those <Col N="633" /> live-stock products in a saleable condition utilising for that purpose as far as possible the produce of your own farm.  That was sound farming policy.  It was based upon the export of poultry, pigs, eggs, milk; and so on, and, in order to produce those things, you had to till your land &mdash;such land as you had&mdash;and produce as much as you could out of your land. That was always our policy.  I heard a Deputy here to-night&mdash;I think it was Deputy Jordan, but I am not sure&mdash; say that it was our policy not to have any tillage at all.  Of course, that is absurd.  The policy that I have enunciated always&mdash;the policy that I have enunciated from these benches for years&mdash;is the policy of tillage to feed one's stock.  That is a sound policy, and that is the alternative to what has been suggested by the Deputies opposite.  The Deputies opposite think that the export of live stock and live-stock products is a mistake.  As a matter of fact, at one time, in recent history, it was regarded as almost disgraceful to approve of the sale of these products.  Our policy is to encourage the maximum export of live stock and live-stock products.  I say that Fianna Fáil knows, or must realise, that every rational man must be held responsible for the necessary consequences of his actions; and that, if the policy is not to export live stock or live-stock products, we must export men and women instead.  That therefore is the Fianna Fáil policy at the present time.  Their policy is that instead of exporting live stock and live-stock products, you export men and women.  For either you must export men and women or else get back to the live-stock trade.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is very easy to demonstrate that fact.  This country cannot do without an export and an import trade.  Certain countries supply our requirements and they must be paid for their supplies by exports from our country, just as we must pay in return. Even the Spaniards must pay, and it must be remembered that this country will suffer, just as Spain did, if we are not able to pay, either in money or goods, for the imports we receive. This country also will stop producing if they are not paid for what they are <Col N="634" /> producing.  If they are not paid for what they are producing, how can they be expected to produce?  Imports and exports must, within a certain period, balance one another.  Within a very short period, as the finances of countries go, imports and exports must balance one another&mdash;and by imports I mean imports of commodities and &ldquo;concealed imports&rdquo; and by exports exports of commodities and what is called &ldquo;concealed exports.&rdquo; These must balance.  There must be except for very short periods a true trade balance.  I put emphasis on the word &ldquo;true.&rdquo; That is an elementary principle.  It is a principle that has been accepted by economists generally, and you cannot change that principle even if you would.  You cannot avoid the results of that principle.  Whatever may be the costs of your imports, how are you going to pay for them?  We are paying for the commodities which we import by commodities that are almost entirely agricultural, and by what is known as invisible exports, which are the result of money coming into this country from investments abroad and also from the wages earned by our people abroad and sent into this country.</P>
    <P>But, now that you have reduced such imports enormously, how are you going to offset that?  You cannot increase the interest on the capital which you have invested abroad.  There is only one way of increasing the amount of money that comes into this country from the men and women outside the country.  You must either have that money coming in or have starvation inside the country.  There is no other alternative.  The law is there, and that explains what is happening, and it also explains very clearly the emigration of young men and young women from Ireland into England that has been going on to such an alarming extent in the last few years.  I alluded to it well over a year ago.  I was then contradicted from the Labour Benches by Deputy Davin.  I heard him some what in the same strain to-night. There is not a single Deputy in this House who knows the West of Ireland but knows that there has not been in <Col N="635" /> his or in the memory of anybody else anything like the number of young men and also of young women who are going to England at the present moment to get work.  That is the inevitable result of the Minister's policy.  Remember that when voting on this Vote to-night your vote will be on this issue: &ldquo;Are you or are you not in favour of the exportation by the Minister's policy of young men and young women from this country?&rdquo;  If the Fianna Fáil Deputies approve of the exportation that is going on now of young men and young women, then by all means let them vote for the Minister's policy of which this exportation is the result.  But I think that is wrong.  I think that is not the proper thing.  If we want those young men and young women to remain in this country and work upon the land of this country, then let Deputies now vote as we of the Opposition are voting for the referring back of this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very petty scheme for helping the live-stock trade.  This scheme has been the slaughter of calves.  That, I venture to think, is one of the most extraordinary procedures which have been ever adopted by any administration. The evil that men do lives after them. The evil that the Minister for Agriculture is doing to Irish agriculture by the slaughter of calves will, I am afraid, live long after him, and live long after the time that he is retired from office.  In adopting that extraordinary policy the Minister for Agriculture was following out some foreign precedents but they were precedents under completely different conditions. The slaughter of calves, the reduction of our live stock and the leaving of our farms understocked is a policy which not only will hit the country in the future, but it is beginning to hit the country even at the present moment.  It is the policy that will hit the country long after our normal trade relations with Great Britain are restored, and long after our cattle industry and cattle exports have been put on a profitable basis again.  The Minister is not only doing harm at the present moment but he is doing harm that will last for very many <Col N="636" /> years to come.  The policy of destroying calves means the policy of not having our lands stocked.  It means that our land is not going to pay owing to the fact that it is understocked. That is one result of the Minister's policy.  Remember, if our land is understocked, receipts are not coming in.  We will, therefore, not be able to pay for our imports by our exports.  We must import and while we import we will still have to keep up the export to which I have referred &mdash;the export of our unfortunate human beings.  The House and the country should bear that in mind. When the Minister is ordering, encouraging or bringing about this wholesale slaughter of calves he is signing a deportation order against thousands of young Irishmen and young Irish women.  His policy must have that result.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have steadily and consistently fought against the slaughter of calves.  We have denounced it.  But in spite of that I gather from the Minister that his policy is still the carrying on of this slaughter.  He tells us that he intends to do it this year.  I do not know how many he means to slaughter.  If he slaughters 100,000 this year, that means that in two years from now it will have cost the country £1,000,000.  He tells us he is going to carry it out.  From every platform from which I have spoken from the first day on which the Minister introduced this scheme of calf slaughter I have denounced it; I have not only encouraged the people not to slaughter their calves, but, on the other hand, I have encouraged them to buy as many calves as they can buy and can rear.  If the Minister looks at my constituency he will find that very few calves have been slaughtered there.  If he makes enquiries he will find that not only amongst my own supporters but amongst my political opponents in South Mayo my advice has been followed, and very few calves have been slaughtered in Mayo.  I believe the people of Mayo are buying as many calves as they are able to rear.  I hope they are.  In the first place, I believe that before two years are over this Government will <Col N="637" /> be out of office, and this economic war will have been brought to a wise and sensible conclusion.  And calves now bought and reared will be calves which will be sold at a great advantage to their owners.  That is the advice I have given and am giving my constituents.  If the calves that are bought and saved from slaughter now do not pay to the extent to which I am looking forward, they will pay to some extent and, at any rate, they will prevent the lands of Ireland lying barren and waste, as the Minister apparently would like to see them. I may tell the House that I am adopting this policy myself, just as I am advising other people to adopt it&mdash;not to slaughter their calves.</P>
    <P>We have an agricultural policy put forward by the Minister.  That policy has got a very large acceptance and support from that eminent agriculturist, Deputy MacDermot.  That Deputy's instructive agricultural speech consisted largely of a not very interesting biography of himself, and was not in the very best of taste. Deputy MacDermot said that he was entirely in favour of the Minister because the Minister was trying experiments.  Deputy MacDermot is all in favour of trying experiments. There is a famous phrase&mdash;<i>fiat experimentum in corpore vili,</i> let the experiment be performed on a worthless body.  Deputy MacDermot is altogether in favour of the Minister making experiments as far as Irish agriculture is concerned.  Evidently the Deputy considers that Irish agriculture is worthless and valueless, and a body upon which experiments ought to be carried out.  I do not agree.  I do not think we have any right to experiment with other people's lives.  There are other experiments, which are wise, experiments which you try on a very small scale.  You experiment with certain classes of seeds or with certain classes of manures, you experiment on a small scale.  That is a wise thing to do.  But when you start experimenting with a man's livelihood, when you start experimenting with a man's sole means of existence, that is quite a different matter. These experiments which are being <Col N="638" /> carried out are not experiments on a small scale or with a view to improving in detail certain matters.  They are wide experiments to which the Minister is being driven by necessity, and they are experiments which are affecting a very large number of people in this State enormously to their detriment.  But Deputy MacDermot praises them because they are experiments, and anything that can be classed as an experiment is excellent according to Deputy MacDermot and it is excellent according to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have the fruits of that policy. We see what the policy is.  It is hitting the large farmer.  I want now to say something about the relationship between the farmer and the labourer.  I am driven to refer to this by a few of the remarks made by Deputy Davin.  Deputy Davin in that respect departed from what Deputy Norton said a few nights ago.  Deputy Davin tried to make out that the fall in wages was to some extent, if not entirely, due to some concerted &ldquo;devilment&rdquo; which has sprung up in the hearts of farmers.  The word &ldquo;devilment&rdquo; is mine.  Has it?  Anybody who knows this country knows that the relationship now between employers and employed upon the land is very good.  There may be an exception here and there but I am speaking of the farmers and the labourers as a whole.  The relationship between farmers and labourers is not a completely economic relationship. There is a human touch in it. They have sympathy with one another &mdash;the farmer with the labourer and the labourer with the farmer.  They feel for one another's sufferings. That is the position all over the country, and the farmers and labourers themselves know it is.  Let me assume for a moment that there is a farmer somewhere who does not regard his workman as a human being at all.  Let me create an economic farmer somewhat in the manner that the old standard political economists, like John Stuart Mill, created the economic man.  Let us invent a farmer who takes no more interest in his men than he does in his cattle. <Col N="639" /> It is to the advantage of every farmer to pay his men a decent wage.</P>
    <P>In every industry, it is of some importance that there should be co-operation between employer and employed. In the case of the farmer, that co-operation is essential.  That is one of the merits of the Irish worker&mdash;that he does take an interest in the work he does, that he takes an interest in the crops he helps to sow and in the crops he helps to reap.  It is of real importance to the farmer that he should keep alive that spirit. It is almost an elementary truth that the farmer who does not know how to get the generous co-operation of his men in doing the work of his farm does not know how to farm at all. All farmers realise that.  Looking at the matter merely from the cash point of view, it does not pay the farmer to cut down the wages of his workmen below the proper economic level because he does not get as good work.  There is, of course, the higher ground to be considered.  In this regard, there are plenty of examples. If Deputies opposite did not keep their eyes shut, they would see the examples.  All over the country, farmers are paying their men wages that, regarded from the purely economic standpoint, they cannot afford to pay.  They are exhausting their resources, and those who have exhausted their resources are exhausting their credit in order not to cut down the wages of their workmen.</P>
    <P>The argument that the farmers have suddenly become wicked and are wantonly cutting down wages has no foundation in fact.  If it had, why, when Fianna Fáil came into office, did this sudden wave of wickedness pass over the Irish farmers?  If such a wave has passed, I should like to know why the two things synchronise. I do not believe that such a wave has passed.  I believe that Deputy Norton's contention is absolutely sound and the only true contention.  I believe that farm wages have been reduced because the farmers cannot afford to pay the higher wages.  They cannot afford to pay because the policy of the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="640" /> and of the Executive Council has deprived them of the means of paying. Agricultural wages are not a bad barometer.  It would be hard to get a better barometer of agricultural conditions than is represented by the agricultural wages that are being paid.  The Minister and the members of the Government Party have dodged and ignored this argument and have not attempted in any way to explain it.  Let the Fianna Fáil Party look at this matter fairly and squarely.  They see the result of their policy everywhere. They see the labourers' wages cut down in the two-fold fashion I have mentioned.  If they go to the West of Ireland, they will see almost every adult young man and young woman being driven out of the country.  They are going off in their thousands and that is happening regularly. Do they approve of that? Is it not clearly the result of the Fianna Fáil policy?</P>

I do know that no census yet published will show the number of young men that left the County of Mayo last Friday and last Friday week and that, as Deputy Brodrick told you, left the County of Galway on the same dates.  These are facts that cannot be disputed.  These things are there to be seen and, if Deputy Donnelly has any doubt on the subject, let him go down to any station in County Mayo or in the West of Ireland on any Friday and he will see the exodus.  There is no use in shutting your eyes to facts.  These people are being driven out and Deputy Donnelly is doing a man's part in driving them out by supporting the policy of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>You are bringing back '47 methods and they are being driven out by the very thing that drove them out in '47&mdash; want.  That is what you are bringing <Col N="641" /> to the West of Ireland now.  I am glad the Deputy mentioned '47.  He and his colleagues are doing their very best to reduce the country people to the condition in which they were in '47. If it were not for England, they would be likely to succeed.  This is a nice way to fight their economic war.  We hear these gentlemen spitting fire about the fighting of the economic war.  Yet they are sending over the best young men and the best young women in this country to work in England&mdash;to work for the enemy.  That is the way you are fighting your economic war which you are so very proud of.  The true Irish heart and burning Irish nationality of Deputy Briscoe, which came out so strongly in rebuke of Deputy MacDermot, would not permit him to see the economic war ended by negotiation. His patriotism is too high for that.  But how are you carrying on this economic war?  You are sending over these young men and young women to England, and they are keeping the Gaeltacht going.  They are supporting their families not alone in the Gaeltacht but outside it because these young people are going, not only from the Gaeltacht districts, but from all over the country.  Is it out of charity or love that they are getting work in England?  Do you think that an Englishman who is paying his Irish labourer 35/- or 40/- is doing that out of charity? Do you not know perfectly well that if the Irish labourer is being paid 35/- a week, let me say, he is doing more than 35/- worth of work for the man who is employing him?  Is he not enriching by his labour the country you are supposed to be fighting?  Are not the Irish girls who are going across doing exactly the same?  You are driving people out of this country who ought to be enriching this country with their labour.  You are driving them into England, and they are enriching England with their labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a whole lot more which I should like to say about the Minister's agricultural policy, but I do not want to reiterate what has been said.  Not only is the Minister ruining the future of the live-stock trade and ruining the future of the export trade, but the Minister by his policy is reducing the <Col N="642" /> true capital of the Irish farmer; he is reducing the fertility of the land.  That is happening everywhere.  We have crops being taken two years in succession. This is happening frequently and happening everywhere, and the Minister ought to know it if he gets any true agricultural returns at all.  It does not pay now to feed your cattle well.  The number of cattle is being reduced.  You do not want the same intensive return off your meadows as you did; therefore, the land you meadow is not manured.  It is happening everywhere.  The fertility of the soil is being reduced, and the Minister ought to know it if he knows the first thing about agriculture.</P>
    <P>Again, in places where there is no money there are people who are not only not putting out manure upon the land they wish to meadow, but they are not putting out manure upon their crops.  They have not got the money to pay for manure, so the fertility of the soil is being broken down.  The Minister, in some moment of leisure, should take some interest in the Department he rules over, and study the statistics of the amount of arti ficial manure used this year and four years ago in this State.  I think he will get a very great eye opener, and see how much the fertility of the land is being reduced.  Of course, its fertility is being reduced in another way.  Artificial manure is excellent, but it is not enough.  It supplies a certain amount of plant food, but it does not supply all the necessary soil ingredients.  You must have either your ground crop ploughed in, which is not being done, or you must have your farmyard manure.  That is elementary.  Yet, the supply of farm yard manure is being reduced, and will be further reduced when the Minister's scheme of slaughtering calves has got a little bit further under way.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's policy.  What is so good about it?  What is there in it of which anybody can approve? Is not the country being spoiled by it? I would ask the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent rural constituencies to think this out for themselves.  Let them look at what is really happening. They ought to see that there is no future for the small farmer or for the <Col N="643" /> agricultural labourer as long as this dispute goes on.  Let them consider that and see what it means.  By your policy you are bringing poverty and misery on hundreds and thousands of homes.  I do believe that there must be amongst you people who have got some human feeling.  There are persons amongst you who must have some national feeling.  There are persons amongst you who must consider that whatever may be the tie that binds you to your Party it is not the highest tie that can bind you.  I certainly consider and sincerely hope that there are some Deputies on that side of the House who realise that the duty above all other human duties is not the duty which one owes to a Party, not the duty which one owes to the leader of a Party, but the duty which one owes to one's own country, and the duty which one owes to the people who are living in that country.  It is to that sense of duty which I am sure there must be in many a one amongst you that I make an appeal&mdash;an appeal that you will put an end to this policy which is bringing that state of poverty and that state of misery to so many homes in this country.  Do not shut your eyes to it. Do not be wilfully blind to it.  Do not be deaf to the voices that tell you about it.  Act like men, and end it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there is another duty to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney might have referred. There is the duty of stating facts plainly to the people&mdash;facts relating to the things that very vitally affect them.  I think Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney very carefully avoided that in his speech.  It is surely a very strange turn to see an ex-Minister of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government emphasising and lamenting again and again the terrible evil of emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He emphasises the terrible disaster, the terrible cruelty that is involved in exporting men and women.  Yet I think no one disputes that during the period of office of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government at least 300,000 young men and women left <Col N="644" /> this country.  You did not hear much then about the terrible evil of emigration. I think, as a matter of fact, those who attempted to raise the question were generally sneered at. And, in fact, it is only a week ago or so since Deputy Dillon made a plea from those benches for the recognition of emigration as a part of national policy in all circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, in face of those cold facts to which I have just referred, I am afraid we will be driven to believe that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney &mdash;I do not like to think it of anybody&mdash;was merely doing a little of Barry Sullivan, Henry Irving, or some of those people.  There has been a good deal of this sort of thing going on on other sides, too, particularly in relation to agricultural wages.  When Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was speaking about emigration, and lamenting the fall in agricultural wages, in my opinion he should have adverted to the fact that agricultural wages seven or eight years ago were maintained at the level then existing by exporting thousands of farm labourers each year. This departure of farm labourers enabled a reasonable wage to be paid to the farm labourers here.  What is the result of that?  Since the American depression set in at the end of 1929 numbers of those unfortunate people are not earning a shilling in wages. They have been in bread lines.  They have been sleeping in underground stations.  They have been suffering cruelties such as we have no conception of in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not for a moment defend low wages.  I think it is a lamentable <Col N="645" /> thing that any family should have to exist on as low a wage as a guinea a week, but I do not see that anything is to be gained by distorting and exaggerating it, and certainly Deputy Norton distorted and exaggerated it when he talked about 33/- a week in England and 14/- a week in Wexford. Surely there is no attempt there to give a correct picture of the facts. There is no such wage as 33/- a week in England.  I have already quoted the British official figures, in correcting Deputy MacDermot this afternoon. Even if Deputy Norton rejects those, I am sure he will not reject the figures of the International Labour Office. These figures are for Great Britain:&mdash; 1927, 31/8; 1928, the same; 1929, the same; 1930, the same; 1931, 31/6½; 1932, 31/1; 1933, 30/7½; 1934, 30/11. These figures were carefully complied, I understand.  Deputy MacDermot said there was a big difference between 30/- and 21/-.  It would be a very serious difference, indeed, if it applied in all cases.  But the fact is there are several strata of wages in this country. There is the fact that quite a considerable number of farm labourers, particularly the married, have advantages in addition to the wages they earn.  They have the advantage of an acre of land, which is a very considerable benefit to the great majority of them.  They have also the benefit of a very cheap cottage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no, but can anybody say that the English agricultural labourer has theses advantages.  I do not say that that is an answer to low wages, but Deputy MacDermot said recently that no farm labourer in England is paid less than 35/- a week, while here the wages is half that amount.  He did not give any authority.  To-day he quoted a letter which appeared in an English paper.  But if we are to use figures at all, in making comparisons, we ought to try and get the correct figures.  I think these advantages that I mentioned are enjoyed to a greater extent here than in England, but how <Col N="646" /> far they tend to equalise wages I do not know.</P>
      <P>There are no similar Labourers Acts in England.  I have seen it stated that the Irish agricultural labourer enjoyed model conditions in regard to housing, compared with the conditions under which the English agricultural labourer lives.  I am not able to say myself.  I cannot say that there are any such particular advantages for the labourers in England that would raise their wages above 30/- a week and I am not able to say how many of our own labourers enjoy these advantages.  There is no use making comparisons that only go half way.  You think you have scored when you have only confused.  Certainly it is remarkable that a leader of a Party in this House should use the ridiculous argument about 33/- in England and only 14/- in Wexford.  The official wage in Wexford, I understand, is over 20/-.  I am sure Deputy Norton would have to go to a lot of trouble before he could establish the figure he quoted.</P>

I have no connection with it politically; but I know farmers in Kildare who pay their labourers more than what Deputy Norton stated, and I could give him their names.  Deputy Norton, also, should be aware that some of this fall in wages is a political fall.  The Deputy <Col N="647" /> knows there was a substantial movement, I will not say a considerable movement, amongst farmers to cut down their wages and to dismiss their labourers in order to show their opposition to the present Government.</P>

      <P>There were two things in Deputy Dillon's speech that I would agree with and recommend to the consideration of the Minister.  One was in regard to the production of cheese and the quality of the cheese.  Efforts should be made to produce the best cheese in the world here.  It would be well worth while bringing over people from one of the Continental countries to train our people in cheese-making. I think it would have some effect also in regard to the tourist interest <Col N="648" /> if people found here that the native cheese were as good as or better than they could get in any other country. There is the other point with regard to the exports of butter, that efforts should be made to extend its sale amongst our own people.  It is the case, I think, that a good number of poor families are unable to buy butter at the present price.  It would be inconsistent with the policy of the self-sufficiency and concentration on the home market if we were not able to meet and improve that position.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is very much to be congratulated upon the success of his policy in connection with the dairy industry; and it is because he is so successful that I suggest he would be even more successful if he could find a way to act on these suggestions. When Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney lamented the position to which agriculture has fallen, under the present Minister's guidance, it was somewhat ungracious of him not to admit that in regard to that very big problem of the dairy industry the Government has achieved a wonderful success.  There is a loss to the country since the slump in dairy produce first took place of at least £5,000,000.  Yet in face of that loss the dairy industry has been maintained and is to-day, probably in a position at least as hopeful and as healthy as at any time.  That, in itself, is a very big tribute to the present Ministry and they deserve every congratulation for it. But there has also to be remembered in connection with the same question that if similar slumps take place in other branches of agriculture, as seems to be quite possible, and, indee, probable, would we not be in a curious position if we were to continue depending entirely upon the exports of such products and were not to take measures to balance possible misfortunes of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see by the statistics published in England that there are 1,00,000 more more cattle there than in 1913; 2,000,000 more sheep and 1,000,000 more pigs.  There are fairly big figures. They indicate that England is, at least, going some of the way towards making <Col N="649" /> herself more independent of outside supplies.  With a tendency like that staring us in the face it would be very criminal on the part of the Government here if they were to say: &ldquo;Everything is all right; you farmers go on catering for the English market and depend upon it; even though the price of butter may fall from 168/- to something like 75/- in a few years, even though other such changes as that may take place, do not be frightened; keep your eyes fixed upon the British market.&rdquo;  They would be unworthy to be a Government if that were to be their policy.</P>
    <P>Those who want to criticise the Government, those who want to be useful in a discussion of this kind, might well base their criticism on these big changes which are taking place, and if they could suggest better means of meeting such changes their suggestions would be very welcome.  But simply to abuse the Government as if they were responsible for things of that kind, to make out that the Ministry were bringing down agriculture and causing misfortune to the agricultural population while regardless of these facts, is to my mind not very useful criticism and leads nowhere.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the present policy is very generally supported in the country.  The best of the farmers, those who at all times gave the lead to the agricultural population, are confident believers in the present policy of the Government and do not want to see a change in any way. They would like better prices for their cattle and in course of time, they expect that better prices will come. But, as regards the other aspects of Government policy, they are entirely behind the Government and appreciate the efforts made for their welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been treated to a very pleasant speech by Deputy Moore in praise of the Minister for his activities.  I agree that the Minister is very probably doing his best for the agricultural community, but I respectfully submit that his best is not good enough or nearly good enough.  I do not intend to delay the House very long, but I <Col N="650" /> shall try to prove in a very definite way that the conditions obtaining through the country are not just as Deputy Moore believes&mdash;that the farming community give full approval to the Minister's agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>As I have told the House before, in the portion of the constituency in which I reside there are a large number of small farmers.  In 1931 and 1932, notwithstanding all the stories told by Fianna Fáil orators throughout the country about the condition of the farmers, the farmers were fairly well-to-do.  Many farmers who supported the present Administration both at the 1932 and 1933 elections had fairly substantial nest-eggs, as they were called, in money.  Within a two or three mile radius of where I reside there are a number of farmers who certainly voted Fianna Fáil, believing that the policy put to them was going to be given effect to and that the agricultural policy in particulat was going to bring them untold benefits.</P>
      <P>Before last Christmas, however, the court messengers started a campagin to collect the annuities in Longford and they called upon Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael farmers without distinction. But they made the same error in both cases.  When they went to a Fine Gael farmer and asked for his annuity and he explained that he was not able to pay, these messengers declared that the farmer had had his lesson well taught to him or that he had learned it well.  When they went to a Fianna Fáil farmer and he said, &ldquo;I am unable to pay,&rdquo; they said the same thing to him&mdash;that he had learned his lesson well.  I know several Fianna Fáil farmers in the district who challenged the court messengers and said, &ldquo;Do you mean to say I am a Blueshirt, or do you mean that I am able to pay and that I will not?&rdquo; One in particular said to them, &ldquo;I want to tell you that I have done more to put Fianna Fáil into office than any farmer in this district, and is this the thanks that I get, that I am going to be wrecked?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That farmer, to my own knowledge, had £600 in the bank at the time of the 1932 election.  To-day he has not <Col N="651" /> a solitary shilling, although he is a hard-working farmer.  As I say, that is within a radius of two miles from where I reside.  These court messengers tried the same stuff upon him as they tried upon his Fine Gael neighbour, although they told the truth when they said that any money they had had been expended and that they now found themselves unable to meet their obligations.  I challenge contradiction on these two or three cases in particular.  They are hardworking farmers who always held their heads high and who would not say that they were not able to pay if they were able to pay.  I might add that this was coming up to Christmas, when they had sold some turkeys, which were the only things they succeeded in making any money upon, and the court messengers came to these people and collected the annuities off them two or three days before Christmas and left them short of money.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community are being hard hit.  A number of people say that they must be doing well.  They are doing well in paying their way out of the reserves that they had.  Remember, that must come to an end.  The only thing that surprises me is that the resources were larger than I thought they were.  Of course there are members of the Government who would declare that there is no such thing as hardship amongst these small farmers.  They are all tillage farmers, all mixed farmers, and the most they have are two or three cows and two or three calves.  They all do as much tillage as they possibly can, and even if the Government brought in a compulsory tillage Act, these men could not till another inch.  They have done all that any Administration could expect of them.  These men came to me&mdash;they were Fianna Fáil supporters and, I presume, are more or less Fianna Fáil supporters to-day, because in talking to me they did not declare that they had changed their allegiance&mdash;and I said to them, &ldquo;Why do you not go to your Fianna Fáil club and tell this to them so that it will be conveyed to the Minister?  If I say that you are hard pressed and <Col N="652" /> hard hit, I am told that I am making Party propaganda.&rdquo;  They said, &ldquo;Do not talk to us about the Fianna Fáil clubs to-day.  They are now controlled by people drawing the dole, and looking for work on the road, and if we farmers go in we are walked on.&rdquo; That may or may not be true&mdash;I do not know.  I do not know what is the make-up of the Fianna Fáil organisation officially, but that is the reply I get.  I said to them, &ldquo;Very well; if I make this statement in the House, are you prepared to stand over it?&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in every case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore says that everything is rosy in the garden and that everything is going well, and he tells us that Deputy MacDermot or some other Deputy was wrong with regard to the 33/- a week wage of the agricultural labourer in England.  He said an extraordinary thing.  He said that the leader of a Party should be more careful in his quotations.  I do not know the strength of the Party which Deputy MacDermot leads at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore should be just as careful as the person he was checking, when making a statement like that.  He said that 31/-, and not 33/-, was the average wage of the agricultural worker in Great Britain, and 21/- was the standard here.  He then said that the Irish agricultural labourer had certain other emoluments and certain amenities which they had not got in Great Britain.  He instanced labourers' cottages, acres of land, and that sort of thing.  Deputy Pattison very rightly pointed out that the agricultural labourer had not got those things from his employer, but from the local authority and from the State.  I should like to point out to Deputy Moore that the English agricultural worker at 31/- a week is in a much better position than his brother in this country, because the cost of living in Great Britain is much lower than it is here.  Everything the Irish worker has to buy has gone up in price&mdash;sugar. bread, butter, flour, etc., If the Irish worker had 33/- <Col N="653" /> instead of the 31/- his English brother had, he would scarcely be in as advantageous a position as the English worker.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore also made a statement that was rather significant and which took my attention.  He said there was an increase in the number of cattle in Great Britain of 1,000,000, and an increase in the number of sheep of 3,000,000.  I should like to know if the population of England is going up or down, because one of the stock arguments we heard in this country was that the human population went down as the cattle population went up.  If there is an increase in Great Britain, I should like to know from an expert like Deputy Moore, who has quoted these statistics to us, what exactly is the reaction of the human population to that increase.  Or is that statement just in keeping with the usual stuff which Fianna Fáil has tried to put over on the people?  I believe it is.</P>
      <P>There are many other points which the Estimate brings to my notice, but I do not intend to go into them.  They have been fairly extensively dealt with and I do not think there is much to be gained by going into them now, but I should like to draw the attention of the House to the administration by the Minister of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, which comes under this Estimate.  A number of victuallers in a small way throughout the country who are licensed were called upon to supply meant on vouchers to unemployed persons, and, in a number of cases, they were unable to kill sufficient meat and they borrowed from other people. The result of it was that these victuallers supplied the people who put in vouchers with the meat, and after some fairly lengthy period had elapsed, the Minister notified them that because they did not supply a certain quality or kind, they could not be paid.  In other words, the Minister assumed to himself a judicial function which, in my opinion, he should not have assumed.  He fined these people certain sums, namely, the sums of money due by the Government to them, which the Government refused to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that that is inequitable.  The <Col N="654" /> fact of the matter is that these people have got the victuallers' property and carried it away, and the victuallers cannot now sue the people to whom they supplied it.  Therefore, they are at a loss if the Minister refuses to pay this money.  I admit that there may have been technical offences, but, if there were, my contention is that the Minister, instead of assuming this judicial function, should have put the Act into operation, and should have prosecuted these people and allowed the cases to be tried on their merits.  Instead of that, the Minister arbitrarily inflicted this punishment&mdash;I call it a punishment because I cannot call it anything else &mdash;upon these unfortunate men who have now no redress.  I contend that these people acted as they did through stress of circumstances, in some cases, and through ignorance of the law, in others.  The Minister will, of course, argue that ignorance of the law is no excuse, but these people took it that the supply of meat on vouchers was of a dual kind.  They had some hazy idea that it was something designed to increase the price of cattle for the farmers, but they thought that the really big purpose of it was the supplying of free meat to the unemployed and to the people who were poor. They got it into their heads that if They supplied that meat to these people, they were nearly sure to be paid for it.</P>
    <P>In some cases in various counties discussions took place between these victuallers and the inspectors.  In one case the inspector might say, &ldquo;Well, it is not exactly right, but as it is the best you can do, carry on and I shall try to see that you are paid.&rdquo;  In another case the inspector would say, &ldquo;It is wrong; it is not the right quality of meat.&rdquo;  To that the victualler would reply, &ldquo;But I have told you for the last five weeks what I have been supplying and you have not taken any notice until now.&rdquo; The inspector then would say, &ldquo;Well, if that is the case, carry on and if you can get away with it, well and good.&rdquo; The amounts due to these victuallers run into substantial sums.  I am not now talking of the big men who are <Col N="655" /> well able to look after themselves.  I am talking of the small men who are hard pressed to exist.  The Minister inflicts this punishment on them without giving them an opportunity of defending themselves.  I suggest to the Minister that after some time, when he has succeeded in getting the Act working smoothly, when he has got the victuallers all over the country to realise what is meant by the Act, and when they are obeying it, he should treat them generously and pay the amounts due on their giving an undertaking to observe the provisions of the Act fully for the future.  That, in my opinion, would help a number of people on whom grave hardship has been imposed.</P>
    <P>I am rather anxious to get an explanation&mdash;I have not read the Minister's speech, and he might have covered the point in introducing the Estimate&mdash;as to the difference between the cost of the cattle bought for the Roscrea Canning Factory and the amount received by way of Appropriations-in-Aid. The difference is very big&mdash;£22,000.  The expenditure is £47,000 and the receipts £25,000.  That leaves a difference of £22,000.  As far as I understand, no animals are being sent to Roscrea except those known as &ldquo;silver cows&rdquo;&mdash;that is, cows that can be bought for silver.  I think that £22,000 should buy every silver cow, not alone in Kerry and Clare, but in every other part of the country.  I do not see where they can all come from. I should like the Minister to explain the difference between these two sums.</P>
    <P>We have been treated again to-night to allegations as to the non-payment of rates and rents.  I think I have dealt with that fairly fully already.  If there are people who say they are unable to pay, and who have not paid, they are saying that because it is true. We had a rather peculiar experience a few years ago at the Longford County Council.  A discussion arose there on the question of who had paid and who had not paid their rates and as to who was leading the campaign for the non-payment of rates.  Charges and counter-charges were made at the meeting.  The result was that the <Col N="656" /> Fianna Fáil members proposed that the list of the county councillors who had not paid the rates up to date should be published.  The Fine Gael members who were present opposed that strenuously, said that it would be unfair, and that they were sure that every county councillor who was able to meet his obligations had done so. Whatever the reactions may have been I do not know, but anyhow the Fianna Fáil councillors insisted on the list being published and they carried a motion to that effect.  Strange as it may seem, when the list was published it was found that every Fine Gael member of the council had his rates paid and that the only defaulters were three or four Fianna Fáil members.  I should like to know if these three or four Fianna Fáil members could be charged with leading a conspiracy not to pay rates.  I do not believe they could.  I believe these members did not pay because they were not able to pay, or that they had some particular reason for it.  That is the sort of stuff that goes on.  The Fianna Fáil members of the council firmly believed that the only members who would be found to be defaulters would be the Fine Gael members, but they counted without their host.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied, and I assure the House, that every farmer in County Longford, who is able to meet his liabilities, has not shirked them in any way and that if there is any conspiracy or any attempt to evade responsibilities, it can definitely be traced to an advice that was given by a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party, an able lawyer, and another Deputy of that Party, who came to Ballinamuck and told the people there&mdash;and goodness knows, they did not want any advice on this&mdash; that if the sheriff came, they were to tell him to go to a hot spot, that they were first to feed themselves, their wives and their families, then to pay their debts, and that if they had anything left, they could give it to the sheriff for either rent or rates.  If there is anybody in Longford not paying rates or rents they are only carrying out the policy of the Party for <Col N="657" /> whom they voted, the policy laid down to them by the Government Party.  As has been said already, the hens are coming home to roost.  You are experiencing the result of your own activities.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Government are not prepared to re-establish the Irish agriculturist, they should think very seriously of the question of making way for those who will.  I advise the Minister and the Front Bench and Deputy Donnelly to study the programme that was passed at our last Ard Fheis.  That is the only means by which the Irish agriculturist can be put on his feet.  There was more or less a sneer at the suggestion of a reconstruction loan for farmers.  There is no doubt about it, that if the present policy continues a reconstruction loan will be required to re-establish Irish farmers, but it will be required at a much less rate than 3 per cent., because the farmers will not be able to pay that rate.  For a certain period the Irish farmers will become a charge on the State.  They will have to get State aid of a very substantial kind because they will be broken.  They will be in the position that I mentioned of the two or three farmers who at the commencement of 1931 and 1932 had as much as £600 or £700 each in bank and who to-day have not a shilling, although they work hard and had no losses.  If we arrive at the stage at which the farmers' resources are all gone, then we will have a bankrupt State.  It was only because the Irish farmers were prosperous in 1921 and 1922 that we were able to make the national advance we did make.  If the Irish farmers are broken then every national effort will be broken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>We look forward with interest to the annual stocktaking of the agricultural industry, because we realise that the condition of the farmers determines the condition of the rest of the community.  The farmer may be called the barometer of conditions in the country, seeing that he is working the principal industry. It is not unfitting therefore that the House should devote a good deal of time to consideration of his position. At the outset I wish to compliment <Col N="658" /> the Minister on the full statement he made in his opening speech. Unlike some other Minister he spoke in a way that we understood and we could admire his candour.  I had the privilege of listening to his whole speech, and I think he gave an exceedingly candid and true statement of what is going on.  However, there are points in his policy with which I differ.  I want to make it clear that I am not in any way attacking the Minister personally.  I am attacking what he puts forward as his policy. It is also fitting, if I might borrow some words that the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health often used when he was Deputy O'Kelly, that we should have a heart to heart talk to see just where we stand with regard to our agricultural policy.  The Minister's speech must have been a great disappointment not alone to those in the Opposition who were looking forward to better times, but also to his own followers.  In effect he said that his policy had not succeeded.  Tobacco was a wash-out; the wet season had destroyed the chances of the wheat crop, and the sack of flour was 10/- per cwt. dearer here.  An examination of the sugar beet question showed that we were paying 2/2 per stone more for sugar than we ought to be paying.  We have not been concerned for many years with peat.  I know what heart-breaking work the getting of peat is in wet years, especially when it cannot be dried.  The Minister's statement has been a disappointment not only to his own followers but to those who wish he had the courage to abandon this foolish Government policy and to come to solid ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I always find fault with the Minister for is that he seems not to stand up for his job.  He allows his Department to be the shuttlecock of the rest of the Departments. When anything is wanted he yields at the expense of the farmers.  As far as one can see owing to his good nature he allows others to get away on him and does not stand up for the rights of his Department.  Last year when the coal-cattle pact was made, and we got an increased quota, all the bounties <Col N="659" /> were withdrawn with the exception of one maximum duty.  This year, when the duties are reduced, the bounties are all withdrawn.  As far as one can see the only definite policy left is to break the spirit of the farmers.  What are the hardworking farmers reduced to?  Deputy MacEoin illustrated what some of them are reduced to in his district. One might recall the words of the poem &ldquo;The Village Blacksmith&rdquo; when the farmer &ldquo;could look the whole world in the face, because he owed not any man.&rdquo; To-day these people are reduced to a daily clamour for some bounty or subsidy to try to keep the wolf from the door.  Men who knew their job and were not afraid to work are, because of the policy of the Government, reduced to that position.  The Minister's speech revealed another thing after all the experiments that have been tried. It was said earlier to-day that we were justified in making experiments. One can allow experiments to be carried on perhaps with warts on the hands or something like that, but when it comes to a vital disease we do not want any experiments.  When the very breath of life is concerned we want to be sure that there is something more than experiments.  After all the experiments the Minister tells us in effect that cattle and cattle products and live-stock products are the only things that will be the salvation of the country.</P>
    <P>We were all pleased to see during recent weeks that there has been an improvement in the trade balance. Examination revealed that the extra quota of cattle last year and cattle exports in the earlier part of this year helped to improve the trade balance. Yet the Minister says that the way to bring back prosperity is to restrict production to the available market at home and abroad.  In relation to cattle, that means kill the calves.  That advice may do down in the south, but I suggest to the Minister that he would have his back to the wall if he gave it in a northern county where more respect is paid to the calves.  We had a surplus of cattle a year or so ago, according to the Minister.  He told us <Col N="660" /> when we asked for a higher quota that we were really getting more than our share of the British market, that our quota was as high as it ought to be considering the claims of other countries, and that we should not get any more.  Yet in a short time the quota was changed and the British have taken our cattle steadily since.  What has been the effect?  I think we have been very shortsighted in regard to our live-stock policy.  For the last couple of years the British Government have given a bounty of 5/- per cwt. on beef. That has encouraged the farmers over there to feed more beef.  They are using more of the home-fed beef now than they have been doing for many years.  To-day those of us who attend fairs in the south, west or north find that there is a steady demand for forward stores and that they cannot be got.  Our cattle population is depleted. When we have a market, and the people at the other side want our stuff, our cattle population is depleted because of the Government's policy. They want our forward stores so that they will come into beef with the least possible delay and we have not got them.</P>
    <P>In our statistical returns we are told of the number of calves that have been slaughtered in the country.  That was not the only discouragement we had so far as our cattle trade is concerned. There were other things too, and all of them combined have reduced our cattle population below the point at which it was some years ago.  I hold that for many a year we could have carried 50 per cent.  more cattle and at the same time gone in for all the tillage that we wanted to do.  I have been connected with farming all my life.  I have in my own way studied most of the practical methods of agriculture, and I am fully convinced that our land has not been brought to its full pitch of production; that it could easily have carried 50 per cent. more cattle as well as enabling us to do all the tillage that the Minister wants us to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, gave a report of our trading in other markets.  We find from that report that only when there is a <Col N="661" /> handicap on an average of £4 a beast on the British buyer, can the foreign buyer operate.  In other words, we are selling our good polled angus and shorthorn beef to Germany and to the other countries at little more than the price of horse-flesh.  There is one bright spot, however, in the Minister's speech.  It is not very much.  The only thing is that it indicates that there is still hope when the Minister mentions his co-operation with Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the extension of the Warble Fly Order relating to cattle.  It is not very much, but it is a move in the right direction, a move which, I suggest, the Minister could work out in other directions in the case of the agricultural industry to our mutual benefit.  These islands of ours are close to one another.  Our agricultural policies are dovetailed into one another.  The more we can get to understand one another, and the more that we can co-operate for our mutual benefit the sooner will salvation come to the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>There was another thing to which the Minister referred and that was the reduction of the butchers' levy.  A good many butchers have asked me why the levy is on at all.  That brings us to the Act which the Minister administered last year, the one dealing with the minimum price for beef.  When that measure was going through a number of us told him that he was attempting the impossible so far as fixing minimum prices for beef sold in the market was concerned.  I think he has since found out that that is so.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the pig question.  Most of us went a long way with him in th Pigs and Bacon Act. We felt that we were making a move in the right direction in stabilising the price of fat pigs and pork.  I am afraid that our criticism of that measure will be unkind as far as the Pigs Marketing Board is concerned, at least as far as our experience of it in the northern counties goes.  One can not altogether blame the Minister for this.  Possibly, he took the best advice that he could get when constituting the Pigs Marketing Board, but the operations of the board, as far as they <Col N="662" /> have been apparent, could hardly be much worse than they have been. There is one aspect of this question that I would like to refer to although, I suppose, circumstances forced it on us.  It is this: that we started our scheme at the wrong time.  When this measure was in Committee I took a good deal of interest in it, and offered any suggestions that occurred to me as being useful.  There was one thing that I tried strongly to impress upon the Minister and it was that he should start the scheme not later than June or July.  Yet, for one reason or another, he walked into the same mistake as the authorities in Northern Ireland and delayed starting the scheme until the peak period in October.  I understand that the southern counties did not fare as badly as we did in the north, but certainly our markets were a scandal.</P>
    <P>No words of mine would be strong enough to describe the pitiable conditions in which our farmers were offering pigs during the months of October, November and December.  The Minister may say, and I suppose rightly, that we had a very big supply and should not have it.  But we were not warned not to feed pigs.  Our people are industrious and will try to earn the money they need to pay their way. We had pigs to sell, and what happened? At the start of the slump the quota was not nearly large enough to absorb all the pigs we had to sell.  I do not blame the Minister for that.  I blame the Pigs Marketing Board. What was the position, as far as we are concerned, in the Counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan?  Up to the year 1934 or so we had two very big firms of buyers, Sinclairs, of Belfast, and Biggars, of Derry, which got a big supply of pigs in our markets. Any market that Sinclair came into he undertook to clear it.  I have seen over 600 pigs on the Monaghan market, and every pig on it cleared.  He paid as much for the last pig as he did for the first.  When it came to dividing the quota these Northern firms, because of the effects of our Government's policy, were shut out of our Northern markets.</P>

      <P>Whatever was the cause of the shutting out does not affect the point I am going to make, and the Minister possibly will appreciate it when I make it.  Whatever the cause of their being shut out of our market there was no cognisance taken of the supply of pigs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish my point and the Minister can contradict, me then.  They took a very big supply of pigs out of our market.  The curers that were left were asked what did they produce in 1934 and their quota was related to what they handled in 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus extra quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that extra did not come anywhere near covering what the firms took out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total was the very same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>The result was we were left with our pigs in the Northern market.  These men could have handled them if their quota had been extended, but what happened?  The market was glutted with pigs.  There was no way of regulating the supply, and here were the poor creatures out with their pigs and no one to take them.  The curers were limited to a <Col N="664" /> certain number and they dared not take any more because the regulations did not permit them.  We tried to get busy.  The Minister and the Marketing Board did their best at the time. They tried to clear the surplus, but in what way?  They said, &ldquo;We will take your pigs and bring them to Waterford and other places and clear them out of the way.&rdquo;  They did do so, but they brought to the curers of the South a pig they did not want, and we know the tale that comes after that to-day.  Would it not have been much simpler if the Pigs Marketing Board had given an extra quota to these men, let them handle the pigs and market them where they could?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Northern curers refused to take more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>They did, because they had no export quota for them.  If they had got an export quota they could handle them, because there was a scarcity of pigs in Northern Ireland at that very time.  I know what I am talking about, because I was there. There was no difficulty in selling the pigs in Northern Ireland.  Instead of the pigs being handled where they could have been handled they were sent to the South to people who worked under a different system entirely, and half of the pigs have been lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement has been made already by an irresponsible Deputy, Deputy Dillon.  There was £50,000 worth of pigs bought and £60 worth of the bacon was condemned. Deputy Dillon told us that three-quarters of the pigs were lost, and now Deputy Haslett says half of them were lost.  Observe the exaggeration when the truth is that £60 worth of bacon out of £50,000 worth of pigs was condemned.  Surely the ordinary curer losses more than that every day in the week.  I am merely showing the exaggeration of these people.</P>

      <P>That was not the story we got back.  We had only the curers' word.  They said the thing was so bad that they would not take any more of our pigs dead.  &ldquo;We will not take any more of your pigs dead; we must <Col N="665" /> have them alive.&rdquo;  We sent them a consignment of live pigs, pigs never meant to travel and that were meant to meet a different trade altogether.</P>

      <P>We will see.  It is a far cry since Christmas.  If we only had the reports since Christmas from the curers to send them no more they were that bad.  The Minister tells us there was only £60 worth of bacon lost. What is happening to-day?  We have now the Pigs Marketing Board bringing this bacon out of the curing place and trying to get the northern men to sell it.  To-day we have three prices for pigs&mdash;the fixed prices published in the papers, the hypothetical price, and the actual price.  People do not know where they are so far as the price of pigs is concerned.  The Minister may feel sore on this point.  I am not urging anything personal against the Minister.  I am criticising the board from the position as I saw it.  If the Minister is inclined to take it as personal, I cannot help that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I know his implications. As far as we were concerned, on the <Col N="666" /> Pigs Marketing Board we had no northern curer, no one who was solely a curer of pork in the northern counties on the board.  We had a representative on the board who was half in and half out.  So far as we were concerned in our trade we never got a chance.  The Minister says the Ulster pig and the Ulster system of marketing must go.  The death sentence is pronounced without judge or jury.  It has to go unwept, unhonoured or unsung.  This is not new.  Someone possibly with a bee in his bonnet in the Department or someone with an axe to grind outside says that our system must go and the Minister echoes &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that he would need some Ulster grit and gristle to ask these people why and examine the matter on the spot.  He knows from experience the record of the northern counties so far as meeting their liabilities is concerned.  My own county led the way in the payment of annuities and rates and it was not through feeding bad pigs.  If we have not any representative on the board and our case is not properly put, it is no way to say it that it must go without a trial.  Certainly our pigs have no place in the same market that the southern pigs go to.  It is a different system altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the North our pigs are killed and marketed in a way that is acceptable and in a way that suits the Lancashire and Glasgow trade.  We have never any difficulty in selling them.  The Southern system is different.  The pigs are cured in a different way and by a different system altogether.  The Minister and his advisers would seem to think that the Northern people are all fools and that they are following up a system which should not be allowed to continue.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House in giving a dissertation on the merits or demerits of pigs, but I suggest that our people have been going on these lines and if the Minister's advisers are correct in what they say, then our curers have been paying more for worse pigs than is being paid in the South for good pigs.  That is the interesting thing about it.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="667" /> that it is worth examining what is being done in Northern Ireland.  There they have not done away with the Ulster pig.  They have allowed it to continue.  Still, they have allowed the large white pig to come in.  Both meet a different trade.  Both pigs are marketed and both inspected to meet the requirements of the British market. I suggest to the Minister that if our pigs are meeting the requirements of the British market that that is standard enough and that we should be allowed to continue until such time as it is found otherwise.  I can guarantee the Minister that, if at any time it is shown or proven to us that there is a better market open to us by changing to another breed of pigs, he will find that there will be not one bit of bother in changing over.</P>
    <P>Our pigs are intensively fed.  They are fed in twos, threes and fours to a great extent.  They come to maturity more quickly and give a quicker return than other pigs.  If we have to change &mdash;and I am not wedded to the Ulster pig more than any other variety&mdash;we will change.  I have been using the other too, and trying to do the best I can, but I can tell the Minister this that at any time at all that the market for the large white pig is shown to be better we will follow that market, and I assure the Minister we will not let any of our prejudices stand in the way. The Minister said that our system of marketing was altogether wrong.  He based that assertion on what he said was the fact, that it gave a man no chance when he came out of the market with a dead pig&mdash;that the producer could not bring that dead pig home again.  I have marketed pigs dead and alive and I never brought any of them back home yet.  I think that any practical farmer will agree that he is not going to bring in to a curing station live pigs a distance of 30 or 40 miles and take them back again.  Nobody takes in pigs dead or alive to a curing station to bring them back again.  That kind of thing has roots in the time when it was said that men took to shoeing pigs and cattle and driving them to one fair after another.  That kind of thing is not done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> As far as the Pig Acts are concerned the great thing is that the people will know ahead what price they will get and all that they need do is to get their pigs to the right weight, and there is no difficulty about carting them here or there or about bringing them back home again. The Minister is not the only one who has said that the farmyard killed pigs are not suitable for the market.  We heard that before.  Only last June I happened to be in Derry and through the courtesy of the owners I had the opportunity of going through Biggars' factory.  That firm put up a very elaborate plant.  They took in pigs alive and slaughtered, cured and disposed of them in that way.  They tried it but found when they went to the same market as they had been going with the farmyard slaughtered pigs that they were not getting the results.  They wondered why it was. They thought they were doing everything better than had been done under the former system.  They got experts and scientists over to direct them. They found however that for the trade they were doing they had been doing better and that it did not suit them to adopt the new system.  To-day they are back again to the method they used formerly. I therefore suggest to the Minister that this is a thing which should be examined in all fairness and in all coolness before the final judgment is passed.  These are facts that he can inquire into.  They are facts that he cannot get lightly over.  I can assure him that this firm in Derry, Messrs. Biggars, are not in the business for sentiment.  They are there to make their living and to make profits for themselves.</P>
    <P>A point to which Deputy Dillon referred immediately after the Minister spoke is an important one.  Deputy Dillon went to the kernel of the feeders' trouble as far as cattle and pigs are concerned.  That is the trouble about the meal mixture.  I do submit to the Minister that he can hardly expect us to get the same results from a mixture that is costing us 14/- a bag whereas the right price of the pure maize meal would be only 9/- a bag.  There in that alone we <Col N="669" /> are paying 5/- extra for a 2 cwt. bag of feeding stuff and getting less value. That is a thing that cannot go on indefinitely.  I suggest to the Minister that the meal mixture business should be reconsidered.  As to our system in the County Monaghan I do not suppose I sold one ton of corn in the last ten years.  I feed all the corn and other things produced on the land to live stock.</P>
    <P>It would benefit the pig feeders much more if they were allowed to turn their attention to taking full advantage of cheap food stuffs.  What the Government are doing is increasing the price of the feeding stuff that the farmer uses from 9/- to 14/- or 15/- a bag.  I warn them that that is a thing that cannot go on for the farmer cannot stand it.  It will tell and it is already telling against the prosperity of the country.  As long as that weight is put on the farmer, as long as he is handicapped to that extent, he will find that he cannot get the results and he cannot expect to continue producing pigs and cattle. These are some of the things that may sound unpleasant to the Minister, but I am giving the facts in all good faith as I found them.  I am a farmer and have been living all my life on the land.  I would like to see farmers and farming in a more prosperous condition than they are.  I would like to see the farmers of the country having a market for what they are producing on the land.</P>

      <P>This debate commenced to-day as a farmers' debate and it is likely to end as such.  I wish that the tone of the debate would be on the lines of the two speakers who have just finished.  I do not expect that we as a Government Party would be entirely free from criticism.  I am one of those who welcome constructive criticism such as we have got from Deputy Haslett and from Deputy MacEoin.  Deputy Haslett has complained that at the moment everything is done at the expense of the farmer. To a certain extent that is true because the whole basis of the country is agriculture.  However, the Deputy did not suggest how from the tillage point of view we are to improve the <Col N="670" /> position.  I am very glad the Deputy did not advocate what we heard from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to-day&mdash;that is, surrender on the money question&mdash; or what we heard from Deputy MacDermot, that the Minister ought to surrender.  If any Minister were to do that, after fighting three elections on that issue, he would get short shrift. The country gave its verdict on three occasions and there is no gainsaying that.</P>

      <P>One thing was said by Deputy MacEoin at the beginning of the speech which I was proud to hear him say.  He said the Minister was doing his best.  The Deputy referred to people who were well-to-do some years ago.  I take it he referred to the inflation period when some of these people had money.  He did not refer to the funding and wiping out of arrears in County Longford in respect of land annuities when we came into office.  He referred to the promises made by us and said we got elected on those promises.  I am sorry he did not tell the House what promises we had failed to fulfil.  Did he expect us to declare war in arms when the Opposition was doing everything it could to stab the Government in the back?  He said one thing which he might have left unsaid.  He said the Fianna Fáil clubs in County Longford were controlled by people on the dole. I can speak for the clubs in County Longford and neither the president nor the secretary of one club in that county is on the dole.  It would have been better if that had been left out. There were predictions that we would have several bankruptcies in that county.  There was also a prediction, when the Guarantee Fund Bill was going through, that the rates in Longford would be increased by 7/6 in the £ as a result.  The rate for the coming year has now been fixed and it shows a reduction of 2/3 in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is the mainstay of the country.  It represents from 70 per cent. to 75 per cent. of our wealth, but I did not hear one suggestion from <Col N="671" /> the Opposition as to what we should do with the agricultural industry in order to absorb the increased population. We heard from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney of all the people who are leaving Galway and Mayo but he had not a word to say about the 25,000 who left every year during the ten years that Cumann na nGaedheal were in office.  It will take a great effort on the part of this Government to absorb people at the rate of 25,000 a year. Those people are here now and we make no apology for saying that we stand for the right of every man and woman to earn their bread.  We had to bring in an Unemployment Assistance Act because one cannot start factories overnight.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was designed to tide us over that difficult period and we are getting rid of that as comfortably as we can without doing injustice to anybody.  At the time that Bill was brought in, every board of health was passing resolutions saying that they could not pay any more home help because they had an adverse balance at the bank.  They said it was up to the Government to come to their assistance and the Government did so.  They were condemned at the time by members of the Opposition.  Yet the people who condemned them put questions here regarding grievances under the Act.  While doing that, we did not lose sight of the social services of the country. The Opposition were ten years in office and they did nothing to assist the widows and orphans in that time. The people who told us, on these Votes, last year that we were cutting down the old age pensions now realise that instead of reducing them we increased them.  All that we have been able to do and yet have what looks like a favourable budget.</P>
    <P>I seldom trouble this House so far as speaking is concerned.  I have been here for three years, and any month the Dáil was sitting I heard bankruptcy predicted for the country in three months more.  There is as little sign of bankruptcy now as there was when we started&mdash;perhaps a lot less.  If we are to absorb our extra population into <Col N="672" /> useful employment we must, broadly speaking, make what we wear and grow what we eat.  How are we to do that?  That is the issue we have to face.  There is no use in saying that we can get stuff more cheaply from other countries.  We have to stand on our own legs, so far as this matter is concerned, and there is only one way to enable us to do that&mdash;that is, to preserve the home market for our people.  I hope we have heard the last about allowing other countries to dump their stuff in here.  We have had trade agreements, and in that regard criticism should proceed on the lines on which Deputy Haslett has dealt with this Estimate, and members of the Opposition should not always be harping on the free market.  We know what a free market would mean, and if we were to settle this big question with England to-morrow, you could shut down your factories.  What about your youth then?  A young man who is walking about for three months and who does not see any prospect of employment is driven into a revolutionary frame of mind.  That is what this Government has to face, and we do not shirk that issue.  We say that we will make available every opportunity to these young people to earn their bread.  We are starting factories. It was said that we would not get money to establish these factories on account of lack of stability in the country. Yet any capital issue that was floated with a decent prospectus was over-subscribed.  When certain social measures were being passed the whole House supported them, but when it came to voting the necessary money some members of the Opposition were not prepared to support the Vote.  It is easy to play to the gallery.  I hope that when Deputies stand up to criticise they will follow the example of Deputy Haslett and Deputy MacEoin and treat us to constructive criticism. That would be helpful to the country, and if we had that spirit of loyalty, we would not be in the predicament we are in.  When this Vote is put to the House I hope that no member will be so mean as to vote against it on the ground of &ldquo;surrendering to England.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, mixed farming gives more employment than any other class of farming.  We have men getting up here and talking about wheat who know no more about wheat than wheat knows about them.  I was reared on a tillage farm in a tillage district.  The people of that district tilled about 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. of their land because farmyard manure was available.  What happened the farmers who stuck to that 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of tillage?  They got smashed.  They had to change their system and go in for mixed farming. By mixed farming more employment is given all the year round.  The farmers are able to pay their men a living wage&mdash;which the farmers cannot do to-day.  The policy of the present Government has reduced the wages of the agricultural labourer by 2/- to 3/- a week in County Wexford.  His purchasing power would have been reduced by 3/- or 4/- a week, and that is a very serious matter if he is a man with a wife and two or three children. You will find he is much worse off to-day than before Fianna Fáil took office.  We heard from every platform before the 1932 election, &ldquo;We have a plan to solve the employment problem. We have a plan to help the farmers.&rdquo;  At a certain fair which I attended before the 1932 election there was a gentleman addressing a meeting there, speaking for Fianna Fáil, and he said, &ldquo;You farmers of this district are hard-working farmers.  After working hard all the year you are here to-day selling your cattle for 38/- per cwt. live weight.  Put us into power and we will find for you alternative markets.  You will not take less than 50/- per cwt. for your cattle if we are returned to power.&rdquo;  Before that day two years the Wexford farmer had no market for his cattle at any price. Those false promises were never fulfilled. The alternative market he got was the German market&mdash;the market which, before Fianna Fáil went into power, bought only horse flesh from this country.  When the British and Irish Governments had a dispute, and the Irish farmer had to pay £6 per head tariff on his cattle, there was an opening for the German.  The German <Col N="674" /> came in and bought our best cattle for the price of horse flesh.  That is what he is doing to-day.</P>
      <P>We will be told that there are alternative markets.  Where are those alternative markets?  Can any man produce stock and sell it at 22/- per cwt. live weight?  Can he stall-feed cattle if he has to sell them at that price?  He cannot.  Through the action of the British Government in giving to the British farmer a bounty of 5/- per cwt. on home-fed beef, the price of our store cattle increased by about £2 per head.  I was at a fair to-day in the Minister's native town, and it was more like a graveyard than a fair.  The men selling cattle there were selling spirits without licence.  The cattle were too weak to walk&mdash;through the policy of the Government.  Deputy Donnelly may laugh.  He knows as much about a bullock as a bullock does about him.  That is what is happening in Wexford to-day&mdash;the county which used to be so proud of having the best stock in the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it was a good county the day you were there too; you saw good men and true there that day.  Through the policy of the Government we have the cattle industry ruined; we have labour ruined; we have the businessmen ruined.  We had a Bill introduced in this House called the Pigs and Bacon Bill.  That Bill is going to kill the pig industry; in fact it has already killed it.  It is putting the people of the country into such a position that they do not know what the bacon curers want.  The Pigs and Bacon Board have got full control of the pig industry.  They want to do away with all open competition; they want to do away with the pig dealer; they want to do away with the open market.  They are advising the farmers to sell their pigs directly to the bacon curer.  The gentleman with the rule will come along, and after measuring an eighth of an inch here and an eighth of an inch there he will say that the pig is second, third or fourth grade.  When you had a market in England, the heavier the pig was <Col N="675" /> the more he was worth.  For our home market, the bacon curer wants the slow-thriving pig, which is unprofitable to the producer.  If this gentleman wants that class of pig it is only fair that he should pay for it.  He should grade the pigs according to quality, and grade them alive.  In many districts where the people have got a return of their pigs, dead weight, from the bacon curers, I find that the returns were not at all popular with them.  The sooner the Minister realises the necessity for putting the pig industry on a prosperous basis the sooner he will do away with this Pigs and Bacon Board.  It is a very unprofitable board.  It is going to kill the pig industry as sure as we are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great talk about the alternative markets, and the price of cattle.  Before Fianna Fáil went into power what would be the cost of marketing cattle in the British market?  Cattle from this country could be marketed in any British market at an overhead expense of £1 17s. 6d. per head.  Before the last coal-cattle agreement it took £7 17s. 6d. a head to market those cattle in the same market.  That is what brought the German to Dublin to buy cattle. It was the British tariff brought him here.  The sooner the British Government and the Free State Government see their way to finish the economic war the better it will be for the Irish people.  As the last speaker said, 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the population are living on the land, whether they be farmers or farm labourers.  If the farmer is not in a position to pay his labourers a living wage, you cannot have a happy country.  Some of those gentlemen will tell you that the farmer is able to pay if he wishes to do so.  But how can he pay and, in a depressed world, take £6 per head less for his cattle than either the farmer in Northern Ireland or the English farmer?  Then you have the sheep and <Col N="676" /> lamb industry.  You have the little spring lamb weighing from 20 to 30 lbs.  It costs 17/- to market that lamb in the British market.  There is a tariff of 10/- under this last settlement.  That means from 4½d. to 6d. per lb. on that lamb.  We hear a great deal of talk about the increase of live stock in England.  Irish stock always got preference in the English market, and the sooner the Minister and the Government realise that the better for the country.</P>
    <P>I do not object to growing wheat; in fact I encourage it, but any practical man knows that at the very least you must have four years' rotation. If you grow wheat you must follow with a green crop.  You must follow that green crop with a corn crop, and follow the corn crop with meadow. What is going to eat your roots and your hay if the bullock must go? They talk about the bullock as if he had the plague.  He has given more employment than a lot of those gentlemen who say &ldquo;We will grow wheat and give employment.&rdquo;  When the farmers first grew wheat in my time one acre gave more employment than 15 acres to-day.  Wheat was always sown in the autumn.  It was sown in small ridges, and trenched.  The land was first grubbed and shovelled.  One acre gave more employment then than 15 acres to-day.  Now it is sown with tractors and ploughs, cut with reapers and binders and threshed with steam. It gives only about three weeks' employment for the whole year.  For the remainder of the year what is going to happen to the men who are dependent on working on the land? We hear a lot of talk about beet growing. How can any farmer pay a labourer a living wage and grow beet at 37/6 per ton?</P>
