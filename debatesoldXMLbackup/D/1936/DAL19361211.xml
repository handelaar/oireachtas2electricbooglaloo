      <P>Before item No. 1 is reached, I should like if the President would say for what reason it has been found necessary to convene the Dáil with this haste.  A certain event took place in Great Britain yesterday and apparently because of that fact, the Dáil has had to meet to-day.  It is being asked to deal with legislation arising out of an event which took place in another country.  Might I suggest to the President, Sir, seeing that this event only took place yesterday, and that the whole atmosphere surrounding it is now involved in a kind of sensationalism, that he should consider the question of not asking the Dáil to deal with any legislation to-day; that instead he should give the people an opportunity of studying the position which has arisen so that we may consider the position dispassionately, and consider it more particularly from an Irish and not from a Commonwealth standpoint?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be obvious to everybody that the present situation cannot be allowed to remain as it is for any length of time.  If we take no action you are going to have an anomalous situation.  The Irish people will have an opportunity at any time of considering any fundamental questions that are involved here.  There is no question of rushing the Irish people at all in this matter.  Neither is there any question of rushing the House, but every Deputy will clearly understand that you are going to have a position here in this country&mdash;apart from any considerations anywhere else &mdash;which needs clearing up.  The purpose of bringing the Dáil together is <Col N="1231" /> to consider legislation, as contained in these proposals, for clearing up that situation.  I find it very difficult to think that the Deputy who has made that remark so naïvely, is quite as innocent as he would appear to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that, so far as this Legislature and this Government are concerned, they had nothing to do with the bringing about of this situation?  That situation was created elsewhere and by other people. Surely, even if we are to have a statement of the Government's intentions, we ought not to be asked to enact legislation, particularly when that legislation is likely to be legislation providing for the appointment of a successor to the abdicating King, without the people having an opportunity of knowing what precisely the Legislature is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as everybody knows, is not a question which is purely external to our law.  It is a matter that affects our law immediately and directly as well as indirectly. The Government has been informed that His Majesty King Edward VIII desires to relinquish the Throne and he has forwarded to me a signed and witnessed instrument of abdication. We will have, as I indicated, an anomalous legal situation here until that matter is cleared up. We would hold that, constitutionally and legally, King Edward VIII will continue to be King here until his abdication has been decided upon by Parliament.  I suggest it is not a satisfactory situation to allow that to continue.  Besides, if we are to remain associated at all with the States of the British Commonwealth, it is evident that common action of some kind, or rather concerted action, should be taken in the matter.  We have come in here as a Government with well defined objectives and with a definite, clearly understood policy by the people.  We assumed office under certain conditions. Those conditions impose certain responsibilities&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before we give a First Reading to this Bill, Sir, I want to put a few questions to the President of the Executive Council.  One: Is it the intention of the Executive Council, in these Bills, to sever the connection of this State with the Commonwealth of Nations?  The second question is: Has consideration been given by the Government as to whether the Bill severs or jeopardises our membership of the Commonwealth?  And, three, in connection with the second question, has there been consultation with all or any of the other States, members of the Commonwealth of Nations, as to the effect of the proposed legislation on our relations with them?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  My reply to these questions, is, first, that there is not in this Bill any proposition to sever our connection with the States of the British Commonwealth.  Article I of the Constitution remains untouched. <Col N="1233" /> The next is that what we propose to do in this is to bring the law and the Constitution into accord with the actual facts of the situation.  The actual facts will be reflected in the Constitution as it will be when these amendments have been effected.  Next: Have we consulted the other members of the Commonwealth on this particular matter?  I say that this is a matter that affects ourselves alone.  It is a purely internal matter and it has no connection whatever and no other State is interested in, or has a right to be interested in, what mechanism we have here for giving effect to the will of our own people and the will of our Parliament.  I can say, in general, however, that as far as Great Britain is concerned, a considerable time ago I indicated quite clearly that the new Constitution would be one in which there would be no reference whatever to the King&mdash;the King would not appear in our new Constitution&mdash; and that any relations that would exist between our State and Great Britain, so long as the people willed to have that connection, would be maintained by the fact of co-operation, and would be regularised, so far as that was concerned, by law.</P>
      <P>Now, that general indication that the King was to be removed from the Constitution was given a considerable time ago.  Of course, it was only indicated informally, and as a matter of courtesy because, again, they have no right to interfere in any way with what we may do in this particular matter.  However, as a matter of courtesy it was indicated, but there was no opportunity, in the present circumstances, to give any specific communication.  With regard to these Bills, there was a general desire expressed by the States of the British Commonwealth that there should be concerted action as quickly as possible.  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa are arranging for simultaneous action by means of assent to British legislation.  We, on our part, are not prepared to give any countenance to the idea that the British Parliament can in any way legislate for us.  If this thing has to be done, it has to be done by our</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> Parliament and our Parliament alone. At the same time, so long as there is any association at all, so long as we continue in association at all, it is obvious that we ought to do our part to facilitate other countries in dealing with this situation.  If not, clearly, the right thing for us to do is to go out; but so long as we do remain, it is clear that you would have either by goodwill to meet situations of this sort, or there would have to be some convention in advance with regard to the meeting of it.  In fact, there has been already&mdash;not in our time, but in the time of our predecessors&mdash;a sort of general convention, not that they would take simultaneous action of that kind, but it was implied that the question of succession was a matter in which nothing definite should be done unless all the States who were associated would co-operate in the doing of it.  That is why, in answer to the third question as to whether we have given any information of this, we have not had the opportunity of giving it formally, (and we would not do it informally) to the British&mdash;and we have not communicated the terms of this to any of the other States.  Time did not permit.  I say, however, that it is a matter concerning ourselves alone and therefore is a matter which is quite proper for us to determine here, and my reason for the summoning of the Dáil at this short notice was that this situation should be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this motion and the attitude of the Government is on all fours with their whole conduct and with their views upon Parliamentary institutions that no explanation should be given of this extraordinary guillotine motion.  It would not be quite in keeping with the President's and his Parliamentary Secretary's contempt for Parliament and Parliamentary institutions to attempt to give any explanation of this extraordinary guillotine motion. The President was present when the leader of the Labour Party demanded that the House should be told why this should be done.  The moving of this resolution is an insult to the House and to Parliamentary institutions. The lack of any explanation on the part of the mover of this resolution is, if possible, an addition to that insult.  We have had plenty of indications already from the Ministry and from the Government Benches of the value that they attach to Parliamentary institutions.  In various debates during the past 12 months, and on various occasions in this House, we had occasion to draw attention to the supreme contempt for these institutions that members&mdash;one member of the Ministry after another&mdash;has shown for Parliamentary institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had, of course, the usual lip service to Parliamentary democracy from the President, but we want more than lip service where Parliamentary democracy and Parliamentary institutions are concerned.  We want more than lip service&mdash;especially when we bear in mind the whole history of that Ministry and the whole history of that Party prior to their becoming a Ministry&mdash;before we can attach any credence to their protestations in favour of Parliamentary democracy. Here we are suddenly presented with a summons to Parliament, by telegram. It is quite possible that some members of the Dáil have got no invitation; I do not know whether that is so or not.  It was yesterday, some time about 7 o'clock, that I, who live in the City of Dublin, got the invitation. This morning by post I got <Col N="1239" /> these Bills.  How many of the Deputies living down the country saw these Bills before they came into this House?  How many of those Deputies, owing to the lateness of the summons to Parliament, will see those Bills before they are asked to vote on them?</P>
    <P>Is this merely a formal business? Does anybody think that the explanation given by the President, namely, the situation created by the abdication of His Majesty King Edward, is all that is involved in this Bill? Surely no pretence of that kind can be made?  If it were a question of introducing a Bill to meet that particular situation, a plain course was open to the President&mdash;to acknowledge or to give the ratification of this Parliament to the abdication.  Why was not that done in a simple Bill? Is it not the fact that he is trying to capitalise the present sensationalism that is in the country about this particular matter?  Is not the charge made by the leader of the Labour Party perfectly justified?  The President speaks about goodwill towards the members of the British Commonwealth. He speaks about the good relations that should be maintained, and, at a time like this, when they are suffering from the present crisis, he gives them this direct slap in the face. He may believe he is correct in doing that, or he may not.  It may be his policy, but let him not talk of goodwill in the same speech in which he does that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speak of democracy and at the same time make a nullity of Parliamentary institutions? Why not?  The President can see no difficulty in that.  He has never seen any difficulties in things of that kind. Again and again, when there was a <Col N="1240" /> proposition here in this House for the abolition of the Second Chamber the dangers were pointed out.  Here, in a single sitting of the Dáil, summoned by telegram, without any proper opportunity of weighing the consequences of these Bills, we are asked to pass fundamental alterations in the Constitution into law.  Is that the kind of guarantee that we thought we were getting from the President when he abolished the Second Chamber?  Are his promises&mdash;shall I say promises&mdash;are the misconceptions that he allowed us to be under&mdash;that is much more in keeping with his technique&mdash;to be honoured in that way?  Has he the same respect for democracy that he has for his promises, or for the way in which he misleads the people?</P>
      <P>He spoke about the Irish people being given an opportunity; he and other members of the Ministry have spoken recently about the Irish people being given a full opportunity to consider all these important Constitutional changes before they were passed into law.  The words are hardly uttered when we find them repudiated by the actions of the Government and the action of the President himself. What opportunity is there?  What opportunity have the Irish people had? The bulk of them do not know about what we are meeting to-day.  They know that we are meeting in connection with the crisis which has occurred in Great Britain; that is all they know. And in reality that is the least thing about which we are meeting.  Anybody reading these two Bills will wonder what connection they have with the crisis.  There may be some slight reference to the crisis, not in the Constitution Amendment Bill which we are asked to pass to-day, but in the Bill which we are asked to pass to-morrow.  But the great bulk of the people, Sir, have no knowledge whatsoever of what we are called together for here to-day.</P>

      <P>That is the President's and Deputy Donnelly's idea of Parliamentary democracy.  And because that is their idea of democracy we are asked to pass this motion. There is nothing in the history of that Party or of the Government which does not fully bear out Deputy Donnelly's boast and Deputy Donnelly's threat at this particular moment. &ldquo;We have a majority; the rights of the Irish people and the interests of the Irish people in this particular matter can go by the board.&rdquo;  There is one thing that would be really far more decent for the President to do, and that is to scrap Parliamentary institutions altogether.  We are presented with an amazing situation here.  I defy any ordinary Deputy to know what is the full purport of these Bills.  I defy anybody to know whether or not they put us outside the Commonwealth.  How are we to decide that?  The President said it was desirable to consult other members of the Commonwealth but there was not time.  Why was there not time? Because he determined there would not be time.  The President could have introduced an entirely different Bill. He is simply capitalising and using the unfortunate situation which has occurred in England, and the objectionable matter which has surrounded that discussion, in order to rush this Bill through.  If that is not so, why did he not introduce a simple Bill accepting the abdication?  It is quite obvious what he intends to do.  Under cover of that crisis he intends to introduce fundamental alterations in our Constitution, and possibly fundamental changes <Col N="1242" /> in our relations with the other Dominions.  He had not time to consult them! Why had he not time to consult them?  Because he took good care he would not have time to consult them.  Is not that the situation?  Is it purely a domestic matter?  Is that the contention?  Is it purely a domestic matter in which the other Dominions have no interest, even though they are committed to the view that a certain institution is the symbol of the free association of the members of the Commonwealth?  That was agreed on at conferences at which the other Dominions were present.  It is enshrined in the preamble to the Statue of Westminster that gives effect to the outcome of those conferences. Does the President say that what was solemnly agreed upon by the other Dominions, by the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, is of no concern to them&mdash;that he is fulfilling his obligations in that respect by acknowledging in the most extraordinary ungracious section the new Sovereign in England as a kind of Consul-General on our behalf so far as foreign nations are concerned, because that is what it comes to?  Does the President think that he is to remain in community with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Great Britain, when our Government have no interest in what these nations solemnly declare and what their whole policy makes clear is the view of the link that binds these nations together?  The President made no attempt to consult them but rushes this Bill through Parliament. Our people have no time to consider this legislation and the President had no time to consider what the views of the members of the Commonwealth are.  He told us he had communicated with Great Britain, whether by writing or word of mouth he was not quite sure, but apparently at least some kind of informal talk over a cigar and a cup of coffee took place. That was the only State of the Commonwealth that he consulted.  He did not tell us what were the reactions of that particular State to his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that the House is left in complete ignorance of the effect that these Bills will have on the interests <Col N="1243" /> of the Irish people; of the effect they will have on our status, and of the effect that they will have on our relations with the other States of the Commonwealth.  As far as I can judge he is cutting out what the other States rightly or wrongly regard as the symbol of their association in the Commonwealth. He deliberately puts that out of the Constitution.  He says that he brings it back in the other Bill.  So he says, but in what capacity?  As a kind of roving Consul-General.  That is the only capacity in which he has brought it back.  I would ask the House to look at the Bill.  If Deputies look at Clause 3 in the Second Bill they will see my point.  Is not the implication of that clause that we are outside the Commonwealth? Is the implication of that clause not this:&mdash;That there is an association known as the British Commonwealth of Nations which regard the King as the symbol of their continued co-operation?  These States are Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and South Africa.  That is, for the purpose of that clause, the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We do not belong to it.  We are merely in relation with it.  They are in relation to each other and form a Commonwealth, but we are only in relation to that group.  That is what the Bill that is suddenly thrown upon this House implies.  The President himself gave the country promise after promise that a Bill having these implications would not be put through this Dáil until the people had been consulted.  He spoke again and again on that matter and he promised at the Ard-Fheis and elsewhere, so far as words had any significance, that there would be a full debate on every detail of the Constitution before the Constitution would be put into law, and the most vital parts of the Constitution are being put into law without the people of this country being given an opportunity of considering what is being done.  The President some time ago implied at all events some respect for Parliamentary institutions. This motion before the House now is an insult to any Parliament. Does the Bill we are discussing to-day deal with the abdication of the King? <Col N="1244" /> Is there anything in the Bill we are discussing to-day dealing with the abdication of the King?  You may argue that there is something in to-morrow's Bill.  That is a question that can be argued, and I am not going to deal with that now.  It is quite obvious that the proclamation of the new King is going to take place before to-morrow's Bill becomes law here. Why then the haste?</P>
    <P>Is that the co-operation that the President is going to give?  He could have brought in a Bill here.  He could have got it through with very little trouble and with very little opposition. But what does he do?  He simply uses a scandal in order to get rid of some outstanding articles of agreement between ourselves and Great Britain. When dealing with the Oath Bill he used the argument subtly but not convincingly that the removal of the Oath was no breach of the Treaty.  Does the President hold that this Bill is not a breach of the Treaty, or does he not mind?  Yet there is to be no consideration of it by the Dáil&mdash;we have a couple of hours' consideration of a matter of the greatest importance.  The President said himself he was going to introduce this Constitution Bill in a couple of months' time.  Why not wait?  Why hurry with this thing now?  He said it was always in his mind to introduce legislation of this kind.  Why did he not wait until the time he had fixed upon?  Because of the present crisis. Again it is obvious, no matter what denial may come from his lips that he is utilising this crisis in order to put a piece of slick practice upon the House and upon the people of this country.  How else can it be read? The Bill is fraught with many consequences which I am not going to discuss now.  The precedent which is being set to-day is also fraught with consequences for the future.  It shows the sort of Government we can expect from any Constitution that comes from that body of men opposite.</P>
    <P>You can have anything you like in a written Constitution.  It is only the working of the Constitution that is going to count and we see how our Parliament can be expected to work. How can a Parliamentary system <Col N="1245" /> work as long as the Party opposite has a majority in this House?  They will take off their hats to Parliamentary control but they will steam-roll it as often as they can and without any excuse.  We have here a parody of Parliamentary practice and of a Parliamentary Constitution.  It is to snatch a mere Party advantage that the institutions of this country are being damaged.  I am not particularly interested in the repercussions this may have elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am now interested in the interests of the people of this country, in the good name of this country and in its Parliamentary institutions.  I believe that at all these things the President has to-day struck a very severe blow.  I am fully convinced that if he appreciated what he is doing he still would not hesitate to do it.  I do not imagine that he has ever had any belief in Parliamentary institutions or in majority rule unless the majority happens to be with him.  We may judge by his performances here to-day how much his professions come to.  I had occasion more than once to refer to the fact that we were all pleased when, as leader of the Opposition, the President assured us that he believed in Parliamentary democracy, but then all our hopes were dashed when he said: &ldquo;I always believed in it.&rdquo;  It is the same here. He believes in Parliamentary democracy just as he believed in it in 1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926.  He believes in it when he can hoodwink the people and rush legislation through this House to the detriment of the people and not to their advantage.  We are getting nothing in the furtherance of our material interests by what is happening to-day.</P>

The object of this No. 2 Bill, whether the Executive Council like it or not, whether they care to admit it or not, is to provide for the appointment of a successor to the abdicated King, and we are now being asked to appoint a King of Saorstát Eireann under a guillotine motion.</P>

      <P>It may be a matter of merriment for some, but I imagine there can be no real merriment in the Government Party on this procedure. When we listened to the speeches of denunciation made by that Party against the British King enshrined in the Treaty and the Constitution, some of us, at all events, never thought that we would have the experience of being asked to appoint a British King of Saorstát Eireann under a guillotine motion in the Parliament of Saorstát Eireann.  That is what we are being asked to do to-day.  Section 3 of this Bill&mdash;to which I do not want to refer at any length&mdash;definitely authorises the Executive Council to appoint a British King to do certain things for them, to carry out certain duties for them.  In case anybody should be in doubt as to which King is going to be appointed to carry out the duties, we are told in sub-section (2) of Section 3 of that Bill that&mdash;</P>
      <P>The King referred to in the foregoing sub-section of this section shall, for the purposes of that sub-section, be the person who, if His Majesty King Edward VIII had died on the 10th day of December, 1936, unmarried, would for the time being be his successor under the law of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>So that we are now being invited to presume the late King dead, and to appoint a successor under a guillotine motion.  It is because that seems to me to be a kind of tragic ridicule of the Irish Parliament, and because it seems to me to be a kind of tragic pantomime for the Irish people, that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> I protest against this Dáil being asked to pass this legislation at such short notice.</P>
    <P>We were asked yesterday by telegram to meet to-day at 3 o'clock to pass this Bill.  The British Government know perfectly well that the King they propose to appoint, in lieu of the King who has abdicated, cannot be made King in Great Britain in the normal course.  Certain abnormal legislation is necessary in order to provide for the appointment of his successor. We can understand these difficulties as they affect Great Britain. We can understand Great Britain's anxiety to regularise the position as it affects her.  But what is the need for the same anxiety and what is the need for the same haste on our part in appointing a successor to the abdicated King?  I cannot see it.  Nothing that the President has said so far justifies us in assuming that there is any real reason, so far as this country is concerned, for appointing a successor to the King who has abdicated.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to show justification for this panic meeting to-day, the President stated that it was necessary, in order to convenience the abdicated King, to meet and relieve him of the title of King of Saorstát Eireann which still reposes in him.  Can we not relieve him of that?  He has already indicated that he does not want to continue in that role.  But if the King still feels that a further sense of legislative tidiness is necessary, and that he ought to be relieved by a legislative Act here, can we not relieve him of that?  What is the need to go further and indicate in this Bill that we automatically deem the person who succeeds him in Great Britain to succeed him here?  What is the need for the haste?  People were only told last night, and others only told this morning, that the British King had abdicated, and within four or five hours of our people reading that in the newspapers, this Parliament is assembled here and asked to appoint a successor to that King under a guillotine motion. I think the haste is indecent, and that it is inexplicable.  I cannot for the life of me understand for what reason we are asked to carry out this thing in this manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> But apart from the haste, and apart from the fact that the Executive Council are now definitely appointing a King of Saorstát Eireann, there are other considerations to be adverted to in this matter.  It could always have been said for the Executive Council that when they came into office in 1932 they found a King in the Constitution; that their object all the time was to clip the wings of the King and to put him in proper perspective in relation to the Irish people and to the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann.  They could therefore always claim to be growing up nationally, so long as they were adjusting the King to Irish ideals and traditions.  But to-day that is not the position.  The person they object to, this person whose wings they wanted to clip then, has now voluntarily relinquished his objectionable role here.  He has indicated definitely that he is no longer going to function as the King of Saorstát Eireann in fact.  He has gone out.  But, instead of being glad at that sudden and welcome departure so far as Irish traditions are concerned, the Executive Council tumble over themselves calling the Dáil together by telegram &mdash; by two telegrams &mdash; and ask it to meet at less than 24 hours' notice to appoint a successor to the abdicated King.  Let us see what we are doing, and if we are going to do it, or if a majority of this House is going to do it, let Deputies do it with their eyes open.  The President apparently is going to swallow by this piece of legislation, not merely the King Britain appoints, but is going to swallow all the trappings associated with that monarchy.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of Succession the British monarch is obliged to take a certain Oath that is offensive to the religious susceptibilities of the Irish people.  It is far from my desire to raise any religious controversy but I feel bound, Sir, to protest in this House against the appointment of a King, who definitely, under the Oath which he takes displays bias and hatred towards the religion professed by the overwhelming majority of our people.  Fianna Fáil in passing this Bill to-day or to-morrow is appointing a successor to the abdicated British <Col N="1250" /> King.  Let it be perfectly clear that they are appointing one who would subscribe to this Oath:</P>
    <P>Provided always and it is hereby enacted that all and every person and persons who shall or may take or inherit the said Crown by virtue of the limitations of this present Act, and is, are, or shall be reconciled to or shall hold communion with the See or Church of Rome, or shall profess the Popish religion, or shall marry a Papist, shall be subject to such incapacities as in such case or cases are by the said recited Act provided, enacted and established.</P>
    <P>The King we are going to appoint under Section 3 of the Bill is going to take that Oath, an Oath under which he admits certain penalties will be enacted upon him and in respect to him if he holds any communion with the Church of Rome, or, if he professes the Popish religion or &mdash; and this is the distinctly offensive part &mdash; if he marries a Papist.  That is the King we are going to appoint under that section; the King we are going to appoint under the guillotine, and that is the Oath he is going to take.  What is the explanation of all the haste?  What is the explanation for all the speed to appoint a King under these conditions?  What is the need to appoint a King at all under existing circumstances?  The other King abdicated yesterday.  Have we not plenty of time to consider and to review the position in the light of that abdication?  The President talks about certain difficulties that may arise.  I cannot foresee these difficulties. The Dáil will not meet again until February, and no legislation is likely to be enacted in the meantime, the validity of which might be raised in a constitutional way.  The courts can function as usual.  The Legislature is not interfered with and the trade and the traffic of the country will run as usual.  What is the need for having this House convened at such short notice and asking it to pass a Bill in such objectionable terms as this Bill, a few hours after the people had learned that the British King had abdicated?  The haste is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>If the Party opposite had come to <Col N="1251" /> this House standing over Bill No. 2 to appoint a British King of Saorstát Eireann under the guillotine, I can imagine the President making a long speech and I can imagine the eloquence that would flow from the Front Benches of Fianna Fáil.  I can imagine even the last member of the Party insisting on pouring out indignation and scorn upon a proposal of the kind. But, here is the Executive Council constituted of the Fianna Fáil Party asking us to appoint a British King as King of Saorstát Eireann a few hours after the people had learned that the other King had abdicated.  I cannot understand the haste.  No case whatever for haste has been made.  A gullotine motion is normally objectionable. It can be justified if it is introduced in pursuit of a good progressive object, either national or social.  This is not a progressive object, nationally or socially.  This is not a progressive document, as far as Saorstát Eireann is concerned.  For the first time Saorstát Eireann is to appoint a British King to rule here.  That is the object of the Bill which the President has introduced.  No case has been made why the House should be muddled in discussing this matter.  No case has been made why the House should pass the Bill with such speed, and I hope the House will realise the gravity of what it is doing in No. 2 Bill by declining to act in the way suggested in the guillotine motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the words of the President that the introduction of these Bills by the Government was a mark of their desire to co-operate with the British Government and the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Even at this stage I appeal to him that he should to-day simply make effective the sentiments that were enshrined in these words.  If he will do that, I fancy he will secure complete co-operation from every member of the Dáil. If he goes beyond that, and attempts to carry, as suggested in the two Bills submitted to us, measures which are not all concerned with the immediate crisis in Great Britain, I think he will be acting contrary to the wishes <Col N="1252" /> of the whole Opposition, to the wishes of the Independents, and, I hope, the wishes of Labour Deputies.  To what extent he will be carrying out the wishes of the country neither he nor I can prophesy with regard to measures of this kind.  I wish to support quite strongly the attitude taken up by Deputy Norton in his first remarks to-day.  I hope in saying so I may get support in the attitude I am taking up&mdash;that we should confine ourselves entirely to such legislation as may be necessary to enable certain steps to be carried out, and that we should not go beyond that.  If we go beyond that I think we are doing what Deputy Norton fears, namely, making our own legislation dependent upon affairs in a neighbouring country.  As I understand the position, there is one thing on which urgency is necessary and for that one thing the British Parliament is meeting to-day and carrying out certain measures.  The King expressed his determination to abdicate and requested that steps should be taken as quickly as possible to make that abdication effective.  I understand the British Parliament are taking that measure at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we wish to co-operate with them we should certainly go the length that has been suggested, and should make the abdication effective as far as the Free State is concerned.  I contend that it is impossible to say from a cursory examination of one day, two days or three days whether the effect, direct or indirect, of the Bill is to make that abdication effective or not.  I do not profess to be a lawyer, but no one, not even a constitutional lawyer of the highest skill and experience would express an opinion on that question without full consideration.  He would hesitate to express an opinion except given ample time to investigate the matter and to give what is called a well-considered opinion.  What Bill No. 1 does is to profess to remove, in so far as legislation is concerned, the King entirely from the place he hitherto occupied in our Constitution, to remove him from being a member of the Oireachtas.  It takes away the necessity for him to accept measures and removes the King <i>in toto.</i><Col N="1253" /> from the pages of the Constitution. Does that beyond doubt remove the King from being King of Ireland? I suggest to the President that that is a question he could not answer at the moment and that it requires a great deal of investigation.  Under Section 7 of the Constitution we took over as the laws of this State all the laws that were effective at the time that the Constitution was passed. These laws included an Act of Settlement, the Act of Succession and such like laws.  Removing the King from his executive functions in connection with our legislative offices here does not, I contend &mdash; I doubt very much whether the President will be prepared to state it does &mdash; remove him from the position he occupies in Ireland under the Acts I have referred to and other Acts similar to them.  I suggest that it would require careful investigation to determine whether, by passing No. 1 Bill, we shall have done or shall not have done the one thing necessary to-day&mdash; namely to facilitate and validate the proposed abdication of the King.</P>
    <P>I am going to be very brief and I trust that brevity will be merely a mark of the extreme gravity I attach to our proceedings here to-day.  We are doing for this country something that is far and away graver, more far-reaching and more important for us than the acceptance or nonacceptance or the recognition or nonrecognition of a serious constitutional crisis in Great Britain.  I should protest strongly against the measures in themselves and oppose them as strongly as I could but, far and away beyond that protest, I should like to object to the way in which those measures are being introduced and put through this House.  That they will be put through, I fear is certain.  That they should be put through with the examination, criticism and discussion that can be given to them in an afternoon session of this House and a second session to-morrow is of the gravest consequence to our Parliamentary institution.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have here introduced, under the plea of urgency, <Col N="1254" /> revolutionary legislation &mdash; legislation which scatters to the winds all care or forethought for the wishes of the minority and gives them practically no opportunity of airing their views or putting forward their case.  That is done under the aegis of a crisis which is occurring in the neighbouring country of Great Britain.  These revolutionary proposals are put forward under this plea in a way in which it is impossible for them to be properly considered.  Some of these proposals might be put before this House at any time and, at any time, ample time would be required for their consideration and investigation. Yet, we are asked to go through to-day what I can only characterise as the farce of weighing up those measures in the few hours that remain when we shall have done debating the question as to whether we should examine them at all or not.  The examination of these measures in these circumstances is impossible.  No doubt, they have been examined by the Executive Council and their advisers.  No doubt, the Executive Council and their advisers think these measures will secure the objects which they desire to secure.  Whether they will or not time alone will determine and, I think, others than ourselves will have much to say.  I protest most strongly against these measures in themselves. I protest more strongly still against this attempt in what we still regard as a democratic institution to force them through in this way.  Lastly, I protest most strongly that these measures, of vital importance to ourselves, should be carried through in this way on the occasion of a grave constitutional crisis in a neighbouring country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On another occasion, I asked the President of the Executive Council not further to employ his admitted gift for bewildering and misleading our people.  I repeat that request to him now.  Grave matters are here for decision and disposal in the situation which has arisen from the abdication of His Majesty King Edward VIII.  No difficulties would have been placed in the way of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> President of the Executive Council had he come to this House with a request for such legislation as was necessary to regularise the Constitutional position consequent on that development. The Bills before us to-day are not introduced primarily for the purpose of regularising the Constitutional position arising out of that situation. These Bills are designed, under cover of an excuse to regularise the position arising out of the abdication, to make fundamental Constitutional changes for the whole people.  They are being rushed through the House on the representation that they must be got through if grave consequences are not to ensue, here and now, for the State-members of the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>If Parliament is to have behind it the moral authority of the people &mdash; and, in my submission, Parliament cannot govern if it has not behind it that authority&mdash;Parliament should be treated with respect.  Anyone who has persued these two Bills must say that no Parliament could possibly give them the consideration to which they are entitled if it is compelled to enact them in one day.  No possible difficulty could have arisen for the President of the Executive Council.  We can understand that if he had come here and merely moved for legislation to regularise the abdication, he might have been criticised by some of the irresponsible members of his own Party.  If he wanted to assuage their ruffled feelings, he could perfectly easily have introduced additional Bills to deal with the other matters referred to in these two Bills and given Dáil Eireann ample time to consider them.  He did not adopt that course, and his failure to adopt that course results, in my opinion, in two highly undesirable things which exclusively affect our country.  The first thing is that it indicates to the people that Deputy Donnelly's view of Parliamentary institutions is the correct view in the opinion of the Executive Council. That is, that Parliament is to be treated with contempt and that, so long as you have a majority in it, you are simply to use it for registering the <Col N="1256" /> opinions of the Government of the day without any regard whatever for the arguments of the Opposition or of Deputies who do not belong to the Government Party.  If that impression is finally made upon the minds of the Irish people, then Parliamentary Government here is going to end. Unless the belief is preserved amongst our people that the views of the minority are heard and listened to, rational men will ask themselves, &ldquo;What is the use of a talking-shop if nothing results from the talk but decisions without any reference to the representations that are made?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The essence of Parliamentary Government is that, though the minority has no right to claim a decisive voice in legislation, Parliament is the place where it can make its representations, and where the Government have a duty to consider those representations in so far as they can be considered by carrying out the general trend of Government policy at the same time.  There is growing up in the ranks of Fianna Fáil, and in the minds of some irresponsible sections of our community, the idea that this House is no more than a futile talking shop.  If that idea grows, the time cannot be far distant when the people will make an end of any futile institution, and if such a disaster should come upon this country, then the President of the Executive Council will have to bear no small share of the blame for having precipitated it, for no man has shown a greater contempt for Parliamentary institutions that he has.  In this instance, in my opinion, he crowns all his previous acts of disregarding the legitimate rights and demands of the Opposition who are co-operating in the maintenance of democratic institutions in this country.</P>
    <P>Now there is one other aspect of the present situation to which I wish briefly to refer.  A great country and a great people, who are neighbours of ours and with whom the President has often said it is in our best interest to maintain friendly relations, have been greatly afflicted by the grievous crisis that has come upon them.  Every nation in the world has extended to them an expression of respectful <Col N="1257" /> sympathy; every nation in the world has sought to lighten the burden of their dismay by any gesture of graceful friendship that the occasion would allow.  I feel that if the President of the Executive Council desired to give the signal on this occasion of his intention not only of dealing with the abdication problem, but of going on to deal with certain constitutional changes, that any regard for the feelings of a great and friendly neighbour would have suggested that we should have devoted ourselves to-day to the regularisation of the constitutional position, and to some signal of the fact that we feel deep sympathy with the trial and tribulation of the people of Great Britain.  I do not believe the national status would have suffered from such a gesture.  I believe it would have been in keeping with the attitude that this nation has consistently adopted when an old enemy or a new friend find themselves in deep tribulation.  That is not the occasion upon which to challenge either a contest or try to add to the burden which fortuitous circumstances already demand they must bear.</P>
    <P>In these Bills forms are adumbrated and terms employed which I cannot but feel will give deep and legitimate offence not to the politicians and constitutional lawyers of England but to the plain people of England, who, so far as I know, have nothing but feelings of the warmest regard not for the politicians or constitutional lawyers of this country but for the plain people of this country.  I bitterly regret that any political expediency in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party has induced them to make a gesture to-day which is open to the interpretation that I have indicated.  I feel that damage has been done, and I only hope that language may proceed from the President of the Executive Council before this business is disposed of which will at least indicate to our neighbours across the water that whatever crudities may be employed in the terms of these Bills, the warmest sympathy of the Irish people goes out to the English people in the distress in which they at present find themselves, and that there is no desire here amongst the ordinary <Col N="1258" /> people to gibe or to use one single word that would hurt or aggravate the already grave burden that our neighbours in this difficult situation have been called upon to bear.</P>
    <P>I urge the President of the Executive Council, in view of the representations that have been made from this side of the House, pointing out to him that adequate consideration cannot be given to the matters raised in these Bills in the time stipulated for in the Parliamentary Secretary's motion, that he should change his mind and take such steps as may be necessary to regularise the position arising out of the abdication, and postpone the detailed consideration of these measures to another day; or, in the alternative, to withdraw this motion and allow the House to deliberate on these Bills so long as the House deems it expedient to do so.</P>

      <P>The members of the Labour Party are quite willing to face up to their responsibilities in connection with the discussion of the serious constitutional issues involved in the Bills that have been so suddenly placed before the House.  I would appeal to the President, if he has any real respect for democratic principles or procedure, that he should amend the motion that is now under discussion. I know &mdash; I have reason to know &mdash;that Deputy Donnelly has no respect for the rights of the members of this House, other than the rights of the members of the Government Party and its back benchers whenever they are allowed to speak here.  I have a recollection of Deputy Donnelly advocating the scrapping of this House.  I believe, however, that the President does not hold views of that kind, but Deputy Donnelly, in the remarks which he made, conveyed his own views when he said, &ldquo;The people of this country will know all about this to-morrow.&rdquo;  I do not know how long the discussion on this motion is going to take, but at any rate it would appear that we are not going to have more than three or four hours at our disposal for the discussion on the Second Reading of No. 1 Bill.  I ask the President seriously: Is that a fair and a reasonable chance to give to the members of this House, all of whom have their individual <Col N="1259" /> responsibilities, apart from Party responsibilities, in grave matters of this kind?  I have no information at my disposal at the moment, other than the information that is in the possession of the ordinary members of the House.</P>
      <P>These Bills were handed to me this morning, and when I read them I saw in the situation, which has not been created by ourselves, but created by the British, a golden opportunity which, if calmly considered, might help the Government and people of this country to solve some of our big political problems.  For that reason, I am of the opinion that the time which it is proposed to allow for the consideration of these very important measures is not sufficient to enable the Government to get the views of the representatives of the people of the country.  I admit that it is quite possible, and that it generally happens, that all the back benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party will be told to sit down, or lie down, or go out when the Opposition Deputies are speaking, and that the President can represent their views.  I understand that he has put his views before his Party.  I am sure he has the support of his Party in this matter, but that is not quite sufficient to enable the President to get the considered views of the people through the Deputies who represent the people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know perfectly well that the law advisers of this Government have proved themselves in the past not to be infallible &mdash; and also the law advisers of the previous Government on other matters.  As I see the situation, it is this, that the law advisers have been called into sudden consultation with the President and other responsible members of the Cabinet.  They sat until or after midnight, burning midnight oil, and they expressed certain views to the President which were subsequently conveyed to his entire Cabinet.  On the strength of that, without getting the views of any other representatives of the people, or of Parties represented in this House, we are confronted with this guillotine motion and with two measures which we are asked to pass in such a short <Col N="1260" /> time.  I could see a reasonable case being made by the President for carrying on the Second Reading of Bill No. 1, or of Bill No. 2, if Deputies did not desire to speak on the subject matter.  I daresay Deputy Donnelly will make himself heard, if he is allowed to.</P>
    <P>If the President is going to stick to the terms of the guillotine motion, I hope he will silence his back-benchers so as to give the other representatives of the people a reasonable opportunity of putting their views forward.  The Second Reading of Bill No. 1 is to be concluded, according to the guillotine motion, by 8.30 p.m.  I hope the President will not persist in that, in the interests of democratic procedure, and I am sure he will not if he has still any real regard for democratic principles.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for this urgency to-day?  We know, of course, that the King who has abdicated has a representative in this country.  Large numbers of Deputies, together with the overwhelming majority of the people, have never seen that representative since he was appointed by the King on the advice of the Executive Council.  I live not far away from his official residence and I can say I never had the pleasure of looking at him since he was appointed Governor-General of this State.</P>

He will not do any harm if he is left there for another few hours, and, in the meantime, Deputies will be given an opportunity of considering the much more important issues that are bound to arise out of this legislation.  A colleague of mine mentions that he may be replaced by somebody who will be seen, who will make himself heard and who may offend or injure somebody.</P>

      <P>I will say that on matters of that kind I would be quite prepared to face up to my responsibilities when the issue comes before the House in a proper way.  I think the proper procedure now would be &mdash; allow the House to go on with the consideration of Bill No. 1 and, when that is concluded, to deal with Bill No. 2.  I suggest that we should adjourn for a period so as to give Deputies an opportunity of considering the consequences of any vote they may give here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are confronted with a situation which nobody could have foreseen when the last general election was held here, which nobody could have foreseen even a couple of months ago.  The President thinks he has looked at this thing from every possible angle.  He has been given certain advice by his advisers.  I think he will agree that there are others who are capable of giving advice and assistance.  I hoped this morning when I read these Bills, after they were handed to me by the postman, that this situation, which has been created by the British King and the British Cabinet, would enable the people of this country to copy the good example set by British political leaders on matters of importance affecting their own country.  I cannot help but admire British politicians of all Parties.  The leaders of the different Parties were called together behind the scenes to consult and collaborate <Col N="1262" /> and decide and agree &mdash; and they did agree &mdash; to take common action in matters affecting their own country. May I express the hope that the position created by the British King and the British Cabinet for us will lead to a similar happy event here?</P>
    <P>I think reasonable time should be given for the consideration of measures relating to big Constitutional issues of this kind, and I believe there should be an adjournment over the week-end. I think the President will agree, if his only anxiety is to get rid of the Governor-General, the King's representative, in a hurry, that we can put up with him for another week-end.  The President should give us an opportunity of considering the various aspects of the legislation with which the various Parties have been confronted on such very short notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>This guillotine motion appears to me to be absolutely indefensible.  If the President had brought forward measures that were merely designed for the technical rectification of an anomalous situation, he might have been justified in asking for a guillotine motion to be passed; or, still more likely, he might not have needed a guillotine motion at all.  But these measures go infinitely beyond the technical rectification of an anomalous situation and, indeed, I do not feel that they are an adequate rectification of a technically anomalous situation at all.  They go far beyond that.  They are measures of the utmost seriousness, that might be fraught with the most disastrous consequences to this country.  Deputy Norton has referred to one of them as being the appointment of a new King of this country.  I disagree with him. I can find no appointment of a new King for this country in what we may call Bill No. 2.  What do we find?  We find that it is proposed that the King, recognised by the other members of the Commonwealth as being the symbol of their co-operation and association, shall have delegated to him by our Executive Council, as and when it sees fit, certain duties.  There is no word of our recognising him as King in any capacity at all for external or <Col N="1263" /> internal purposes.  We just lay it down that we propose to use him in this particular way.</P>
      <P>The President, with that simplicity which so much endears him to all Parties in this House and all Parties in the country, has expressed amazement that anybody should suppose that these measures were at all the business of other members of the Commonwealth. He was affronted by Deputy Cosgrave's question as to whether the other Governments of the Commonwealth had been consulted.  What are we doing?  We are, in fact, breaking up certain articles of partnership; we are substituting a new conception of the partnership altogether, without any consultation with the other Parliaments. Even if we could &mdash; which we cannot &mdash; accept the President's proposition that this is a thing that is no business of the other partners, there is yet a third party with whom consultation would seem to be not only appropriate, but necessary, and that is the new King.  How do we know that this Bill is not going to subject this House and country to a resounding humiliation? How would it be if the new King said &mdash;as I would if I were in his shoes&mdash;&ldquo;Go and be damned; I am not interested in acting as your deputy for certain purposes while I am not recognised as the King of the country?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone is it true that this House has a right to be given ample time for reflection before passing measures that may very well result in the severance of this country from the Commonwealth of Nations, but the country has a right to be given time to consider them, to be given time to consider the consequences of such severance, if such severance comes. And I regard these measures, not alone as quite probably involving severance from the Commonwealth of Nations, with disastrous consequences to the people of this country, and, above all, to the poor people of this country, in whom the Labour Party might show a little more interest than they are showing to-day when talking this clap-trap about the appointment of new Kings, and referring, with indignation which I can hardly <Col N="1264" /> believe to be genuine, to such futile matters as the obsolete wording of a 17th century Act of Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still an Act but the wording, as every member of the Labour Party knows perfectly well, is not the wording that would be adopted by any British Parliament to-day, or would in any way correspond with the sentiments of the British people to-day.  Deputies know that the Coronation Oath was altered years ago so as to take out the matters that were offensive, and very naturally offensive, to Catholic sentiment.  As I was saying, these are measures that may affect the vital interests of this country and, above all, the poor of this country.  They are measures which may perpetuate the evil we all feel most strongly about, and that is the evil of Partition. I wonder if a single member of the Government Front Bench or the Government Party has given a thought to the likely reactions of our fellow-countrymen, our Protestant and Unionist fellow-countrymen, in Northern Ireland to the provisions of these Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, in the first place, to protest most emphatically against the method in which these particular Bills have been introduced. I think the method is entirely offensive and distasteful and the time selected, I think, is about as inopportune and as unhappy as could possibly be selected by anyone stimulated only with a desire to reopen enmities and feuds, and to give offence to a neighbouring people at a time when sympathy would come better from us. We have a particular piece of legislation flung at us here this evening not only to bring about very grave and far-reaching changes in the Constitution of this State, but to mutilate to a very great degree, if not entirely to smash, the Articles of Agreement between this country and Great Britain, and we have legislation of that type introduced here with a clear statement by the President of the Executive Council that he has given it no consideration&mdash;none whatsoever. <Col N="1265" /> He does not know its reactions; he does not know its consequences.  The State and the Parliament, and the people and the prosperity of the people mean so very little to that individual that, without consideration, he will gamble with their destinies and introduce this type of legislation. If he had time to consider it, and if his colleagues on the Executive had time to give ample consideration to that Bill, that would be absolutely inconsistent with the statement he made that he had no time to consult any other member of the Commonwealth. The two are incompatible. The reply given by the President to Deputy Cosgrave means that he takes his responsibilities so lightly and has such contempt for the destinies of the people that he introduces grave and far-reaching legislation of this type without any consideration or without knowing its immediate or remote effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I protest that it is not fair play to the country or to the Parliament.  We are a single Parliament now, and at the time we were created a single Chamber Parliament all kinds of frothy pledges were given from the Government Benches that it would be inconceivable that a Government would ever effect major Constitutional changes or do anything of a violent nature without giving the Parliament ample time to consider it. What happened?  Each Deputy of this House, or those who were reached, got two wires yesterday &mdash; (1) hold yourself in readiness and (2) the Dáil to meet to-morrow at 3 o'clock.  For what?  No information in the wire, good, bad, or indifferent; and by post this morning, a Bill goes out to each of the Deputies. Take any Deputy living at a distance. To get here by three o'clock, he would have to leave his home before the post arrives.  He gets here at 3 o'clock, and the first motion tabled from the Government Benches is that that Bill is to be through by 10.30 as a matter of extreme urgency; and the man who moves that motion at least shows his sense of shame by not attempting even to advance one word to explain why it must be through at 10.30, or to make any case for the motion.  The President, every one of his Ministers and <Col N="1266" /> every member of his Party sit there like so many dummies and not a voice is raised to justify this undemocratic action and violation of all the rights of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In theory, every Deputy of this House has equal rights; in theory, every Deputy of this House has equal responsibilities: and to bring them up here and deliberately machine the programme so that only a tiny minority of the Deputies would have any opportunity of expressing their views is certainly ensuring that the voice of the majority of the Deputies will not be heard.  It is exactly what many of us feared and most of us expected when the Second Chamber was abolished &mdash; that it was in order to give a free hand, not to a Party and not to an Executive, but to one man, because that Party and that Executive is treated normally as this House is being treated to-day.  Their opinions do not matter; their voices do not matter.  What one man, in a spirit of vindictiveness and recklessness, decides will be done, shall be done; and the only case made for the guillotine motion, and the only answer given when a request is made for arguments to be advanced, is for Deputy Donnelly to point to the members sitting around him on the Government Benches.  That is not an answer. Might is not always right.  Having the right to do a thing does not necessarily mean that you are right in doing it.</P>
    <P>This bit of legislation has been introduced and is being put through in a thoroughly despicable manner.  This bit of legislation, in the way in which it is being put through, has not the stamp of a statesman on it.  It has the stamp and the brand of a shifty politician &mdash; the political opportunist who takes advantage of the fact that one particular thing has got to be done urgently and who because of that will link to it the thing he has linked, because it is shady, because it will not stand the light of day, because it will not stand a proper examination, because the person who introduced it is not prepared to stand up and argue it and prove to the Dáil and to the country that he has given it ample consideration or, in fact, is aware of its possible consequences.  It is introduced in that shifty spirit, that we are told <Col N="1267" /> that there was a communication between us and the British Government and he does not remember whether it was telephonic, a direct verbal discussion or a written communication.  Is this country such an unimportant plaything to that individual that he can take a decision to-day on a particularly drastic matter and it is of such comparative unimportance that he does not remember how, why, where or by what means he discussed it with the other party concerned?  Is there any evidence of responsibility there?  Is there any evidence in that statement, or in that answer, of the capacity of the individual to pilot through this Dáil legislation of a far-reaching kind?  I suggest it is because of the very definite incapacity of the individual to pilot it through in a normal way that we have to put it through in this contemptible, abnormal way.</P>
    <P>About the gravest and most far-reaching thing that can be done is to undermine the foundations of any institution.  In the material sense, about the most reckless and dangerous thing that can be done is to interrupt or to invite the interruption of relations associating us with other trading communities.  The President, in conveying, if he did convey, an outline of his intentions to another country on which his Government admits we lean materially, treated it so lightly that he does not know how the communication was transmitted, and, presumably, does not know the reply he got.  If he does know the reply he got, surely this Parliament, this democratic Assembly, is entitled to demand that that information should be placed at the disposal of every Deputy in this House before he is asked to vote?  There are some, possibly a majority, who are prepared to vote to jeopardise the future of the country, like mutes in blinkers. There are others who are not prepared to do that, but both the majority and the minority, in facing up to a Bill of this gravity, are entitled to have all the information that is available. If the House has to violate all the principles governing a democratic Assembly, and if we are to put this type of legislation through, racing <Col N="1268" /> against the face of the clock, we are entitled to have a case made for that urgency.  Even if the case made were a weak case, or a bad case, it would not be so deliberately offensive as the way in which this guillotine motion was introduced to-day, without a word, without one line of explanation, without any attempt to say why the urgency, but merely &ldquo;I move,&rdquo; and the answer, &ldquo;Count heads.&rdquo;  It is a foretaste of what we all have before us.</P>
    <P>This legislation is to remove a symbol, a symbol that is powerless to interfere, from the Executive machinery and the Oireachtas of this country.  According to speeches made by the President and others, what the future holds in store for us is to replace that symbol by an individual who will have powers to throttle this Parliament.  As a Nationalist and a democrat, I would rather have any outer external symbol, absolutely powerless to interfere, absolutely powerless to obstruct, than to have anyone within the country with overriding powers over the legislation passed by a majority of the Parliament. I would have more respect for the legislation introduced in the name of a so-called republican Party who have fooled hundreds of thousands of electors to the cry that they were out for the establishment of a republic.  I would not agree with them if they did that, but at least I would respect it as an honest course and a bold course, but this zebra legislation, merely to act the part of the musk rat, to undermine, to nibble away, to destroy as much as can be destroyed with safety, and to replace it by nothing &mdash; that type of legislation will get the respect of nobody, neither the person standing strongly for the republic nor the person standing strongly for the Commonwealth.  They will join together in contempt not only for the legislation itself, but for the unmanly way in which it is introduced.</P>
    <P>We have an attempt made here to defy, as far as we can with safety, our colleagues within the Commonwealth of Nations, to give as much offence as we can, to drift as far apart as we can with safety, to cling with our left hand to the tow-rope, while <Col N="1269" /> we waggle the republican flag with the right.  If it is not a body to which it is good for us to belong, then we ought not to cling on to it in the contemptible position of a flea on the back of a dog, merely sucking sustenance from it, capable of giving a certain amount of irritation, but powerless to control the movements or to direct the animal itself, just going wherever the animal brings it for the little bit of sustenance.  If I happened to be associated with a household, I would prefer to be in that household as a member of the family, rather than be tolerated as a beggar at the back door.  The whole drift is that drift of servile attachment, and here we have it in these Bills that we are going to be in the position of being republicans in the Bog of Allen and Imperialists in Piccadilly; that we are going to say here at home: &ldquo;We have got rid of the King, we are a Republican Government now,&rdquo; but when there is anything to be got, when there is anything to be secured, when we are sending a Minister to any point of the compass, that Minister will be accredited by the King of England, and the President here at home is going to strut about as the bogus President of a sham republic, but when he goes abroad he is going to be fêted and greeted by the accredited Ministers accredited by the King.</P>
    <P>There is no half-way house between the Commonwealth association and separatism, meaning, isolation.  There is no half-way house.  If it is good to belong to the one, it is better then to belong to it in an open, honest way and get all that can be got out of it.  If it is bad to belong, we should go out completely.  Both under the previous Government and under this Government experience has proved that the symbol of association is absolutely powerless to interfere with the will of the Parliament here or with the will of the people here.  Experience under two Governments has shown that.  Why jeopardise the association, then, by bringing in this type of legislation and rushing it through before it can be examined? It is clear that this legislation is not and has not been introduced in the <Col N="1270" /> interests of the country, either present or future.  It is introduced in order to justify the doubtful political record of certain individuals; in order to justify an unfortunate past.  We can forget that past, and we can forget that past without damaging the future.  If we had to select and if we had a choice between having to keep the King somewhere within the Constitution, and it was a case of keeping him here at home inside the internal half of our Constitution, or having him in the external half of our Constitution, if we think really nationally, it would be far less harmful to have him in the internal half. If you have him here in the internal half, the people are close up against the position, and the people would see, from day to day, that all power is in fact in the hands of the people and of the people's Parliament, and that that particular symbol has no effect and is powerless to stand against or interfere with the people or the Parliament.  But selecting, as the President does, for selfish political reasons, to use him in the capacity abroad, nationally&mdash;that is the more harmful nationally; that carries potential danger; but the whole idea of the Bill is not designed for the progress of this country nationally or otherwise.  It is designed and introduced out of motives of political expediency.  It is introduced with discreditable haste.  It is introduced in a way that shows contempt for the people and contempt for their Parliament.  It is introduced by a President who tells us he has no time to consider it, and because he has no time to consider it he is going to ensure that the members of the Parliament have no time to consider it.</P>
    <P>Countries progress by thought, by study, by careful consideration given to every step taken by careful planning, and careful building.  Countries collapse and go to disaster by hasty, reckless, thoughtless legislation.  There can be neither good luck nor blessing on the type of legislation that is passed under the directorship that directs this Bill, or passed under the conditions in which we are asked to pass it here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; When I introduced this question this afternoon I indicated, I think quite clearly, the reason for the urgency.  I pointed out that there would be an anomalous situation existing here legally or rather that it might give rise to anomalous interpretations if when Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain and South Africa, when these members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, had ratified the abdication of King Edward VIII and provided for a successor we, while still belonging to that group of nations, that community of nations, continue to have a different King, particularly in view of the fact that there was a convention or an understanding that questions of succession were matters which required consultation and consent in regard to all the members.  I think that the continuance of that situation would be in every way harmful and I felt that it was my duty to advise the Executive Council and to summon Parliament to deal with it with all possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly a very abnormal situation has arisen.  No special provision has been made for it in advance.  It had to be dealt with.  We naturally had to consider how we should deal with it, being careful to maintain the status which we at present have, and in the general interests of our own nation. Some people, I take Deputy Norton as one, undoubtedly think that we should remedy this situation by declaring a Republic for the Twenty-Six Counties. I wonder whether that is precisely what he wanted to say or that we should just leave the position as it is and do nothing.  Whatever might be said for the solution of declaring a Republic for the Twenty-Six Counties, I certainly see no argument whatever in favour of leaving the situation in the form in which it would be if we did nothing.  The effect would not be in our favour I feel certain, but altogether against it.  We would have theorists and publicists trying to explain the situation in which we would be placed by some sort of pretence that the King who was appointed in Great Britain, or whose succession is provided for in Great Britain and in the other States, could somehow be regarded as King here. Australia, Canada and New Zealand had to face a situation somewhat similar to ours.  They recognised, too, <Col N="1277" /> that legislation would be necessary in order to maintain their status.  They did what they wanted to have done to regularise the situation by requesting and assenting to legislation to that effect in the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, that is the one thing that we certainly could not consent to and which I do not think any Government here would be willing to consent to.  We had, therefore, to regularise the situation.  I did not propose to use this situation to declare a republic for the Twenty-Six Counties. Our people at any time will have their opportunity for doing that.  We are putting no barrier of any sort in the way.  They can do it, if they want to do it, at any time.  I have indicated already that that is not our policy, that what we want ultimately is to see a republic for the whole 32 counties of Ireland.  I want to say also that, if I were proposing that we should declare either a Twenty-Six County republic or a 32 county republic an occasion like the present would not be the occasion to do it.  Neither is the present occasion one on which we should introduce a permanent Constitution here.  That is not proposed either.  We had intended at one time to continue constitutional amendments, just like those we have put through in the old Constitution, to bring the law in the Constitution into accord with the practice and the real position.  But when we had reached a certain position after some time I satisfied myself that this instrument, or whatever you like to call it, this fundamental law, which is scored through in several places, was no longer a fit instrument or a fit document to be regarded as the fundamental law, and I said the time has come when we ought now, with full freedom of action in regard to it, to consider what should be, in our own circumstances, our own Constitution.</P>
    <P>This Constitution came into being under very abnormal circumstances. Nobody denies that the Treaty was accepted here only under threat of force and, consequently, if there is any truth in the statements that are made so often from the opposite benches, if there is any truth in the <Col N="1278" /> liberty of action and freedom which nations enjoy whilst retaining membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we should be at liberty at least to make a Constitution that would accord with our own aspirations and our own desires and use the symbols which our people desire to see of their power, of their authority, in their own Constitution.</P>
    <P>I had to consider what advice I would give to my colleagues when dealing with this situation.  It was clearly necessary to bring in some Bill by which it would be regularised, or rather by which&mdash;I do not like to use the word regularise, because it would be regular, on our theory at any rate &mdash;but by which any ambiguity that it might be possible to import into the situation would be completely and thoroughly cleared up.  I asked myself: &ldquo;How can I do this?&rdquo; I would not ask the members of our Party, nor would I myself take the responsibility for the introduction of a measure such as the second one here unless it was made clear, side by side with it, what the true situation was.  I think that, instead of being regarded as some trick, or something of that sort, by some side-wind to secure some advantages, everybody who is sincerely and genuinely anxious about the constitutional situation here should welcome our bringing in the first measure and putting it side by side with the other so as to show clearly what the true position is.</P>
    <P>I have heard speeches this afternoon from the opposite benches and, as I listened to them, I said to myself: &ldquo;Surely these men, when talking about the freedom that was possessed, never believed that we had that freedom, or they could not talk like that.&rdquo;  If any excuse was required for putting through this measure quickly it could be found from listening to some of the speeches that were made from the opposite benches.  If it were possible to stir up irritation and to cause trouble it would be caused by these speeches.  It is not by the action of the Government that irritation between the people of this country and the people across the water would be caused, but by the false interpretation and misinterpretation of our attitude <Col N="1279" /> expressed in the speeches I listened to to-day.  In these two Bills we are giving expression to the position as it is to-day, in reality and in practice, and, if we are to take responsibility for Bill No. 2, we are not prepared to do so unless we have Bill No. 1, which makes quite clear what the functions of the King are for whom succession is provided.  We think this is the proper time.  In the time of King Edward VIII I had indicated quite clearly that we proposed in the new Constitution to make the position of the King roughly as it was in the old Constitution, with these deletions.  I said that informally, because I had hoped that these were matters of our own domestic concern, and that we are not obliged to get the consent of any of the other States in the British Commonwealth in order to do what we proposed to do.  Informally, and as a matter of courtesy, the British Government was informed, and as it was purely informal, naturally I did not keep records in the way Deputy O'Higgins tried to make it appear.  I was asked a question if that was done, and I gave my recollection of what was done.  I was then asked where were the documents, and so on.  The fact that informal notice or information was given was quite sufficient.  I hold that it was not necessary to give formal or informal notice of what we proposed to do.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is nothing but what the people of Ireland anticipated we would do, and what we said we would do ultimately with regard to this matter.  We are making clear what is the fundamental position in practice. It should be well known now, at any rate, that those who take responsibility for any action and decide the policy in regard to it, even where the King is the final instrument by which effect is given to it, are the Executive Council. They have in fact the authority, and as they have authority, it is right that it should be fully and formally expressed here on the face of the document, so that there may be no possible misrepresentation or misunderstanding. We propose to continue the King for the functions which he in fact directly exercise and for these only.  The <Col N="1280" /> functions provided for here are the only functions which in fact the King exercises. We are providing for the continuance of these functions on the advice and authority&mdash;as in the past and in the future&mdash;of the Executive Council.  We are clearing up the political constitutional situation.  We are making clear to everyone what the situation is, and we are removing fiction.  Whatever justification there might be in British history or British constitutional theory for such fiction, there is no justification in our case. It is very much better that our people should see clearly, with no fog and no mist of constitutional theory about it, what the situation is.  That is what is being proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is happening, then is that from the King are being taken away any functions internal, either direct or indirect, in the Administration of the Government and in the internal Executive of the country, and we are retaining the King for those purposes for which he was used hitherto.  He is being retained for these purposes because he is recognised as the symbol of this particular co-operation in the States of the Commonwealth.  If the Irish people do not wish to continue him for these purposes they can end that by legislation.  They can end the whole situation by law or limit the exercise of these powers by law. What is given in the Bill is permission to continue to use the same instrument.  Somebody objected to the word &ldquo;organ.&rdquo;  I think it is as good a word as organisation, for instance.  In the Constitution it is stated already that Executive authority will be given effect to by certain organisations, one being the King. If the King can be called an organisation I think he can be called much more properly a constitutional organ.  With regard to any impropriety in the expression, I think it is only people who are looking for difficulties will find them.  All this talk is in keeping with the attitude of people who talked about &ldquo;slaps in the face&rdquo; and that sort of thing.  We are administering no slap in the face to anybody, but we are asserting our right, and so we are doing this positive act of our own, <Col N="1281" /> and doing it under certain conditions, clearly setting down what those conditions are, so that there can be no misrepresentation.  That is the purpose of the two Bills.  That is why they are linked together.  I certainly &mdash;and this Government&mdash;would not take responsibility for one without the other.  There has been too much misrepresentation of the situation, and too much of an attempt by foreign jurists and theorists to try to give the situation here an interpretation for which we do not stand, and which we think in law is not warranted.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to go through the Bill in detail.  The effect simply is to eliminate the King from all those Articles of the Constitution which seem to give him functions here in our internal affairs.  We are taking these out.  The whole purpose is to do that.  In the case of the Governor-General, the appointment and executive powers provisions are being deleted. Whether the Governor-General is immediately ended by that is another question.  The amendment does not expressly state what functions in connection with legislation disappear. There are certain statutory functions which would require a consequential Act to clear up.  We do not propose to do that now.  We can let the situation rest at the moment.  If it should be necessary to bring in a consequential Act to deal with it, we are prepared to do so.  We have not the list made out of the places where the Governor-General has some functions. There does not appear to be any urgent need.  I feel confident, notwithstanding speeches that were made, whether by Deputy Norton, Deputy Thrift or Deputy O'Sullivan, that these speeches were clearly made by people who understand the situation, even though they tried to over-emphasise a particular aspect of it.  I shall leave it at that.  They thoroughly understand the situation.  Those who say we are doing something desperate at the moment, that we are taking a mean advantage of the Irish people, know that, in fact, we are making clear the position as it is.  I am quite confident also that if Deputy Norton reflects a little, on his suggestion with regard to leaving matters alone, he <Col N="1282" /> will be satisfied that they could not remain in that condition for any length of time.  Finally you would have to clear them up, and you would clear them up under much worse conditions than you can clear them up now.  You would have considerable irritation created by the misrepresentations that are bound to be made on matters of this sort by people who do not thoroughly understand them, who do not understand the need we have for them or the purpose behind them.  I am satisfied that to leave the situation to continue for a considerable time would be to do harm rather than to do good.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President is much concerned with the fog which has been generated about the constitutional position in this country.  The President is very anxious about the misrepresentations that may occur even in this debate with regard to what he is now seeking to do.  The President states that, if the situation was not cleared up in the particular way he proposes to clear it up, publicists and theorists might not judge correctly of a matter about which they have exhausted their ingenuity.  Does he imagine that, in a matter so vital to the future of this country, the speech we have just listened to is an adequate contribution even in the hurried circumstances in which he says he was forced to act?  I should have thought that the guillotine resolution, which we have just passed, would be a sufficient gag on the mouths of people speaking in this, the only deliberative Assembly in the country, without anything being added to it. The President is not content.  He indicates that he anticipates trouble, and, as a further gag to the mere limitation of time, he warns us that, if trouble does arise, we must bear the blame for it.  That is one of the well-known gags of the President.  We have had frequent examples of it&mdash;the falsehoods uttered in this House as arguments by the President to meet very definite statements and positions put to him, the falsehoods which he could not substantiate by example.  One is <Col N="1283" /> too recent to require any great analysis.  One is too notorious&mdash;the matter about Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;to require further attention in dealing with that discredited device.  We are asked to sit quietly lest, if there is trouble hereafter, we shall be blamed for causing it.  That is not what one would call a manly way to meet what appears to us to be a difficult situation. It is not the attitude we propose to adopt.  Irrespective of what the President, with his swarm of propagandists, may let loose in regard to our attitude on this matter, we are going to speak our minds freely within the limits of the time allowed.  All the old tirades, all the old allegations of lack of patriotism, the enumeration of people on this side with well-known traitors in Irish history&mdash;all this will not debar us from saying what we feel it to be our duty to say on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing, in addition, must emerge from the President's inadequate contribution. The President does not know whether his informal approaches to the British Government on this matter were conducted through correspondence or not.  He baulked at first at saying whether or not he would reveal the contents of the correspondence. Then he made a statement that he was not sure that there was any correspondence.  Are we to take it that the President of the Executive Council thought fit&mdash;possibly thought it his duty&mdash;to communicate, even in an informal way, to the British, that he intended to have a Constitution in which the King would play no part, and that, like Pontius Pilate on another occasion, he would not wait for an answer?  Does he not know whether or not the British have replied?  Did he not ask his representative in England whether he communicated that information in writing, and what were the terms of the writing? Did he not ask him if he had got any reply, and what the response was? This House is told that the President communicated informally with the British.  It has not been told whether there has been any reply.  It is told that the President does not know the medium through which that informal <Col N="1284" /> approach to the British was made. The House is to discuss this very vital matter under these circumstances. The President is concerned about misrepresentation and he is precise in stating that he was careful to maintain the status we at present have.  Many years' history is forgotten in that phrase or, at least, an attempt is made to have us forget many years of history.  Who first created the fog about the constitutional position in this country?  Who was guilty of serious misrepresentations about it? Nobody can put himself forward as a rival to the President in that regard. The President is now anxious about our present status and boasts that he was careful to maintain it.  His boast used to be that his driving effort in life was to abolish the status which had been got because it was, according to him, inferior.  We shall not take this as the opportunity to declare a republic; it would not be the proper time; the President might be accused of a trick.  He is sensitive about accusations about trickery.  He ought to be.  That sensitiveness ought to arise as much from looking into his own heart as from what anybody on these benches could say to him.</P>
    <P>We have got to discuss two measures in a limited time.  We must discuss them separately.  I am going to speak on the intern measure but, if I do, I speak with advertence to the context of the other Bill, which is to follow. I know that in the context of the other Bill there is, for the first time, acceptance of a particular British Act as being part of the law of this country. I know that the President has accepted a particular position with regard to the King&mdash;one that he fought against. I wonder if he considered, when he came to the intern measure, whether there is likely to be any repercussion on our extern affairs from it.  We cannot have the solace the President may take to himself over these two Bills.  We have no past clouded by error, nothing to fear, no vanity to solace and no attempt is necessary to justify ourselves in the background of history.  The President has justified all we did.  He can try to justify hereafter his own attitude with regard to the status he is now claiming that he has maintained in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> Is there an outside repercussion possible from this first measure? Surely there is.  What was the constitutional position that this country occupied up to about three years ago? We had conformed to what the ingenuity and wit of man in most countries in which civilised government obtains had devised.  We had conformed to their practices in regard to constitutional internal machinery.  We had various checks and balances.  We had a Legislature of a particular type. We had an Executive.  We had a judicial body standing outside, impartial and able to declare from time to time that certain things done here were unconstitutional.  We had a Constitution that was supposed to be fixed.  We arrive now at the situation in which we have one House to govern this country.  We have a Constitution which is so flexible that it can be moulded under a guillotine resolution in about five hours.  We will put our judges in the position that they must stand aside after this House has brought its collective wisdom to bear on a problem presented to it at 3 o'clock and wound up at 10.30. Where are the checks and the balances? Is it necessary, in order to get our situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> Great Britain clear, that all that machinery, well thought out and adapted by centuries of growth, conformed to by all the peoples of the world, should be thrown into the melting pot in order that we get our external association point made clear?</P>
    <P>Internally, we had a King operating through a representative.  The President is now anxious that the true situation should be made clear: that any function the King may have had in relation to our internal affairs should be removed.  Will the President some time or another say whether now, after five years' education in the interior of Government Buildings, he has definitely come to the conclusion that the King had no effective power in regard to our internal relations; that the slander to the contrary was sought to be perpetuated in history in this country, the slander used and used effectively against the President's predecessors, the slander that brought at least three good men to their graves? The President is now keen on maintaining <Col N="1286" /> the status that we have, and of making clear that there is no effective power, and neither was there. But there was then a symbol, and here we must turn to the external relations. We became a member of the community of nations.  Again, I think the President in the year 1931 expressed the view, when debating a Commonwealth report, that he wanted to be rid of that association.  He does not seem so whole-heartedly keen on getting rid of that association now.  He tells us to-day that he has still left in the Constitution Article 1:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it?  Will it remain so?  Can we, by an Act of this House, say that we will be a member, even a co-equal member, of that association?  Is there nobody else to have a say in that?  Are the things that we do here, even as the President talks in regard to our internal relations, going to preclude us from that association, or does the President think that that is not a matter worthy of consideration?  Will the President willingly take a gamble that we will be continued in that association no matter what we do in regard to our internal machinery, or is the President now sufficiently taught the lesson that we must live inside that association, not merely that we must live inside it, but that it is desirable that we should live inside it, and that there is no other association which gives us either the prestige or the economic sufficiency that living in that association can give us?</P>
    <P>We say that we are going to be a co-equal member in the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Would the President not wait for an answer to the informal representations made to the British Government to find whether they thought that that clause could be continued on their side, because there is a reaction in this not merely on Great Britain but on the other group of members forming the Commonwealth? It is an easy thing to say that in what we are doing to-night, in this first Bill, we are only handling internal <Col N="1287" /> machinery.  The President has no sense of responsibility if he says that and means it to be accepted as the truth.  The President knows well that our internal machinery, corresponding with the machinery operating in every part of the Commonwealth, may become a vital matter in the decision as to whether or not we are still to be members of that association.  Has that been considered?  Has the President weighed up what his Minister for Agriculture said here the other day that this country could stop exports of agricultural produce to Great Britain?  It can do that and do it at a price: a further decline in agricultural production, and that the 31 per cent. of the people employed on the land are to become unemployed.  Can this country cheerfully look forward to an extra 250,000 of our people being put out of employment?  Is there the risk, to put it no further than that, that one of the repercussions from this piece of internal machinery may be that the situation, so gloomily contemplated by the Minister for Agriculture, will be brought about?</P>
    <P>This country did achieve a particular status under the Treaty.  Despite the President's attempts to hide that particular instrument, the Treaty is still the foundation of this State, and breaches of that Treaty are serious matters.  It was argued when the Treaty did come into existence and when this country got a particular association with the other members of that Commonwealth, that our status was an inferior one.  One of the men who moulded the destinies of this country&mdash;the late Vice-President of this State, Kevin O'Higgins&mdash;did seize his opportunities, and despite the derision that was poured on it by the President and his supporters, he did get it made clear beyond all the writings of the theorists and the publicists, even beyond the cloud of misrepresentation and fog that the President tried to raise around the situation, that this country in its internal relations was as free as the freest republic that exists. We had certain symbols.  Those symbols were under our control.  Those people who were symbols moved at our behest.  Those people could not do <Col N="1288" /> anything without the advice of the Executive Council; those people, if they disobeyed the advice of the Executive Council, either went themselves or the institutions they represented went and were shattered.  But that whole situation was brought along in peace by co-operation, by friendly meetings and advances from time to time in spite of the great impatience amongst the patriots who wanted to get immediately into the open air and get the great freedom of republican institutions.  All that was brought along, and that association, then recognised to be valuable, and now recognised to be valuable, is being jeopardised.</P>
    <P>That situation was left to the President to handle and we now come to the point where we are said to be dealing with matters that concern ourselves alone.  That is promulgated in this House by a man who does not believe the words he utters.  We are told that there can be no reactions to this: that if there are any repercussions we do not mind, and so we are going to remove these symbols.  We are going to take away a piece of machinery that had to be put in operation by the will of the representatives of the Irish people and are going to make that machinery operate without certain intervening hands.  Again be it stated that the President admits the hands that might be interposed would have no power.  They came, they were put on the machinery at the request of the Executive Council; they operated entirely at the dictation of the Executive Council; there was no force and effect, no power, and the representative of the Crown, or the Crown itself, could not do anything in this country save what was demanded of it by the representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>The machinery was useful.  The machinery did not operate against the people of this country.  The people were as free as any people could be. But by keeping this piece of machinery, by retaining these symbols, we did retain two things.  Firstly, we kept faith with the people with whom we had made a Treaty; we kept our honour and we kept our word. <Col N="1289" /> Secondly, we kept touch with an association of immediate material advantage and we kept, beyond all that, under better conditions of permanency, a grouping of nations which certainly do still count and count tremendously in world matters.</P>
    <P>One of the important points is the question that looms so much on the horizon at the moment, the question of war or peace.  The President declared, on an occasion on which there seemed to be no immediate necessity for such a declaration, that this country would never permit&mdash;that no Government in this country would ever permit&mdash;the shores of this land to be used for an attack on the British.  Why was that statement made?  The President has certainly swung in more than ever he has done before into the defence machinery of the old United Kingdom, the group of islands that used to form the United Kingdom.  Why has he done so?  Does the President think that the doing of this is likely to have a more advantageous effect than keeping the Governor-General or having Ministers appointed by the Crown or having Bills signed by the Governor-General or having the executive authority vested in the King?  Does the President think there is no danger in these latter phrases, knowing himself what the phrases mean, and is he prepared to exchange symbols that were of no disadvantage to the people for definite commitments likely to be very dangerous if war should break out?</P>
    <P>Supposing this machinery does operate and that we have some sort of an unsettled condition maintained for a period of years as between ourselves and the community across the water.  Supposing even that we do succeed in winning through after some years of further sacrifice, some years of further economic hardship, what is to replace what is now being removed? Is it intended that there shall be always in this State a Government of a Single House, that there is going to be no check either by way of judges or any other revising chamber or any other body or group of people or any individual?  Is there to be nothing to coerce or to restrain from time to time <Col N="1290" /> the majority view of one Single Chamber?  Is that what the Government of this country is intended to be? What commitments may we have to enter into to remedy the situation, a good situation as it existed with the British people?  Are we to have any process of bargaining?  Is there any idea of what the bargains likely to be proposed may be?  Has the President even waited to get any account of these things?  Does the President feel that that measure, phrased as it is at the moment, and run in conjunction with the one that comes to-morrow, is going to leave feelings as between this country and our neighbours as they were before?  If he thinks there is going to be any greater friendliness, will he tell us why it will emerge, and if he thinks there is going to be any possibility or certainty of trouble, will he tell us what measures he has in mind to mitigate even the temporary hardships that will be brought on the people until this is as fully accepted as the Treaty was?</P>
    <P>We have, to use the President's own words, abandoned the old method of co-operation.  We have abandoned the idea of consultation.  We are rushing into an emergency and we are now engineering a very definite constitutional change.  As far as the President's words to-night are concerned, he has not brought this to the notice of the House, that he has considered the reaction of that on the Treaty. He has not let this country know what the British said, if anything, about his proposals.  The House is to be asked, subject to a closing-up debate at 10.30, to accept these vital changes and we are not told if there is any trouble apprehended.  The President has an easy passage in this, or is the President taking up the attitude that, no matter what may come, he is going ahead?</P>
    <P>Even at the risk of having the accusation I referred to previously levelled at me, I consider that the accumulation of those changes is a distinct breach of the Treaty.  It is a distinct breach of the constitutional position we held.  I cannot see that we have any great expectation of remaining with Article 1 of the Constitution effectively in force.  I doubt if we will hereafter be a co-equal member of <Col N="1291" /> the particular community of nations. I know the President has on other occasions looked to the seriousness of that issue.  I know he asked questions as to whether the declaration of a republic here would be regarded as so hostile an act that aggressive military action would be taken against us.  On that occasion he appeared to be prepared to sacrifice the economic advantages of being a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Is he making this move now in disregard of his previous fears, or has he quelled his fears, or has he got some statement from the British which enables him, with a clear conscience as to the future, to present this for acceptance to the Irish people?</P>
    <P>One might talk of the time at which this is being done.  The President is concerned to find he is accused of a trick.  Whether it be trickery or not, this undoubtedly is an exceptionally serious change in the constitutional position here and by reaction a very definite attempt upon our position in the Commonwealth of Nations.  It is being introduced at a particularly delicate time.  The occasion that gave rise to it is one that has caused great anxiety to the people in Great Britain, an anxiety that was not confined to them but has spread beyond those islands and definitely spread to the people in Australia and New Zealand.  It appears to have affected quite deeply too the people of Canada and South Africa.  And at a time when they are so affected by a particular incident, which could have been met by a single clause measure here, the President decides it is a time to bring about sweeping constitutional changes.  It might have been more tactfully done.  A better opportunity certainly could have been chosen.  And that is the repercussion as far as these people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The President has communicated his fears that constitutional changes effected here might be regarded by the British as so hostile an act that they would move troops against us. I do not know if he did believe that, but he professed to believe it.  In those days he was concerned also as to whether or not there would be any <Col N="1292" /> economic changes to the detriment of this country.  The time he chooses to make these changes is not merely a time, as I say, heavy with anxiety because of a particular unfortunate event for the peoples with whom we have no immediate family sympathy, but a time when our people are flying in more thousands than ever before to the country most concerned with this matter, a time when our economic situation was never lower, a time when any man with a little discretion would have waited, would have let the awkward moment pass, and would then have come forward with better and more adequate provision than the President has indicated here in this case, and made his clear statement that because of changes that occurred, because of a growth of status, because of the Statute of Westminister, because of all that happened in the past 15 years, the moment had come for certain sweeping changes.  This House is being asked, in very awkward circumstances, to make this choice, and we are being asked to do it under conditions of limited debate and without the President's giving to this House any adequate presentation of what is likely to result from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we may presume, from the silence on the Labour Benches and also the silence on the Independent Benches, that the real reason Deputies are so shy about speaking on this Bill is that they are quite unable to understand it.  I entirely sympathise with that point of view because, while I do not entirely fail to understand this Bill, I very nearly fail to understand it.  I think it was Deputy Davin who, earlier in to-day's proceedings, drew attention to the defects that existed in the Bill as drafted and as it came before the House, and Deputy Professor Thrift, following him, said that it would take a constitutional lawyer of vast experience to expound, or even to realise, the implications of the Bill we are discussing. I do not profess to be an expert in constitutional law, but I have had some ten years' experience of the matters dealt with in this Bill. I attended at three of the Imperial Conferences, and during these ten years I had the privilege of assisting <Col N="1293" /> at most of the work that was done in connection with the constitutional changes wrought by the last Government. I can, therefore, say that I know enough constitutional law to know how little constitutional law I know.  I can, therefore, also say this, that it is almost impossible for anyone in this country, with even a good knowledge of constitutional law, to know what the legal and constitutional repercussions and effects of this Bill are going to be on our internal and external relations.</P>
      <P>This Bill creates a political monstrosity, the like of which is unknown to political legal theory, such a monstrosity as exists nowhere in any polity in the world.  I listened to the President earlier in the afternoon when he said, fairly categorically, that it was not the intention of the Government, by means of these two Bills which the House has to discuss to-day and to-morrow, to jeopardise our position in the British Commonwealth of Nations. It may be that those who think that the vital interests of this country depend on the maintenance of our relations with the British Commonwealth of Nations will get some little comfort from that assertion, but I very much fear that, when these two Bills become law and when the consequences of these two Bills become plainly to be observed in their operation, such comfort as people may now take to themselves from that declaration of the President will be found to have been misplaced and to be without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I failed to follow the President in his opening speech on the Second Reading of this Bill.  My mind was in a sufficient whirl trying to find out what was the effect of its provisions on our internal and external relations, but when the President proceeded to give as his reason for bringing in this particular Bill amending our Constitution, that the abdication of King Edward VIII required it, that argument of the President completely capsized my intellect.  I failed to see any possible connection between the abdication of the King and the provisions of this Bill purporting to take out the references to the King in the Constitution. The President said it was <Col N="1294" /> necessary in order to give expression to the position as it exists to-da he had said &ldquo;to give expression to the position as it existed in 1931,&rdquo; his statement might have been correct. The statement bears the implication, whether he intended such an implication to be given to it or not, that the constitutional advances made by his predecessors in the ten year period from 1922 to 1932 were his constitutional advances and his work.  The implication of his phrase was that the position as it exists to-day was the work of the present Government. Since 1932, when the present Government took up office, they have not done one single thing, achieved one single purpose which in the smallest degree advanced our constitutional liberties and rights under the existing constitutional position in the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill seeks to show to the Irish people that the King had no functions or powers, that the insertion of his name in the original Constitution rather implied that he had such functions and powers, but that by reason of something that was done he now has no powers or functions&mdash;all that was achieved by the late Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan. Not a single thing, not one scrap of advance was made in that particular connection, nor can it even be claimed that it was made&mdash;nor can even a false claim be put forward for the present Government&mdash;that they made a single advance or achieved any victory for this country on the constitutional front in connection with the functions of the King.  If it is possible for the present Government to introduce this Bill to-day, it is due to the efforts of the late Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan.  The very fact that the Constitution under which we are functioning, the Constitution which was perfected by the efforts of the last Government, gives to the present Government the power to destroy the Constitution, the power legally to declare a republic, is the best testimonial that could be given to the success that attended the efforts of the late Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan in 1926, 1929 and 1930.</P>
    <P>The President, if he considers this <Col N="1295" /> Bill as a victory for the Irish people, or as a victory for his Party or for his Government, is reaping the fruits of what was sown by the late Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan. He is building on the foundations they laid, and his actions are only possible because of their efforts.  But what is he doing, in fact, in this Bill and in its corollary, the Bill we are going to deal with to-morrow?  He is creating what I have called a political monstrosity.</P>
    <P>We find that if this Bill becomes law in the form in which it stands at the present moment&mdash;and in that form it must become law having regard to the closure motion which we have passed already&mdash;there will be no head of this State in this country for internal affairs.  It is said by the President that we must get rid of the King from the Constitution, that he must no longer act in the symbolic capacity in which he did act in internal affairs, entirely on the advice of the Executive Council as a piece of harmless machinery.  It is said that that must be got rid of but he is to continue to act as head of our State for external purposes.  That is the provision in the second Bill so that we are to have this extraordinary and ludicrous position&mdash;a state of affairs which will make us the laughing stock of international jurists throughout the world&mdash;that for one purpose we have no head of this State and for another purpose we have a foreign King as the head of our State.  What sort of State is that at all?  What sort of political monstrosity is it that we are creating by this Bill?  Under Article 51 of the Constitution, the executive authority in the Irish Free State was declared to be vested in the King, but it was to be exercised in accordance with the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the exercise of the executive authority in the case of the Dominion of Canada.</P>
    <P>The work of the last Government, particularly that of the late Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan was directed in 1926, 1929 and 1930&mdash;and in 1930 complete victory was achieved&mdash;<Col N="1296" /> to make it clearly apparent that that meant, as it was always understood to mean, and as Michael Collins and other persons who asked the Irish people to accept the Treaty said it meant, that the real authority of the people in this country rests, and would rest under the Treaty and under the Constitution that they would give to the people, in the representatives of the people and in the Government elected by the people and in nobody else.  That was the position achieved and solemnly declared in the findings of the Imperial Conferences of 1926, 1929 and 1930.  The fruits of it the present Government are reaping and are taking very good care to reap.  The position under that Article was, until to-day, that the executive authority of the Irish people was exercised by the Government elected by the Irish people, in the Parliament responsible to, and elected by, the Irish people.  The King was merely a symbolic head of the State and as such symbolic head of the State he had no power, either nationally in our internal affairs or internationally in our external affairs. That was the position which had been achieved by the work of the late Kevin O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan. They worked on the internal front and on the external front.  It was realised, in order that our status should be sufficiently recognised abroad, and in order that not merely should our own people recognise it when we told them that they had that power, that it was necessary for the establishment of our status, for our national pride, that our complete freedom should be recognised nationally and internationally.  The recognition of our freedom, our complete and absolute independence as a sovereign State was conceded internationally in Geneva by the declaration of the British Foreign Minister in 1929 when Deputy McGilligan signed the optional clause of the Permanent Court of the Hague.  So that internationally and nationally complete independence was secured for this country.  Not merely was it secured in the Commonwealth but recognition was secured for the country from international jurists. <Col N="1297" /> What is the position which the Government have taken up now?  We have this extraordinary state of affairs, that half a head of a State represents us in our most important manifestations of sovereignty.  The test by which sovereignty is determined by international law, the test by which our status in external affairs is determined, is how we operate in international affairs, in our external relations with other countries, how we conclude treaties and how we carry on association with foreign countries.  Up to this we had done so through our Government and through our Minister for External Affairs, acting occasionally, but not always, through the symbol of the King.  He was the symbol of our country, merely a symbolic figure acting on the advice of the Executive Council in international affairs and acting on the advice of the Executive Council in national affairs, with no shred of authority and no power.</P>
    <P>What do we find now?  What problem is presented to international jurists now by this Bill?  Into what category are we going to be put as a State in international law?  There is no niche that I know of in international law where this State can fit in, with this monstrosity, this half head of the State acting for us sometimes and not acting for us at other times.  We had it affirmed, in the most solemn way we could, in the Statue of Westminister passed by the British Parliament, that the Crown in its relation to this country, as a member of the association known as the British Commonwealth of Nations, was the symbol of our freedom, the symbol of our free association in a group of States each of which was sovereign and independent.  We had that solemnly set forth in as solemn words as could be conceived by a draftsman.  That was what the Crown stood for and it has stood for nothing else.  It stood as the symbol of our freedom, our free association.  That is now taken away by these Bills which are recommended to the Dáil by the President to-day. This half Crown that we are asked to take on as the symbol of this country, as the head of our State in international affairs, apparently was not deemed of sufficient dignity to be the <Col N="1298" /> symbol of our freedom and of our free association in the Commonwealth of Nations.  It is now called the symbol of our co-operation.  The Crown was never the symbol of our co-operation in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It is solemnly stated in the Bill with which we shall have to deal to-morrow, and which is a corollary to the present Bill, that &ldquo;so long as the King recognised by those nations as the symbol of their co-operation continues to act on behalf of each of those nations,&rdquo; then he is to continue to act on behalf of this nation. Instead of having a symbol which we had reduced to the symbol of our freedom, a symbol which could not act except on the advice of the representatives of the Irish people and in accordance with every wish and, in every detail, in accordance with the wishes of the Irish people, that is swept away by this Bill which we are asked to pass, and some new principle is substituted, which is called the symbol of co-operation. I do not know what that means.  The Crown was never the symbol of our co-operation. There was a principle of consultation and co-operation, but that was not the symbol of our co-operation.  We did not express our co-operation in this community of nations, this League of Nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;we did not express that principle of co-operation and consultation through the medium of the Crown.  We substituted that principle of consultation and co-operation for the control of the Crown in the Imperial Parliament, and it was one of the achievements at the Imperial Conferences of 1926, 1929 and 1030, that the control of the Crown, through the Dominions Office, through the advice of British Ministers was swept away completely and for ever; that the control of the British Parliament by the medium of British Imperial legislation was swept away for ever and, instead of that cement which formerly held together what was called the British Empire, a cement which was made up of advice from the Dominions Office and from the Ministers of the Crown and from Imperial Acts of Parliament&mdash;instead of that there was substituted that loose co-operation <Col N="1299" /> founded on consultation and co-operation.</P>
    <P>How have we kept our word with those Dominions which helped the representatives of the Irish people to achieve their freedom in the Imperial Conferences of 1929 and 1930 and 1936? Kevin O'Higgins was assisted in his work by the representatives of Canada and South Africa, not to mention any of the others.  Deputy McGilligan was helped in his very arduous task in 1929 by General Beyers on behalf of South Africa, by the representatives of Canada and by the representatives of Australia, and in 1930 we had reached the position, as the result of the prestige that had been gained for this country by their representatives at Imperial Conferences in 1926, 1929 and 1930, that every single one of the representatives of every Dominion, of every State member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, ranged themselves behind the representatives of the Irish Free State and demanded that their rights should be granted, and they were granted finally and for ever.  We took on, in return for that co-operation and in return for that assistance which we got from the Dominions&mdash;we undertook, for the freedom that we obtained for this country through the operation of our membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations, as established over that long period of years and by that very arduous course of work, obligations, slight obligations, obligations that cost very little, if anything at all.  Those obligations have been dishonoured by the President of the Executive Council in reference to these two Bills we are asked to pass here to-day.</P>
    <P>The President said that he did not wish to have it said that we required the consent of any Dominion to anything that we do here.  I agree that we do not require anybody's consent to anything we do, either in our domestic affairs or in our international affairs.  The President stressed that we did not require the consent of anybody in our internal affairs.  The implication of that was&mdash;and I believe he believed it&mdash;that we do require the consent of somebody in our international <Col N="1300" /> relations.  We do not require the consent of anybody in our international affairs or in our national affairs in the exercise of our sovereign and independent rights, but we are under an obligation, voluntarily undertaken, to consult our fellow-members, our fellow States members of the British Commonwealth, when we propose to take any action that may affect their rights or their beliefs or their loyalties.  This Bill may be doing nothing wonderful, as the President said &mdash;or that was the effect of his speech: that we are doing practically nothing in taking the King out of the Constitution. Assuming that we are doing nothing and that it is a mere trifle taking the King out of the Constitution, there are millions of people in the Commonwealth of Nations who, whether we share their beliefs or loyalties or not, have a profound loyalty to what they refer to as the Crown.  The Crown to us here means nothing but a symbol. To them it means something personal. To the British it means their whole social order&mdash;everything they hold dear &mdash;and, above all things, it stands for stability in political and economic affairs.  It is a tragedy that the one nation in the world that has withstood the shocks of all the economic revolutions that have upset the world in the last 20 years, the one nation which withstood that shock and that was now emerging as, definitely, the most sound economic country in the world&mdash;that at this time that country should have had to suffer the tragedy that they have had to face within the last four days in England.</P>
    <P>Whatever the views of the greatest republican in this country may be in reference to the British Crown, whatever instincts we may all have as Irishmen in reference to the British Crown, by virtue of the fact that it stood, in the past, for everything we detested, we can now recognise that it now represents for us the symbol of our freedom.  We can recognise that we are sufficiently free to recognise the tragedy that has befallen our copartners in a free association of free nations, and we ought not to have introduced this Bill without asking them if they thought it hurt their sympathies <Col N="1301" /> or offended their susceptibilities. If it did nothing more than hurt the susceptibilities of people throughout the world, then at least the courtesy ought to have been extended to them of telling them that it was the intention of the Government to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>Lip-service was paid this afternoon by the President of the Executive Council to the principle of co-operation. He said, in reference to the abdication of the King, that it was necessary that some action should be taken by this country, and he made a remarkable statement.  He proceeded to say that if we are to remain associated with the States of the British Commonwealth, it is evident that common action&mdash;and then he quickly corrected himself and said &ldquo;concerted action&rdquo;&mdash;should be taken.  The President has been learning constitutional law.  I am glad that he has been learning constitutional law and that he recognises that there is a difference between common action and concerted action, and I hope that he recognises that we could take independent action if we like, common action if we wish, concerted action if we desire, and that any action that we take is our own action, whatever action we take, and that we are completely free to take any action, but that we are under a very definite obligation, before taking any action, to inform our fellow-members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that we do intend to take that action.</P>
    <P>I agree with the President of the Executive Council that the events which have transpired in Great Britain during the last few days would require from this Parliament a definite Act to make them effective.  It is for each State member of the Commonwealth to determine for itself how it will meet the situation which arises.  I agree that this Dáil should not stand&mdash;nor should any section of this House stand &mdash;for legislation by the Parliament of Great Britain on behalf of this country. That was the principle which the Government from 1922 to 1932 stood for.  That was what they achieved for this country in 1931, and it is that power that the present Government are exercising in bringing in these two <Col N="1302" /> Bills to-day.  I agree that it is necessary that there should be legislation to deal with the abdication of the King.  I may say, in passing, that I have the very gravest doubts as to whether the second Bill which we will be considering to-morrow does in fact adequately deal with the situation created by the abdication of the King. At best it deals with it in a very crooked way.  I never knew that the Act of Settlement was the law of the Irish Free State.  We are declaring here, or we will declare to-morrow when the second Bill introduced to-day is passed into law, that the Act of Settlement is the law of the Irish Free State, and I suppose that the Act of Union is the law of the Irish Free State.  That is what we are going to say by the second Bill&mdash;that the Act of Settlement and the Act of Union are the law of the Irish Free State. I did not know that they were.  The people of this country will know, probably to-morrow evening, that they are.</P>
    <P>Who is going to sign these Bills? We are taking the King out of the Constitution.  Who is the gentleman that Deputy Davin said he never met out in Dun Laoghaire going to represent? The Governor-General has been kept in the background.  He got a warrant of authority from some King. That warrant has come to an end, or will come to an end once King Edward VIII abdicates.  Who is going to fix the precise moment at which the abdication of King Edward VIII becomes effective?  How long is the authority of Mr. Donal Buckley, the present Governor-General of the Irish Free State, to last?  What legal effect will his signature on either of these Bills have?  These Bills are going to cause tremendous unrest in this country from the point of view merely of our internal affairs.  I myself can see the gravest legal and constitutional difficulties arising in connection with this Bill.  Reference has been made, I think by Deputy McGilligan, to the fact that this Bill which we are considering at the moment is a clear breach of Articles I and II of the Treaty.  I myself think that it sweeps the Treaty aside completely, and notwithstanding the President's declaration that he still adheres to Article I <Col N="1303" /> of the Constitution and that it is his intention by virtue of this Bill to clamp this country down into the British Empire, I believe that this is the clearest breach of the Treaty that there could possibly be.  That may affect only our relations with Great Britain.  With that I am not at the moment concerned, although it concerns and will concern the poorest person in this country.  If our relations with great Britain are still further aggravated, we are going to have still further economic unrest and instability in this country, and further economic unrest and instability are going to affect the poorest as well as the richest in the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court, our own court, has decided that constitutional changes cannot be made after the lapse of eight years where they offend against an Article of the Treaty.  I do not care what the position is going to be in this country from a constitutional point of view, provided we know definitely where we stand.  I can understand the position, constitutionally and internationally, of this country being a member, a full, recognised, decent member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I can understand a decent declaration of a republic.  But I cannot understand the indecency which is being perpetrated on this country by this Bill.  I do not know into what political pigeonhole we are going to be put when this Bill is law, but whether we are in the Commonwealth of Nations, whether we are a republic, or whether we are neither one thing nor the other&mdash; a State unknown hitherto to political theory&mdash;I want at least that it should be definite, so that the ordinary person's rights in this country in his ordinary affairs should be clearly defined and ascertained.  If this Bill is not constitutionally proper, and if it is not effective law in accordance with the decision of two at least out of the three, if not the whole three, of the members of the Supreme Court in the Colonel Jerry Ryan case, how are you going legally to collect your taxes? How are you going legally to enforce the orders made by the Executive Council in statutes?  A whole vista of <Col N="1304" /> litigation and subsequent legislation spreads itself out before anybody who thinks, and who must become appalled at the possibilities which are inherent in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible, in the time that is at our disposal, to go through every point which ought to be made on this Bill.  I have barely touched on the fringe of the subject.  I have barely touched on the consequences that may ensue from the passage of this Bill.  But there is one thing that I want to say in conclusion&mdash;that, if we stand here to-day opposing this Bill vigorously and with all the eloquence and force at our disposal, we are prepared to have the back-benchers of Fianna Fáil go down the country and denounce us as pro-Britishers.  We are used to the slander, we are used to the falsehoods and the false political propaganda of Fianna Fáil.  In the exercise of our duty we are prepared to take that risk, but we want it to be clearly understood that that is only a trick of the Fianna Fáil Administration and of the Fianna Fáil Party in order to blind, to give a sort of anodyne to the country, to lull them into the belief that this is something of a republic, that at least we have got rid of half the King and will soon get rid of the other half.  The Crown as it exists in this country is not the sort of thing which Deputy Donnelly will tell his constituents in Leix-Offaly that we say it is.  It is the symbol of our freedom.  It is more than that; it is the instrument by means of which we achieved our freedom.  It is an instrument through which the representatives of this country in 1926, 1929 and 1930 persuaded their fellow-members of the British Commonwealth of Nations to change the whole theory, the whole fabric of the British Empire as it then stood.</P>

      <P>Completely and absolutely. The British Empire existed before 1926 and 1929.  In 1926, Kevin O'Higgins laid the foundation-stone of the new structure of an independent nation.  The coping-stone was put on that structure in 1930 by Deputy McGilligan: the British Empire no <Col N="1305" /> longer existed.  The King was no longer King in the way he reigned in 1925.  He was the symbol of our freedom. He exercised any functions that he did exercise internationally and nationally merely as the mouthpiece of the Irish people.  The British Empire had ceased to exist and had become an association of independent free States, completely and independently sovereign.  They were no longer controlled from Downing Street or by the Imperial Parliament.  All that was swept away.  The entire fabric of the British Empire was changed and we became a completely free nation exercising our freedom and our sovereignty in any way that we pleased.  It is in that sense that we stand for the Crown as the symbol of our freedom, as the mouthpiece through which the Executive Council acts in certain international affairs and as the fiction through which the executive authority of the Irish Free State acts in our internal affairs.  There is no essential difference between the functions exercised by the King in our international affairs and the functions exercised by him in our national affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the President of the Executive Council, the members of the Executive Council and the hangers on of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the country think that something more is going to be achieved by the passing of this Bill, by putting the King out of the Constitution, then they are suffering under a very severe delusion. There is no difference between the functions as exercised by the King in our internal affairs and the functions exercised by the King in external affairs.  He acts in both capacities on the advice of the Executive Council. What are those foreign jurists, of whom the President is so much afraid, going to say about the position to be created by the present Bill if it becomes law? Are they going to say that we are investing the Crown with greater dignity, greater power, greater prestige, and greater force in our international affairs?  Our status in international affairs is judged by its marks of sovereignty which are exercised in external affairs.  We will have our international lawyers who are sufficiently astute telling the world <Col N="1306" /> that this Act of ours is investing the King with greater authority, greater force and greater prestige than he had when his Kingship as head of our State was a mere fiction, acting without power and acting without authority, except such power and authority as was given by the Irish Government from the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House very long and I am not going to say very much in this debate. I just want to say that I was bewildered by the President's opening statement on the introduction of this Bill.  He told us that he did not consult any member of the British Commonwealth of Nations about the particular action he is taking to-day. Sir, I submit that the situation that has arisen is one to which he should have given some consideration.  I submit that he should have consulted other members of the Commonwealth unless as it has already been described here we are to keep half in and half out of the Commonwealth.  In my opinion, that is an undignified position for this country to occupy.</P>
      <P>The President says he wants to clear the air.  I submit that the readiest method by which he could clear the air would be positively to declare a Republic for the Twenty-Six Counties. In that way, there would be no fog or no difficulty whatever to meet.  By declaring a Republic for the Twenty-Six Counties he would be doing something positive.  He should have put it up to the British Government that if they wanted us to remain members of the Commonwealth and to accept the monarch as monarch of this country, we would only do so on condition that we had him as monarch of a united Ireland.  I submit, Sir, that the President and the Executive Council funked the job.  They ran away from their responsibilities in this matter.  You will probably never get a similar situation or anything at all like it again in this country.  I know it is said that we should not avail of an opportunity like this or the opportunities presented at Geneva but Deputies might remember that the old slogan in this country was &ldquo;England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know that we want straight dealing.  That is what we want at a particular time like this in our history.  As I said here before, we are in the position now that we have one leg in and one leg out.  The President tells you that we are retaining the status.  He tells us also that it is absolutely essential that we should pass certain legislation and that we could not pass that certain legislation until this Bill was first passed to regularise the Crown in this country. If the President wanted to regularise the Crown in this country that is simplicity itself; it should not be done by the method which is adopted in the Bill which we will be discussing to-morrow.  As Deputy O'Higgins says, this is a very underhand way of doing what the President says he wants to do.  To my mind it simply means that the Fianna Fáil Party want to be in the position of being able to say down in the Bog of Allen that they are republicans and of being able to say in Piccadilly that they are imperialists.  That sort of thing is not fair to the Irish people.  They deserve better than that. The Government are lowering this country to a position that nobody who ever fought for it or worked for it would wish to see it in.  In the two days which the President had at his disposal there could be nothing wrong in his putting up to the British statesmen the proposition that owing to the circumstances that had arisen we were prepared to accept the Crown on condition that we had a united country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the President saw that Lord Craigavon had stepped over to London <Col N="1308" /> why did he not take up this matter with the British statesmen?  Why was Craigavon sent for?  We may assume that the British statesmen foresaw some question like that arising from the Free State.  What use did the President make of that situation?  The President and the members of his Cabinet have done here this week at the end of 1936 what he and his Party did in 1922.  They shirked the issue.  They were not prepared to go over and to meet the British statesmen face to face, as man to man, as equal Governments and equal peoples and there discuss with them the difficulties between us and bring them to an end.  I am prepared to say this to the President that in the event of his taking up with the British Government this attitude of going over discussing and effecting a settlement of the political differences between the two countries and the two peoples he would have behind him the support of 90 per cent. of our people.  If you do not do that, if you accept the King and, for the first time, put in positively and definitely that you remain a member of the Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;I am not sure whether you are or not&mdash;and if you retain the Governor-General, not knowing whether you want him or not, or what you want him for&mdash;the President says he is not sure whether the Governor-General should be retained, but he says that it is proposed to retain the King for the functions which he directly exercises and that the Governor-General would perform these functions&mdash;what is that?  It has been described by Deputy Costello as a monstrosity.  I know another word for it that is worse than that.</P>
    <P>Then the President tells us that it will clear the position.  When we look at the alterations that are proposed to be made he says that the Executive Council is to have all the executive authority and, quite blandly, this evening the President started to exercise these functions, the functions of the King.  What he said was&mdash;that he felt called upon to advise the Executive Council.  That is a rather peculiar phrase.  He advises the Executive Council, I presume, that <Col N="1309" /> they must do so-and-so.  Is that the sort of position that we are arriving at-that when the President says something the Executive Council say, &ldquo;Yes, yes&rdquo; and that is the end of Government in this country?  It looks as if it were so, because the President has told us that he advised the Executive Council and the Executive Council apparently said yes.  Then he must have advised the Party, and they said yes, and the machine goes on and the legislation is through.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has advised the Executive Council in this case and he was looking into his own heart when doing it.  He knows what is good for the Executive Council, and the Executive Council say yes, and are glad of the chance.  That is the position. The President said that he advised the Party and the Party says yes.  I am quite satisfied that not five of them outside the Front Bench know what is in this Bill.  They discussed it themselves for about 20 minutes.  The President advised them and that was the end of that.  For a Republican Government to adopt that attitude is very low.  As I say, the position will be positively clear if you adopt either of the attitudes that I suggest.  There will be no question of difficulty for jurists or anybody like that.  If you accept the Crown and the Monarchy for the united country, for an All-Ireland Parliament and go over and negotiate your settlement of that and leave this legislation here until it is finished-pass the Abdication Bill if you want to, but go over and negotiate that settlement and you will have done something and will be getting somewhere.  In the alternative, if instead of taking this underhand method, because it is nothing else, of pretending you are declaring a republic and not doing it, you declare a republic, we will know where we are and there will be respect for you in this country at least, even if there is hostility towards you in England, which you do not mind, I suppose. That will be some advantage, some ground gained.  Failure to do that <Col N="1310" /> leaves this country in a lowered condition, which nobody who fought for it or whoever thought anything about it would like to see it in.  It will be the butt of every person who wants to come in and tell you what you ought to do.  While not wishing to say anything about anybody, I notice that there are people who come into this country, who have served a long time with the British Administration, and try to tell us what we are to do and what is patriotic and what is not.  I tell them that they should be very careful, that we know exactly what is good for our country and we do not have to ask anybody like them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The overwhelming objection to this Bill, as I said earlier in the afternoon, is that we do not know whether it puts us outside, the Commonwealth or not.  That very fact makes any extended discussion of the Bill useless and, indeed, next door to impossible.  The complaint against the Government with regard to the guillotine motion is not that, under the circumstances, a longer discussion would be of any use; the complaint is that the circumstances in which they have presented it are such that we simply do not know what we are doing.  For that reason, I do not propose to repeat what I have said already this afternoon or to set forward any further arguments about the major issues that are raised by the Bill.  I want to put a technical point to the Attorney-General and, before doing that, to say just a word upon the speeches of Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Costello.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Costello's speech, it seems to me that he has grossly over-stated the effect of the changes in the constitutional position that he says were brought about during the regime of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  After all, the first two Articles of our Constitution read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the Community of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
      <P>And Article 2:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All powers of government and all authority, legislative, executive, and judicial in Ireland, are derived <Col N="1311" /> from the people of Ireland and the same shall be exercised in the Irish Free State through the organisations established by or under, and in accord with, this Constitution.</P>
    <P>If anything could justify&mdash;I do not think anything could&mdash;the action of the Fianna Fáil Party in precipitating this country into civil war it would be the suggestion that was implied in Deputy Costello's speech, that these two Articles were a delusion and a snare at the time they were first introduced.  It is simply not true that the principle of real self-government for the different parts of the British Commonwealth did not exist before the efforts of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins which he described.  It is not true that the King could act in relation to this country on the advice of any Ministers except the Irish Ministers, or that the King could act in relation to any other country of the Commonwealth on the advice of any Ministers except the Ministers of that particular country of the Commonwealth.  The Statute of Westminster was useful in making precise what was already constitutional practice, but I cannot believe that it is wise to suggest that there was this extraordinary revolution in the whole structure and theory of the British Commonwealth that Deputy Costello in his speech said there was during the years of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government made certain things clearer.  I imagine but for the sort of opposition they had to meet here they might not even have thought it necessary or important to get these things clearer than they were.  While they got things made clearer, and though it was valuable to have them made clearer, it is not true that by the Treaty we were really taken in and only given the show of freedom, and that it needed the efforts of successive Ministers for External Affairs in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government to turn the show of freedom into the reality of freedom.</P>
    <P>As to the speech of Deputy MacEoin, I am simply amazed that anyone on the Front Opposition Bench should come forward with the proposal that we should put into effect on this occasion <Col N="1312" /> the old proverb that England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity and that we should have gone to the British and said: &ldquo;Look here, if we fall in with your wishes and recognise this new King it will be only on the basis of a united Ireland.  You must put the thing through.&rdquo;  It appears to me that to take that course would have been, in the first place, utterly futile and, in the second place, open to the very objections that were so eloquently urged by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McGilligan against the course the Government is now taking.</P>

I gather he is now suggesting that, in keeping with what he says they ought to have done to-day, they ought to have made use of the situation at Geneva to blackmail the British Government into some concession to us, quite irrespective of the fact that we had undertaken freely certain obligations and had to decide whether we would fulfil the obligations we had freely undertaken or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Attorney-General that it is clear this Bill No. 1 effects nothing at all with regard to the change in the holder of the Crown.  If legislation by the Irish Free State is necessary to make the abdication of King Edward VIII effective, and to make the appointment of the new King effective, then such legislation will not have been carried through to-day, and until to-morrow at any rate it would seem that King Edward VIII remains the lawful King of this country, even though he ceases to be elsewhere.  I should like to know if that is the Attorney-General's view of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to Bill No. 2 it has a bearing on what we are doing with Bill No. 1, and I think it is legitimate to <Col N="1313" /> raise this point:&mdash;It is to be enacted that:</P>
    <P>(2)  The King referred to in the foregoing sub-section of this section shall, for the purposes of that sub-section, be the person who, if His Majesty King Edward the Eighth had died on the 10th day of December, 1936, unmarried, would for the time being be his successor under the law of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>That appoints&mdash;though I do not think it is the proper expression, I will adopt it for the moment&mdash; a King in relation to some purposes in the previous sub-section and only in reference to those purposes, so that it would appear the outgoing King will still remain King for all other purposes.  The fact, that a list is given of a whole lot of functions that are taken away from him in Bill No. 1 is not conclusive that he does not remain King for some purposes&mdash;he might on the advice of the Executive Council be authorised to do certain acts that are not listed in Bill No. 1. I presume the Attorney-General has carefully considered that matter, but it is clearly relevant to the consideration of Bill No. 1 that we should know what the technical position really would be as a result of Bill No. 1 and Bill No. 2 taken together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one or two remarks of Deputy MacDermot.  He complained that in his judgement Deputy Costello had very much misrepresented the development of the Treaty position.  I should like to point out at the beginning that prior to the coming into existence of the Irish Free State there was no doubt whatever that certain laws existed clearly implying the inferiority of the position of the Dominions.  Secondly, at that time there were also practices which clearly indicated that the British Government could act with legislative effect with regard to the Dominions. Take the case of the signing of treaties.  The Deputy will remember that in the case of Versailles the preamble made it clear that, in as much as the British representative had full powers in relation to the whole Empire given him by the respective <Col N="1314" /> Governments, his signature was for the whole Empire.  Apart from that, there was the British North America Act and the Mercantile Marine Act which implied inferior status.  The Treaty by incorporating the words &ldquo;practice and constitutional usage&rdquo; itself gave development.  The Constitution when introduced defined and stated that we were co-equal members of the community of nations.  That affirmation of co-equality was accepted when the Treaty was accepted and was accepted by the other party to the Treaty.  In the following years, what our Government did was this: In every case, in every practice, and in every survival which implicitly or explicitly suggested lack of that co-equality, we pointed out that such survival and such condition was incompatible with the Dominion position as defined by our Treaty, and as incorporated by our Constitution, and in that way we did radically change the whole status of the Dominions, because there was nothing about it when the Free State came into existence.  The Dominions had not then the same status as the British in the Commonwealth.  In accepting the Treaty we accepted it with the guarantee, and on the clear understanding that every inequality that existed would be wiped out.  In that regard, when we were negotiating with the British if in practice or in law anything was incompatible with co-equality, once that was made clear, these survivals in practice and in law were by common agreement abolished as incompatible with the understood position of the Dominions.</P>

      <P>Could the Deputy refresh my memory by telling me the approximate date of the Balfour declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Balfour declaration was 1926.  I do not want to pursue that too far, except in so far as to meet other points that were raised.  There were certain other points which involved possible legal consequences, and these were postponed for what was called an expert commission which did not meet until 1929.  It met then, examined the matter, and made certain recommendations which came before the Imperial <Col N="1315" /> Conference in 1930, which were incorporated in the instrument called the Statute of Westminster.  When we took over, we became a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The President says we remain a co-equal member of the Commonwealth of Nations by reason of the fact that he has not abolished Article (1) of the Constitution, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State (otherwise hereinafter called or sometimes called Saorstát Eireann) is a co-equal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We affirmed that in our Constitution. It is quite clear that when you use a phrase like &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo;, it must connote something. We are a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and also a member of the League of Nations.  Membership of the League of Nations requires certain conditions and it is something completely external to ourselves, to which we adhere by going through certain forms and adhering to the Covenant.  I do not think that the President will deny that certain things were implied and necessary in relation to a State-member of the Commonwealth so far. What has been implied, so far, is that each one of these States has the King as what I might call an integral part, within itself.  The King stands, so far, as part of our legislature, as we can see by reading the Constitution.  The Bill which will come before us to-morrow refers to the King being King by the law of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill completely eliminates every reference to him in the Constitution. Therefore, it must be assumed that, when this Bill goes through to-night, the King will no longer be part of the Irish Free State legislature.  The President got up and talked for some time but said nothing whatever.  You have the Commonwealth of Nations, which is the result of growth.  It has grown up, so that it has not needed very exact definition.  When it comes to considering what it is that constitutes a State a member of the British <Col N="1316" /> Commonwealth of Nations, one of the first notes or marks is that the King, who is the King of the British Commonwealth of Nations, is an integral part of that State.  That is to say, he is not external to the State and is not a mere external link between the States but, being in each of these States and being the identical person in charge of the whole organisation, he makes that link from the interior of the State and not from the exterior.  The President calmly states that he had not time for conference with the other members of the Commonwealth and that it would not be relevant.  He says that we are a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and can enjoy every privilege and benefit that may accrue therefrom by reason of the fact that our Constitution claims we are a member.  It seems to me that, in the case of any organisation, that organisation has the right to lay down the conditions of membership, even if the conditions be undefined, because no firm definition has ever been made in this case.  The British Commonwealth of Nations has consisted of a number of countries which accepted one man as King in these countries.  In that way he was the link.  The President arbitrarily comes along and says he is wiping him out so far as the Free State are concerned but we are still members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It seems to me that he has asked us to accept something without having bothered to find out what the effect of his act will be.</P>
    <P>Can we say that we, the Irish Free State, have decided that, for membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations, nothing more is required than that the Executive of this State should employ the King as their agent for certain external functions?  I think that the President has shown an absolute disregard for this House and for the people by calling us here and asking us to pass this Bill with the casual remark that he is not abolishing Article I of the Constitution and that, for that reason, we remain a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I am far from satisfied that we do remain a member.  When <Col N="1317" /> this Bill is passed to-night, shall we have any relations whatsoever with the King.  In our basic law, which defines our whole position and from which every other law flows, there will be no reference to the King once this Bill passes.  The only Article into which that reference might be read is Article 73, which says that all laws in existence when the Free State was established continue to apply except in so far as they are changed or abolished by our action here.  It may be that the President holds that, by virtue of that Article, the Act of Settlement applies and that, although there is no mention of the King in our basic law, from which all our law flows, the King still remains by reason of the Article which incorporates previous legislation, including the Act of Settlement.  If it is a fact that we have been called together to wipe out the King from the Constitution and, consequently, to separate ourselves from the British Commonwealth of Nations, the President is clearly acting against his own most solemn promise, in so far as one can regard any promise from him as solemn.  Surely, the effect of his action is that to-night &mdash;whatever may happen to-morrow night&mdash;we are completely dissevered from the British Commonwealth of Nations.  If reference to the King is abolished in the Constitution on the assumption that, to-morrow, another Bill will come in which refers to him and empowers the Executive Council to employ that individual as an agent for certain functions, surely the position is as I have stated?</P>
    <P>It does seem to me perfectly scandalous that the President should introduce this Bill to-day without showing any indication that he himself had given thought to the question whether or not it definitely separates us from the British Commonwealth of Nations. If it does that, we need not go into the possible reactions we may suffer from this fundamental change in the position of the country.  We were summoned here yesterday by telegram. We got the Bill only this morning.  It is a Bill which requires careful consideration&mdash;much more careful consideration than the President himself has given it.  The situation to-night, roughly, is that the President creates <Col N="1318" /> a condition which, in his own mind, completely severs us from the British Commonwealth of Nations.  To-morrow, he makes an offer to Great Britain and to the King that the King shall have certain functions and shall occupy a position completely different from the position he has held up to now in relation to the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the President's line will be that if the British do not like to accept it they can do the other thing, and that we can go outside. But that is a most frivolous way of treating the whole matter.  It is a most scandalous way to treat the Irish people.  There is no doubt about that, although the President may summon some of his gun-men friends, Mr. Seán Russell and others, to discuss the matter with him.  There is no doubt but that a very large proportion of the people of this country are perfectly convinced that their economic salvation lies in that relationship with Great Britain, and in the benefits that flow from it.  A great many other people are convinced that if that economic salvation is lacking, this country is likely to suffer morally and materially.  The President is asking us to take a jump in the dark.  He would not even bother to consider the question as to what the effects of passing this Bill are going to be. Admittedly he has gone through the Constitution, and he is proposing to wipe out of it every reference to the King or to the King's representative. He is doing that without giving consideration as to what the effect will be when these passages in the Constitution are wiped out.  It is ridiculous to say that in the Constitution of this country, in which there is no reference whatever to the King, the King is part of the legislature or part of the machinery of this country.  By reason of what is he part of the legislature? There is nothing to establish that. Therefore, to-morrow when the President comes along and makes an offer of what he would describe as external association with Great Britain, that is unilateral rejection of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>When the Abolition of the Oath Bill was before the House, the President, by using a most dishonest argument which convinced nobody, said that the <Col N="1319" /> Oath was not binding because it said &ldquo;the Oath to be taken by members of the Dáil&rdquo; and so on.  In the case of the Governor-General the Treaty does not use the words &ldquo;to be.&rdquo;  It uses the words &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;.  The Treaty affirms that &ldquo;the representative of the Crown in Ireland shall be appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada&rdquo; and in accordance with the practice observed in the making of such appointments.  With regard to the President's whole argument as to whether the Oath to be taken was permissive or mandatory, to my mind it is perfectly clear that Article 3 of the Treaty makes it mandatory that there shall be appointed a Governor-General as the King's representative.  This Bill proposes to abolish that altogether. Consequently, it seems to me quite clear that this Bill is an abrogation of the Treaty.  Moreover, Article 1 of the Constitution, which says that we are a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, itself flowed from the first two Articles of the Treaty.  Article 1 of the Treaty provides that</P>
    <P>Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire, as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia...</P>
    <P>And Article 2 of the Treaty provides that</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada...</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that the phrase used is &ldquo;in the Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  I gather that the intention of this Bill is to put us outside the Commonwealth of Nations, and, to use the President's meaningless phrase, to create &ldquo;external association.&rdquo;  As I read Article 1 of the Constitution the affirmation made there is that we are co-equal members in the British Commonwealth by reason of the first two Articles of the Treaty, and because of the fact that we have the same constitutional status in the British community of nations known as the British <Col N="1320" /> Empire, and because our relationship is the same as that of Canada.  Because that is established as a fact, we can affirm that we are a co-equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Admittedly, the Bill that we have before us does mean that our relationship is not that of Canada, and if it is not, then our membership in the Commonwealth of Nations disappears, and our membership of the British Commonwealth also disappears. I admit it is possible that if the British are good-natured they may not raise the point.</P>
    <P>The President, in asking us to pass this Bill, certainly had the right to satisfy himself that any question of our continued membership being raised could only be a remote possibility.  If the question is raised, has the President any case to put forward to justify his assertion that Article 1 of the Constitution is now hereafter an affirmation of fact, or merely a clause which has no relation whatever to fact?  So far membership of the Commonwealth of Nations necessarily meant that the King was in the Constitution and had certain functions in relation to the State.  He was one aspect of that moral person that we call the State. Once this Bill is passed there will be no reference whatever to the King in the Constitution, and that being the basic law of this country it seems to me clear that the King is abolished. He will not even be the symbolic link in the Bill that the President proposes to move in the Dáil to-morrow.  He offers that the King should perform certain functions.  If I wanted to get the Free State out of the Commonwealth, and if my arguments could achieve it, I feel that I would have a very good case for affirming that, inasmuch as we had changed our position here by abolishing the King out of our Constitution, we automatically ceased to be a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, because that membership flows from Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty, and is not a mere matter of becoming a member of the British Commonwealth or merely affirming your intention of doing so.  It implies more than that.  It implies the unity of the Crown, and that means that the Crown is the Crown here as well <Col N="1321" /> as in the other country.  When this Bill is passed, by reason of what will the Crown be the Crown here as in England, Australia and Canada?  I cannot see anything on which it can be based, and if that is not there the President should have abundant arguments to prove beyond all refutation that the change he is making is not in any way interfering with or even jeopardising our position in the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>In the matter of secession from the British Commonwealth, he has, I think, stated from time to time that such action would only be taken when the case had been put before the Irish people and when they had declared their desire in the matter.  As far as doing that is concerned, it was only last night that we got telegrams telling us that the Dáil would meet to-day, while only those of us who live fairly near Dublin got these Bills to-day.</P>

      <P>We have before the House to-night a Bill which is a very difficult Bill to understand, not only from its wording but from its many implications.  We received this Bill this morning.  I think that that was grossly unfair to the members of the House.  Here we are taking a step, possibly a very important step, and surely we should have had every opportunity of carefully considering the step we are taking and the consequences which are likely to follow.  We have had no such opportunity.  We have had just a few hours in which to read a Bill which gives rise to the most difficult problems which any constitutional lawyer could face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might have had an alternative. If we had no time to read this Bill, we might at least have had from the man who understands, or is supposed to understand, what this Bill means, a clear and definite statement of its contents and what he considers the consequences will be.  What did we get? We got a few disjointed, perfunctory remarks from the President and nothing else.  Very big questions are here at issue.  The President cannot be so completely ignorant as not to know that there are big questions at issue. It was another act of unfairness to <Col N="1322" /> the House for the President deliberately to shy at putting his own views forward.  It was an unfair thing to the House for the President to show himself the moral coward who was afraid to put his views before the House.</P>
    <P>What do we get in regard to a matter of some importance such as this&mdash;to my mind a matter of grave importance?  Was there any consultation with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations about this?  Yes, out of politeness we are told that there was a communication made to Great Britain.  Was it written?  Yes, said the President.</P>

      <P>What advantages are we or the country supposed to get from this measure?  We are told, and this is the only explanation which we get from the President, that <Col N="1323" /> this is bringing constitutional usage up-to-date in expression.  That, of course, is a very valuable remark to fall from President de Valera's lips, because that is a complete admission that for many and many a year President de Valera and the members of his Party who followed him then and who follow him now were wandering in a bog of error and untruth.  Whenever they said that the Treaty did not give complete and entire freedom to this country they were, of course, no doubt entirely unconsciously, misleading the people of the State.  It is very useful now to have the admission of that fact coming from the lips of President de Valera.</P>
      <P>What are we supposed to gain by this?  What definite, positive advantages does it confer on this State?  I see none.  Does it add to our liberty or increase our freedom by one single jot?  Not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party can suggest that it does. If this Bill becomes law, will the Executive Council to-morrow have one jot of power more than it possesses to-day?  Will the people have got one single piece of liberty more to-morrow than they have to-day?  The answer must be that they will not, because the people of this State are sovereign to-day and sovereign liberty cannot be increased.  They are sovereign to-day by virtue of the Treaty which was so often denounced, but the power that it conferred and that remains is being attacked here in an underhand fashion.</P>
      <P>What does all this prove?  It proves, but I do not think that was in the least bit necessary, that for years Fianna Fáil have been deceiving the country.  It proves that the Party that now calls itself Fianna Fáil, even before it called itself Fianna Fáil, was deceiving the country.  That is all that it does, that and nothing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the other side of the picture. Here we have it stated by the President that this does not put us out of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I am not going to argue whether it does or not.  It is a difficult matter, a matter on which nobody could make up his mind in the short time in which we have had an opportunity to consider this Bill.  I will argue upon the President's <Col N="1324" /> statement and upon the supposition that this keeps us inside the Commonwealth of Nations.  Personally, I believe that this State should remain in the Commonwealth of Nations.  I believe it is to the great advantage of the State to remain in the Commonwealth of Nations.  I believe this State can be as free within the Commonwealth as ever it could be outside and I believe that this State has a greater sense of security, and a greater security in fact, by being in the Commonwealth than if it were outside.  I believe, too, that this State has got enormous economic advantages, not being derived at the moment&mdash;but that is owing to the incompetency of the present administration&mdash;enormous potential advantages to be derived from membership of the Commonwealth.  Those are the reasons why I believe that this State should remain in the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>What is the view opposite?  We should remain in the Commonwealth of Nations, yes, but we are to do everything we can to derive as little advantage as we can from being in the Commonwealth of Nations.  That is what is being done here.  Surely, if you want to remain in partnership with any persons, if you want to derive every possible advantage from that partnership, you ought to live on the best of terms with them and ought not to endeavour by pin-pricks and more serious injuries to stir up resentment against us.  We are not fools. We do not live in the moon and everyone of us knows that these two Bills are going to give the greatest possible offence to the people of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa as well as to the people of Great Britain.  There is nobody in this House who does not know that. Kingship may be only a symbol but it is a symbol which is very dear to the people of those countries.  The majority of the people of those countries, as a matter of fact, have a great sense of loyalty to that particular symbol which is called the Crown.  Why insult it?  Do you think that deliberately, wantonly and without any cause and deriving no possible advantage from it, it is wise to attack <Col N="1325" /> a sentiment which is a genuine sentiment of theirs?</P>
    <P>That is what you are doing here. I could not imagine any way in which, setting himself to annoy and disturb public opinion in all the Dominions, President de Valera could have effected his purpose better than he is effecting his purpose by these two Bills.  They are insulting in their matter, and they are doubly insulting by their phraseology, and especially by the phraseology of Section 3 of the Bill which will be before us to-morrow. I should like to point out that under that Section 3, the President and other members of the Executive Council have evidently visualised a very extraordinary state of affairs. Is there a King of Ireland?  They seem to make it perfectly clear that there is because sub-section (2) of Section 3 of to-morrow's Bill says:</P>
    <P>The King referred to in the foregoing sub-section of this section shall, for the purposes of that sub-section, be the person who, if His Majesty, King Edward the Eighth had died on the 10th day of December, 1936, unmarried, would for the time being be his successor under the law of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>A Bill becomes law to-day by which the King is removed.  His name is removed from the Legislature and also from the Executive, but to-morrow there will be a law of Saorstát Eireann regulating the descent to the kingship.  What, then, is the position? Have we a king or have we no king? What do you mean?  Here you are taking the King out of the Constitution and to-morrow you introduce a Bill and you say that there is a law in force that regulates the descent to the kingship.  I do not know what the position is.  I do not know whether the Executive Council themselves know what it means.  Certainly if they know what it means, the President of the Executive Council was very careful this afternoon to refrain from telling us what he thought the position was, that is, if he has any thoughts about the matter at all, which is not very likely.</P>

      <P>I am not going to deal with these constitutional questions.  As I say, they are not questions I have had any real or fair opportunity of considering.  I am more interested in this Bill and in the Bill which is being introduced to-morrow, because they are very dangerous to something I have very much at heart. I know that this is as dangerous a threat as can be brought against the economic prosperity and the economic well-being of the West of Ireland, and especially of the constituency I represent. We cannot carry on in the West of Ireland, as events have shown, and above all, we cannot carry on in South Mayo, in which constituency I am particularly interested, unless we have for our produce the economic market which Great Britain affords, to some extent even now, and should afford completely and freely if the affairs of this country were properly looked after.  Here I find a Bill which, although I cannot tell the British reactions&mdash;no one can&mdash;is certainly a threat and a danger to that economic prosperity.  If there has been any statement by Great Britain that there will be no unfavourable reactions, it was open to the President to tell us to-day.  He had his opportunity.  A direct question was put to him, but he was not in a position to answer it, or else he would not answer it.  I do not know which it was, but I conclude that if he were in a position to give a favourable answer he would have done so.  Therefore I discover that though this country derives, and can derive, no possible advantage from this Bill, that Bill in itself constitutes a very grave menace to such little degree of agricultural prosperity as the West of Ireland enjoys at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing.  The West of Ireland could not carry on and my constituency could not carry on, considering that the land has been rendered barren, unfruitful and unproductive in the hands of its owners by the policy which the Government has adopted and because there is economic stress in that county, as there is all along the western seaboard, such as <Col N="1327" /> has not happened within living memory.  That burden which the West of Ireland is bearing at present would be utterly intolerable were it not that the young men and, to some extent, the young women of that county and of all the western counties are able to get a considerable amount of and, in fact, as much employment in England as there is surplus population in the county.  Is that to be stopped?  Is that to be cut away?  It is in danger at present.  The consequences of Fianna Fáil action have been that no smallholder can make a living out of his land at present, and if he is going to make a living some member of his family must go away and work outside this country, and the only place they can work outside this country is Great Britain.  The Government's policy drives them out, and not merely do they want to drive them out but they seek to prevent them going to the one place in which they can profitably spend their time.</P>
    <P>It is upon these grounds, because of the grave dangers to the economic structure of the West of Ireland contained in this Bill, that I mostly strongly oppose this measure.  I have spoken from the point of view of the West of Ireland, because that is, after all, the part of this country which is dearest to me and also the part of the country that I know best.  I do believe that if any single member of the Fianna Fáil Party, no matter what part of this country he came from, really looked within himself, really examined his own conscience, really considered what was his duty to his constituents and his duty to his country, he would follow into the Lobby, not President de Valera to vote for this Bill, but, rather, he would follow us into the Lobby and vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express a viewpoint on this Bill somewhat different to that which has been so far taken.  At the outset, I want to confess that I do not understand the Bill in all its implications.  As I listened to the debate to-day it seemed to me that nobody in the House, even those who are best fitted because of their <Col N="1328" /> training and professions to understand a Bill of this kind, claimed to have a full understanding of it.  However, I want to ask the President a few questions. The President took action shortly after becoming head of the Government of this country, which was fraught with very grave consequences to the country.  We know that as a result of the action taken by the President and the Government on that occasion untold suffering has been brought upon great numbers of the people of this country.  We know that millions of pounds in trade have been lost to the country.  We know that notwithstanding all the efforts made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to absorb the unemployed into industry and to find work here at home for our people, he has not been able to make any headway because of the action taken by the Government in another direction.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the President whether he has considered fully the reactions which are likely to flow from the passage of these two measures. Has the President considered for instance whether the passage of these two measures is likely to affect the 50,000 odd Irish boys and girls who emigrated to England during the three years ending 31st March last?  Has he considered whether it is likely to affect the interests of the 36,300 odd who have gone in the first nine months of this year?  Has the President considered this matter in relation to the negotiations, which I presume are going on at the moment, regarding the renewal of the coal-cattle pact?  Are the President and the members of the Government aware that the agriculturists of this country particularly, and the people generally, have been looking forward with some hope to an improvement in the coal-cattle pact that is to be effected within the next month or two?  Is the President aware that people were hoping that the Government would be able to make a much more favourable bargain with the British than they were able to make under the previous pacts?  Can the President say now to the people that the passage of these measures will not affect adversely the commercial relations between this country and Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> These may seem all very immaterial points.  They may seem to be very commonplace points beside the very high constitutional questions discussed here to-day but I submit to the House that they are the real questions that affect the people of this country.  We want to know in what way the passage of these Bills is going to improve the position of this country.  Are they going to improve the position or make it more likely that trade will be better in the coming twelve months than it has been in the last four years?  Is there anything in the Bill which is going to affect favourably or unfavourably the chances of unemployed men getting work in this country and, failing their getting work here, is the passage of these two Bills going to make it more difficult or more easy to obtain the employment in Britain which they cannot obtain at home?  I take it to be the duty of any head of a State here to inquire into these matters before he brings before the House measures of such far-reaching importance as the measures now before us.  I think the House and the country are entitled to know from the President whether he has examined into these matters, whether he is satisfied that they are not going to affect adversely the people of this country, whether the President and the Government are merely gambling on the whole question, or whether the President's line is: &ldquo;I am going ahead with this and to hell with the consequences.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the President to say to-day that the time is not opportune and, in effect, that even if it were opportune, he would not proclaim a republic for Twenty-six Counties. As far as I can understand, this Bill is going to produce all the objectionable features that a Twenty-six County Republic would have without declaring the republic.  Other speakers have dealt with the constitutional position that this Bill, when enacted, will create or rather how it will be interpreted by Great Britain, whether Great Britain will consider that this Bill has placed us outside the Commonwealth. As far as I am capable of judging it, I think it could be easily <Col N="1330" /> interpreted in that way.  When the name of the King goes out of the Constitution, where does recognition of the King, even as a connecting link in the Commonwealth of Nations, come in?  However, I am not so much concerned about the technicalities of that position as I am about the declaration of the President that he would not proclaim or stand for a republic for Twenty-six Counties.  His ideal is a republic for Thirty-two Counties.  How will that position be brought about, and what obstacles to the realisation of that ideal will the passage of this Bill create?</P>
      <P>I think it is generally accepted, and the President has often declared it, that we must show the people of the Six Counties that we in the Twenty-six Counties not only welcome them in but welcome them in to conditions at least as favourable as the economic conditions that they have in the Six Counties.  Now, whether we like it or not, the people of the Six Counties will not come into a republic.  They have opted out of the Free State.  If we want to make progress on national lines our first objective and our main concern should be the creation of conditions and of a situation that would, under whatever the régime, be that the Thirty-two Counties would function as one unit.  My main objection to this Bill is that it is building up a still greater barrier between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties, and it is a further desertion of the people of the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a Deputy applauding the President here to-day when the President stated that he and his Party stood for a republic for 32 Counties.  That Deputy is a native of the Six Counties. I have not heard him on this Bill, and I should like to hear Deputy Donnelly tell his friends and relations in Armagh what obstacles the passage of this Bill will create for the political unity of this country, never mind under what régime but under any régime&mdash;what obstacles, if any, will be created, or what easements will this Bill produce, when it is enacted, towards bringing the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties together.  Deputy Donnelly knows well that up in the North the one concern of the Nationalists there is to get even <Col N="1331" /> a portion of the freedom that we have here, and they blame all political parties and all politicians down here that they, who have borne the brunt of the national fight for all these years, have been deserted by the Nationalists of the South.  I look upon this as a further desertion the effects of which nothing will be able to obliterate for many years to come, if ever.  As far as I can visualise it, nothing short of a terrible and bloody revolution in which England, Ireland and Scotland would be involved, some terrible upheaval such as we have in Spain at the present time would have to happen, before that boundary would be obliterated.  The President smiles. Well, I should be very interested if the President would show how this will make the path of Irish unity, under any régime, easier.  The people of the Six Counties, whether we like it or not, whether it is wise or unwise, are loyal to the British Crown&mdash;that is, the majority of them&mdash;and anything that will infringe on that loyalty, any régime established in this country, will not be recognised by them; they will have nothing to do with it.  They have shown that.  Now a situation is going to be created by this Bill which will make the objection they have against coming into the Free State still greater, and how are we going to get national unity?  Is it not the greatest of nonsense, is it not absolute dishonest propaganda, to say that we stand for an Irish Republic for 32 Counties when we are doing all that we can to prevent even a Free State for 32 Counties?  If the President is anxious to answer the crack of the British whip and implement the constitutional position, and if it is necessary to pass an Act to say that King Edward VIII of last week is Mr. Edward Windsor to-day, I am sure he would be facilitated; and that the Duke of Gloucester, as I think he was last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If this is passed, and thus creates that super-obstacle in the way of national unity, then this is the last and greatest betrayal of the Nationalists of Ulster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at great personal risk to myself I get up to answer Deputy Belton and to say a few words in reply.  After all, Deputy Belton has been abroad, and during the course of the last Session, while he was abroad, we had all this thing thrashed out in this House&mdash;this question of the unity of Ireland and the question of the cures for all these obstacles.  If the Deputy had been here, instead of reviewing troops on the Christian Front in Spain, north, south, east and west, and playing a kind of political toreador, he would not be asking these questions to-day, and it would be the simplest task I ever got to tell him just to get the Official Report of the debate on the resolution submitted to this House by Deputy MacDermot. However, Deputy Belton is entitled to a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nobody in the country more interested in Ireland's unity than I am in voting for this, and I approve of it and I did so here to-day, when the President said he was out for a republic eventually for 32 counties.  During all the years before this question ever arose, during all the years when Deputy Cosgrave was at the head of a Government, and during a period when Deputy Belton was a member of Deputy Cosgrave's Party, I do not think, with regard to the people in the North of Ireland, about whom Deputy Belton seems to feel so anxious&mdash;the Unionists in the North of Ireland&mdash;even without the terror and dread of legislation such as this, there has ever been an approach to come nearer to the South in all these years than there is now.  I do not think that this will do the least harm.  On the contrary, <Col N="1333" /> it will prove to these people up there, who do not have the same faith as the majority in this House, who at least have the courage of their convictions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is a religious question, and not a national question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy, it is a national question.  I am speaking about a certain type of Ulsterman whom Deputy Belton seems to think will keep away further and further from ever effecting contact with this State as a result of this legislation.  In connection with that kind of man, this legislation will not do the slightest harm, because the type of Irishmen they admire most are the people who have the courage of their convictions and who go all out for whatever they believe in.  If we can effect this here for ourselves in the Twenty-Six counties, why not go all out for the 32 Counties?</P>

When Arthur Griffith started off as the apostle of Sinn Féin he used to be asked: &ldquo;How are you going to do all this; how are you going to bring this about?&rdquo; The very same question is being asked of us to-day: &ldquo;How are you going to effect Irish unity?&rdquo; It should be remembered that there is such a thing in politics as the evolution of politics.

      <P>At the same time, while waiting for the time to come along, surely we are not going to rest on our oars and do nothing for the betterment, nationally or otherwise, of this portion of Ireland where we can function?  Deputy Belton, of course, is more optimistic than I am perhaps as regards the North.  He is perhaps a <Col N="1334" /> bit more enthusiastic and zealous from certain standpoints as regards the North than I am.  Of course that is only a phase.  It will pass, like all his other phases have passed.  Some day or other he will come in here and will have a more pessimistic outlook than he has now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to relate Deputy Belton's question to the Bill before the House.  He put me a very pertinent question, and I am trying to give him an answer.  I say that the optimistic phase in which Deputy Belton is now moving will pass.  There is no necessity for me to waste too much time on it, because certainly in a month or two, or in three months at the latest, he will be coming in and putting a different question.  However, let us be a little bit more serious about the matter.  I do come from the area referred to by the Deputy, but I have not the slightest fear in my mind that this Bill is going to do any harm.  I remember an occasion not very long ago when I happened to be in contact with a very prominent leader of the Ulster Unionists.  We started exchanging views on political issues, and he expressed a very remarkable point of view.  I want Deputy Belton to take note of this.  He said: &ldquo;I think if you fellows would go ahead on more extreme lines than you are going you would have my support much more than you are having it at the present time, because we people never stood for compromise.&rdquo;  I do say this, that during all the years when the Moderate Party were in office before we took over control here not one inch did those people advance towards a united Ireland, any more than they would to-morrow if President de Valera dropped this Bill.  That is an outstanding fact, and there is no use whatever in anybody trying to put hypothetical questions in order to score a little debating point.  That is not politics.  Probably Deputy Belton put the same question several times to Deputy Cosgrave when he was his leader.  If ever he put that question to Deputy Cosgrave, I should like to <Col N="1335" /> know what was the reply that Deputy Cosgrave gave him.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and please goodness never will be.  I have not the slightest fear that these Bills are going to do the slightest harm.  There are several angles from which this Northern question can be approached. My only quarrel with these Bills, as my colleagues know, is that they have not gone far enough.  I can assure the Deputy that if he had been in Ulster two or three days ago, and moving around amongst the population not only of Nationalists but of Unionists, he would have found a very different Ulster last Wednesday from what he will find next Wednesday. The last week has been an important one in Irish politics.  I can assure Deputies in this House that there are changed mentalities in Ulster to-day as a result of the happenings across the water.  This habit that is growing in this House of Deputies who fancy themselves as leaders coming in here and putting awkward questions to Deputies who happen to have taken a prominent part is not going to advance the cause of the people either north or south.  It may be a clever thing to appear in the newspapers, but certainly it is not going to do any good.  For that reason I would advise Deputy Belton to drop that habit.  His contribution to this debate, as far as I can see, has been a miserable contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He has made the statement that as a result of the introduction of these two Bills we have put up a higher barrier and made the unity of the country more impossible. I deny that, and I deny it with all the emphasis at my command. Whether Deputy Belton, after a visit of one or two days to Ulster, knows more about that particular portion of <Col N="1336" /> Ireland than I do, I leave the House to judge.  I was born and reared amongst them.</P>

At the time when the fight was fiercest here in this country, and before there was any split in the Republican movement, amongst no section of the people was there greater admiration for outstanding Republicans than there was amongst the Protestant young men of the North.  I do not believe these Bills will make the barrier any higher; I do not believe they will do one bit of harm.  I do believe this&mdash;that the average Ulster Unionist, the average Ulster Protestant, always admired the man who knew what he wanted and went out for it.</P>

That is the one overwhelming answer, as I pointed out to-day&mdash;a matter out of which Deputies opposite tried to make capital.

We still have the confidence of the people, notwithstanding all the efforts which have been <Col N="1337" /> made during the last four years, and even up to to-day, including the merger that Deputy Belton himself engineered after sending deputations to Deputy Cosgrave to take him back.  Notwithstanding all those things, we are still here, and in greater numbers than before he became a Spanish General.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.  As Deputies will see, the effect of this section is to delete certain phrases from the Constitution and insert others.  Looking over the Schedule we have, first of all, in Article 2A, the deletion in sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the words, &ldquo;Governor-General acting on the advice of the.&rdquo;  With this deletion it will mean by the Executive Council. In Article 12 we have the deletion of the words, &ldquo;The King and.&rdquo;  The Oireachtas will then consist of Dáil Eireann.  In Article 24 there is the deletion of the words, &ldquo;Representative of the Crown in the name of the King&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;Chairman of Dáil Eireann on the direction in writing of the Executive Council signed by the President of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  That is the Article dealing with the summoning and dissolving of Parliament.  In other words, Parliament in future will be summoned and dissolved by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann acting on the advice and under the direction of the Executive Council signed by the President of the Executive Council. The amendment in Article 41 means that Bills, instead of being signed as formerly by the representative of the Crown on the advice of the Executive Council, will in future be signed by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann and shall become law as from the date of that signature.  In Article 42 there is the deletion of the words, &ldquo;received the King's assent&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words, &ldquo;been signed by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo; That is consequential on the previous changes.  There is also the deletion of the words, &ldquo;Representative of the Crown&rdquo; wherever those words occur and the substitution in every case of the words &ldquo;Chairman of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  That is with regard to the copies of Bills which will be authoritative copies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Article 51 you have the deletion <Col N="1341" /> of the sentence beginning with the words, &ldquo;The Executive Authority&rdquo; and ending with the words, &ldquo;Representative of the Crown,&rdquo; and the deletion of the words &ldquo;aid and advise in the Government,&rdquo; etc., as indicated on the Paper.  The effect of that is to leave the executive authority to be exercised by the Executive Council direct.  Similarly, you have the appointment of Ministers.  Ministers were formerly supposed to be appointed by the representative of the Crown.  In a certain way the President was nominated by Dáil Eireann, but in fact and in truth he was elected, so that in fact and in truth there is no difference.  I never got, and I do not think my predecessors ever got, anything in the nature of a formal appointment or anything of that sort.  It was purely a question of election so far as I have been able to find out.  I do not know what happened exactly in the case of my predecessors, but the fact was that the person elected here was accepted at once without question as the President of the Executive Council.  He selected the persons he proposed to submit to Dáil Eireann to be members of the Executive Council; Dáil Eireann considered whether they would approve of that Executive Council and, when they were approved, they were supposed to be appointed.  I know of no formal act of any kind to say that such and such were appointed.  There was nothing to be said for or against it. In fact, it could not be otherwise.</P>

What advance have we made in freedom except to get rid of a little verbiage, according to the President?  The facts will <Col N="1344" /> not be changed.  As the President knows and believes, in the time of some of his predecessors all the things that he now proposes to do were always, in reality, facts.  What is all the pother about?  What is this all about?  This is the great achievement: to make this Bill palatable to people like the Deputies opposite! Is that the purpose of the Bill?  Is it to throw dust once more in the eyes of the people under the excuse of removing misleading verbiage, and in order to change into obvious realities what are already facts?  Every Schedule the President read out was an admission that there was no increase in the power of this State by what was being done&mdash;not a single new power in the State.  We were told we were summoned to discuss something arising out of the abdication of the King.  I have read the Bill, and I do not know whether or not, when we pass it, Edward VIII will have to be considered as having abdicated in this country.  I do not know, and even the President, when addressing some sarcastic remarks to Deputy MacDermot, did not make it quite clear whether we have still a Governor-General.  I gathered that we are to have him for a short time.  Whom does he represent? Can anyone tell me?</P>

      <P>We are told he is still there.  Does he represent King Edward VIII or the new King? This Bill does not make it clear.  How could a Bill like this make it clear? The President confined himself to reading out certain Schedules which are plain to anyone who has had time to look at the Bill, but he did not explain the effect of what he was doing.  The speech proved one thing up to the hilt, that this nation has <Col N="1345" /> been&mdash;and was when the present Government took over command&mdash;a sovereign State; and that he has not added one whit to the sovereignty of the nation.  Nothing that is proposed to be done here does that.  The President does not even pretend it does. It is a question of formality.  What for?  This nation has suffered, and apparently is going to suffer, from the inability of the President to understand constitutional issues, the value of constitutional machinery as distinct from legal forms.  To him legal forms are much more important, it was quite evident from the President's explanatory statement&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash; than realities, though apparently the legal forms can make obvious realities what are already facts!</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent phrase.  I rarely heard the President's policy summed up so well as in that phrase.  The country has suffered very seriously from that inability of the President to understand the value of a constitutional instrument as distinct from mere legal forms.  I believe that in this Bill, and possibly in to-morrow's Bill, which I cannot discuss now, he is going to sacrifice realities for legal forms.  We are going to be left less free on account of his passion for legal forms, in order to remove verbiage so as to make out facts to be facts! That is the situation we are asked to approve of by voting for this Schedule. I asked the President, and he has not made it clear, why the Governor-General exists even for a short time. Whom does he represent during that short time?  Does he refuse to answer? Is he not clear on the issue?  Does he know the purport of the Bill in that respect?  Quite true, the Governor-General exercises no functions, but it obviously follows from the statement of the President that though he exercises no functions he is still Governor-General of this State.  What has the President done as regards the King? He has taken out all his functions but is he providing that he is not King any more than he is providing that the Governor-General is not Governor-General. We are in a rather peculiar position.  We have the Governor-General <Col N="1346" /> without functions still remaining the Governor-General.  I suggest in the same analogy we will have King Edward the Eighth without functions still remaining King Edward the Eighth as far as we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a certain function for which we are going to provide to-morrow we shall have another King.  Naturally, one is not enough for the Party opposite. They want two Kings! We are getting rid of machinery, of certain constitutional fictions, as, I presume, the President would call them, fictions that he confesses have no reality so far as this State is concerned. and that have not interfered with our freedom.  We are getting rid of these fictions and we are going, or we may be tempted, to put in their place something far more dangerous to our liberties and our freedom, something that might bind us more definitely and clearly.  We are going to sacrifice realities for fictions.  That is the position we are going to get into. Notwithstanding what is urged in certain quarters, this State did make considerable progress in the way of real liberty between 1922 and 1932 in home affairs, and in foreign affairs, as the President knows and also in reference to the Governor-General and his status and functions.  There was real progress.  That cannot be denied.  It was obvious to anyone who had an understanding of the vitality of an instrument like the Treaty that that development was inherent in it. Does the President's constitution develop that further?  There was no necessity for any misrepresentation. The President acknowledges that it happened.  Anyone who reads the President's statement of the &ldquo;tremendous&rdquo; thing he is doing to-day, and compares that with the liberty won, and the achievements between 1922 and 1932, will see that the balance is altogether on the side of the achievements between 1922 and 1932 and that what we are doing now in so far as it is not dangerous, is a mere bauble in comparison with what was done between those years, when every real advance to liberty was opposed, criticised and carped at by those who now admit that the real <Col N="1347" /> facts of the situation were that we had liberty and untrammelled liberty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told in the course of the Second Reading speech for this Bill that there were two reasons for the introduction of the measure, and consequently for the various Articles set out in the Schedule.  One explanation was that if in practice and reality they were to take responsibility for Bill No. 2 they were not prepared to do so unless they had Bill No. 1, which makes quite clear the functions of the King.  We must distinguish in connection with this matter what are described as the functions of the King, on the one hand, and the existence of the King, on the other hand.  In the case of the unprecedented introduction of two such measures as these, we must consider whether what is proposed to be done will be an improvement upon the existing state of affairs.  Judged by that standard, we have to shake our minds free from the entanglements of the slave-mind which appears, so far as one can judge, practically to dominate the majority of the members of this House.  Are we at liberty to consider what are the best methods of providing for the government and control of this country?  If we are, is the scheme before us the best that can be conceived at this particular moment?  Ought it not to concern us, just at the present time, whether another nation is in great travail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we pride ourselves upon our Christianity, we should, at least, have that natural sympathy which one people ordinarily has with another and regret the circumstances which have arisen and which presented us with the question before us now.  What we must consider, whether we like it or not, is that Parliament here has the responsibility of standing over whatever decisions it comes to and that, if a deliberative assembly is going to enact provisions for the proper control and government of this country, it ought to do so on the actual value of these proposals and not because of some events that have happened <Col N="1348" /> in our own lifetime or in the lifetime of our forefathers for which we wish to take revenge or assert our present independence.  Judged by that standard, the alterations proposed to be made are no improvement upon the state of affairs which has existed up to the present.</P>
    <P>When this Parliament re-assembled three or four years ago, there were three parts in the Oireachtas&mdash;the King and two Houses.  There is now left one House.  When this measure passes into law, there will be no outside individual to put his name to a measure.  It rests absolutely at the whim of the majority in this House to change the Constitution and the law inside a seven and a half-hour's sitting. We are told that this is democracy. Is it not a mockery of democracy? Who outside a lunatic asylum could stand for it except he were dominated by a majority such as there is in this House?  In a few years' time will any Deputy be able to look back with pride on what we are doing to-day and say that this change represents an assertion of greater independence than we had before?  What do we mean by the first Article of our own Constitution in which we accept membership of the British Commonwealth?  Are we honest in our acceptance of it?  Is it the spirit of the thing or the letter we are bothering about?  Are we really friendly with South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain?  If we are, it is the spirit of the thing that matters and not the tattered remnants of this Constitution, as it will be decimated.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to this Bill?  We are to have the Dáil dissolved and assembled by the President of the Executive Council and the Chairman of the Dáil.  I presume that no Party outside this House is going to challenge one or the other of them, assuming that the President of the Executive Council advises the Ceann Comhairle to dissolve the Dáil even though he has not got a majority in the House for the purpose.  When I was on the opposite side, I was often told: &ldquo;You will not be always there and recollect that what you are doing now may be done by those who will come after you.&rdquo;  The majority here <Col N="1349" /> at the moment may content themselves with their self-sufficiency, their self-confidence and self-adulation but remember that the headlines they are setting this House to-night will be the subject of consideration by future Parliaments.  It is not in any spirit of mere opposition we draw attention to these matters.  What is the Constitution of this State going to be when this Bill is passed?  Can anybody say what it will be like?  After 14 or 16 years boasting of our independence, of our non-subordination to any other country, of our equality with those other countries, is there a Statute Book in the whole British Commonwealth that can compare in complexity with the Statute Book we have for our single House, notwithstanding our squeamishness about democracy?</P>
    <P>This measure is one which the members of this House will live to regret.  There is neither genius in it nor construction.  It has not even the semblance of what some people will probably apologise for; it is putting the King outside the Constitution and leaving him in the State.  As somebody said, they are not satisfied with even one King.  We have the most royal set of republicans in this country anybody has ever known, and they have served faithfully under three kings.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may intervene again, as we have the privilege on Committee Stage to do so.  It is very interesting to notice the changes which can suddenly come in debates on one subject.  This morning we were being threatened from every direction as to the terrible consequences of what we proposed to do.  I should like to put side by side the speech Deputy O'Sullivan made a few hours ago and the speech he has made just now.  If they were put side by side, these speeches would show at once how play can be made with all this fog and fiction that existed.  At least, there will be clearer thinking when these Bills are through and our people will clearly understand what the position of affairs is.  They will not be subject to threat by people who were very strong at certain times in their statements about the liberty they had.  The <Col N="1350" /> moment the people were going to exercise that liberty, even to the point of getting rid of the symbols, then we were threatened that we were not free.</P>
      <P>References to the &ldquo;slave mind&rdquo; come very badly from the opposite benches because the whole of the arguments of these Deputies to-day were quite inconsistent with any belief in their own freedom or right to do certain things.  We are doing these things because we believe we have a right to do them.  The same threats that were used when the Oath of Allegiance was about to be put aside, and the same threats that were used, to a certain extent, when we were making other changes, because we did not go into negotiation, were repeated to-day and repeated with just as little foundation as on the previous occasions.  The great legal experts who told us what we could do and what we could not do were all proven wrong in the end.  We did not hear much, when put to the test, regarding the effects of the threats made in the other House as to the legal consequences of what we were doing.  What we are doing now will establish a position which will make for better relations, because these relations between the people of this country and people elsewhere will be clearer.  By these Bills, we are laying a foundation on which it will be possible to start at the beginning and establish relations in which all the friction that occurred, just because of these symbols and this fog and misrepresentation, will disappear.  It will be possible to do that when these Bills are passed, and it will never be possible otherwise.  With regard to the Six Counties, we were prepared in 1921 to make certain concessions to the minority if they were prepared to come into a united Ireland at that time.  There is a limit, obviously, to the concessions that the majority of the people down here ought to be asked to make in order to bring in the people from the North.  We are laying the frame-work into which they can come if they want to.  It shows the utmost limit of our concessions.  If, after a certain time, they do not come, the Irish people will constitutionally be at liberty to take any other line of action they please.</P>

      <P>We are told that we are doing this because we believe that we have the right to do it.  Is not that magnificent?  If there is no better justification than that for this measure, does it not absolutely prove the petulancy that surrounds this whole business. Let me admit at once that I am just as ignorant of constitutional law on this question as the President. I am not concerned with that, but what I am concerned with is that if there be a case when either one of two parties to a Treaty says to the other that he has broken it, it is for the two parties in question to settle that between them.  It is not for an outside party to decide whether one or the other has broken it.</P>
      <P>What is the view of the opposite Party on the Treaty?  Are they standing for it and for its normal development here?  I am not concerned now with legal interpretations or with constitutional law.  I am concerned with the right of one person to say to the other, &ldquo;You have broken it,&rdquo; and of the other person to say &ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; and for the two of them then to come together and hammer out between them an agreement for a new Treaty to settle the question once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards my attitude towards the Treaty, it has been expressed thousands of times in this House as well as out of it, and in despatches to the British Government which have been published.  That Treaty, as far as I am concerned, was imposed by force, and it imposes no moral obligation on the Irish people. But leaving that to one side, the question is whether the actions which we are taking can be construed as breaches of that Treaty in itself.  I say they cannot.  We have heard here to-day two or three different interpretations of the Treaty.  One set of Deputies want to say that the Treaty is to be interpreted practically as it was when it was signed, and under the conditions under which it was signed.  Then we hear of constitutional advances in 1926 and in 1931.  I want to say with regard to these that they were hardly made when I was one of the first to admit that these did constitute a <Col N="1352" /> tremendous advance in regard to the position in the Free State.  I was one of the first to admit it.  The moment the Governor-General ceased to be the instrument of what, in fact, was the Crown, of the British Cabinet as was shown up to that time&mdash;the moment that he ceased to be the instrument of the British Cabinet and became subject to the advice and authority of the Executive Council here, his position was completely changed.  That is true. I admitted it at the time and spoke of it here in the Dáil.  Similarly there was an advance from one point of view at a later stage, not because the Statute of Westminister ran here, but because fundamentally it showed and was a declaratory recognition as far as they were concerned that they had no right to interfere and legislate anywhere.</P>
      <P>I would not be here bringing in these Bills at all if it was not that I felt it to be my duty to see that whatever was in the situation, as long as we were here anyhow, would be maintained. From the day on which I came into the Department of External Affairs, although we came into a situation with the creation of which we had nothing to do, one of the things that I set out for myself was that if we were not able to make a definite advance I was, at least, going to leave the situation in such a position that, if my predecessors came back into office, they would not find, from their point of view, at any rate, a worse position to deal with.  That has been my attitude. There is no one here who has had anything whatever to do with the Department of External Affairs who will not admit that it is very important from our point of view that this situation should be clarified.  They ask what advances we have made.  I say that by the choosing of our symbols and the exercise of our rights, by our standing on the theories that we hold and standing on them against the theories that are held by people elsewhere, we are asserting our liberty and making advances.  The symbols will be here after this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that this is going to be our permanent Constitution.  I have proceeded in this way because I would not take responsibility for <Col N="1353" /> bringing in this Act No. 2 unless I put it in conjunction with Act No. 1, which was going to clarify a situation and clearly define the extent to which the King was going to be used in our regard.</P>

That would come better from people who had made a better instrument than the Treaty, and it is the duty of the President, if he has that in mind, to make such a Treaty. What is the position of the Irish people with regard to the Treaty?  They pronounced their opinion on it four or five times, and even the President did not invite them to repudiate it on the last occasion.</P>

We are used to these statements by the President without documentation, but <Col N="1354" /> we have not yet found one to be accurate.  The President made the point that certain people speaking to-day said that what was being attempted in these Bills was dangerous. I repeat that.  Having said that, I say what we have here is the removal of symbols.  Is there anything contradictory? We are accepting certain association.  We say we do.  Is there inherent in that association the acceptance of certain symbols?  I say there is.  Do those symbols operate adversely on the Irish people?  Do they prevent the representatives of the Irish people being as free in their movements, legislative and executive, as the Government of any other country?  I say there is no impediment.  They are, in fact, symbols, but they are also the sign of our association in a very valuable community.  There is no contradiction in calling these matters symbols and saying there may be threats used against us and something disagreeable in the way of circumstances put upon us because we remove those symbols; there is no contradiction whatever. But there is this to be said, that the President did as much as a man might do&mdash;I think malevolently&mdash;to dissipate through this country this fog about the situation, that these were not symbols, that they were effective handicaps upon the people.  We know the documents that were issued under the President's authority telling us that what might be the constitutional law and practice in Canada, so many thousands of miles away, would not be the law and practice here.  The President fought the Treaty on the ground that the freedom it offered was not real freedom.  He now tells us that it is merely symbols that we are clearing away.  I say they were always symbols; for years past they were merely symbols, since 1926.</P>

      <P>Certain of them began to be cleared away in 1926.  But could we not go through the whole litany of the amazing list of hidden powers the President saw in the Treaty and in the Constitution founded on the Treaty?  Was not there a bogey in every line?  We took the ones that emerged, particularly ones about which <Col N="1355" /> theorists and publicists had commented, and we got a distinct clarification of the new position.  We got the phrase used &ldquo;the new position.&rdquo; Certain people held it was the old position, but we knew that certain principles might often be stated and there might be an attempt to get behind them and operate them in an adverse way.  We knew that the President was going to get his propagandists to work in an attempt to prove that what we knew were symbols were, in fact, definite powers that could be brought into sway to prevent the people functioning in the way they wanted to function.</P>
      <P>What is being done, we are told, is the removal of certain things which in no way impede the free exercise of the people's will through governmental institutions.  But the removal of these symbols may operate to drive us from an association in which I, for one, want to remain.  The President has told us it is not his intention to sever the connection.  He may succeed in doing it; he may be excluded.  He has told us of threats.  He said there were threats about what might happen after the Oath had been removed.  I do not remember definite threats being made, but I remember warnings of the type now being given, were then given.  What were they?  That the British might think what was being done with regard to the Oath was a breach of an agreement.  They have done so.  We said the British might seek in some way to penalise the people for what was being done.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in an article written before the 1932 election, said that that was rubbish.  It is no rubbish whatever.</P>
      <P>Can the President deny that there are in force against us at the moment certain penal duties on goods that flow out of this country to Great Britain, goods that must go there because we have no other opening for them?  Is the keeping on of those penalties the result of the breach of a political agreement? I say it is.  A Deputy asked the question: If there was no threat, no operative threat against us by the British, why was not the economic war brought to a conclusion?</P>

      <P>Is there any part of it in operation?  The President says it has no legal force.  Has it?  I can understand people who will say in a straightforward way &ldquo;This is a bad settlement; it was forced on us and we will have none of it.&rdquo;  What I cannot understand is the attitude of those who say &ldquo;We will work this&rdquo; and in the next breath they tell us that it has no legal or moral force. They accept it and work it but it has no force.</P>
      <P>I want the President to face up to the precise question put by Deputy O'Sullivan: Is the abdication of King Edward recognised in the two measures before us, and, if so, where? Is there a specific clause which recognises that abdication and, if so, which is it?  Is it asserted that the cumulative effect of the first measure, or the first and second measures, is to agree to the abdication of that person? Surely we can have that answered? The second Bill, for the first time in the history of this country, does two things.  It says that the Act of Settlement is Irish law.  If it is, it is not so declared.  It is not declared to come into existence merely by the passage of to-morrow's Bill.  I take it the President's mind is, as disciplined by his legal advisers, that the Act of Settlement is law in this country at the moment.  If so, a certain individual rules in this country under it. How do we oust him?  What clause removes him?  The Abdication Bill has been signed in England to-day. Who will the Governor-General represent? Who will sign this Bill?  Will it be the Governor-General as the King's Irish representative&mdash;will he sign it?</P>

      <P>That Bill, therefore, does not remove King Edward VIII. It is going to be sent to the representative of King Edward VIII. Where is the removal clause in the second Bill?  Surely the situation is what appeared to be put facetiously, that to-morrow night we will have in this country apparently a Governor-General without function, Edward VIII King, but without function, and the new King with a limited function. We have, we are told, a multiplicity of civil servants in this country, but to get to the point where we want a multiplicity of regal personalities is carrying the joke a bit too far.</P>
      <P>The point is one that admits of a precise legal answer.  I had thought the answer that might be given would be that this Bill, the first Bill that we are discussing, by removing all kingly functions, might have been alleged to remove the King, any kings, all kings, and into that gap to-morrow we will put a new King for a limited purpose; but I am told that is not the situation, that the Bill does not remove King Edward.  The President assented to that, that the Bill does not remove King Edward.  Does the other Bill do it?  We will certainly have to get that matter explained, if not in this debate, certainly in the other.</P>
      <P>The President is very anxious that whether there be advances or not by him he will leave his successors in no worse position.  I alluded to that to-day.  The people of this country might be left in a worse position by either of two sets of circumstances operating.  There might be something new brought into a constitutional scheme, something new brought into law which would have an effect not of a limited duration.  But there might outside that be engagements and commitments entered into by a Government, which could not be removed by a new Government.  Does the President say that what is now being done on our west coast has nothing to do with defence and has nothing to do with the British Islands' defence? Does the President say that his remark that this country would never be used as a stepping-off ground for enemies of England against England means no commitment?</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but the facts speak to the contrary.  I have heard people arguing about the Treaty and what are the good terms and the bad terms in it.  I know there is a school of thought which holds that these Articles which allow British maintenance parties to be in possession of certain parts of our coasts are the worst parts of the Treaty because they give an enemy in time of war at least this, a legitimate excuse under international law for attacking us.  Does the President say here that his new engagements in regard to the wireless matter on the West coast, and his engagements with regard to the aerial service, do not give an enemy a better opportunity or a better excuse for attacking us in time of war?  If he does, he speaks without any knowledge of history as apart from law.  But in law, there is also an advance, or a retrogression.  The President, if he left office to-morrow, will not leave a situation as unembarrassed to his successor as the one which he got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the President means by his references to the Statute of Westminister.  Nobody here asked that it should be enacted in this country.  It was a British Act. It was to clear up British doubts and to prevent British judges holding a certain view which they might otherwise have taken in regard to certain constitutional relations; but there is this, apart from the Statute of Westminister, that the President, by the Bill we are to discuss to-morrow, does say that the Act of Settlement is Saorstát law.  Under its operation, a certain person reigns at this moment. When does he stop and by reason of <Col N="1359" /> what clause in either of these two Bills?</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy MacDermot has gone.  He intervenes in this House occasionally to read to the Deputies of this House lectures as to what happened in the years during which he was regrettably an absentee from this country.  There is a phrase used in one of the newspapers this morning with regard to the tragic incident, or the incident which developed so tragically, in England.  It was a classical quotation&mdash;<i>mulier peregrina vertit in pulverem.</i>  The <i>peregrina</i> touch suits Deputy MacDermot.  If Deputy MacDermot had his feet more often on the soil of this country and gave a little more time and attention to the recent history of this country, he would find it impossible to make the statement he made here to-night that there was no advantage gained between the years 1922 and 1931 in our arrangements by treaty with Great Britain and our constitutional proceedings here.  I cannot speak any further about him in his absence, but let me say that that speech proceeds from a depth of ignorance which I thought I had previously plumbed, but to which I now realise the impossibility of getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The President says there will be clearer thinking after all this is over and he also prided himself on the position he occupied in that, whatever he did, when he handed over to somebody else to follow him in the office of President of the Executive Council here, no harm would have been done.  On the question of clearer thinking, the President certainly left nothing undone, in my opinion, to get clear thinking on one particular aspect of what he is doing, because on no fewer than eight occasions in speaking here to-day he said that what was being done by this legislation was showing what the true position in this country was.  He charged Deputies on this side of the House that they could never have believed what they said with regard to the freedom we possess in this country or they would not oppose what he is doing here.  He said that we should welcome it as showing what the true <Col N="1360" /> position is.  Again, he said that in these two Bills &ldquo;We are giving expression to the position as it is to-day.&rdquo;  For the third time, he said: &ldquo;This is making clear what is the fundamental position in practice&rdquo;; for the fourth time, he said: &ldquo;We propose to continue the King for the functions which he in fact directly exercises&rdquo;; for the fifth time, he said: &ldquo;From the King is being taken away any function, direct or indirect, in this country&rdquo;; for the sixth time, he said: &ldquo;What we are doing is clearly setting down what the conditions are so that there can be no misrepresentation of them&rdquo;; for the seventh time, he said: &ldquo;The effect of it is to eliminate the King from all these Articles of the Constitution which seem to give him functions here in our internal affairs&rdquo;; and for the eighth time: &ldquo;The fact is that we are making clear the position as it is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here we have a position in which he says, in his own phrase, which Deputy O'Sullivan has emphasised, that he is making no change, that he is providing us with a written law which states exactly what the position is.  Much has been suggested as to progress made between 1922 and 1926 and between 1926 and 1929, but I would ask the President, or any of the persons who were associated with him in his fight against the Parliament set up here in 1922, and in his absentee attitude to the Parliament that existed here up to 1927, where is there any function that the King had in this country in 1923 that he had not got in 1935?  The President said that he was not prepared to introduce Bill No. 2 unless Bill No. 1 went along with it. Bill No. 1 is simply a piece of the fog the President complains about, introduced as a kind of cover to keep off his flank the criticism of people like Seán Russell outside and certain members of his own Party whom his own misrepresentations of earlier years drove to fight against this Parliament, to repudiate its authority and to adopt the attitude which they continued of misrepresenting its sovereignty and its powers to the people until they got into office themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was all the past about?  If the position is as the President states to-day, <Col N="1361" /> that this tells us what the position exactly is, the clearing up that was done in the past was certainly not the clearing up and the stopping of any actual powers of interference on behalf of the Crown in this country, because I again challenge the President, the Attorney-General or any of his Party to say what powers the Crown had in this country in 1923 that it had not in 1935.  Deputy Donnelly says that the plans and policies affecting union with the North, etc., that were good enough nine years ago are not good enough now.  I am sure they are not because Deputy Donnelly will remember that nine years ago the present Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were examining the situation for the purpose of informing the Vice-President, who was then in America, and strengthening the hands of the Vice-President in America for the purpose of getting money out of the American people.  They were examining the military situation here and the military situation here was that Deputy Donnelly and the President had only 15,000 men.  There was the Free State Army of 18,000 to be beaten and then the situation had to be consolidated here.  There was an army of 30,000 Specials in the North to be beaten, and five battalions of infantry, and then there was the British Army to be taken on, and as a result conversations and deputations to Russia to gain military experience were being arranged.</P>
    <P>The present policy is a milder one. According to Deputy Donnelly, it is a happier one; it is a more powerful one, even though he found out from some of his Unionist acquaintances in the North of Ireland that what was wrong with Fianna Fáil policy in the eyes of the Unionists, and what was keeping them from getting more Unionist help, was its mildness.  I should like to know from Deputy Donnelly&mdash;he has a different plan from this&mdash;how many degrees east of this proposal and how many degrees west of the Russian and 1925 proposal his plans go.</P>

      <P>The point I am bringing out is that whereas we had grave destruction in this country, loss of life and repudiation of Parliamentary institutions, with all that followed in their train, there was no ground for them according to the President to-day. Eight times running he tells us that these proposals here are to show what the position actually is at the present time.  I challenge the President and his followers to show what difference exists between the position of 1936 and 1935 and the position of 1923.  Again the President says that he is going to leave this country in no worse position than he found it.  One thing that makes me almost speechless, in face of the antics of the Fianna Fáil Party, is the tragic occurrences that have happened in this country without any of the excitement of special meetings summoned <Col N="1363" /> by telegram, without any guillotine to push Government proposals through the Dáil for alleviating the position.  We had the position disclosed, a position that was perfectly known to the Ministry, of a fall in agricultural production of £25,000,000. We had the revelation when the census returns were issued this year, that the population of this country was 50,000 below the figure they expected it to be. We had also disclosed, a couple of weeks ago, the enormous rise in emigration from this country.  These figures show that 36,000 people emigrated from this country in the first nine months of this year.  We had that fact unexpectedly disclosed by the British Board of Trade Returns but there was no special summoning of Parliament to deal with it.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fagan pointed out, the question that is affecting this country more than anything else, is the sufferings our people are undergoing as a result of the economic war.  These conditions are forced on this country simply because of the political antics of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The political antics of the Fianna Fáil Party in introducing measures like this, are antics which, while they are not of the same kind, have the same effect as the antics of 1922 and 1923.  Their antics in 1922 and 1923 involved this country in destruction amounting to £30,000,000 as well as loss of life.  Their antics in connection with the present proposals and their policy for the past few years have cost this country £25,000,000 by the fall in agricultural production. Their policy has resulted in a loss of 36,000 people to this country in the first nine months of this year.  The loss has been increasing every year since they came into office.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has before him to-day with the exception of those for one industry, namely, coach-building&mdash;and he has probably the figures for that too&mdash;the results of the Census of Production for 1935.  After four years of intensive efforts with all the machinery of an absolutely free and sovereign Parliament to develop industrial production, all the increase he can show in net output is £2,500,000. That return is inflated by bounties on bacon, woollens and linens sent abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> He knows that in the three years from 1926 to 1929 when, according to the Fianna Fáil Party from front bench to back bench, there was a Government in this country that could do nothing for the country, there was a net increase of £1,500,000 odd in industrial production.  So that in three years, in a normal way, under conditions in which you had a natural growth in the country, you had an increase in production of £1,500,000. After four years of intensive work by the present Government, with a squandering of State money in all directions, inflated as the amount is by fictitious figures, by moneys taken from the pockets of the taxpayers and handed over to industrialists, by the payment of bounties on bacon, woollens and linens sent to Great Britain, industrial production here shows an increase of, probably less than £2,500,000.  And why?  Because, instead of being concerned with the real interests of the country, instead of dealing with the things that will have an effect on the well-being of the country, the President is merely concerned about whitewashing himself and his followers.  The result is that we get this kind of measure and we get a continuance of the industrial and economic conditions that exist in this country.  Then the President tells us: &ldquo;Stick to the language and learn Irish,&rdquo; at a time when this country is being bled so much economically, when it is so bedevilled with false antics and misrepresentations of men's characters and men's actions, misrepresentations of our neighbours, their outlook and their actions, that we have no real cultural outlook at all or no character on which a sound cultural outlook can be founded.  The character on which only a sound cultural outlook can be built, is being destroyed.</P>

We want to establish international relations of a proper kind so as to enable our people to develop our resources and to develop a true Irish culture, an Irish and a Christian civilisation.  Nothing else matters.  And the things that this Bill most affects in this country are the economic condition of our people, the character of our people and our cultural future. To-day in the Irish-speaking districts, the greater part of our people in the Irish-speaking districts are kept up on the dole, with an odd fourpenny voucher for free meat, and we are taking some of these people from the Gaeltacht and bringing them to Meath and putting them on good land there, at enormous expense to the State, and the result of that is that in 12 months they are not able to pay their rates.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, this section.  It proposes that the fact enshrined in Section 2 A of the Constitution shall be made an obvious reality.  Everyone of these things that deals with things that are symbols, that the President says we do not want&mdash;he does not inform us what the symbols are that we do want&mdash;but these symbols that we do want are the symbols of economic well-being in this country, of decent living and upright character in this country, and, the greatest symbol, the Irish language, as the living speech of our Irish people. We are concerned with this Bill in that this Bill prevents the Irish-speaking colonies, which are being brought to Meath and put on good land there at enormous expense to this country, from making a living there because agriculture is reduced by the President's agricultural policy to a position in which agriculture is getting £25,000,000 a year less out of the land than it was getting before the President found it necessary to develop this particular type of constitutional policy as a means of whitewashing his face for the losses brought to this country when he made war on the Parliament here and war on the people here, alleging that there was a foreign monarch with <i>de facto</i> powers here of interfering with the people of this country, which he now admits never existed, because he is introducing a measure here which he tells us, eight times running, and again in ten additional comments in the Schedule to this Bill, never existed in the country.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to hear from the President what are the symbols that he talks about that our people want, and we are entitled to hear from him what steps he has taken to ascertain what the reactions of this measure are going to be on the symbols I have mentioned: the economic well-being of our people, their culture and their welfare, and the Irish language, because it seems to me that the silence on the Fianna Fáil Benches shows that they know, so far from doing the good of which the President speaks, this Bill is going to do continued harm, a harm that will be continuous to the harm that has followed his misrepresentation and his pretence from the time he began in 1922.</P>

      <P>Those of us who criticise this Bill have been making, as it seems to me, a very modest and humble request to the President that he should ascertain and consider what its consequences would be.  His reply is that to make such a request of him is to be an enemy to Irish freedom, and the short point that he has to answer is: Is it really inconsistent with freedom for a man to consider what the likely consequences of his act are going to be?  This is not a question of interpretation of the Treaty. I should make the same point if there had been no Treaty.  The situation is that we are going to change fundamentally the whole framework of our association with the British Commonwealth, or are going to attempt to change that framework, and surely it is not a matter of sacrificing principle &mdash;it is a matter of the merest common-sense to find out in advance how the other people affected are going to take it.</P>
      <P>The President must have got some inkling from the British when he communicated with them months ago about leaving out the King from our Constitution&mdash;he must have got some inkling from them surely as to how they were going to take that and as to what they were going to do about it: whether they would make up their minds for themselves upon it or whether they would leave it over for the Imperial Conference next May to decide.  Whatever it was, surely we have a right&mdash;surely the House has a right and surely the country has a right to have that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, at the close of his speech when, unfortunately, I was not in the House, Deputy McGilligan complained of my having asserted that there had been no constitutional advances between the Treaty and the coming into office of the present Government.  I made no such assertion. I quite agree that there were advances.  What I did say, in reference to Deputy Costello's speech, was that I believed he exaggerated the value of that advance.  I said that the advances were implicit in the terms of the Treaty and the first two Articles of our Constitution, and that they consisted rather in a gradual <Col N="1368" /> clarification than, as he said, in a fundamental change in the whole fabric of our Constitution.</P>

      <P>I would say it was of great importance, but I would not say that it was a fundamental change, because it was included and implicit in the terms of the Treaty, and it seems to me that these boasts of fundamental change are both misleading and an error of tactics.  I said in passing that they played to a certain extent into the President's hands, even though I admit the difference between attempting to do such things by consent and doing them by unilateral action.  I think it is absurd to represent what I said as a denial of theoretical advances of which we have heard dozens of times already in this House and with which every man in the street is, to a considerable extent, familiar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view that the Bill before the House is a serious one.  As presented by the President to the House, it is put on two different footings.  I may not have followed him, but I endeavoured to do so. He told the House that the Bill now before us is the price which he demands&mdash;I do not say that these are his exact words&mdash;for the Bill which he proposes to introduce to-morrow.  The unpalatable, and the price must be exacted to-day by the passage of the present Bill.  If so, it is a matter of importance, and I think the House is entitled to know more clearly than it has heard up to the present what the effect of it is considered to be.  So far as we have heard anything about the effect of it, we are told that it simply removes from the Constitution a set of fictions.  If that be so, it is difficult to know why <Col N="1369" /> it is put through, in circumstances like the present, as a matter of extreme urgency.  I do not think it is a matter of the removal of fictions.  Examining the Bill, in the time that I and the House have had in which to do it, it would seem to me that the effect of it is to remove the King from the Constitution, and to give to this country a republican Constitution. That may or may not be a desirable thing.  Before doing it, I understood that the country and the House were to be given an opportunity of considering what the effects of it might be.  I think, before the House is asked to pass such a measure, the House ought to know what its reactions are going to be upon the Commonwealth of which we are told we are still to remain a member.</P>
      <P>I think that that is a fair reading of the Bill, that there is no King in the Constitution, though we are told&mdash; by what means it is achieved I know not&mdash;that although there is no King in the Constitution there still is a King in the State.  That seems to me to be something incomprehensible.  I entirely fail&mdash;it may be my fault&mdash;to understand how a State can be organised with a written Constitution, a fundamental law, from which every mention of the King or the King's representative must be taken, and, even where a reference is made to somebody performing the functions of a King, the word &ldquo;King&rdquo; is taboo and the word &ldquo;organ&rdquo; is used.  The President has said that the use of the words &ldquo;organ&rdquo; or &ldquo;constitutional organ&rdquo; is a more appropriate way of describing the King.  I venture to say that the choice was deliberately made, in order that the Government Party outside this House might say to their supporters that they had struck the King out of the Constitution.  They therefore funked&mdash;if I may use a vulgar term&mdash;the word &ldquo;King&rdquo; and substituted the synonym &ldquo;organ&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>The President already made that point.  If the President says that the word &ldquo;organ&rdquo; was used in the amendment to Article 51 because it seemed to him to be the most suitable <Col N="1370" /> word, if he will say that the name &ldquo;King&rdquo; was not consciously and deliberately avoided, I suppose we will accept it, though it is difficult to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's point would be better taken if, in to-morrow's Bill, where the same provision is made in the same term, the vexatious word &ldquo;King&rdquo; is faced up and used, and what is described as &ldquo;organ&rdquo; to-night is named as &ldquo;King&rdquo; to-morrow, because to-morrow, having paid the price to-day, the Bill will be swallowed. It is remarkable that although Deputies on the other side of the House are as numerous as Deputy Donnelly told us at an early stage to-day, not one of them made any contribution to to-night's debate, with the single exception of Deputy Donnelly, who, if I may say so without disrespect, indulged in one of his usual comedian speeches which he does so well.  I think that his contribution&mdash;being the only contribution from the Government side of the House other than that of the President, and consisting of cheap jibes at Deputy Belton, for whom I hold no brief; he does not need anybody to hold a brief for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was a very poor contribution to what I take to be a serious matter requiring serious consideration by this House.  It seems to me&mdash;I may be wrong; the President has not made the matter clear, but perhaps he will make it clear before the House is asked finally to pass this Bill&mdash;that when this Bill is passed the Irish Free State will be without a King as part of its Constitution.  That may be to some members of the House a desirable state of affairs, but let it be understood. I take it that if I am wrong, and if when we leave this House to-night there is a King forming any part of our Constitution, forming any part of the Government of this State, that King is His Majesty King Edward VIII, and I take it that he is King of the Irish Free State until we take further steps to-morrow.  This debate has been conducted&mdash;probably because <Col N="1371" /> the speakers have not been members of the Government Party&mdash;without any criticism or any unsympathetic reference to the difficulty of Great Britain, and I certainly do not propose to make any criticism of the position there, or to say anything which could be considered disrespectful either to His Majesty King Edward VIII or to his successor.  Certainly this House is entitled to know what will be the position to-night and to-morrow.  It may be a technical point that we may make right to-morrow afternoon; I know not.  But you can test the reality of these proceedings by asking yourselves: &ldquo;Have we a King?  If so, who is he?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I venture to submit to this House that it is quite impossible for anybody who has a sense of reality to regard the internal relations of a State separate and distinct from its external relations.  A State must have its organisations.  It must have its Executive.  It must have its representatives abroad.  Its Executive has duties to perform within and without the State.  It is, I would suggest, absurd to say that we can deal to-day with the internal Constitution of the State, and to-morrow make separate provision for our external relations. There is no sense in it.  No man who is not a twister and a quibbler in words could possibly face up to such a situation, and that is the situation we are confronted with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one way of testing the ill-considered nature of the present proposals. There are others; I will only refer to one.  I do not know whether it has been considered&mdash;I certainly think it has not been sufficiently considered &mdash;what are the provisions to be made in the future for the summoning and dissolution of Dáil Eireann?  We now know that the Oireachtas and Dáil Eireann are synonymous terms.  We are asked to make an amendment to Article 24 of the Constitution by which the Oireachtas&mdash;that is Dáil Eireann &mdash;shall be summoned and dissolved by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann, on the direction, in writing, of the Executive Council, signed by the President.  Has it been considered that when Dáil <Col N="1372" /> Eireann is dissolved, the Chairman of the Dáil, as a functionary, ceases to have existence?  Has it been considered how the Dáil is to be summoned by the non-existent functionary&mdash;the Chairman of Dáil Eireann.  The position of the Chairman, I think, is perfectly plain.  By the Constitution Amendment Act of 1927 the member of Dáil Eireann who is Chairman of Dáil Eireann immediately before the dissolution of the Oireachtas shall, unless before such dissolution he announces to Dáil Eireann that he does not desire to continue to be a member thereof, be deemed without any actual election to be elected in accordance with this Constitution at the ensuing general election as a member of Dáil Eireann.  The late Chairman of the Dáil comes into the succeeding Dáil as a member of the Dáil and not as Chairman of the Dáil.  By the act of dissolution when the Chairman of the Dáil ceases to exist with the Dáil of which he is Chairman there is no provision for the summoning of the new Dáil.  It may be said that that can be met in a new way.  That is possible.  Here we are asked to swallow to-night after a seven hours' debate, a Bill which has not been fully considered, a Bill which the members of the House other than the Government Party and probably only the members of the Executive Council had an opportunity of seeing only this morning.  I suggest that that is only one of the many difficulties that may be found in the working out of this ill-considered, hasty and unnecessary piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>When Deputy McGilligan rose to speak for the first time on this Bill, members might have been at a loss to establish the connection between his opening statement and the matter under discussion.  The House will recollect that he began by stating that a fortune awaited the man who could discover some means of dispelling fog or mist.  The speech to which we have just listened, when considered with the speeches from the Opposition benches which preceded it, <Col N="1373" /> explains Deputy McGilligan's preoccupation with a commercial fog dispeller.  Because it is quite clear from that speech&mdash;for I presume that Deputy McGilligan has been taking counsel with the learned legal luminaries who decorate the benches opposite&mdash;that in the counsels of his Party there is at the present moment a very thick fog and a very heavy fog. Deputy Lavery has just told us that he takes the view that this Bill is dangerous.  That great authority upon constitutional law, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, who I think opened the debate for the Opposition on the Second Reading of this Bill, declared that what this Bill is doing is a mere bauble in comparison with what was done in those years when every advance to liberty was opposed.  So we have Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan, the Deputy who is leading Deputy Lavery on the Front Bench, declaring that this Bill is a mere bauble in comparison with what has been attempted and done while Deputy Lavery declares that it is a dangerous Bill.  Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald, another great authority on constitutional law and practice, in so far as I could follow him or follow the drift of his remarks, was apparently contending that this Bill would do nothing to oust the King from the Constitution.  I think he was followed on these lines by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, another great authority on constitutional law and practice.</P>

I hope when the Deputy gets the fog dispeller he will turn it like a fire extinguisher upon the ranks of his colleagues and get them to clear their minds as to what the Bill does or does not do.</P>

      <P>Well, Deputy Morrissey gave neither light nor leading Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan said that the purpose of this Bill was to remove verbiage in order to make obvious the results that are facts.  If that be the purpose of the Bill&mdash;and Deputy O'Sullivan says it is&mdash;what justification have the Opposition for opposing a measure which proposes to remove verbiage?  I can quite readily understand Deputy Dillon wanting to retain the verbiage.  He revels in it. So does Deputy McGilligan, even though he is a trifle acidulated on occasions.  But why do the strong silent men behind these two over-articulate Deputies walk into the division <Col N="1375" /> lobbies in order to prevent the Government from removing verbiage? Why are they trying to prevent us from removing verbiage the removal of which will make obvious what are the facts?  Surely if there is one service the Government can do it is to clarify this matter for the people.  If we are trying to do that why should we be opposed by the silent ranks opposite? They have no regard for verbiage. They do not get up and talk as interminably as Deputy Dillon talks.  They do not get up and talk as offensively as Deputy McGilligan does nor as confusedly as Deputy Mulcahy talks.  They sit here and try to understand.  But why should they not have the wits to try and make clear to the understanding of the people what our Constitution really means.  According to John Marcus O'Sullivan that is just precisely what we are trying to do to-night by this Bill.  They are trying to stop us from pruning from the Constitution the useless verbiage which now conceals the real facts of our constitutional position.</P>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy O'Sullivan's statement does the Opposition justice.  I am sure that somehow or other they must think this Bill does make a change.  We are told that, if it does make a change, then the event of an abdication is not a fit occasion to make the change.  But every abdication that has marked the course of English history has marked a constitutional change and a constitutional advance. If we feel that this is the time when such an advance should be made, why should we not take it, particularly if, as we have been told a dozen times over, all power and all authority in this country rests in this House and in this country's people? Deputy McGilligan was one of those who stated that we were, in fact, doing nothing except dispelling the fog which has been created by years of misrepresentation.  Surely it is beneficial at any rate to dispel the fog. Why does Deputy McGilligan want to retain the fog here, just as Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan wants to retain the verbiage?</P>

      <P>That is not my fault.  I am prepared to sit for another half-hour.  We have here, that as soon as a Bill is passed the Chairman of Dáil Eireann is to sign such a Bill and, thereupon, it becomes law. The next Article of the Constitution says that, as soon as it has been signed by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann, two copies are to be made and one of these is to be signed by the Chairman and that is law. Apparently, he signs three times and twice it is declared to be law.  Which is it to be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>I want to put one last point.  Article 51 used to run in the form that executive authority is hereby declared to be vested in the King and shall be exercisable, etc. That is cut out.  The phrase we are now going to have is that there shall be a council to exercise the executive authority and power.  In whom is the executive authority vested?  There used to be a vesting of the executive power in the King.  The King has not been removed entirely from the Constitution. Remember the phrase, &ldquo;His Majesty,&rdquo; is still in the Constitution. It still occurs in one amending Article of the Constitution and possibly is kept alive for constitutional purposes. So that, if there was an attempt to take out the name everywhere it occurred, it has failed.  &ldquo;His Majesty in Council&rdquo; occurs once in the Constitution still, no matter what clearing has been done.  It may be in a restrictive Article but it is still there. There is.  I think, a maxim that will be regarded by the Attorney-General, that whatever is expressed has a certain <Col N="1378" /> reaction upon things about which there is silence.</P>
      <P>We used to say that the executive authority vested in the King.  We now do not vest it anywhere.  Where does it reside?  We make allowance for its execution.  We have asked already, from this side of the House, whether King Edward still remains. I think he still remains as the repository of the executive authority.  It may not be intended that way, but is not that the situation?  Where do we say that the King shall not have the authority vested in him?  Remember, we still accept the Treaty with two Articles in it, and these Articles indicate a certain constitutional relationship as between the King or his representative and a Government.  That, undoubtedly, through the rest of the Commonwealth, means that the executive authority is vested in the monarch.  In explicit terms that has not been said not to be the effect here.  We have removed the phrase which implemented what was in the Treaty That being the situation, I hold that the matter is still there.</P>

      <P>That is my reply to the Deputy&mdash;that the executive power rests with the people.  I may say that in my opinion Deputy Lavery has made a very important point&mdash;a point that touches a matter in this Bill that I could not assure the House is free from doubt.  I take the line of greater caution.  I propose to yield to the view expressed by Deputy Lavery, that there is at least a doubt as regards this and, with your permission, Sir, I will ask to move at this stage an amendment to Article 24.</P>
