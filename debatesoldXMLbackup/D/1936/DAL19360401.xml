      <P>Complaints have been received from time to time regarding shortage of water in a stream at Clonmore, near Cahir, County Tipperary, arising from a diversion to augment the Cahir town water supply.  The supply of water to Cahir Military Barracks, which is in the charge of the Commissioners of Public Works, is derived from the source of this stream.  Inspections which have been made disclose that the shortage of water in the stream is not occasioned by the Barrack supply, as the diversion complained of is upstream of its intake, and consequently the Commissioners of Public Works have no functions in the matter, which would appear to be one for the owner of the Cahir town water supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's two questions relative to allotments on the Lowe estate, County Tipperary.  The applications of Michael Bourke and James Kavanagh for parcels of land on the Lowe estate received due consideration by the Land Commission, but it was not found possible to make provision for allotments to these two applicants. The loss of their employment by these applicants did not arise from the taking over of the untenanted lands in this matter by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, would the Parliamentary Secretary state if it was not possible to provide holdings for James Kavanagh who had given more than 12 years' service on the estate, under the last owner, and for Michael Bourke who worked on the estate all his life from the time he was a boy.  How was it possible to find accommodation for people who never had any interest in the estate and were brought in there from outside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the ex-employees, Michael Bourke was taken into employment by the Holy Ghost Fathers who purchased portion of the estate from the previous owner, and was only disemployed for some time previous on the taking over of the estate.  With regard to the other ex-employee, James Kavanagh, he had only been in the employment of the former owner since 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Michael Bourke worked all his lifetime on the estate?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say if the Land Commission propose to depart from their usual practice of providing some alternative means of livelihood for those who lose their employment as the result of the Land Commission taking over the estate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Increases were not given to the postmen, grade &ldquo;B,&rdquo; at Class III offices&mdash;in which the offices mentioned in the question are included&mdash; as the existing rates of pay were considered adequate having regard to the nature and responsibilities of the work performed.  It was considered that the responsibility attaching to the work of post office clerks and postmen, grade &ldquo;A,&rdquo; at these offices warranted the increases given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say why the degree of difference has been widened in this case?  Why is there a difference of 4/- as between the places mentioned in the question and other places, like Cobh and Bray, in view of the fact that there was only a difference of 3/- in the basic rate prior to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in the debate on the Estimates, it is because of the classification of the different offices.  I might mention&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Norton will bear me out &mdash;that the union, apparently, approves of such difference, because when they were putting their claim in they were prepared to widen the gap more. Although I was not prepared to say whether it was good or bad, while the Estimate was on, the union apparently considered it a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there are claims in his Department, extending over a period of years, asking for the complete abolition of the classification of offices in this way?  Is he aware that the Post <Col N="683" /> Office is the only State Department that classifies its staff on the basis of offices, in which they are employed, and that no other Civil Service Departments classify their employees on that basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that, seeing that the union have approved of it, and recognise it, there must be something in it as they actually wanted to widen it.  They claim that Class I office should be 54/- and Class III, 45/-. That is a difference of 9/-, whereas the existing difference is only 6/-, the difference between 40/- and 34/-.  When the union asked for that, they recognised there was something in it.  I recognise there is need for giving more to people in big towns or cities where the cost of living is higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise any charges on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof and any payments (including any loan) out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas that are necessary in carrying into effect any Act of the present Session to make further and better provision in relation to assurance business and persons carrying on that business or any branch thereof, to make provision for the formation and registration of a company having for its principal object the reinsurance of insurance business, and to make provision for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question on the money resolution. The amalgamation proposals contained in the Minister's draft Bill, and contained in the Bill as it will be amended after the Government amendments are adopted, if they are adopted, seem to have given rise, and I think legitimately, to considerable anxiety in Irish insurance circles.  A great many people interested in this problem feel that the amalgamation proposals put forward by the Minister are not going to meet the situation they are designed to deal with.  I would be glad, therefore, if the Minister on this money resolution would state in principle whether he is prepared to consider alternative amalgamation schemes which may be brought under his attention between now and the Recommittal Stage of the Bill.  It is a futile procedure in my view to attempt to redraft the amalgamation proposals by amendment of the existing scheme, because following that cumbersome procedure would result in a half-baked scheme emerging which might not be efficient for any purpose. <Col N="685" /> But if the Minister indicated his readiness to consider on its merits any independent proposal put up by the Irish insurance companies I believe such proposal would be forthcoming and the purpose of the Opposition certainly would be to co-operate in any way in making alternative proposals that would be more acceptable to all those interested, effective in the Act as finally emerging from the Oireachtas. I would like to know from the Minister if he feels that schemes of the kind I suggest might be profitably pursued for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am prepared to consider any proposals put to me, but I do not know that any proposals bearing upon the amalgamation scheme, as the Deputy calls it, are likely to be forthcoming which I have not already seen.  I am certainly very doubtful whether I am likely to get any proposals preferable to those contained in the Bill.  But, on the narrow question whether I am prepared to consider such proposals, I certainly am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty has been this so far, I think, that discussions were going on and it was desired to bring under the attention of the Minister a proposal which would command the unanimous support of all the existing Irish companies.  It was felt better, however, not to trespass upon his time with any scheme assuming that there was a prospect of getting a unanimous suggestion; but, in the event of the insurance companies failing to be unanimous on any given scheme, I understand from the Minister now that he would be interested to see a proposal proceeding from any one of them, or any group of them, with a view to dealing with the problem we have under consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill in its present form applies only to the classes of insurance business defined in the Act of 1909, as amended by the Road Traffic Act of 1933.  There appears, however, to be a good case for extending the provisions of the Bill so as to include certain other classes of business which are set out in the amendment.  The classes of business set out in the amendment are important, and I think it is desirable, in the interests of insurers, that the same provisions in respect of control and supervision should apply to them as to the classes of business defined in the 1909 Act.  I notice that other Deputies have moved amendments to similar effect, and there appears to be a general opinion that it is desirable that all these classes <Col N="687" /> of business set out in the amendment should be brought subject to the control and supervision which the Bill proposes should apply to other classes of general insurance business.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 9, after the word &ldquo;life&rdquo; to insert the words and brackets &ldquo;(other than superannuation allowances and annuities payable out of any funds applicable solely to the relief and maintenance of persons engaged or who have been engaged in a particular profession, trade, or employment or of the dependents of such persons) and also including contracts which are attached to or dependent on contracts of assurance on human life and under which the assurer has no right of cancellation and which provide for the payment of moneys in case of fatal or other accident to or disease of the assured.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment effects two changes. The object of the first part, that is, the part set out in brackets, is to exempt from the provisions of the Bill such staff pension funds, superannuation funds and the like as are not life assurance business within the meaning of the Act of 1909.  In such institutions as banks and railways, there are mutual funds which have been established for the benefit of, and are confined to, the staffs concerned who make periodical contributions, entitling them or their dependents to pensions or other benefits, and it is not intended that the provisions of the Bill should apply to such funds.  The second part of the amendment deals with accident benefits attaching to life policies.  Many life assurance policies include provision for the payment of benefits on accident or disability.  They are distinguished from ordinary accident policies by the fact that they form part of a life assurance, and are not <Col N="689" /> subject to cancellation by the insurer. In the case of an ordinary accident policy, the insurer can cancel when renewal is due.  If we do not effect this amendment, the other provisions of the Bill, requiring the separation of life assurance from general insurance business, would prevent life companies from giving these accident benefits in connection with life policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the accident benefit referred to by the Minister is the kind of benefit which doubles the value of the policy in the event of the holder dying by accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various kinds but there are a number of life policies which provide for certain payments in the case of accident or disability, and it is desirable that a life company should be allowed to continue to issue such policies which would otherwise be illegal if this amendment were not effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no objection in principle to what the Minister is doing, except that it seems to me to open a very wide door.  What is there to prevent a company incorporating a life benefit of an infinitesimal size in any given accident policy and thus bring itself within the scope of this amendment and release itself from the obligations of the Bill?  For instance, suppose one insures against accident.  The Minister's intention is to leave that insurance policy outside the scope of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Bill separates life business from general business and prohibits any company which does life business from doing general business.  If this amendment were not inserted, the issuing of life assurance policies containing this accident benefit provision would be illegal because it would mean that a life company was doing accident business. In so far as these assurance policies are effected on the life of the assurer and are not subject to cancellation as an accident policy would be, on renewal, there is no reason why we should prohibit life companies from continuing to do that class of business.</P>

      <P>Suppose a life company wants to do the accident insurance which the Bill prohibits it from doing, and they issue an accident policy with the proviso in it that the policy carries life insurance for 1/- on the occasion of the death of the insured person, or that a part of the normal premium paid for the accident risk shall be sequestered for the purpose of securing the 1/- life benefit? That is, of course, a purely fictitous insurance in so far as the life part of it is concerned.  The effect of that fictitious life value is injected into the accident policy and makes it possible for a life company to issue what is really an accident policy within the terms of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but why should any person take an accident policy in that way?  If he wants an accident insurance policy he can get it.  If he takes a policy of this kind he must effect it upon the basis of a life policy. The person who wanted an ordinary accident policy naturally would go to the company which could issue him such a policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are <i>ad litem</i> on the line.  My suggestion is that in this amendment you are opening a door which the skilful will push more widely open.  This amendment will still be an answer to any proceedings brought by the Minister against a life company for having issued such a policy.  The insured person need never have been informed about the life policy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the insurer says this is one life policy and the life premium is covered by the premium which you pay for your annual accident risk.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

I understand the premiums are sometimes collected by other than authorised collectors such as the wife of an authorised collector during the latter's illness or absence from work.  The companies are anxious that that practice should not be interfered with by a provision which imposes a statutory prohibition against collection by deputies.  That would result in a considerable inconvenience and might interfere with the smooth working of the business in which the collector is engaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are merely defining what constitutes industrial business, and we are defining it as life business in which the premiums are collected at periods of less than two months and by collectors.  The only change we are making is to provide that the premiums must be collected at intervals of less than two months.  The amendment also provides that the premiums must be collected by collectors authorised by the company, &ldquo;by persons authorised in that behalf by the company which carries on such business.&rdquo;  The purpose of the change is to loosen up the rather tight definition in the original section and to provide a definition of industrial assurance business which will not prohibit the making of the collection by a person other than the authorised collector in the circumstances I have described.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The point in the next amendment is that the Deputy seeks a <Col N="693" /> definition which will confine industrial assurance business to business where the premiums are collected at intervals of one week.  There is business which is definitely industrial assurance where the collections are made monthly, and I think it would be a mistake to exempt that business from the control which this Bill proposes to impose. The effect of the amendment is the names of Deputies Keyes and Pattison would be to take this class of business, industrial assurance business, outside the scope of the industrial insurance provisions of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which is consequential on an earlier amendment to which I referred and it provides for the exemption of the business of registered friendly societies and registered trade unions.  It is considered that the exemption, which it was intended to afford in any event, could more appropriately be effected by a provision in this section rather than in the earlier section.  The desirability of exempting that class of business from the provisions of the Bill is clear. Certain trade unions carry on minor forms of insurance.  They may, for instance, insure a worker against the loss of his tools and it is not necessary <Col N="700" /> to have that business brought under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification of this position from the Minister.  The first intention of the Bill appeared to be to bring the trade unions carrying on business which might be described as life insurance business within its scope, making provision for certain forms of exemption, in the case of a union registered in Saorstát Eireann.  It appears that you require a union not so registered to make a deposit as a condition of continuing that kind of business and that condition would apply not merely to unions which definitely do not desire to register but unions which were prevented by the constitutional position here from registering.  I would like the Minister to indicate what is the effect of this amendment on the Bill as first circulated.  I think his own explanation of the thing is rather inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change, except perhaps a minor one.  The Bill as originally circulated excluded from the definition of life assurance business any contracts described as &ldquo;effected by societies and other bodies registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Acts relating to friendly societies or to trade unions.&rdquo;  That has been deleted, and we are proposing to provide here that nothing in this Act shall affect any business lawfully carried on by societies or trade unions registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Acts relating to friendly societies or trade unions.  That widens the scope of the exemption in so far as it extends it to cover business other than life assurance business as defined, but the effect of it is the same and it confines the exemption to business carried on by trade unions registered in Saorstát Eireann. That is, however, a question to which I had given very considerable attention, and it may be necessary to consider it again at a later stage.  There are unions operating here which have been deemed not to be registered in Saorstát Eireann, and the effect of the Bill on those unions has to be considered. I should not like to give the impression that I have arrived at a <Col N="701" /> final conclusion as to the best course to adopt in relation to such unions, but in so far as this amendment is concerned it leaves the position unchanged.  If it is decided to change the scope of the Bill in relation to those unregistered unions it will require another amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to have special provisions for the supervision of that business in an Insurance Bill.  There are, of course, Acts relating to trade unions, but in any event the requirement of a deposit and so forth would be well beyond the capacity of many of the trade unions concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see that there are certain parts of the Bill which would not be applicable to the minor activities of a trade union of an insurance character, but I can see no reason why the activities of a trade union in an insurance enterprise, no matter how small, should not be subject to the same type of supervision that the industrial insurance company or the minor branch insurance which is practised by large companies must submit to.  On the contrary, I think it is a very good thing that any insurance contracts of that character should be under the strictest State supervision. We have got to bear in mind that the men dealing with a trade union insurance enterprise of that kind are of a type most easily victimised because they ordinarily have not the time or <Col N="702" /> the resources to prosecute legal claims against a trade union or insurance company.  Therefore, there should be the utmost vigilance by the State to see that substantial justice is done between themselves and the assuree body.  I think it would be better from the point of view of the trade unions and the members thereof if all insurance activities carried on by a trade union were subject to the closest scrutiny that is provided for any other insurance body in the State.  We quite agree that they would have to be delivered from the necessity of putting up big deposits such as insurance companies are required to do, because insurance is not the prime purpose of a trade union; it is a side activity. That may be easily done without taking them out of the scope of the Bill altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Supervision is provided for in the Trade Union Acts.  My point is that it is not desirable to provide for the supervision in an Insurance Act.  There is provision for supervision in the Trade Union Acts, and, although the Trade Union Acts are in many respects antiquated and may have to be revised at some stage, if any further provision were deemed necessary to cover those classes of businesses done by trade unions it is in that code that the provision should be made, and not in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not Deputy Norton agree with me that in the interregnum between bringing the trade union code up to date it would be desirable if power were vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce to supervise the insurance activities of any trade union to the same extent as this Bill allows him to supervise insurance companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the position is the same as in the case of an ordinary insurance company.  The benefits which trade unions provide, for instance in the form of tool money for a member, or emigration money, or superannuation benefit, or other special kinds of benefit, are not in the nature of contractual obligations. They are a kind of discretionary benefits <Col N="703" /> which are given.  The condition of entitlement to them is not related to the fact that a member pays any individual contribution for them, but rather being a member of a society his membership of the society entitles him to consideration in the matter of having such benefits extended to him.  But he has no individual contractual rights to benefits of that kind.  In practically all cases he does not pay for any special benefits, but gets them in a kind of discretionary way under the rules of the society.  I think it may well be argued, in respect of the kind of business which trade unions do, that in fact they do not come within the scope of insurance legislation as conceived and expressed here, because in many cases the element of contract is wholly absent, and that is the main basis upon which insurance is defined in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think that Deputy Norton's statement in regard to this matter strengthens the case for closer supervision?  Is it a desirable thing that insurance activities should be carried on by a trade union on an indeterminate and vague basis such as that outlined by Deputy Norton?  After all, anybody who has any knowledge of those things knows that if the trade unions are carrying on their insurance activities on a sound basis they must earmark a part of the dues of a member of the trade union for benefits under the various schemes they have in mind.  At first glance I cannot approve of a pseudo insurance system which is based on paternalism, leaving discretion in the trade union authorities to give the benefit to one man and withhold it from another, because in my opinion the trade union will be forced into the position of allowing their judgment to be influenced by their knowledge from time to time of what funds they have at their disposal.  To me that does not seem to be fair.  If two men are paying the same dues to the same trade union those two men should be entitled to the same benefits of every character.  A trade union cannot possibly make those benefits <Col N="704" /> effectively available unless they have made a rule of earmarking a part of every man's dues to finance the benefits which it is their intention to confer.  I think it is necessary that the Department of Industry and Commerce should have the power of supervising that activity in order to ensure that substantial justice is done as between one member of the trade union and another, and in order to see that the dues of one man will not be sequestered to pay the benefits of another, when the other's dues have not made any contribution towards benefit for the first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Deputy Norton's remark, if there is no contract it is not insurance business, and would not come under this Bill in any event.  If there is any need for better supervision or regulation of such activities by trade unions it is not by a section of this Bill that that would be done but by an amendment of the existing Trade Union Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct what I think is a misapprehension on the part of Deputy Dillon.  I used the term &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; as indicating the power of the union to give a benefit to the member, but the inability of the member to sue for the extension of that particular benefit as a matter of contractual right.  In fact, the grant of a benefit of that kind is not given in a discretionary way as between individuals. The discretion is exercised collectively over the whole membership, and the benefit is paid by the whole body of members.  The right to pay it, as a right, does sometimes reside within the executive of the union.  They can make a grant or not, but once the grant is made it applies to the whole of the membership and it is dependent upon the funds existing from time to time.  The matter Deputy Dillon is concerned with is to ensure that all members should be treated fairly.  I have had considerable experience of the way trade unions manage funds of this kind.  I am satisfied of this: that for the one case in which an insured member would get the benefit of the doubt in the case of a private insurance company, he would at least get the benefit of the doubt a <Col N="705" /> hundred times more in the case of the trade union.  Funds of that kind, providing for benefits such as I have indicated, are administered in a rather generous manner.  The object sought is to pay the member what it is possible to pay him, having regard to his rights in the matter, and that strict legal procedure which is the feature of private insurance companies, in dealing with policy-holders, is not obtruded in the same way as between a privately insured person and a private company. As the Minister said, the way in which matters of this kind in relation to trade unions might be regulated where regulation is necessary, is in a Bill dealing with the trades union legislation. This is hardly a matter that could be brought into a Bill of this kind, which I take it is dealing with insurance different from that in which trade unions are engaged.  If the matter was to be dealt with by legislation at all it should be dealt with in a Bill dealing with trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all reassured. Beneficence is a very desirable thing. But, dealing with insurance funds, beneficence alone would not be sufficient. While I am prepared to accept that where there is no contract between a person and a trade union they would not come within the scope of this Bill, yet I cannot see there is any reason in excluding cases where there is a contract between the trade union and the person entitled to benefit.  Misguided benefit might involve persons in a very great loss, and short-sighted benefits might involve catastrophe.</P>

      <P>I express no opinion as to the adequacy of the supervision. Trade unions have always been exempted.  They were exempted under the Act of 1909, and they are exempted from this Bill because they are regulated <Col N="706" /> on a different footing.  Friendly societies are also exempted and their supervision is exercised by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I think it is desirable that we should leave that position unchanged in this Bill.  I have not expressed any opinion as to the adequacy of the supervision under the Trades Union Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever an application has been duly made in accordance with this Act by a foreign company which is a society, association, or other body incorporated or otherwise constituted under the law of a country other than Saorstát Eireann for an assurance licence to carry on life assurance business or industrial assurance business, or whenever an assurance licence has been granted to any such company to carry on either or both of such businesses, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any alteration in the rules or other instrument defining the constitution of such company and filed with the Registrar of Companies shall be notified to such Registrar within the prescribed time, and</P>
      <P>(b)  any notice, document or legal process may (save as may be otherwise required by or under any rules of court or an order of a court or judge) be served by being left with or sent by prepaid ordinary post to the persons resident in Saorstát Eireann at the addresses of such persons as specified by such company under this Part of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(c)  The Registrar of Companies shall, if satisfied that such company has filed with him the matters required by this Part of this Act to be so filed by it, issue a certificate under his hand certifying that such company has so filed the matters which it is so required to file, and</P>
      <P>(d)  every such certificate shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matters stated therein and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of the Registrar of Companies or that he was in fact such Registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is to require that insurers not having the constitution of incorporated companies shall notify <Col N="713" /> the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies of any alteration in their constitution. It also provides for the service of a process and for the issue of a certificate by the Registrar of the filing of documents to such insurers.

      <P>In page 12, before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Whenever the Minister grants to a foreign company an assurance licence to carry on one or more than one class of assurance business (other than life assurance business or industrial assurance business) the Minister shall (without prejudice to any other power of refusal conferred on him by this Act) refuse every application by such company for an assurance licence to carry on any other such class of assurance business unless such company on the 31st day of October, 1935, carried on in Saorstát Eireann that other class of assurance business.</P>
      <P>This amendment limits the grant of a licence to a foreign company to such class of business as the company carried on in the Saorstát on 31st October, 1935.  I think it is desirable to have such an amendment, because since the passing of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, a number of companies made a deposit of £15,000 and commenced to carry on mechanically-propelled vehicle insurance without, however, undertaking any other class of business.  If this amendment were not inserted such companies could obtain a licence and could then, if they wished, proceed to do any class of general insurance business provided for in the Bill.</P>

In other words, any company incorporated here as an exclusively glass insuring company is allowed to carry on its activities here, to be exempt from the payment of the deposit and to enter into competition with the existing Irish companies. Would the Minister not consider requiring such company to make a deposit of £20,000 if it is going to continue its activities here?  There is a particularly strong case for not putting it in a specially privileged position as compared with Irish companies, which, as the Minister has indicated, carry on glass assurance, and which, presumably, could transact this business in the same way as an externally controlled company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal to be said for what Deputy Norton has put forward.  This glass business is regarded as one of the choice businesses in the insurance world.  The ordinary Irish company or the ordinary foreign company in doing its business has to take the rough with the smooth.  A great deal of the business is non-paying, or badly paying, and this class of insurance is considered one of the plums of the insurance business.  I think it is very unfair to give special facilities to any one company who specialise in that particular line, and I think that companies doing general business and facilitating the public generally should be considered in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But the ordinary company does not have to make an additional deposit in order to do this class of business.  If it is doing other classes of general business, it can do this as well.  The only question is whether a company doing this and no other business should be required to make a deposit of £20,000.  There is certainly no public need for the provision, nor is this concession, if it can be called a concession, confined to any one company.  Anybody who gets a licence to carry on in accordance with the provisions of the Bill can confine himself to this class of business if he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister has inquired closely into this problem, because two points arise. One is the matter referred to by Deputy Bourke.  As general insurance is run in this country at present, what is actually happening is that some profitable branches of general insurance are carrying unprofitable branches to a certain extent.  Motor insurance is extremely unprofitable, and it is very largely carried on by insurance companies for the purpose of getting other business.  Heretofore, when they could do life and general business, they very often did motor insurance for the purpose of getting into a house with a view to getting O.B. business there, and if you are going to allow special privileges to individual companies who undertake to engage only in those branches of insurance which have been proved by experience to be profitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are only dealing with one class&mdash;glass insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to allow that to develop, I do not see how you can refuse to extend a similar concession to any company which is insuring other small individual risks and which says: &ldquo;It is inconceivable that at any time we should sustain a loss which would make it necessary to turn to our reserve deposit in court to meet it.&rdquo;  They could make a case <Col N="720" /> similar to the plate-glass company's case to get exemption from the operation of the Bill.  If that happened, you would leave the general insurance companies carrying all the unprofitable business, and being undercut in respect of profitable risks by the specialised companies who were running very small establishments on advantageous terms.  That is one problem to which I invite the Minister's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second problem is one the answer to which I do not know myself. I do not know if the Minister's attention has been directed to it.  The situation in the plate-glass business is very peculiar because my information is that there is some kind of a <i>cartel</i> which deals with plate-glass, and the terms under which the <i>cartel</i> operates are that plate-glass will not be supplied to any merchant who sells it to a consumer below the fixed price.  That was originally done for the purpose of preventing prices being cut by excessive competition.  The effect of it has been that the plate-glass distributors got a proviso put into the <i>cartel</i> agreement providing that while they must all get the minimum price fixed by the <i>cartel</i>, they could make a salvage allowance for as many square feet of plate-glass as they could cut out of the window that had been broken.  Accordingly, if a plate-glass window be smashed you send to a glass merchant and ask him: &ldquo;For how much will you put in a plate-glass window to replace this plate-glass window that has been smashed?&rdquo;  He looks at the window and he measures out of that window the square feet of glass that he can credit against his customer's bill and he makes an estimate of the cost of putting in the window.  When that person is going away he puts his elbow against the window with the result the remaining part of the glass is broken and the next person who comes to give an estimate will naturally have to give a higher estimate. If that is the case, is it possible for a plate-glass insurance company to derive some peculiar benefit&mdash;I will not say through collusion because there is nothing dishonourable or dishonest in the transaction&mdash;but is <Col N="721" /> there not a possibility of the plate-glass window insurance company operating in conjunction with plate-glass suppliers or with the <i>cartel</i>, or could any special benefit accrue to a company operating as such that would not be available to the ordinary insurance company?  I have no reason to think that there is, but I think the facts that I have mentioned to the Minister should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any company operating as an insurance company must make a deposit of £20,000, that is any company which does a business to which the Act applies except motor vehicle insurance for which the deposit is £15,000, but it is not considered necessary in the public interest to require a deposit from a company doing plate-glass business only.  As regards the question of the <i>cartel</i>, I am afraid that I do not know much about those arrangements, but Deputy Dillon will be glad to hear that in the next six months we will be able to provide him with Irish plate glass, and the more of that that will be broken the more employment will be given.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever an industrial assurance company receives a proposal for a policy of industrial assurance and such proposal contains an incorrect statement of the age of the person whose life is thereby proposed to be assured, such company may, within one month after the date on which it receives such proposal, so adjust the terms of the policy issued or about to be issued in pursuance of such proposal as to make such terms conform to the terms applicable to the true age of such person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of their experience, the companies gave a number of illustrations in support of their case that one month was too short to enable them to adjust a mis-statement with regard to age.  They suggested a longer period, in fact, than a period of four <Col N="733" /> months.  The case made by them appears to me to be reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is that it is unreasonable to give them only a month in which to effect an adjustment. In order to understand that, it is necessary to have a knowledge of the working of the business and of the circumstances which might arise to make it unfair to have a shorter period provided.  It would take a long time to give a number of illustrations; nor could I do so straight away, because I do not claim to have a technical knowledge of the business.  On the basis of their case I felt it was reasonable to allow a longer period, nor do I think any injustice will be done to the insured persons by having this additional provision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 174:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 34, before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) Where any benefits which are granted by an industrial assurance company under policies of industrial assurance are revised in favour of or to confer further benefits on assured persons with retrospective effect in whole or in part in relation to any such policies which are in force at the date of such revision, the rights of the persons entitled to such policies shall not, in case of forfeiture thereof, be more favourable to such persons than such rights would have been if such benefits had been attached to such policies at the date of the issue of such policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this proposed new sub-section is to cover cases where an industrial insurance company gives increased scales of benefit and makes the improved benefit apply to existing policy holders and to make such benefit retrospective.  As the Bill stands, it gives the existing policy holders greater free policy rights than they would have been entitled to if the benefit attached to a policy from the date of the issue because of the difference in the nett premium which is taken into calculation. It may be as difficult for Deputies to follow that as it was for myself to understand it when the problem was first put to me.  The difficulty will be removed if I give an example.  If we suppose that a man aged 20 has taken out a policy for a premium of 1d. weekly in which the sum assured is £8.  Under the rules of the Third Schedule when that policy has been ten years in force the free paid up policy to which he would be entitled would amount to £1 15s. 6d. If the company altered the benefit so that under a new policy the sum assured for 1d. a week would be £10, the free paid up policy, after it was 10 years in force, would be entitled to £2 4s. 4d.  If the company makes the <Col N="739" /> increased benefits retrospective, so that the sum assured under the existing policy was increased from £8 to £10, then the free paid up policy, owing to the method of calculation provided in the Third Schedule, would be £3 5s. 6d.  That is to say, the policy holder, in addition to the increase in the sum assured, would have a right to a free paid up policy greater by £1 1s. 2d. than if the improved benefit had been in operation from the outset.  The effect of giving such benefit, in addition to increasing the sum assured, might operate to prevent the company making the benefit retrospective to the obvious disadvantage of an existing policy holder.  The purpose of the section therefore is to ensure that if benefits were increased and are applied to existing policy holders, the free paid-up policy rights will be no greater than if the increased benefit operated from the commencement of the policy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 184:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6), line 37, to delete all words from the words &ldquo;and the decision&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section, and before sub-section (7) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7) Where an appeal from a decision of the High Court under the next preceding sub-section of this section is taken to the Supreme Court by an industrial assurance company, such company shall, whatever may be the result of such appeal or the determination of the Supreme Court thereon be liable for and pay the costs of all parties to such appeal.</P>
      <P>It was felt that cases might possibly arise in which an assurance company might be anxious to obtain a Supreme Court decision.  As the Bill stands there is no appeal from the decision of the High Court.  We propose, therefore, to permit an appeal from the decision of the High Court by an industrial assurance company in cases where the company is willing to accept the liability for the costs of the parties to such appeal whatever the result.  The whole purpose of the section is to prevent the cost of litigation being used by an assurance company to deprive a person of his rights. Secondly, an appeal from the decision of the Minister to the High Court can only be on a question of law.  In the event of a further appeal by a company to the Supreme Court we shall require that the company will pay the costs of both sides so that an insured person will not necessarily lose in consequence of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see what is in the Minister's mind, but in fact this introduces a new principle into our law.  There is no precedent in the existing law for suggesting that a successful litigant in the Supreme Court should be mulcted for the costs of the case.  I can quite see a case being made that it is not fair that a person who ordinarily would have an industrial policy of assurance should be dragged from the High Court into the Supreme Court and faced with these enormous costs for the purpose of deciding a point of law, but let the Minister say that he will assist an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court by providing that if the insurance company succeeds the State will pay the costs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should look at this from a wider point of view than the point of view of an English assurance company.  The British insurance companies do not give a fiddle-de-dee what happens the insured litigant. They do not give a snap of their fingers for the Supreme Court.  All that they desire is to get into the Supreme Court in order to get a decision on certain matters which will govern their business here.  I am not concerned with the question of mulcting a company such as the Prudential <Col N="744" /> Assurance Company.  The costs are of very little consideration to a company such as that.  The Prudential Assurance Company could spend £250,000 fighting a case in the Supreme Court and they would not miss it.  What interests me is that at the instigation of the insurance company, which does not give two straws for the expense in order to get a favourable decision on a point which is going to arise repeatedly in the ordinary course of their business, we are going to introduce into our law a principle that was never heard of before.  If the only purpose the Minister has in mind is to convenience the British companies and to provide them with facilities for taking cases to the Supreme Court, let him tell them he will not do it and that it cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if you feel that it is desirable that the decision of the Supreme Court should be taken from time to time on matters in connection with the Bill, and that you feel it would be a grave injustice to persons with industrial assurance policies to make them go into the Supreme Court with the insurance company, lay it down that in cases where the insurance company wins in the Supreme Court, the State will pay the cost.  There is no danger of having a jury who may be influenced by the consideration that the State can well afford to pay and give costs against the State in every case which comes before them.  You will have the judges of the Supreme Court deciding each issue on its merits and where the verdict goes to the insurance company, after all they have only got their rights.  The costs are going to be something trivial from the point of view of the State or the point of view of the insurance company but the integrity of the Supreme Court is preserved and that is something about which I am sincerely solicitous.  I have pointed out time and again in this House that once you make a breach in a well-established principle to cover a specific evil, you may think you are doing no harm but in 12 months' time that will be quoted as a precedent for imposing a penalty on some other section of the community in some other court.  You open the door to evils, the <Col N="745" /> end of which we cannot see, in introducing an amendment of this kind.  I urge on the Minister either to abandon it altogether and leave the final decision in the hands of the High Court or, if not, to allow the existing system obtain in regard to appeals to the Supreme Court with this proviso, that the State will pay the cost in cases where the decision is against the insured person and to the advantage of the insurance company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am not satisfied that this amendment is an improvement on the Bill.  I approach it from a point of view altogether different from that put forward by Deputy Dillon.  I can conceive this right of appeal to the Supreme Court being used by the insurance companies as a threat to the insured persons, the threat of delay. We all know what is likely to happen, that if an appeal is taken to the Supreme Court, 12 months, two years or even four years elapse before you get a decision on that appeal.  Does the Minister consider that that would be fair treatment for the insured person?  As I say, conceivably the insurance company might do that.  It may be said, of course, that it is an exaggeration to say that you will wait for 12 months, two years or even longer for a decision of the Supreme Court but it is not.  It has happened over and over again.  Even at the moment there is one case in which the public are waiting for a decision in the Supreme Court for over four years.  I can conceive this new amendment being used very much to the detriment of the policy holder.  I would like to hear some further justification for its insertion, and to be assured that the danger that I have mentioned can be provided against.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it would not be desirable if an insurance company were able to take advantage of this amendment for the purpose of ensuring delay and of bringing pressure to bear on a policy holder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he is submitting this new amendment because the insurance companies apparently want it.  Of course <Col N="746" /> it is clear on the face of it that the companies want this amendment inserted.  The effect of it, so far as they are concerned, is to give them greater power in dealing with the insured person.  If there is nothing in the amendment of advantage to the insurance companies, why do they want it inserted, and why did the Minister go to the trouble of drafting it and of introducing this rather unusual principle?  The Minister has apparently been convinced by the companies that not only is it to their advantage, but he has gone to the trouble of introducing a rather novel method for the ascertainment of costs. All this is done because the companies want to get from the High Court to the Supreme Court against an insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not against an insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly against an insured person.  The marginal note to the section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Decision of disputes between industrial assurance companies and others.</P>
      <P>Here are some of the matters which may be decided:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any person who has effected a policy of industrial assurance with such company or any person claiming through such person, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any other person claiming under or in respect of a policy of industrial assurance effected with such company, or</P>
      <P>(c)  any person claiming under or by virtue of any provision of this Act, or</P>
      <P>(d)  any person aggrieved by a decision of such company or any person claiming through such aggrieved person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, most of the disputes under this section will be disputes in which the insured person is the plaintiff, and, from his standpoint, the insurance company will be the defendant.  The Minister will decide that matter, but if he so desires he may refer it to the High Court for decision, and its decision shall be final and conclusive, and no appeal to the Supreme Court <Col N="747" /> shall lie from such decision of the High Court.  That was the Minister's first intention.  Now, the Minister has received a request from the insurance companies to amend the Bill so that they can take the dispute from the High Court to the Supreme Court. It is well to point out that it is the insurance company that is given the initiative in the matter.  The High Court decision is to be binding on the insured person, but the company can say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied with the High Court judgment, and we want to take the case to the Supreme Court.&rdquo; In a case such as that the insurance company is being given another opportunity to delay the implementation of the decision as given by the High Court.  Under this new amendment the insurance company is being empowered to delay the matter still further.  It is being enabled to use its superior financial resources to get behind a High Court judgment, if it possibly can, and in any case to cause the maximum amount of inconvenience that it is possible for a company to cause to an insured person.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the insured person I think this is a most unfair amendment.  It introduces a novel piece of cost ascertainment for the purpose of litigation which may go before the Supreme Court.  It obviously puts the company in a preferential position as compared with an insured person.  If persisted in, I believe the amendment will work out in a disadvantageous manner from the point of view of an insured person. The Minister, I suggest, should leave the Bill as it was drafted originally, and turn down this proposal of the companies, the effect of which will be to enable them to use their superior financial position to deprive an applicant of a judgment which the High Court had given.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, many of these companies will not care what amount of money they spend in costs before the Supreme Court in order to upset what they would regard as a particularly objectionable judgment of the High Court. As it is the company which is empowered to go to the Supreme Court and not the insured person, I think <Col N="748" /> that the amendment, to which apparently the companies attach considerable importance, is very objectionable from the point of view of the insured person and should be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather difficult to follow the remarks that have just been made by Deputy Norton.  They were directed to show that this amendment is unfair to the insured person. I may be misreading the amendment, but it appears to me to give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court to either party from a decision of the High Court.  In so far as it does that it has my full benediction.  Under the Constitution and the Courts of Justice Act it is envisaged, if not as a constitutional right, at all events as being practically a constitutional right, that there should be a right of appeal from a decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court in every possible case.  Under the amendment as it stands, if I read it correctly, both the insured person and the insurance companies have the right of appeal, but the insurance company has the satisfaction of paying whether &ldquo;we lose or draw.&rdquo;  I may be wrong but that is my reading of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, sub-section (6) of this section provided that whenever the Minister referred a point of law to the High Court for decision, the decision of the High Court should be final and conclusive.  That provision has been taken away, and instead provision is being made for an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court. In other words, as I read this amendment, leaves the Constitution to operate.  The Constitution says that wherever there is a decision of the High Court there is the right of appeal to the Supreme Court unless that right is taken away by law.  I do not know whether I am reading this provision correctly or not but, if I am right, then it is a good principle that there should be an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court.  I think that that was intended by the Constitution.  If I am right in that&mdash;and I think I am &mdash;I cannot see how Deputy Norton can make the point that the insured person, under this proposed amendment, will be subject to hardship, because he <Col N="749" /> will have a right of appeal as well as the company.  Deputy Norton cannot always rely on the High Court to decide in favour of the insured person as against the company nor can he rely on the Supreme Court to decide in favour of the company as against the insured person.  I think that the right of appeal to the Supreme Court is a right which the insured person should have.  If it is given under this proposed amendment to the section, then I think it is a good amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not given, I think it is a bad amendment.  I think everybody should have a right of appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court, and the cutting down of that right is a bad thing and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. The insured person should have that right of appeal and, if he had not, I think there would be considerable public demand for it in the space of a few months after this Act came into effective operation.  Where the amendment is wrong in principle is where it provides that, whatever the result of the case, one party to the litigation is to pay the cost.  Deputy Dillon's point, I think, was that that was bad in principle.  In so far as it applies to a big insurance company, it makes no difference, but it is introducing an extremely bad principle.  It is a good thing from the point of view of the insured because, if the decision of the High Court is against him, he can go to the Supreme Court at the expense of his opponent.  He is on velvet and I do not see why Deputy Norton should have any objection on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the amendment provides for is the retention of the right of appeal to the Supreme Court which the Bill, as originally introduced, ruled out.  That appeal is permitted but it is provided that if the appeal is taken at the instance of the company, then the costs of all parties, irrespective of the result, must be paid by the company.  Whether that is a new principle or not, I am not in a position to argue.  In Great Britain, the insurance commissioner may refuse to state a case unless the company concerned agrees to pay the costs of all the parties and that, in effect, brings about the same position as this section proposes to establish. The whole purpose of the provision is to provide a means of determining disputes between insurance companies and their policy-holders which will be cheap and expeditious.  At the present time, it is undoubtedly correct that policy-holders are intimidated from pursuing their rights against a company by the fear that, if they get a decision in the courts, they will be involved in certain expense and that, in any event, the company is likely to appeal that decision from court to court to the ultimate tribunal.  In order to prevent policy-holders from being intimidated by the fear that that may be the consequence of their resort to the law, we have inserted this section which gives the Minister the right to determine, acting through an inspector, disputes in certain circumstances.  It is provided that the Minister's decision shall be final and there can be no appeal unless the Minister, at the request of any party to the dispute, should refer any question of law arising in such dispute to the High Court for decision.  The Bill, as introduced, provided that the decision of the High Court should be final, but we are proposing to delete that limitation and to provide for an appeal to the Supreme Court, with this condition attached&mdash;that if the <Col N="751" /> appeal is taken at the instance of the company, the company will bear all the costs.</P>

      <P>The confusion arises from the fact that it is not appreciated that, under the Constitution and the Courts of Justice Act, there is a right of appeal in every case from the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court unless that right is specifically barred by statute.  This provision does not bar that right.  In fact, it recognises a right of appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I think it is constitutionally preferable that this amendment <Col N="752" /> should be effected, but, from the point of view of this section of the Bill, I do not mind whether the amendment is inserted or the Bill remains as it is.  It is better, however, to have the matter dealt with this way, because it is conceivable that important questions of law will arise upon which a company may desire to have a decision from the Supreme Court.  I do not think it should be debarred from getting that decision provided it is made clear that the other party to the case, who may be quite a poor person, is not involved in additional cost in consequence of the decision to appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>There is a lot to be said for the principle enunciated by Deputy Costello, but what I am concerned with is how it is going to work out in practice so far as the policy-holder is concerned.  The section, as amended in the way proposed by the Minister, is likely to be abused, and to be abused in such a way as to cause a great deal of hardship to the policy-holder. Without having very much hope of succeeding in the Supreme Court, a company may hold that threat over the head of a policy-holder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>If the policy-holder wins in the High Court, if this amendment is carried the insurance company can say: &ldquo;Very well, we will appeal to the Supreme Court.&rdquo;  That person is held up for 12 months, two years, three years or four years before a final decision is taken on the matter.  It is not merely a question of paying the costs that is involved.  I think the Minister would agree that the insurance companies have some very good, sound reason for insisting on this particular amendment, or at least for putting it up to the Minister that it should be inserted.  I am not suggesting that the companies are not entitled to get the same play of justice as the policy-holders, but I do say that it is likely to be abused and that it is conceivable that, if it were never exercised, it can be used there as a threat to the policy-holders by the insurance companies, <Col N="753" /> and that, if they actually do take a case to the Supreme Court, a policy-holder may be kept out of his money for 12 months, two years, three years or four years.  That is the aspect of the matter with which I am concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely no company is going to involve itself in, possibly, very heavy costs in a legal action merely to keep some policy-holder out of his money?  They may be willing to become involved in heavy costs in a legal action for the purpose of getting, say, a decision which may safeguard themselves against expense or may have a bearing on the whole operation of their business, but in that case the question that would arise would be a point of law and, in such circumstances, they have a good case to support their claim that they should be allowed to get the decision of the Supreme Court on the particular point of law involved if they are prepared to pay the costs of all parties to the case.</P>

      <P>I should like to disabuse Deputies' minds of the idea that insurance companies go to law expecting to be financial gainers as a result of legal proceedings.  I have yet to hear of a case of an insurance company going to law in matters of <Col N="754" /> this kind where they did not come out financially the losers.  No insurance company goes to law merely to get money as a result of the legal proceedings, but to get some point of law finally settled.  It is awkward, both for the policy-holder and the company, to have one legal precedent established in one country and another legal precedent established in another country.  Accordingly, when such matters come to be decided in the ordinary Circuit Courts, they sometimes do not know how the matter stands, and it is in the interests of everybody that the best legal opinion should be taken in order to get a disputed point finally settled.  I think this amendment was introduced for that purpose, and I think it is for the benefit both of the company and the policy-holder that these points of law should be settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, if this Section 6 is amended in the way suggested by the Minister, and if the section stops with the word &ldquo;decision&rdquo;, in line 37, there still seems to be a gap which, I think, ought to be filled in between that word and the beginning of the new sub-section &mdash;numbered 7&mdash;which he proposes to insert in this section, because it is not at all clear to me, speaking as a layman, that these two sub-sections will hang in such a way as to make it clear to all that the policy-holder is entitled to go to the Supreme Court in the same way as the company is entitled to go to it.  Assuming, however, that the policy-holder is entitled to go to the Supreme Court in the same way as the insurance company is entitled to go there, it seems to me, in any case, to be a highly-doubtful benefit to give the policy-holder the right to go to the Supreme Court.  He will not require to go to it if he gets a favourable judgment in the High Court, and it is only in the event of being given an unfavourable decision in the High Court that he will desire to go to the Supreme Court.  Deputy Costello argues&mdash;and the Minister argues now, after hearing the viewpoint of the insurance companies&mdash;that it is desirable that there should be an appeal by both the policy-holder and the company, <Col N="755" /> if either so desire, to the Supreme Court.  I do not see, however, that there is any advantage in that appeal from the point of view of the policy-holder.  It seems to me to be on a par with telling a tramp that the Ritz Hotel is open to everybody.  The tramp probably knows that, but he has not the necessary passport to get into the hotel.  In the same way, I suggest that it is conferring a doubtful benefit on a policy-holder to tell him that he can appeal to the Supreme Court.  The policy-holder may be aware of that, but he is also aware of the fact that it costs money to go to the Supreme Court, and very often he will have to be satisfied and will have to put up with the High Court judgment because he cannot mobilise the necessary cash to take the case to the Supreme Court; whereas the insurance company, every time it loses in the High Court, will be able, by reason of its superior financial position, to take the case to the Supreme Court and, in that way, by a legal process of extended litigation, the policy-holder will be financially worn down.  In fact, and in effect, there is no real advantage in letting the policy-holder go to the Supreme Court because, in most cases, he will be unable to go there anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But when the policy-holder gets a decision from the High Court, why should not the company be compelled to recognise that decision in the manner the Minister first contemplated before the companies got at him and convinced him that he should allow the companies to have another round of the courts by going to the Supreme Court?  The Minister was quite satisfied that the High Court was a competent body to decide such matters, in the first instance, but in the meantime the companies have got at him and said: &ldquo;No, the High Court is not qualified to give the decision, so let us go to the Supreme Court.&rdquo;  The Minister wants to say that there is a gloss of equality between <Col N="756" /> the insurance companies and the policy-holder because they have equal rights to appeal to the Supreme Court, but in actual fact they have not equal rights.  The insurance company, heavily capitalised and wealthy, can go to the Supreme Court with greater ease than can the policy-holder. Deputy Seamus Bourke says that insurance companies do not engage in litigation with the intention of making a profit, but most of us know that insurance companies have written policies for persons&mdash;often very poor persons&mdash;collected the premiums, and, when the assured person dies, and his or her relatives claim payment of the policy&mdash;and very often it is the only means they have of burying the deceased assured person &mdash;the companies have gone into the courts to dispute the age of the deceased person as entered on the policy which they wrote themselves.  It is constantly before the eyes of members of this House, through the daily Press, that assurance companies have gone into court often to dispossess a relatively poverty-stricken person who claims an interest in a policy which was written on a deceased person's life. If that will happen in the ordinary course of events, where there is merely a sum of not more than £10 or £20 at stake, how much more is it likely to happen where an insurance company has legal people of its own engaged, to whom the company pays retaining fees and where it is quite easy to get these people, during times when they are not very busy generally, to take a case into the courts in the hope of upsetting the claim of the policy-holder? I think that the very fact that the companies have pressed the Minister for this amendment and that he has had to go through the rounds of introducing an entirely new feature, by measuring the costs of proceedings before the Supreme Court, is evidence that this amendment is valuable to the companies.  And they can only regard it as valuable because they see in it another weapon against policy-holders.</P>

      <P>Before Section 82 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every assurance company which effects assurance business (excluding life assurance business and industrial assurance business, but including the renewal of any other assurance business, the original contract for which was entered into before the commencement of this Part of this Act) in Saorstát Eireann shall enter into an agreement with the company whereby such assurance company agrees that, if and so far as it reinsures its assurance business (excluding and including as aforesaid), it will reinsure with the company but subject to the qualification that the company may, in the case of any particular risk, refuse to accept the reinsurance thereof unless such assurance company retains such portion of such risk as the company shall direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put forward in lieu of Section 82 of the Bill, to which objection was taken, and the drafting of which required revision in any event. The proposed new section differs from the section in the Bill in two respects. Firstly, it does not require the assurance company to reinsure life or <Col N="759" /> industrial business with the company. That was not made quite clear when Section 82 in the Bill was drafted.  The proposed new section makes it quite clear.  Furthermore, it requires the insurance companies to retain for themselves at any rate portion of the risk they reinsure with the company.  The necessity for that will be obvious.  The change of the wording of the section proposed in this amendment will remove any objections which were advanced on Second Reading discussion and which were subsequently put forward from other quarters.</P>

      <P>Before Section 93 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where an assurance company carries on one or more of the following classes of assurance business, that is to say, public liability insurance business, engineering insurance business, glass insurance business, guarantee insurance business, or burglary insurance business, the Act of 1909 shall apply to such company and to such one or more of the said classes of assurance business as is or are carried on by such company but with and subject to the following modifications, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Sections 5 and 6 of the Act of 1909 shall not apply to such company, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such company shall annually prepare a statement of its assurance business in such form as the Minister shall from time to time direct, and sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Act of 1909 shall apply thereto as if such statement were a statement required to be made by a provision of that Act prior to the said Section 7, and</P>
      <P>(c)  Section 32 (except paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) thereof) shall apply to such company with the substitution in the said section of the words &ldquo;public liability insurance business, engineering insurance business, glass insurance business, guarantee insurance business, or burglary insurance business&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;accident insurance business&rdquo; wherever those words occur in the said section as applied by this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing in this to insert a new section.  I think it is necessary to do so.  In consequence of the inclusion within the scope of the Bill of additional classes of business, it becomes necessary to apply to these classes the provisions of the Act of 1909, with the necessary modifications set out. Sections 5 and 6 of the Act of 1909 which relate to actuarial reports and abstracts of valuations, are not relevant <Col N="765" /> to these classes of business and should not apply.  Secondly, in (b) the provision requires the preparation and furnishing of annual accounts in respect of these additional classes of business in such form as the Minister may direct.  Paragraph (c) provides that these additional classes of business shall be subjected to the same modifications of the Act of 1909 as accident assurance business.</P>

      <P>4. The age of the person whose life is assured under a free paid-up policy of industrial assurance shall be obtained by adding to the age attained by such person at his birthday next after the date of the issue of the original policy of industrial assurance the number of completed years which have elapsed between that date and the date as at which the value of such free paid-up policy is required to be ascertained.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes to insert two new paragraphs, the first of which provides for the case of a free paid-up policy as distinct from a policy in respect of which premiums are payable.

      <P>6. The value of a free paid-up policy of industrial assurance shall be taken to be the present value at the date as at which the value is required to be ascertained of the reversion in the sum assured, including any bonus added thereto, according to the contingency upon which it is payable.</P>

      <Col N="771" /> 7. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Schedule, a policy of industrial assurance in respect of which premiums are payable shall not for the purposes of this Schedule attain a value unless and until such policy has been in force for two completed years.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, clauses 5 and 6 replace clause 1 of Part II.  They are the same as that clause in intention and effect, but make a distinction between policies in respect of which premiums are payable and free paid-up policies.  They are being brought forward to Part I because, being rules of a general kind, they are more appropriate to Part I than to Part II.

The cash surrender value of the surrendered policy shall be 90 per cent. of the present value, at the date as at which such value is required to be ascertained, of the reversion in the sums assured (including any bonus added thereto) under the free paid-up policy which the surrendered policy would be entitled to receive, or, if the surrendered policy is a free paid-up policy, to 90 per cent. of the present value at the said date of the reversion in the sums assured (including any bonus added thereto) under such free paid-up policy.</P>
      <P>This amendment makes provision in lieu of that contained in clause 3, which has now been deleted.  It proposes that instead of the cash surrender value of a policy being taken directly as two-thirds of the policy value, it shall be taken as 90 per cent. of the present value of the free paid-up policy to which the original policy would be convertible under paragraph 4.  The effect is that the cash surrender value of whole term of life policies is derived from the free paid-up policy value, thus bringing them into line with the method adopted for endowment and endowment assurances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that I would specially like to bring before the notice of the Minister and that is the price of bacon pigs.  To my mind, there is somebody besides the producer getting a very fine profit out of the pig.  One would think that the Government, which is so sympathetic towards the poor man, ought to see that the poor man should be able to get a little bacon at a fair price.  A working man going into a shop now is asked 1/1 a lb. for bacon anywhere around the country.  That is putting bacon altogether outside his reach.  There is another thing I would like to bring before the Minister's notice and that is the 5/1 that is deducted off every pig that is put on the market.  Men around the country ask: &ldquo;Why are we supposed to pay the merchants' expenses?&rdquo; I hope the Minister will answer that question.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister that in the town of Wexford at the present moment there are 50,000 barrels of barley in the lofts of the corn merchants.  I hope the Minister will tell us what is to happen that corn. From the information I have got I know that the lofts are filled up to the roof with this barley.  Owing to the price at which the meal mixture is sold and, on the other hand, the price the producers receive for their live stock the farmers are not in a position to buy this mixture.  The result is they are not feeding their stocks as well as they might or if they were in a position to do so.  Perhaps they are feeding them better than they can afford but they are not feeding them to the extent that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To where is this business of the slaughter of calves going to lead?  It is a deplorable thing for anyone to go through the county of Wexford where in former days before the advent of this Government the people used import thousands of calves and rear them.  These calves were fed on what the farmer produced on his land. To-day the calves are not there.  What is to happen in the future?  We have a foretaste already of what is going to happen.  Our markets are not half stocked.  If the Minister for Agriculture will get down to commonsense and tell the people that he has ceased to <Col N="777" /> slaughter calves it will be better for the country.  For every 20 calves slaughtered one man is done out of employment.</P>
    <P>All this talk by the Fianna Fáil Party about the bullock is codology.  It is the bullock that gives employment. The growing of wheat gives employment for three weeks in the year.  The growing of bect probably gives three months' employment in the year but what the farmer and labourer want is an article that will give employment the 365 days of the year.  That is what is needed if the agricultural labourer and the farmer are to get a living.</P>
    <P>During this past season we had men working on the land pulling beet for which the producer got 37/6 per ton. The farmer is not in a position to pay the labourer a living wage at that price.  Neither is the labourer in a position to work at the wage the farmer is able to pay him at present. The labourer at present is working under such depressed conditions that he takes off his wet clothes at night and puts them on in the morning.</P>
    <P>In the constituency that the Minister and I represent, two or three people have told me that their contract for next year's beet has been cancelled.  Is not the 25th March a nice time to tell people that their contract for growing beet is cancelled?  They were given that information at a time when their land had been ploughed, manured and ready for the beet crop.  In most cases, this is the sort of land that would not suit for corn growing this year because it is too highly manured.  What is the alternative now before the farmer? The policy that killed the potato market.  It seems now the bullock is gone and so the animal to which the farmer could feed his produce is gone too.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what are those people to do with their lands now?  I was told that the reason the beet contracts were cancelled was that these farmers last year grew a little more beet than the quantity for which their contracts provided. That was through no fault of their own.  It was because the seed was on their hands.  When the inspector came around he said to these men: &ldquo;You have more land under beet than you contracted for; you are to leave that <Col N="778" /> beet where it is on the ground until I tell you to lift it.&rdquo; These people, seeing that the beet was losing on the ground, fed it to their cattle and because of that their contracts have been cancelled.</P>
    <P>It is nearly time that the Minister should get down to commonsense and let the farmer be his own master in his own place.  This thing of coercing the people to do what the Government thinks they ought to do belongs to the old days.  I remember when the Fianna Fáil Party were seeking power; I was at a good many of their meetings.  In those days one would really think from their promises that their advent to office would turn this country into a paradise.  It is not a paradise to-day for the farmer, the labourer, the business man or the professional man.  It is not a bed of roses for anyone in the countryside.  We were told at that time that employment was to be found for all the workers; that taxation was to be reduced by £2,000,000 but what do we see to-day?  It is about time that the people should waken up and ask themselves to what is the present policy leading.  The back-benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party say that the farmers are all right.  I, as a practical farmer, know that they are not all right.  Perhaps the back-benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party and I are all right because we are drawing salaries but what about the unfortunate men who are trying to knock a living out of the land?  It is surely time for the Government to wake up and settle the economic war.  The Government should either get on or get out.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to know what is going to happen these 50,000 barrels of barley held in the stores in Wexford. I hope the Minister will not find the new crop coming round on top of the old crop.  If that happens, the Government will have to do this coming harvest what has already been done in wheat countries&mdash;that is either to burn the corn or let it rot.  In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will see his way&mdash;I see now he is present in the House&mdash;to do something for the unfortunate farmers.  The Minister is, I am sure, aware as well as I am because he got notice from these Wexford farmers <Col N="779" /> as to the cancelling of their contracts for beet growing.  Now, those farmers in Wexford grew beet when it was an experimental crop.  They were growing beet when the Fianna Fáil Party was saying that beet was a white elephant.  Since that time the Carlow factory has had three calves, all white elephants I suppose.  I do not know what is going to happen the country under the Minister's policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I think, is the third day on which we have had this Vote before this House.  We got perhaps more speeches than we usually get from members on the Government side of the House on this Estimate.  Some of them were very interesting.  Deputy Corry led off on the first day last week when the Minister introduced the Estimate and he proceeded to prove to us that Deputy Corry speaking in Dáil Eireann is a very different person to Deputy Corry speaking down the country.  Deputy Corry speaking in Leinster House on the price of beet for the farmers speaks with a very different voice to the voice of Martin Corry, T.D., member of the Beet Growers' Association.  I am sure that the Minister and the Sugar Company were surprised to read that Deputy Corry was here championing the price which the company had agreed to pay the farmers who grew beet.  Those of us who remember some of Deputy Corry's speeches at the meetings of the Beet Growers' Association last year, when the Minister and the Sugar Company had some difficulty in securing agreement with regard to prices, were also rather surprised.  The Deputy was emphasising that the price paid for beet grown in this country was very much better than the price paid to the beet growers in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By implication he tried to prove that the price paid in this country was a price that would amply compensate the farmers for growing beet.  I never grew beet, but I am living in a part of the country where there is a very great deal of beet grown and I am in fairly close touch with those who grew beet long before the present Government came into power.  By discussing this matter with those people <Col N="780" /> I know what they think of the price they are being paid.  Deputy Corry told us about a yield of 18 tons to the acre.  No person who knows anything about beet returns believes there is anything in the nature of 18 tons to the acre of an average yield.  There would not be much more than half that yield, as Deputy Corry should know.</P>
    <P>He then went on to compare prices in relation to grain and he referred to the way in which the tillage policy was paying farmers now as compared with a few years ago.  He drew the picture of the farmer who in 1926 was getting £6 for an acre of wheat and then he proceeded to tell us something about barley.  He said the average yield for barley was a ton to the acre, ten barrels to the acre.  Does the Deputy consider that is a handsome reward for the farmer&mdash;ten barrels of barley at 14/-?  I may mention that every farmer did not get 14/-; many got 12/6, 12/3 and 13/-, the price depending to a large extent on what the barley bushelled.  The Deputy apparently wanted to leave the House under the impression that 14/- was the minimum price the farmers received.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harris gave us his views on the conditions in agriculture, with particular reference to agricultural labourers.  He challenged certain statements made by Deputy Norton about the conditions which obtain in rural Ireland.  The Deputy told us of his concern for rural workers, agricultural workers.  I am prepared to agree that Deputy Harris is quite sincere in saying all that.  I am quite sure the Deputy would like to see agricultural labourers getting a fair return for their labour.  He said he was anxious to give as good conditions as possible to agricultural labourers and he always resented the conditions under which farmers and labourers had to work.  He seems to be going a rather strange way about giving them good conditions, because the policy he is supporting certainly will not tend to improve their conditions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about men getting £1 and 25/- a week and he added that it was impossible in parts of County Kildare to get men to do agricultural work at 25/- a week.  I <Col N="781" /> cannot claim to speak with any authority as regards labour conditions in County Kildare, but I find it almost impossible to believe that statement.  It does not matter what the statistics may say about wages being only 3/- lower than they were three, four or five years ago, I can prove that there are farm labourers in North Tipperary, where there is tillage, working to-day for as low as 5/- a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are working for 5/- a week, with board.  I will say there are very few farmers who, under present conditions, can pay £1 a week, even to married men with families, without board.  Deputies know that quite well.  There is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy, who is himself a farmer or who lives in a rural area, who is not well aware that what I am saying is true.  There is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy who is a farmer who does not know quite well that, so far as depending on his farm is concerned, he is worse off than he was five years ago. Deputy Harris went further and he said that wages boards would not get higher wages for the workers.  Why does the Deputy say that?  What are we to gather from that statement?  Is it that the Deputy believes wages boards will not get higher wages for the agricultural labourers because the farmers are not able to pay higher wages?  If his statement means anything at all it means that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy told us, in conclusion, that he was anxious to raise the worker above the standard of a wage earner, to put him in a better position and get him away altogether from the level of a wage earner.  How does he propose <Col N="782" /> to do it?  As he says himself, by providing each of these men with four or five or six acres of land.  Then the agricultural labourer would be in the happy position that he would be neither a wage earner nor a farmer. That is not going to improve his position. If people living on five, six, seven, eight, or ten acres of land in this country were able to maintain themselves there would be a lot of fairly happy people in this country. We had Deputy Moore comparing the wages in this country with the wages in England.  Deputy MacEoin dealt with that last night, and I do not propose to go into it, except to say that the cost of living in England is very considerably lower than it is in this country.  I think that will be admitted even by the Minister himself, apart altogether from the fact that the average wage paid in England is much greater than it is in Ireland. Deputy Moore also told us that he was glad to be able to inform the House that there was an upward tendency in agricultural wages, and that there had been a significant increase in the wages of agricultural labourers in several counties in the country within the last few months.  When he was asked to give the names of those counties, or any information as to where those increases took place, he informed me that he would be glad to give me that information out in the lobby.  I prefer to get the information here in the House where the original statement was made.</P>
    <P>Then we had my friend Deputy Davin, who started off by taking Deputy Donnelly to task for the attack which Deputy Donnelly had made on the Labour Party.  He proceeded to enlighten Deputy Donnelly and the House as to the relationship between the Labour Party and the Government.  The Deputy spoke very emphatically on this point, and said that the Labour Party had committed itself to backing the Government's political programme, but did not back the Government in its wage-cutting policy or in its financial or economic policy in some respects.  In other words the Deputy said that he himself and his colleagues are committed <Col N="783" /> absolutely to support the Government in their political programme, and then he went on to wash his hands completely of the results which have flown from putting that particular programme into operation.  The Deputy cannot, I think, have it that way. Either the Deputy supports the Government or he does not.  The Deputy knows quite clearly that the Government's political programme&mdash; and in particular the principal parts of their programme&mdash;is responsible almost wholly for the low rate of wages paid not only in the rural parts to agricultural workers but to other workers as well.  He knows it is responsible not only for the low rate of wages but for the increased cost of living which they have to try to meet on those low wages.  The Deputy said he was not particular as to how the wages increase he was asking for was to be brought about.  I think that is a statement which would prove very useful, but in any case having told us that they were committed to backing the political programme of the Government he proceeded immediately to disassociate himself and the Party from one very important aspect of that political programme.  He told us he did not believe that this dispute with Great Britain could be settled otherwise than by direct negotiation, and that he did not believe there was any hope whatever of what he called &ldquo;this tribunal of saints and scholars&rdquo; which some people were so full of&mdash;I presume he meant the President&mdash;ever settling the dispute.  He went further; he threw overboard altogether the principle he previously said he supported, when he stated that he was prepared to make a total payment to Great Britain.  In that way, as I said, he was giving away the whole principle of the case.</P>
    <P>That is not an unfair summary of Deputy Davin's speech, and I do not bring it up here for the purpose of trying to score off Deputy Davin or any member of the Labour Party, good, bad or indifferent; perhaps in this matter we are very close together.  But I do say that it is not only the farmers who are suffering, and must suffer so long as this dispute is allowed to continue, <Col N="784" /> but the agricultural labourers must suffer, and unfortunately in my opinion the workers of this country will suffer more and suffer much longer and will take much longer to recover from the effects of this dispute than either the farmers or any other section of the community.  To the extent that Deputy Davin's statement regarding his belief as to how this dispute can be brought to an end expresses the view of the Labour Party, I personally welcome it, because I think it shows that the Party is facing up to the actual facts in the matter, and are not allowing themselves to be blinded by any particular political prejudice. The sum and substance of the whole thing is that agricultural workers are not only on low wages&mdash;lower wages than perhaps they have been on for a great number of years; in some cases lower than they have been on at any time since before the Great War&mdash;but there are many agricultural workers who have no wages at all because they are unemployed.  Not only have they no wages but, by the order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, they are now going to be deprived of even the unemployment assistance which they were to get.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore also told us that the reason why agricultural wages were so much higher under the previous Government than they are under the present Government was because there were then so many thousands of agricultural labourers emigrating from this country; in other words that labour was so scarce in the country under the previous Government that the farmers, in order to get labour, had to pay much higher wages than they have to pay to-day.  It seems to me that that argument cuts very much across what we heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and some of his colleagues when they told us that there are far less unemployed to-day than before they came into office. They cannot have it both ways.  Then we had the question of emigration again raised by Deputy Moore, and I think by Deputy Victory afterwards. They talked about 25,000 people emigrating to America under the previous Government.  That is rather clever propaganda because, of course, the <Col N="785" /> implication there is that the Fianna Fáil Government has stopped emigration. They do not exactly say that President de Valera brought in an Act of Parliament which kept everybody in the country, but they imply that. I think I would be as much entitled to say that if the American Government were as anxious to get the best of our brains and brawn now as they were, say, ten years ago, I am afraid the annual figure would be much higher than 25,000.  I doubt if any Deputy on the opposite benches could deny that.</P>
    <P>We know that in the restricted field available there is a good deal of emigration.  That is a thing that no one is proud of and that no one likes to see.  Deputies ought to face up to the fact that our boys and girls are not emigrating to Great Britain, or to any other country for the love of these countries, but because they are not able to get a decent living at home. That was always the reason why our people emigrated, and it is the reason they are emigrating to-day.  These are the facts, whether we like them or not, and on a matter of such major importance as this Estimate, affecting not only the farming community but the country as a whole, we ought to face up to the facts.  We are not going to improve the position of agriculture or of the unemployed by shutting our eyes to facts.  Wages are low.  Many workers are getting no wages because there is no employment as the farmers cannot afford to pay.  Another aspect of this question is that many farmers whose sons and daughters cannot now emigrate are able to carry on with the help of their families and do not require paid labour.  We know also that those employed in agriculture are not employed the whole time; that there is a good deal of what might be called casual employment.  Not only is there a shrinkage in the numbers employed on the land, but far fewer persons are employed in the other work of any consequence in rural areas, that is, road making.  Anyone who has a knowledge of local conditions knows that that is a fact.  It is not a matter to make any political capital out of. It is a pity, but it is a fact we must face.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> I want to wind up by giving my opinion for what it is worth, and saying that as long as the present policy continues there is no hope whatever of making any inroads on our huge number of unemployed, nor is there any hope of getting, side by side with permanent employment, decent wages for workers in rural areas.  Farmers must be given money before they can part with it.  I want to emphasise a fact that many Deputies ignore, that the wheat and beet schemes, assuming that they are all that the Government claims for them, touch only a few counties, and only parts of certain counties.  There are areas in every county in which there is intensive wheat and beet cultivation, where farmers, owing to the nature of their land, cannot grow wheat or beet, and are absolutely dependent on live stock. There are other counties where they cannot grow wheat or beet in a commercial way.  Deputies on all sides know these facts better than I do, because many of them are active working farmers, and are in close touch with the agricultural position.  I am trying to put my views before the House as I gathered them from close association with both farmers and workers.  In my opinion the first essential towards the absorption of the unemployed, and the getting of a better standard of living for workers and farmers is a settlement of the economic war.</P>

      <P>I only heard portion of Deputy Morrissey's speech, but I think I heard him making the same speech four or five years ago.  There was not then of course an economic war yet he prescribed some other remedy, but I forget what it was.  Now of course he states that termination of the economic war will heal all our problems.  One would infer that we were not aware of the position that exists.  We are all well aware of it, and every effort is being made under difficult conditions to solve our problems.  The Deputy stated that people were going to look for work in England.  Possibly that is the case, but there they have the same problem with agricultural workers as we have, with this difference, that here we <Col N="787" /> definitely guarantee something to them, while in England they have adopted the same principle of unemployment insurance as was adopted here for industrial workers.  They would not do that in England if everything was so rosy there.  One would imagine, after listening to all the speeches that were made here for the last two days, that the position across the water was a sort of El Dorado; that they have no unemployment difficulties there.  That is not the case, and the sooner it is realised the better for everybody.  There is general world depression, and there is depression more in the live stock trade than in any trade, or in any other product of the land.</P>
      <P>Anyone who reads the reports of the proceedings in the British House of Commons knows that each week the very same question crops up as to how they are going to benefit their farmers and create more employment. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney confirmed last night a statement he made some weeks ago in County Mayo.  He crystallised the policy of his Party by advising the people to buy all the calves they could get, and he said that if his Party was returned to power they would guarantee profitable prices.  That would be very simple if he was in a position to help the British Government to impose a tariff of say 1d per lb. on Argentine meat. It is quite possible that may happen. It is expected by many people that it will happen within the next month. It is expected that that accounts for the rather firmer prices being given for the suitable stock we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young stock of the right quality are now making from 25/- to 30/- each more than they made last year.  That increase is not due to the recent coal-cattle pact, but is caused in England by the expectation of feeders there that there will be a levy of 1d. per lb. on meat imported from the Argentine and perhaps other places.  It does not appear likely that any tariff will be imposed on Australian frozen meat, which forms a very considerable quantity of British supplies, because it <Col N="788" /> will be noticed that the Australian Government refused point blank to lower their industrial tariffs on British goods so that the British policy towards the Australian Government is very much like ours.  We must face up to that question because the British Government may very likely indicate that unless we reduce or remove the tariffs here on their industrial products, they will not reduce in part or entirely the tariffs on our live stock.  If we had more good cattle we could sell them at the present time.  There is any amount of cattle in the fairs but only about 30 per cent. of them are saleable. That is the difficulty Deputies on the opposite benches who criticise the Government should remember, that they were in office for ten years and did not make the slightest effort to improve the quality of our cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that, but we have not as good stock as we should have.  We certainly have not as good stock as we had in the country and the fault of that lies to a large extent on the late Government.  What they held was the most important part of our industry&mdash;and they still hold it to-day&mdash; was possibly the most neglected part. It is only now that any suitable method has been adopted to standardise and improve the quality of the cattle in this country.  I am not making these statements purely for political purposes.  These are the facts.  Whether people engaged in the cattle trade belong to the United Ireland Party or to Fianna Fáil, they will all tell you the same thing.  If our predecessors had had more wisdom, if they had looked after their business better we, to-day, would have possibly quite a large number of suitable cattle to sell.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney last night attributed the shortage entirely to the slaughter <Col N="789" /> of calves.  As I understand the matter, if a man can get more than 12/6 for his calf he need not slaughter it.  I think that is the case; it is a matter of leaving him the choice.  If he believes there is anything in the animal and that he is going to get more than 12/6 for him, he is certainly not going to slaughter him.  I take it that the class of calves that are being slaughtered are regarded as not being a desirable class to have, mainly again because of the carelessness and neglect of the late Government.</P>
      <P>Of course I admit the same situation prevails in Wales and to a large extent in the North of Ireland.  It must have been the bad old tradition; there was no attention given to live stock as a whole.  I admit, of course, that there was quite a lot of attention given to the production of high-class bulls and I notice that at the shows they are magnificiently turned out. Sometimes, of course, the turn-out is a little deceptive but in general the breeding of bulls is all right.  There was, however, very little attention paid to the other end.  The result was that we had to turn quite a lot of cows into bone meal and other sorts of meal.  In other words, we had to get them out of the way.  I think, as far as live stock breeding is concerned, no greater service than that could be rendered. There was no greater misfortune for the small farmer than to have these uneconomic cows producing calves which, in recent years and even during the period of the late Government, were sold in Meath, Westmeath and Longford for 10/- each.  It is no wonder these people are glad to accept 12/6 per head for such calves.  As far as I know, there is no compulsion on them to accept it, if they think they can make more out of them.  The fault lies with the want of attention on the part of the late Government to that particular industry, which we were told by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was the only hope we had.  There was no effort made to standardise the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the handicaps to agriculture, both here and in England, which arose during the last 20 years and which developed in intensity after the war, was the fact that new countries with <Col N="790" /> a very small population started to produce commodities such as grain, beef and other agricultural produce.  These countries had not very much of a tradition in that way but they started on the most up-to-date lines.  These countries succeeded in standardising their produce.  Having a very small population, they consumed only a very small quantity of the commodities they produced and the result was that a considerable proportion of their production was dumped on our markets, seriously injuring the farmer-producer in this country.  Not alone had it that effect but it left consumers in this country accustomed to a very highly graded commodity.  Part of the depression that exists here is due to the inability of our farmers to avail of these markets because they are not able to standardise and commercialise their commodities.  One can take ordinary fruit as an instance.  It may be considered a very small item but still it is an important side issue.  There is every opportunity here to develop the production of that commodity.  I believe that the value of apples and plums imported last year amounted to a good deal over £200,000.  That is not an inconsiderable item.  This fruit had to be purchased abroad even though the market here is protected.</P>
    <P>I am informed by those connected with the trade that the principal reason why Irish fruit was not acceptable is that it is not graded or standardised. No proper method is adopted in marketing it.  I noticed during the Spring in Dublin immense quantities of cut flowers coming in&mdash;tulips and other classes of flowers.  Very large sums are sent across to Holland and Belgium for these commodities.  We are unable to oust these people from the market, even though a tariff is imposed on such commodities.  What is the reason for that?  The reason is that agriculture was completely neglected, because the Minister in the late Government devoted all his attention, and ineffectually at that, to the live stock industry. He did not visualise the time when this country might have a bigger population, the time when the people would have to use their land more intensively than in those days.  There was no <Col N="791" /> effort made to educate the people or to induce them to produce standardised commodities or to standardise the different products of the country.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal of talk about the live-stock industry.  Picture the position of the live stock industry during the winter months when we are producing stall-feds, stall-feds that are produced under very careful conditions, properly and comfortably housed, cattle that may be kept in from the end of November.  They are put into a wagon, which perhaps may be described as clean, to be taken to market.  There is an engine attached, which is driven fairly well, although there may be an occasional bump. They are taken out at Liffey Bank Junction and unloaded there, and they are driven to the shed in which they are accommodated for the night.  The next morning, any time after 5 or 6 o'clock, they are taken and tied to the railings by a rope.  They are tied by the horns, and if they have not horns they are tied by the neck.  There they stand on a cold winter's day until they are sold.  Anybody looking at that kind of thing going on would not believe that the late Government or any Government has an interest in that industry.  What are those other countries that are competing against us and against the British farmer doing to solve this problem?  They have standardised their commodities.  They have guaranteed them free from disease, and they have got a market. There is not a penny difference in the price obtained for Scotch sides and the price obtained for meat from the Argentine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Government is looking at the fundamental thing.  We should remember that the market that we are looking to with such confidence has considerable difficulties <Col N="792" /> of its own.  If tariffs are not imposed on foreign beef, then those who produce for that market will not be able to continue to pay the high prices they have been paying for store cattle.  As I say, they are paying those high prices because they believe their Government will give them protection. If we were to place our dependence on that market it would, I submit, be a slender hope to go on.  I think that our Minister is very wise in making every effort to develop other lines for our agriculturists.</P>
      <P>Those who study the debates that take place in the House of Commons will see reported the statements of farmer representatives in that assembly advocating wheat-growing, statements about the calamitous prices offered in that country for oats and about the poor type of store cattle that they have.  Statements of a similar kind are made in the North of Ireland.  All that arises from this, that not alone has the British Government neglected its agricultural industry, but the Government that succeeded the British Government here did the very same thing.  We do not propose to do that and we are not doing it.  Every effort has been made here to take away from the farmer what we believe to be uneconomic, to give him the opportunity of producing all that he can, and to enable him to avail himself of the market that exists at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the question of milk.  As a people, we consume about half a glass of milk per head of the population.  If instead we consumed a glass of milk per day, we would possibly require another 120,000 cows to provide milk to meet that consumption, cows giving at least 800 gallons each per annum.  That has not been done, and why?  Because there has been absolute neglect of the production of milk.  Recently the Minister for Local Government and Public Health had to introduce a measure to ensure that our people would be supplied with milk free from disease.  Some people have described that measure as drastic.  It should perhaps be made a lot more drastic to ensure that all milk was absolutely free of disease.  The Minister's measure was the first effort to be <Col N="793" /> made to bring about that reform.  It deals with the most important branch of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>When on this question of milk I would ask Deputies to reflect on the system of milk distribution in the City of Dublin that we inherited.  No effort whatever had been made previously to improve that system.  I believe that the measure introduced by the Minister for Local Government will, in time, help to do away with a good many of the abuses that exist at the present time.  For instance, there is no law at the present time to prevent boys and girls from going up to the market in Dublin and milking overstocked cows.  That milk is hawked about the city and there is nothing to prevent those boys and girls from selling it.  There is no control either of the milk supplies coming into Dublin City.  It is proposed to regularise that by means of legislation and to guarantee to the people that the milk they are supplied with is sound.  In the case of the milk producers, I understand it is proposed to introduce legislation to give them some form of protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, when introducing his Estimate, indicated the progress that had been made in putting the policy of his Department into effect.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did the same in connection with his Department.  The returns at the end of the financial year, published to-day, indicate the progress made by the Government as a whole.  All these things are an indication of the progress that the country is beginning to make.  I have observed that we do not hear so often now the doleful expressions that we used to hear from the benches opposite: that just around the corner misfortune was awaiting us. Even the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day, while not agreeing with everything that the financial returns reveal, admitted that the income tax returns were perfectly correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it may have been.  We all believe that the prosperity of the agricultural industry is fundamental to the success of the country as <Col N="794" /> a whole.  The returns to which I have referred indicate that the agricultural situation is improving.  As regards employment, I am not going to deal with it generally.  I propose to deal with it so far as it relates to agriculture. It is quite true that in the County Meath the division of a lot of land there absorbed quite a number of people, so that at the moment you have not more than one or two parishes in which you have any number of unemployed. In fact, in many parishes it is quite impossible to get workmen at the present time.  That may be due to the action of the Land Commission in dividing up so much land in the county.  That, at any rate, is the position in the County Meath.  I know that there are other counties which are in a worse plight.  There is not any employment in them.  I admit that the farmers in the hilly districts are hard hit.  I would like if the Minister for Agriculture would consider the problem that is there, and see whether he could not do something to relieve it. We in the County Meath can grow wheat and oats, and when we grow oats we can get a good price for it, but it is the farmers in the hilly districts who must pay it.  I am not going to say that the farmers did not have a bad time.  As a farmer myself, I know that although their difficulties were severe and their hardships great they stood up to all that.  I say, furthermore, that suppose it is our misfortune to have to meet further hardships, these men are still prepared to stand up to them.  One thing that surprised me more than anything else was that there were so many farmers in 1931 who had a little laid by which enabled them to carry on.  At the time I did not think there would be so many in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we had Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy MacEoin talking about the activities of the sheriffs. Ever since we came into the Dáil in 1927 we have had that sort of thing going on all over Meath, and in every other county.  Pressure was being put on the Land Commission to collect the land annuities.  The position had not improved by the time this Government took over control.  In <Col N="795" /> fact, it was worse than it had been.  It is quite possible that we would not have got into power but for the fact that the position was getting much worse.  Therefore, it could not be expected that this Government would in three or four years be able to improve what was really a very bad position.  But, as I have said already, if agriculture is the fundamental industry of this country, then the financial accounts published to-day clearly indicate that the position of the agricultural industry has improved and is at last becoming hopeful.  When we took over there was no hope, and many farmer-supporters of the opposite Party voted for us because there was no hope.</P>

There is no more owing in land annuities than there was in 1931.  We gave new hope and new courage to the people, and they have accepted the position.  When the Minister made his introductory speech here, he disclosed many facts which were not palatable to the members of the Opposition.  I watched some of their faces and, to my surprise, their faces dropped.  They got a disappointment. That is not as it should be.  Everyone of us should be glad to see the country improving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was quite a lot of justification for Deputy O'Reilly keeping away as far as he possibly could from the Estimate.  I have heard Deputy O'Reilly speaking here on a number of occasions and sometimes he gave indications of common sense.  Not even once to-night did he get within miles of common sense.  It is a pity that Deputy O'Reilly does not give some consideration to the conditions that prevail in this country. Apparently, he gives attention to the conditions that prevail in Britain.  He appears to be a very close student of conditions in Britain.  If he takes my advice, he will leave Britain alone. They are well able to look after themselves and, when Deputy O'Reilly's Party endeavoured to make pacts with them, the British came off winners every time.  There is no necessity to tell us of the conditions in Britain.  It is with the conditions in this country that we are concerned and that Deputy O'Reilly ought to be concerned. In what appeared to be a rather innocuous talk, Deputy O'Reilly to-night libelled Irish cattle and Irish stock&mdash;a thing he ought to be very careful not to do and a thing which no man in Ireland, England, or any <Col N="797" /> other country can do with any justification. We have the best live stock in the world.  They are able to take first place in any market in the world and to hold it.  It is not for Deputy O'Reilly to come in here and say that, because of neglect by the previous Government, which did more for live stock than any Government in the world did in the same period, 30 per cent. of our live stock are not saleable. That is a libel which Deputy O'Reilly should be ashamed to utter. After experience of the Live Stock Breeding Act he comes in and says that the late Government made not the slightest effort to improve live stock. Later, of course, he contradicted himself, when he endeavoured in a roundabout way to say that, in his opinion, the production of bulbs and things of that sort was of more importance than the production of live stock and that the late Minister for Agriculture could not devote time to these things because he had to give all his attention to live stock.  That is the type of thinking in which members on the opposite side indulge.  Deputy O'Reilly is a farmer and comes from farming stock, and that is what he gives us across the floor of the House on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  He is so poor a student of the conditions in this country that he told us that when his Party came into power they had to get rid of the old cows so as to improve the standard of the cattle.  It is a pity the Deputy had not a consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce before that Minister made a fool of himself over the number of cows in the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce boasted in this House and outside it that there were 101,000 more cows in the country to-day than there were in 1931.  He is right in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how far Deputy O'Reilly is right in what he said.  Although we have 101,000 more cows, we have half a million fewer cattle under one year old.  What is the cause of that?  The cause is obvious and is known to every farmer.  Deputy O'Reilly may have deliberately blinded himself to it.  On no farm on which cows are kept are there not a couple of sterile, old cows <Col N="798" /> that cannot be sold.  I have here a leaflet published by the Department of Agriculture, which gives the price of fat cows at the present time.  Taking the same Department's leaflet for 1931, I find that fat cows are to-day worth £6, whereas in 1931 they were worth from £15 to £18.  And, of course, Deputy O'Reilly thinks that these old cows have been got rid of.  The Deputy told us about stall-feds being taken up in trains.  Does the Deputy contemplate taking them up in aeroplanes? If he does not, how does he expect to take them up to the Dublin market or to get them to the British or any other markets?  He says we are not able to keep our place on that market because our goods are not standardised.  What is Fianna Fáil doing to standardise our goods so far as agriculture is concerned?  He says the policy of Fianna Fáil is to take away what is uneconomic for the farmer.  But Fianna Fáil is making the farmer do what is uneconomic for the nation.  Deputy O'Reilly knows as well as I do that if agriculture is the main industry of the country&mdash;and it is&mdash;it must be able to live out of its own production without subsidy.  I do not say that you might not occasionally have to subsidise a branch of agriculture or of any other industry.  That is occasionally necessary, but what branch of agriculture is paying to-day that is not subsidised out of the public purse?  None.</P>

      <P>Do not trouble about England.  Keep your eyes off England and on this country.  Deputy O'Reilly has his eyes on England too.  It will not do him a bit of good.  This Estimate is only in keeping with the practice of Fianna Fáil, which came in here to cut down expenses and economise. When agricultural products and prices generally, including agricultural wages, have dropped considerably, and while our exports have dropped from £18,000,000 to £6,000,000&mdash;by £12,000,000 &mdash;in three years, we find that the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, that is responsible for certain agricultural activities in this country, <Col N="799" /> has gone up since 1933 from £119,000 to £180,000, and that the number of officials employed in the Department of Agriculture has more than doubled in that time.</P>
      <P>Of course, I think that the predecessors of the present Government were very bad politicians in comparison with the present gentlemen who occupy that office, because the previous Government endeavoured, so far as they possibly could, to run the various departments economically.  They did not take on more officials than were required, and they did not pay more money than was required to be paid. Fianna Fáil, however, have a different outlook, and we have a very good example of the outlook of Fianna Fáil in this matter that we are discussing here.  Apparently Fianna Fáil realises that every new appointee is a new organiser for Fianna Fáil, and consequently, in the various public departments&mdash;take any of them you like&mdash;the personnel of their officials has gone up and up and up.  The officials in the Department of Agriculture have gone up from 331 in 1933 to 698 to-day, according to the official Estimate, and the expenditure has gone up from £119,000 to £180,000.  The extraordinary thing about it is that, while all that has happened, the farmers' income has dropped by such an amount.  The Minister for Agriculture, who is present here, publishes monthly sheets showing the various prices of stock and the Minister for Industry and Commerce publishes another volume and shows us that the average price per head of our stock has dropped from about £19 in 1931 to £11 at the present time.  Of course, there is this much to be said about it: that once the present Government had embarked upon the insane economic war, as they call it&mdash; an economic war in which there are no sufferers and no casualties except on one side, and as far as we are concerned there is no war going on because we have surrendered and given in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only casualties are on this side.  We are engaged in an economic war&mdash;or at least somebody is engaged in an economic war&mdash;against the farmers of this country, and that is the only war that is going on.  The present Government has no war with England at all.  They are not fighting it, but the farmers are fighting it, because it is the farmers who have to pay, and the present Government is reaping the advantage of it because they are collecting the annuities here and the other moneys for pensions and so on that were formerly sent across, while the farmer is paying the whole lot.  There are no other casualties in that war than the Irish farmers and, of course, naturally, the Irish labourers and the shopkeepers and other people who are dependent on the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy Donnelly, when speaking here yesterday, seemed to be very hard to please.  Ordinarily, I have a great respect for Deputy Donnelly, but he seemed to be very hard to please in the speech he made last night.  First, he seemed to be greatly annoyed because the policy of the Opposition appeared to be practically the same policy as that of Fianna Fáil so far as agriculture is concerned.  Of course, Deputy Donnelly is an astute <Col N="801" /> politician.  He would like to be able to go down the country and say to the people who have to grow wheat and beet as a substitute for cattle and live stock generally, that if the present Government were put out of office they would not be able to sell their wheat or their beet.  Consequently, Deputy Donnelly does not like the fact that the policy of the Opposition, if they do get into power, would be, for the time being at least, to continue whatever advantages there are from beet or wheat.  Deputy Donnelly seemed to be very annoyed that that was so, and, peculiarly enough, I think he was even more annoyed that there was one new departure, as he said, in the Fine Gael policy for agriculture, and that was that they were going to provide a loan at a certain rate. Accordingly, it did not matter whether we fell in with the Fianna Fáil policy or whether we differed from it&mdash;it annoyed Deputy Donnelly, anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was floated in Tipperary on Sunday by Deputy Morrissey&mdash;£3,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the peculiar thing was that Deputy Donnelly asked, and he seemed to be quite serious about it&mdash;or at least he endeavoured to pretend to the House that he was serious&mdash;what about all this money that Deputy Cosgrave had paid to England during the last ten years. One would imagine, to hear Deputy Donnelly, that Deputy Donnelly and his Party had stopped that flow of money to England, whereas the President, speaking here, has told us that we are paying that money in a very much more painful way, and with a much greater dislocation of trade. The President admitted that and said that he regretted that that was so, but one might imagine, from what Deputy Donnelly says, that they had stopped that and that that money was not going out at all.  There was another thing that Deputy Donnelly told us, at which I was amazed.  In fact, I was rather amazed that Deputy O'Reilly did not use it also, because it seems to be stock-in-trade of Fianna Fáil so far as land and agriculture are concerned.  I refer to Deputy Donnelly's <Col N="802" /> question as to why people are looking for land if it is not paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly.</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Quite so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is time to abandon that.  The Deputy knows just as well as I do that land has both a present and a potential value.  He knows quite well that it is something valuable and stable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that, even though it is not paying, and even though a man cannot rear his family in decency and comfort on the land, it is something stable at any rate, and Deputy Donnelly knows that, long before the predecessors of Fianna Fáil were in office, even when the landlord system was here, people wanted land.  Accordingly, I say it is time to abandon that kind of argument. It is just nonsense, and nobody knows that better than Deputy Donnelly. Deputy Donnelly told us also, when speaking yesterday, that this economic war was an international conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that it was the duty of the Opposition, as it would be the duty of the Opposition in any other country of the world, to stand in with the Government and to fight this international conflict, as he described it</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.  That is their job; so why do you not do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another side to this, which I should like to commend to Deputy Donnelly.  There are people in Ireland, besides the Fianna Fáil Party, that have consciences, and feel they have obligations to the people although they are not the Government of the country. Just as Deputy Donnelly would, if he were a member of a household, where the leading member of that household was running the place on the rocks, feel obliged to speak out his mind as to what was happening, so the people on this side of the House feel compelled <Col N="803" /> to speak out their minds at what is happening under the present Government.  Our people told the Fianna Fáil Party when they were embarking on this economic war, England had a weapon with which to hit them back but, the Fianna Fáil Party, who were so ready to say that the British could fool Deputy Cosgrave, were then so foolish themselves as to say that the British had to wait for Deputy Cosgrave to tell them what to do.  What reason or logic is there in argument of that kind?  Deputy Cosgrave was not afraid to tell our people what the position was, or to keep from them what was in his mind.  The sooner the Fianna Fáil Party, and others, realise that the Opposition have obligations to our people, the better it will be for themselves and for this country also. I say that if the Opposition were to do what Deputy Donnelly says they should do, and fall in behind the Government and say now because they are fighting the British, whether in the interests of the country or not, we would be equally guilty with the Party opposite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing has come out of this discussion, and that is <Col N="804" /> that the scales are falling from the eyes of some people.  Deputy Davin was amazed yesterday; he gave expression to one truth at any rate.  He said that Deputy Norton was opposing this Vote and that he should have opposed the whole Fianna Fáil policy with regard to agricultural labourers. I agree.  I think it was stupid that the Labour Party did not see where the Fianna Fáil Party was leading them.  Now we have the Labour Party enquiring into the position of the agricultural labourers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way to solve the agricultural labour question, and that is to put the farmers in the way of being able to pay a proper rate of wage.  Everyone knows that.  Deputy Davin has to come a long way yet before he gets a proper grip of the position.  He said last night that he wanted to know why some of the millions paid to the farmers in bounties and subsidies did not find its way into the pockets of the labourers.  He wanted to know why some arrangement was not made by the Minister for Agriculture to see that more of the millions that went into the farmers' pockets, by way of these subsidies and bounties, did not pass into the pockets of the labourers. One would imagine there was no economic war so far as prices are concerned. Deputy Davin knows and everyone knows, that the reason bounties were given to the farmers was to give them something for their time in the matter of production.  Whatever little relief the bounties give them they are still at a loss. One would imagine, listening to Deputy Davin, that the farmers were getting something extra, and that out of that they should pay the agricultural labourers a decent wage. It is all very well for Deputy Davin and the Labour Party to accuse the Minister for Agriculture for neglecting agricultural labourers' wages, and that he should at least have set up a wages board.  But it is well to warn the Labour Party that if the Minister for Agriculture or anybody else set up a wages board and that that board fixed a wage, without regard <Col N="805" /> to the farmers' income, the effect would be disastrous to agricultural labourers because they could not be paid that wage.  They could not be employed at all, and they could not be paid a standard rate of wage unless the position of agriculture is improved.</P>
    <P>One thing that Deputy Davin stated shows that there is some semblance of commonsense at last coming into the minds of the Labour allies of the Government.  So far as the economic war is concerned Deputy Davin is quite prepared to sit down and consider it. He is even quite prepared to make a token payment and, mind you, as we are paying the annuities in the way the President says we are paying them, it would be much better and easier to pay them in the ordinary way. We would at least have this advantage that the price of live stock here would not be depressed to the extent it is in the payment of the annuities as they are at present paid, because at the present time the British price makes the price here.  The Minister for Agriculture told us that recently, and because there was a certain relaxation of the price so far as the British were concerned that meant the depression of prices here.  The same applies to prices in Spain and elsewhere so that we are paying annuities to everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin did not agree with Deputy O'Leary or Deputy Bennett that the Minister for Agriculture had done something practical for the dairying industry.  Deputy Corry on various occasions tried to point out that because of the steps taken by the Government in regard to the creamery industry the price of milk was raised considerably.  But if the farmers engaged in dairying could get the same price for their cows as they were getting before the economic war they would not be in need of any subsidies or else they could do with a lot less in the way of subsidies.  I would like if Deputy Donnelly would take the case of a farmer with 30 cows to-day, and work out what loss that farmer is at year after year when he has to replenish his stock and when he can only get £5 or £6 a piece for beasts to be sent to Roscrea but for which formerly he could have got £15 or £20 <Col N="806" /> apiece.  It would take quite a big subsidy to recoup him for that loss.</P>
    <P>The discussion of this Estimate has been remarkable for this, that all those who spoke, I will not say in favour of the Estimate, but against the Opposition, because nobody spoke in favour of the Estimate&mdash;they all kept as far as they possibly could from the Estimate&mdash;showed an amount of inconsistency. But one speech rather amused me and that was the speech of Deputy Jordan of Galway.  Deputy Brodrick spoke against the adoption of the Estimate and that appeared to annoy Deputy Jordan to such an extent that he drew the attention of the House to the inconsistency of Deputy Brodrick who, two weeks ago, asked the Minister for God's sake to continue the subsidy for seed potatoes, and now opposed the Agricultural Estimate.  Is not that an extraordinary suggestion?</P>
    <P>We had a more remarkable speech from Deputy Victory.  Deputy MacEoin, speaking from this side of the House, pointed out very forcibly the condition of the farmers in his constituency and gave some illustrations of the conditions to which the farmers had been driven by the present policy of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Victory complimented Deputy MacEoin on the speech he had made and said he was glad to hear Deputy MacEoin speak as he did, and did not find the least fault with it.  Deputy MacEoin&mdash;it was the first time I heard it, although I believe it was stated in this House before and in other places&mdash;burst the bubble of Fianna Fáil so far as the no-rates and no-annuities campaign is concerned when he told the House, and Deputy Victory or anybody else did not contradict him, that when the Minister for Local Government asked the Longford County Council whether the members had or had not paid their rates and annuities, and when the Fine Gael members said they wanted to know that, the matter was inquired into and it was found that the only people who had not paid their rates and annuities were five Fianna Fáil members of the Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being decent to them.  Certainly we ought not to hear any more about the no-rates or the no-annuities campaign.  A similar state of affairs was revealed in Tipperary&mdash;not a single Fine Gael member was in arrears, but there were four or five Fianna Fáil members in arrears.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore made a statement last night which I think was most unjustifiable, and I think it was the first time it was ever made by a Fianna Fáil Deputy or by a Labour Deputy or anybody in this House.  He was referring to the wages paid to agricultural labourers, and he said: &ldquo;We all know that there was a fall in wages some time ago, a political fall.&rdquo;  Does Deputy Moore or anybody else believe that, because a farmer had certain political views, he cut down the wages of his labourer who had different views?  The allegation was made at one time that the services of certain labourers, were dispensed with because they had different views from their employers, but it was never stated until last night that people were retained in the service of employers and that their wages were cut down, and that that was responsible for the lower wages at present.  Deputy Moore said: &ldquo;We have killed that campaign now, and wages are coming back again to where they were.&rdquo;  That is dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate the Minister for Agriculture informed the House, perhaps in a roundabout way, that at present we were not filling our fat cattle quota, and that possibly there might be reactions later on.  After making that statement he went on to tell us that, notwithstanding that, it is possible we might have to restrict production of cattle in this country. <Col N="808" /> Further on he told us that the slaughter of calves was still in operation.  I cannot follow that type of reasoning.  If the Minister tells us that we are not able to fill the cattle quota, as in effect he has told us, he certainly ought to give up his policy of slaughtering calves, and he ought not to tell the people that they may possibly have to restrict the production of cattle.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I am very anxious to know, and that the country is entitled to know, because, as far as I am aware, we have not had the information from the Minister or the President or anybody else, and that is in connection with the recent coal-cattle pact.  There seems to be a feeling abroad that, so far as the quota restrictions are concerned, there has been a removal of some restrictions to our benefit.  I wonder if that is so? If it is so we are entitled to know it. The people ought to know where they are.  They ought to be told that.  We have heard a lot about secret agreements, even though the payment of the money was authorised by this House. I do not know what type of agreement was made recently with Great Britain. It is very hard to follow it, because, if our quota has been increased in numbers, we ought to be told that.  If it is, presumably, increased because we are going to buy more coal from England, then we ought to know where we are with regard to the Turf Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing it. Then what are we going to do with the turf?  The farmers are entitled to know where they stand in this respect. It is like blind man's buff.  That is the type of agricultural policy for which Fianna Fáil stands.  They are chasing one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow.  It is all blind man's buff.  If Fianna Fáil or anybody else thinks that the main industry of the country, namely agriculture, can exist by subsidisation and that the country can exist on that type of farming, they are making the biggest mistake they ever made in their life.  It is illogical and absurd.  I should like the Minister for Agriculture to take advantage, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce advised Deputies on this side of the House recently, of the figures published with regard to agriculture.  I should like him to pay particular attention to the imports of artificial manure and the manufacture of artificial manure in this country and see in what way the land is being utilised at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody thinks that the land of Ireland has an inexhaustible supply of plant food, he is making the biggest mistake he ever made in his life. There is no man here of average age who has had anything to do with land who does not know the amount of manure that has been put into the land of Ireland during the last 30 or 40 years to make it what it is to-day. I got the figures with regard to manure imports and the manufacture of manure in this country.  They are appalling, and the Minister, in addition to that, says that we ought to have less live stock.  What is going to happen to the land of this country? We must get away from the idea that agriculture can be maintained for all time by subsidisation.  It cannot be done.  There is only one way in which agricultural wages can be paid and <Col N="810" /> that is by making agriculture prosperous, by putting it in a position in which it can pay wages, by giving it a profit.  There is no use in endeavouring, as Deputy Moore endeavoured last night, to make comparison between agricultural wages paid in this country and in England, because the cost of living in this country is quite different. Is it any wonder it is different?  The people who saw the Exchequer returns in to-day's paper, and saw that £10,000,000 were got from tariffs alone, must realise what a burden the plain man in this country has to carry on his back in addition to the economic war. Tariff burdens to the extent of £10,000,000 he has got to carry.</P>
    <P>There is only one basis for agriculture in this country and that is the basis of live stock and live-stock products.  They constitute the basis of prosperity in this country, and, not alone that, but the basis of tillage in this country.  You cannot have tillage without live stock. You cannot maintain the soil of this country without manure.  You cannot do it with artificial manure except to a limited extent.  The Fianna Fáil Party and the Government appear to think that what is more important than a prosperous agricultural community is that the faces of Fianna Fáil must be saved.  They must save their political faces.  We have got to drop that sooner or later.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which was referred to in the Minister's speech and which has become a kind of catch-cry or byword all over the country to-day&mdash;the activity displayed by the Government in regard to catching the warble-fly.  Of course, as I said in the beginning, it is good politics.  We have hundreds of Fianna Fáil organisers catching the warble fly all over the country, but the tragedy of it is that the local rates and the Exchequer must pay for the joke.  The benefit, as the Minister has pointed out, may be a couple of shillings per hide, whereas at the present time a beast carries a load of £4 5s. 0d., the British penal tariff, and there is nothing at all about it.  As a small farmer said to me down in Roscommon recently, this thing about the <Col N="811" /> warble fly beats anything Fianna Fáil has done yet.  Just imagine, those people do not want cattle at all; they say: &ldquo;You ought not to have cattle; they are not patriotic; but, if you have them, it does not matter whether they are in good condition or not, there must be no holes in the hide. You must mind the hides, anyway.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position we are in to-day is one in which Fianna Fáil is chasing the pennies and losing the pounds. Another joke about the warble fly is that an official of the Department of Agriculture explained to the Roscommon County Council that we are merely endeavouring to keep step with the British Ministry of Agriculture. Is it not terribly slavish for Deputy Donnelly and the people who stand with him to have an official from the Department of Agriculture stating that, notwithstanding the fact that we are at war with England&mdash;there is an international conflict going on&mdash;we must keep step with the British Ministry and catch this warble fly.  And the whole idea of it is to save the hide. I certainly should like to see the warble fly caught, but if I were in Deputy Donnelly's shoes I should be ashamed of my life for two reasons: because I was chasing the warble fly to improve my beast by 2s. and, at the same time, making him carry a load of £4 5s. which I was either afraid or ashamed to get rid of.</P>
    <P>The whole position is deplorable and I am afraid there is no use in trying to make any impression on Fianna Fáil.  They will possibly go on pursuing their present policy until this country is unable to get back, but I would remind Fianna Fáil again that the lands of this country have not an inexhaustible supply of plant food. They must be manured and there is no use in the Minister or Senator Connolly dividing land and endeavouring to have families reared on it unless that land is kept in such a condition that it will be able to bear fruit.  Let us talk common sense and let us get away from politics.  Let Fianna Fáil get down to the basic fundamentals of agriculture.  If they do, they will realise that the policy they are pursuing to-day is pure humbug.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan makes a very unfair contrast when he tries to suggest that the cost of services as at present administered is greatly in excess of what it was during the previous regime.  He has taken very good care to avoid taking into consideration the cost of the various schemes which have been initiated and which are in progress throughout the country.  He stated that in order to cut down expenditure the late Government cut down salaries and several other items of expenditure.  I should like to remind Deputy Brennan that in one phase of the agricultural administration, namely the Dairy Disposals Board, while the late Government were in office, the administrative cost of the service was questionable.  The purchase of the proprietary creameries during the period of the Cosgrave Administration was a very questionable arrangement.  I do say that the prices paid under that scheme by the board were very much open to question.</P>

      <P>I am trying to draw a fair contrast which Deputy Brennan carefully avoided.  The Deputy tried to show that by the cutting down of expenditure they were able to have a better system and to provide a cheaper administration.  On another occasion Deputy Belton tried to prove that special facilities in regard to the exceptional levy had been afforded to the Kerry cattle area.  I should like to point out to Deputy Belton and to other Deputies that Kerry did not get that concession.  It was provided for in the Stabilisation of Prices Act that the Kerry cattle area would get that exemption, but it did not come about.  I do not blame the Minister or the Department for that, because in the operations of the Stabilisation of Prices Act the system worked out satisfactorily.  In other words, prices found their own level, and the Minister and the Department were not called upon to give the benefit of the levy provided for in that Act.  At the same time I should like to say that if concessions are to be given to farmers, <Col N="813" /> the farmers in that particular area are entitled to them.</P>
      <P>I have noticed that the representatives of the Creameries' Association have approached the Minister and asked him to give a guaranteed price of 120/- per cwt. for butter.  I am of the opinion that the creameries have been fairly well catered for by the Department already.  There are several areas, such as the area I represent, where home butter-making is carried on to a very great extent.  I submit that such areas would be more entitled to concessions than the areas represented by the people who approached him from the Creamery Managers' Association or the representatives of the creameries.  I want to say that I am not in any way finding fault with the creameries or with the creamery managers for trying to get the best possible concessions from the Minister. But I do hold that these poor, undeveloped areas where there are no creameries operating and where the people certainly are hard hit are more entitled to concessions.  The small farmers of the mountainy side of the county from which I come are more entitled to concessions than those in the richer areas.  If any move is being made in that direction, if the Minister can see his way by some adjustment, or if there are any funds available whereby the farmers can be assisted, I would appeal to him to give the farmers of my constituency that assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point to which I wish to refer.  I notice that instead of there being an increase, there is actually a decrease in the amount allowed for schemes in the congested areas.  I say that is not very satisfactory or very encouraging.  Take our County of Kerry, one of the poorest counties in Ireland.  In order to avail of the different schemes and to inaugurate a lime subsidy scheme for the county, the Kerry County Council struck an increased rate.  I submit that instead of there being a decrease in the amount available for expending on these schemes in the congested areas there should be an increase.  If you take the position in a poor county like Kerry, where the people are trying to <Col N="814" /> do their utmost to avail of the various schemes, you will see how the matter works out.  The beet and the wheat schemes are not suitable for most of that area.  For that reason there should be some encouragement given to them by increasing the amounts provided for other schemes.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I must say that no one realises better than I do and better than the people I represent what the Minister has done and is trying to do for agriculture.  In very trying and difficult periods he has done everything possible to find beneficial schemes for the people of Kerry and similar areas.  The point has been made by several Opposition Deputies that we are afraid to admit that the farmers are hard hit.  We never denied that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In fact we know that the farmers in our county have been hard hit, but they have stood up to it and they will always stand up to it.  I do say that if the economic war were settled to-morrow, the farmers in our county and in other parts of the country should never be forgotten for the fight they put up in this economic war.  The farmers and the farmers' sons always fought when needed. This catch-cry that we hear so much about of knuckling down to England and being beaten to the ropes and all that kind of thing will never work with the farmers of this country, because there is something more than a material side to this fight.  No matter how hard hit they are, the farmers will stand up to it.  I say that when they are making such a great fight in adverse circumstances everything should be done for them by the Department of Agriculture and the Minister in the way of assisting them. I again wish to say that our people appreciate what is being done for them.  We hope that if there is any possibility of inaugurating further schemes for the areas I have mentioned the Minister and the Department will avail of that possibility.</P>

      <P>It is hard for some of us, like myself, who have grown <Col N="815" /> grey on the land, and who have watched the growth of the development of the usefulness of the Department of Agriculture over a long number of years, to find that the usefulness of that Department has gone since the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government to office.  Let us go back to 1927-28 when the Department of Agriculture was a useful body giving very valuable service to the State.  The Department Estimate that year was £527,150.  I would like Deputies to compare that with the very much increased Estimate for 1936-37.  If I had my way I would go further than the motion on the Order Paper suggests, slightly further; instead of moving that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, I would be inclined to move that the Department be scrapped as a whole. I would be inclined to press a motion of that sort were it not that I know that Fianna Fáil will soon be leaving office and the usefulness of the Department will again make itself felt.  It is an extraordinary thing to find that, making a comparison between 1928 and the present time, the cost of the Department of Agriculture has been practically doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read in the Official Report speeches made by the Minister and Deputies of his Party and they have stressed the advantages of growing wheat and beet.  They have talked in thousands and probably millions and emphasised the advantages that wheat and beet are conferring on the State. Will they tell us the cost of production of wheat and beet and let us know what amount the farmer has after his wheat and beet have been harvested? I have before me a report presented to the Cork County Committee of Agriculture in which is given the estimated cost of producing an acre of wheat. It is for the year 1934 and I do not think that there has been any change since then; I believe the cost of production would be about the same and the average yield would be about the same.  According to this report, it works out at a total cost of £7 17s. 6d. a statute acre.  It gives the average return for that year at seven barrels to the acre and I do not think the <Col N="816" /> average yield has increased since.  The price that year was fixed at 16/6, with a bounty of 7/- per barrel.  The return is given at £9 9s. 6d. per acre, the cost of production was £7 17s. 6d. and that left £1 12s. 6d. of a net return.</P>
    <P>I gave figures recently in the Dáil in regard to an acre that would be now devoted to wheat and I compared them with what could be made out of that same acre if used in another way.  I proved that an acre of ground could feed four cattle and if we were allowed to get the price that prevails in the English market to-day, if our cattle had not to take £4 5s. 0d. on their horns when going over to England, that acre would leave £16 to the farmer.  I would like, instead of trotting out figures here in thousands and millions, if the Minister would get his instructors, who have really given useful service, to go into the cost of production of wheat, beet, tobacco and the other schemes that the Government have tried to put into operation since they came into office, and if they can prove that those schemes are more advantageous to the farmer than the system under which we worked heretofore, then I shall be satisfied.  I hold that the system that was established here many years ago and that our people found from experience was an advantageous one for themselves and the State, the system on which they were able to support themselves and their families in decent conditions and that enabled them to educate their children and put a little by for the rainy day, the system that our fathers and grandfathers found was a sound system, should not have been touched. It was very unwise to change over from that system, and the Government should first have ascertained if their schemes were going to be a success.</P>
    <P>No useful purpose would be served now by talking about the economic war, but if we did not have the economic war I venture to think the country would be very much better off to-day. Deputy O'Reilly and other Deputies always have their eye on England. They are like the West Cork &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; when it had its eye on Russia in other days.  Deputy O'Reilly and others have their eye on England; they decry <Col N="817" /> everything English.  They tell us that the English market is gone but, bad and all as it may be from their viewpoint, it is as good now as it ever was within the last ten years.  Unfortunately, our cattle have to carry £4 5s. on their horns in order to get in there. I mentioned the work of the agricultural instructors, and I repeat that they did useful work but, notwithstanding the experiments they have carried out, and are carrying out&mdash;manurial experiments&mdash;we have no new manures. We are applying the same manures to the different crops.  All farmers know what manures to apply to the different crops.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M. (1) refers to Miscellaneous Work, and I see that we have under that heading an inspector, a superintending costings officer and six costings officers.  It might be well if the instructors, even at this late hour, could be got to call on different farmers and find out from them what it costs to produce the new crops the Department have suggested to replace our old system of farming.  That would be a step in the right direction and we would know where we are.  I would like to refer to the sub-head dealing with the improvement of flax growing.  We have beet and wheat and probably, under present conditions, they may be attractive crops to the farmers who can grow them.  The farmers who are growing them have an advantage over the people to whom Deputy Flynn referred, the people in Co. Kerry, and the people whom I represent in West Cork.  They cannot grow wheat or beet.  Those who can have the advantage of a guaranteed price for their crops, and they have also the advantage that they are not paying anything towards the annuities and the other moneys that are going to England because they are not rearing cattle for export.  In my constituency and in the county Deputy Flynn represents, different conditions prevail.  The Deputy says the people in his constituency are poor; he acknowledges they are poor and very few Fianna Fáil Deputies acknowledge such a thing&mdash;Deputy Flynn is honest.</P>
    <P>We had this Flax Bill which got its first reading here I think in the first week of December, and we had it circulated <Col N="818" /> on the 1st of April.  I wonder if it is a fools' day prank of the Minister to introduce it, because of all the Bills I ever read it is the most vague.  There is no information as to what is to be done with the flax produced, or no guarantee so far given to any prospective growers of flax.  Perhaps the Minister, in his winding up statement, may give us some information about it.  There is another matter of some importance to which I should like to refer, and that is cow testing. I think there is a slight reduction in the Estimate for the improvement of milk production.  If there is one thing which would be any asset at all to the farmer down the country it is an improvement in milk production.  He handles the price of milk every month. He has to wait for the price of beet and he has to wait for the price of wheat until the end of 12 months, but he gets his milk cheque every month. Experience has told us that you can feed the cows and increase the milk yield by 100 or 200 or 300 or more gallons per cow in the course of a few years.  If that could be done, thereby increasing the milk cheques for the poor people who have nothing else to live on, it would be a step in the right direction.  Instead of seeing £22,000 for the improvement of milk production I should like to see £44,000 or more.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into horse breeding.  I know only one or two of the members personally, but I wonder if any of them ever harnessed a pair of horses to a plough. I am sure they are all interested in bloodstock and the production of hunters, but they recommend the Irish draught horse.  For some reason which I do not know they recommend that the heavy horse&mdash;they do not mention whether it is the Clydesdale or the Shire&mdash;might be useful in counties such as Monaghan, Offaly, Kildare, or Kerry.  That is a matter which we have been advocating here year after year, even before this Government came into office.  The Cork County Committee of Agriculture I think on one occasion asked for a Clydesdale stallion or two to be registered and licensed in the West Cork <Col N="819" /> area.  Of course they could be brought in by men who are willing to pay the money out of their own pockets, but there is no hope, I suppose, of their getting a loan from the Department.  I may be wrong in that, but I think there is not.  There is a general demand for them in the different areas in West Cork, where they want heavy horses to pull the loads from different places. Those people know what they are talking about.  Their wants should be supplied because they know the requirements of their districts.  Time and again they asked to have a Clydesdale stallion or two sent into the West Cork area.  I hope that the Minister will now favourably consider the matter. There are Clydesdale stallions within a ten-mile radius of Cork City, but that is no good to the farmer who lives 60, 70 or 80 miles away in West Cork, and cannot afford to send his mare to such a stallion.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the excessive cost to the farmers, and especially to the pig producers, of the admixture scheme. I think it cannot be stressed too strongly that the small pig producer is a thing of the past.  The pig was considered to be the poor man's friend. The poor man has no friend now, because on account of the commercialised system we have at the moment he cannot afford to compete with the big men.  The cost of producing a pig is beyond his means, with the result that he is left without a pig. The West Cork farmers feel that they have a great grievance with regard to this admixture.  At the lowest calculation it is costing an extra 15/- to produce a pig on account of the admixture system, whilst the system that we had established, and our fathers before us, was to feed what was capable of consumption on the farm&mdash; potatoes, wheat, oats and barley&mdash;and sell the surplus.  If we were given an opportunity of absorbing the surplus that we have for sale, and confining it to the county, it would be a benefit to the West Cork farmer.  At the moment he is selling his surplus, and in addition he is compelled to pay for the farmer members of the Grain-growers' Association who are fortunate <Col N="820" /> enough to get this admixture scheme carried through.  He afterwards has to sell his produce in competition with those who can produce a pig at a cost of 15/- less.  I do not think there is any change in the situation since the report of the Grain Inquiry Tribunal was issued.  They said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The admixture proposals do not possess the advantages claimed for them by their advocates.  We are satisfied that a mixed meal composed of 85 per cent. of maize and 15 per cent of home-grown grain could not be produced at the cost of maize meal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose that report has been read by every Deputy in the House, and I need not go into it any further.  As far as I can remember, the evidence given before this tribunal was to the effect that about 70 per cent. of the maize imported into this country came through the port of Cork.  The bulk of that 70 per cent. of maize was fed in Munster, and I take it that the greater portion of that was fed in Cork. They have 50 per cent. of the oats or some mixture in it now and they have to take it from Athy or some place up in this part of the country, pay for transport to Cork, and for mixing by millers, and then try to compete in the markets against those who have the advantage of maize and cheap feeding.  That is unfair.  I wonder where the grain growers would find themselves if Cork pig feeders went out of production for a year.  The Minister would then find a good deal of surplus corn on hands.  It would be fair and equitable to let each county consume home-produced corn and to mix it with maize or other feeding. If each county did that it would be a step in the right direction.  I suppose there is no good suggesting these things to the Minister, and very little good suggesting anything to improve conditions until the Government comes back to sanity and ends the economic war.</P>
    <P>Give us back normal conditions and the markets that were advantageous to us.  No matter what Fianna Fáil says these markets are there still, and they are as good as they were for the last <Col N="821" /> 20 or 30 years.  I suppose the Minister for Agriculture like his Government is not going to do that, and that the poor unfortunate farmers will have to struggle along under the present frightful conditions.  A good deal has been said about the wages of agricultural labourers.  They are the most hard-working people in this State, with the longest hours and the heaviest kind of work.  They have to be out in the wet and the cold, in hail, rain and snow, because cows have to be milked, calves have to be fed, fowl have to be fed, and work has to be done on the farm early and late.  The agricultural workers were never paid for their work.  Whatever farmers were able to pay them in the past, they have nothing to pay them now. It is a shame that agricultural labourers should not be able to get a decent wage, and it is also a shame that farmers are not able to make a decent wage, because both are amongst the most hard-working people in the community.  It is time that Fianna Fáil recognised that agriculture is our main industry.  Agriculture and agricultural economy as we knew it is dead. The Labour Party have a motion on the Order Paper dealing with the wages of agricultural labourers.  They are at last showing that they are wise. Were it not for the support that they gave to the Fianna Fáil Government farmers would now be able to pay their wage-earners better.  If there is one Party responsible for the present position of agriculture it is the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Before I begin a few remarks that I wish to address to the House, let me wish all members, including myself, many happy returns of this, our feast day.  I hope that such members as will be here this day 12 months will have learned the wisdom and prudence of saying what they have to say in fewer words and in the shortest time.  I did not intend to plunge into the abysmal and dismal and unfathomable depths of the beet, wheat, peat, meat, or cheat policy of the Government.  The Peter Pan who is now in charge of the Department of Agriculture is doing his best to serve the Irish farmers in his own <Col N="822" /> childish way, but I doubt if he has succeeded in doing so.  We were told that his policy was going to turn this country into a regular Golconda. What actually has happened, and it may be said in a few words, is raised cost of living, a lower standard of living, and farmers' sons and agricultural labourers fleeing this country because they cannot find a decent livelihood in it.  I have no objection to the Minister's beet and wheat policy so far as it is applicable to certain districts, but, as Deputy Flynn said a few moments ago, there are parts of the rural areas where it is absolutely ruinous.  I know some parts of West Cork where the farmers are hard-working, industrious, intelligent, and wish to make an honest living and to pay all their debts, but very little of the land is cultivable.  The most of it could be described as cúilíní, nooks between rocks where they carry manure on their backs and till with a griffaun.  How could these poor people be expected to make any kind of a living out of such crops, if it is impossible to grow them?  Their only means of livelihood are live stock, poultry, and eggs.  The live-stock trade has been killed by the policy of the present Government.  An ancient Roman writer said that the grass of Ireland was so rich and so nourishing that it almost burst the cattle.  Is it not a disgrace to get rid of that national asset now?  Deputy Donnelly had the audacity to get up here and talk about farming.  Deputy Donnelly has not as much land as would sod a lark.  He would not know a white turnip from a yellow globe, and while laughter is on his lips shame is written on his brow.  The Minister for Agriculture talked recently in a lecture about self-sufficiency.  That is a very good phrase.  Self-sufficiency is a very excellent thing if it could be achieved.  Deputy Kehoe followed the Minister and said that Ireland was never so well governed since the time of Brian Boru.  Did the Deputy ever read any book on Irish history or does he really know anything about Irish history?  Does he know that the followers of Brian Boru were mercilessly attacked on their way home from the Battle of Clontarf?</P>

      <P>Can self-sufficiency be attained by taxing raw materials which we cannot produce?  Will it be attained by the slaughter of calves got from premium bulls which cost immense prices?  Why maintain at great expense all these agricultural colleges if we are told that it is foolish to engage in the rearing of live stock?  Is it to provide inspectors in this over-inspected country?  Is there in the whole world any country in which there are so many inspectors as there are in the Free State?  Why, you cannot go around the corner, or put on your pyjamas, without getting a licence from some inspector.  It is time that really the Department of Agriculture and the Government faced up to realities and that they should see how their policy is leading the country into ruination, bankruptcy and semi-starvation. The condition of the country must be known to them.  There are parts of Ireland in which large farmers are on the verge of ruin.  I know a man myself&mdash;and if the Minister wants the full particulars I shall give them to him&mdash;who has a fairly good farm. He is a hard-working man and has been all his life a hard-working man. He is an abstemious man.  He never wastes one half hour in the town or anywhere else.  That man to my certain knowledge&mdash;and, as I say, I shall give full particulars to the Minister if he desires to have them&mdash;has been living on home assistance and Vincent de Paul relief for the last two years. That is only one case of many in the County Cork.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;and I am sure he has a very kind heart and would not like to see anyone in difficulties&mdash;that he should consider the condition of these people.  Deputy Flynn honestly admits that in Kerry there are many such people.  There are many such people <Col N="824" /> in West Cork and I am sure there are many such people in the whole of Ireland.  These people deserve the fullest and the most favourable consideration, and the Minister if he can come to their assistance without in any way imperilling his policy, or interfering with the progress, prosperity and advancement of the country, ought to come to their assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak for a few moments on this Estimate. I look upon the policy of the Government in connection with agriculture as a policy that was doomed to failure from the beginning.  I have spoken here on this Estimate on a few occasions, giving my own experience and the experience of a number of other farmers with whom I come in contact from time to time, and who have discussed with me, speaking confidentially between ourselves, what was going to happen in the near future if the Government insisted on the policy that they have forced on the country.  I do not want to make a bitter speech or to say anything personal to the Minister.  I know perfectly well, and I could see from the very beginning, that his policy was going to bring ruin and destruction on the agricultural community.  Take, for instance, his wheat policy.  We have no objection to the growing of wheat or the growing of beet in this country. If anything I support it, but I support it only to the point to which it can be grown to the advantage of the farmer, his family and the people who are working with him on his land. In producing anything from the soil we have, first of all, to take into consideration what we are going to make out of it.  How we are going to keep the land in the best condition is another consideration.  We have officials and Ministers in this country who tell us that they can make any branch of agriculture pay. Undoubtedly they can by sitting down with pen and pencil and working out their theories to their own satisfaction; but if they had to go out on the land with plough and harrow, if instead of toasting their feet to the fire they had to work on the land in <Col N="825" /> snow and rain, their theories might not work out so well.</P>
      <P>We have appealed on several occasions to the Minister to change his policy but it appears to have been of no use.  I was glad that Deputy Flynn was honest enough to admit that the farmers in his constituency were depressed.  He knows the situation there but at the same time what is the Government doing to relieve this depression?  Every Deputy on the Government Benches knows perfectly well that we are going through a state of depression against which we cannot stand up indefinitely.  We have families to rear and we have a standard of living, which we are entitled to maintain and we shall fight for that standard of living.  The Minister, in telling us to grow beet and wheat, must remember that we want a price for it that will give us something more than the mere cost of production. Further, we cannot grow wheat if we have not manure to fertilise our lands. If we could grow wheat and get 23/- per sack for it it would pay us, if at the same time we could feel sure that the land in six or seven years time will not be in any worse condition as a result of having grown that wheat. Beet, at 37/- per ton, can only be grown at slave wages.  The man who has to pay labourers cannot grow beet at 37/- per ton.  We are prepared to pay our workers and to keep our workers in employment if we are only put in a position by the Government to pay them.  We must be allowed something over the cost of production if we are to continue to do that.  The agricultural workers are not getting a fair wage but that is not our fault. We cannot help it.  We are not making a wage for ourselves under present conditions and we cannot keep our families in ordinary comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister is handicapped by the Executive Council.  I know too that, if he knows anything about farming, he would not continue to pursue the policy he has put before the country unless there is a certain pressure brought to bear upon him. We have the policy of the slaughter of calves which I regarded as unlucky from the beginning.  At the same time <Col N="826" /> we have 500,000 less cattle on the land than we should have.  If we had that 500,000 cattle, we could still maintain the same number of acres of beet and wheat and even grow these crops with greater success.  I maintain that the number of live stock must be kept up to the maximum to ensure the success of agriculture all round.  Mixed farming is a far better policy than a whole tillage policy.  It gives employment the whole year round, men are just as busy in the months of November and December on a system of farming of that kind as they are in the springtime and harvest.  There is a considerable number of people walking unemployed along the roads to-day.  Take the number of agricultural workers alone who are prepared to give a fair day's work for a fair day's wages.  We know there are others who do not want to work or who never worked and who are drawing the dole.  I do not compare the honest working man to persons like that.  I have men working at home while I am here and I know that they will give a fair return for their wages although I do not see them from one week to another, and although I give them what in other circumstances, might be considered only a miserable wage.  However, were it not for the fact that I have some allowances, I would be quite unable to pay them any wage.  I know farmers in my district who used to employ three or four men weekly and who are now unable to pay wages to any labourer.  I asked the Minister some time ago that if he was not going to do that he should give the farmers of the country some relief.  I put that request to him on several occasions, but he refused to do anything. I asked that some relief should be given as regards the payment of the land annuities while the economic war was going on, but he did nothing. While I say that, I do not want the Minister to think for a moment that I am opposed to the Government for going on with the economic war.  What I want to put to the Minister is that we should be compensated for the losses we have sustained during the last three years and more that the Government have been engaged in this economic war.  As farmers we cannot <Col N="827" /> afford to be losing one year after another.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss my own position in the House, but I can truthfully say that I am a very much poorer man now than I was when the Government came into power.  I want to tell the truth about the situation, and I do not want to exaggerate.  I had to go to the Land Commission to-day on behalf of 12 or 14 farmers to make an appeal that the sheriff would not call on them a second time and take away what stock they have left.  Ten or 12 of these men voted for the Government Party and helped to put them in power.  The appeal that I am making to the Minister is prompted by the condition to which the farmers of the country have been reduced.  This dispute is being carried on solely at our expense.  We are made pay the land annuities to England and pay them at home.  We are appealing to the Minister to compensate us for the losses that we are sustaining.  We are prepared to stand by the Government, and if they can make an agreement with England we will support them.  We are not engaged in any agitation against the Government. What we are standing up against is the injustice that is being practised on us as farmers.  We are being forced to pay what is not due by us. We have to sell our cattle at a reduced price in England and to sell to the home consumer at the same price.  In addition to the £5,000,000 that is being taken from us in the tariffs on what we send into England, we are losing a further £2,000,000 on what we have to sell at home.</P>
    <P>In connection with the cattle that are being bought in Kerry and sold to the Waterford factory for canning, I would like to have some particulars from the Minister&mdash;the average price paid for them, the cost of transit, the fees and commissions paid to those buying them, and the price received in Waterford.  Will the Minister tell me what is the total cost to the State? Deputy O'Reilly to-night said that the late Minister for Agriculture neglected our live-stock industry.  I was here when Deputy Hogan was Minister <Col N="828" /> for Agriculture, and I can say that by the legislation he introduced he did his utmost to improve the live-stock industry.  He did that work so well that we have as good a breed of cattle as any country in the world.  We are proud of our cattle.  Deputy O'Reilly said that about 31 per cent. of the cattle offered for sale at a particular fair were so bad that they could not be sold.  Well, I can say that we have not cattle of that type in either Kilkenny or Carlow.  One would imagine, listening to Deputy O'Reilly, that we were never better off than we are today&mdash;that prosperity is ready to greet us around the corner.  So far as I can see, there is no prosperity awaiting the farmers around the corner, but rather a position in which they will get more and more into debt.  The Minister, in my opinion, should use his influence with the Executive Council to get some relief for the farmers while the economic war is going on.</P>
    <P>The growing of beet and wheat is all right.  We will grow both as long as we get a price that pays us to do so.  There has been some reference to oats and barley.  We have been given to understand that the Minister is going to introduce a Bill to deal with both crops.  We will welcome that Bill, and I hope the result of it will be to improve prices all round. In connection with the horse-breeding industry, you have a certain number of people in the country well able to look after the end of it that is concerned with thoroughbred sires, race horses and hunters.  I urge that some attention be given to the breeding of the ordinary working horse that is required on the land.  There is an inclination to breed a type of horse that is a bit too light for that work. The old Irish draught horse is the ideal type.  He is a good working horse but sometimes is not heavy enough. Although I never cared much for the Shire or the Clydesdale, I think that you might get a useful type of horse by crossing the Irish draught with the Shire or Clydesdale.  I hope the Department will give some attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, I have always <Col N="829" /> been very much opposed to the policy of the Government in connection with the slaughter of calves.  I had hoped that I would not see any provision in this year's Estimate for that purpose. I hope, however, that the Minister will curtail expenditure as much as possible in that direction, because I have no doubt that in a few years' time there will be a cattle shortage in this country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we have no objection to the growing of wheat, but we maintain that the policy of wheat growing should not be carried to the extent of killing the live-stock industry of the country.  Why should there be a grudge against the cattle business?  The more cattle we have the more feeding will be required and the more employment will be given. A tillage policy is one that is suited for the spring and the harvest, but we want to be able to provide work for our men all the year round.  For that reason we are in favour of a system of mixed farming, because we are convinced it is the system that is best suited to the country and is the only system that will bring prosperity to our farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am venturing into this debate in what I hope will be a brief way.  I am embarrassed at the start by feeling that it is going to be a very timid way.  It has been a gloomy business all through.  There will be general agreement, I think, on that.  I confess that I can see no way of injecting any gaiety into the proceedings on this particular subject. We have had lamentations from every side of the House touching the position of the farmer-producer in the country at the moment.  We have had a rather belated but very welcome lamentation from the Labour Benches on the condition to which they have reduced people who look to them for aid when they speak on behalf of agricultural labourers.  I view the situation as one of many in this country who is forced, somewhat unwillingly, to subscribe to the subsidisation of agriculture, but more particularly as a person who is fined, and fined heavily, every time he buys <Col N="830" /> at this moment any of the products of this, apparently decaying business. Although, as Deputy Burke said, and said correctly, the whole matter is dismal and the depths to which one has to get in this are somewhat approaching the abysmal, still they can be plumbed and plumbed if we take as our standards one or two simple items.</P>
      <P>Suppose we get clean away from all the mixed matters that are coming home to the hearts and bosoms of the various farmer-Deputies and suppose we speak only of three or four simple matters&mdash;wheat and beet and, say, milk and butter.  I have the feeling that if the debates in this House for the past couple of weeks had been broadcast, same as the speech of President de Valera, a certain churchman, with the enchantment that only distance lends when he views this country, would not find it possible to be even so optimistic as was Deputy MacDermot, who is also somewhat removed from this country and is often much detached in regard to discussions on agriculture.</P>
      <P>Let me start off by reminding the Minister and those who support him of what they promised.  I have often used the Fianna Fáil Plan, and I suppose people think that it is time it should be given up.  To some extent, I agree with them but it has hardly ever been used in regard to agriculture and just what the old Plan was should be announced here to-night.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Here is what a Fianna Fáil Government will do for you in regard to tillage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister, as the coming expert in agricultural matters, had his hand in this advertisement.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When we grow our own requirements of wheat, oats, barley, peas and beans, we will have 1,410,000 acres of additional tillage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is all very well as an advertisement in the columns of a newspaper, but somebody thought that out and honestly believed it could be brought about.  Somebody put that forward as a plank in the Party programme and they got elected on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Agriculture <Col N="831" /> has calculated the wages payable on the growing of an acre of wheat at £2 6s. 6d. and on an acre of oats or barely at £2 2s. 0d.  On the Department's figures, then, this additional tillage will increase the earnings of agricultural workers and small farmers by £3,130,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the promise.  &ldquo;Here is what the Fianna Fáil Government will do for you&rdquo;&mdash;we are to grow our own requirements of wheat, oats, barley, peas and beans&mdash;they left out beet&mdash; and that will mean 1,410,000 acres of additional tillage and £3,130,000 per annum to agricultural workers and small farmers.  We have not got our requirements in wheat but we have got a big acreage under beet.  Suppose we concentrate on beet and wheat and leave out of consideration all offsets by way of substituted tillage, by way of people dropping out of other crops to get into the subsidised crops.</P>
    <P>The increase on wheat and beet between 1931 and this year is represented by about 190,000 acres.  That makes a poor comparison with the 1,410,000 acres that were promised.  How was that increase achieved?  I do not know if the Minister has a figure in mind which he would state and rely upon as the amount paid by way of subsidy per acre for beet and per acre for wheat.  I understand, however, that the subsidisation of the beet produced at the moment amounts to about £1? million and that the subsidisation of wheat amounts to something short of £500,000.  In any event, between the two crops, the amount is about £2,000,000.  We pay £2,000,000 per annum to get 190,000 acres extra under wheat and beet.</P>
    <P>How does that come home to the labourer?  Permanent employment in agriculture has gone down by 600 persons. Temporary employment is up by about 2,400.  Supposing the temporary people work a quarter of the year&mdash;I understand that that is an exaggerated estimate, but let us work on it&mdash;you equate those 2,400 temporary workers to 600 full-timers.  As we have lost 600 full-timers, we have no gain so far as paid agricultural labour is concerned. We have a gain in respect of those who <Col N="832" /> are members of farmers' families and who have registered as being in occupation on the land.  They are up by 9,000.  Why?  Because there is an inducement, not to go on the land but to register as being on it, inasmuch as the agricultural grant is distributed according to returns made as to the members of farmers' families occupied on the land.  With a State subsidy of over £2,000,000, we get 190,000 acres under cultivation, leaving aside the offsets and those who have dropped out of other types of cultivation.  That is not the end of the story.  Wages are down, according to the official statistics, by 3/- a week.  If you relate that to the number of agriculturally employed, you find&mdash;again assuming that temporary people are employed three months in the year&mdash;that the wages of permanent labourers are down by nearly £750,000 and that the wages of those who are temporarily employed on the land are down by £128,000. There is a drop in the purchasing power scattered through the country, through the medium of agricultural work, of £820,000.  I do not want to go into a series of detailed calculations to show on what these figures are based. If these figures are accurate, or if they approach accuracy, that is the situation. Perhaps I may sum it up again &mdash;in three years we have increased the acreage under beet and wheat by £190,000; we have not got any increase in the number of those who get paid for working on the land but we have increased the number of members of farmers' families who work on the land &mdash;for what, we do not know&mdash;by about 9,000.  It is costing the taxpayer, in some shape or other, £2,000,000 per annum to do that.  The purchasing power scattered through the community through the medium of agriculture is down by £820,000.  If a director of a company went before his board and made that announcement, as the result of three years' working, we know the vote that would be passed. He would be told that he was heading for bankruptcy, to cut the losses and try to reconstruct the business or get into some other line of activity.  These are the two main, subsidised crops, one of which, added to barley, peas and beans, was to give us 1,500,000 extra <Col N="833" /> acres and bring an extra payment of £3,130,000 to workers and small farmers. The advertisement continues&mdash; it is almost blasphemous to read this part:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wheat would give us a large surplus of offals to feed extra pigs for human consumption and small wheat to produce extra eggs for the home market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say what anybody has got to do with extra eggs at the moment except to use them for obvious purposes if Deputy Donnelly or the Minister for Agriculture go out to address a public meeting?  That was not the climax of all this.  The increased production was, according to the advertisement, to add no less than £11,000,000 to our agricultural output, equivalent to £16 per year for every adult male or female person engaged on the land, whether farmer or labourer.  Alberta has nothing on that. These are two subsidised crops.  It is by getting one or two things under the microscope and reducing them to their essentials that one gets an idea of the Government's policy.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with that later.  The man who made this mistake most glaringly is not here, but the Deputy may pass on the education to him second-hand.  Milk and butter have been the subject of great acclamation on the part of back benchers.  Deputy Corry, I think, in the debate on this matter ventured again into the calculation that the producer of milk was, through Government activity, getting 2d. a gallon extra.  I cannot reconcile that figure with the Minister's own figures.  According to what the Minister told us, he claimed that as far as milk, or butter through milk, was concerned, it would work out at about ¾d. a gallon.  Will the Minister tell me if I am correct in saying that his figures would represent about ¾d. a gallon?  Let us assume at any rate that there is ¾d. a gallon extra being paid to producers of milk on what they produce, how is it being paid for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> This is where it hits me, as a consumer, among others.  There used to be a calculation that there was about 700,000 cwts. of creamery butter produced in this country, and that half of it was exported and half of it consumed at home.  I do not know if the amount consumed at home has gone down.  If it has gone down, will the Minister tell us that that was simply due to a distaste for butter or was it due to a decrease in the general standard of living owing to the fact that the people cannot afford to buy butter? However, let us assume that it has not gone down, and that it has kept constant and that there is being consumed 350,000 cwts., and we are paying on that.  I make the calculation&mdash; and I will guarantee the accuracy of the figures&mdash;that 350,000 cwts. is about 40,000,000 pounds in weight of butter. What are we, as consumers, paying extra per pound of butter that we eat in this country?  Certainly, it is not less than 5d., and I think that over the last year it has been at least 6d. What is 6d. per pound on 40,000,000 pounds of butter?  Let us work that out.  It represents £1,000,000 in money.  We are paying £1,000,000 in money to enable the farmer&mdash;the milk manufacturer&mdash;to get ¾d. a gallon. Is that good economics?</P>
    <P>At any rate, there are the two big items.  Fianna Fáil policy was to put this country on its feet.  The farmers were down and out, and this was to rectify the whole thing.  The big items were the aid to the dairying industry, <i>via</i> milk and butter on the one hand, and the subsidised crops&mdash;in the main, wheat and beet&mdash;on the other hand, and we find that, as far as one of these is concerned, the purchasing power of the community is down by £800,000, and that, as far as the other is concerned, the consumer is mulcted in £1,000,000 per annum to enable the producer to get ¾d a gallon for his milk.  Of course, that is offset by any number of other things that have happened to the farmer, but has any calculation been made as to what subsidy or extra payment on milk would be taken to offset the damage that has been done by the slaughter of calves? However, I shall leave these things <Col N="835" /> simply to be looked at in the light of the situation in regard to the increased productivity in agriculture and how it has been brought about and what it is costing.  That does not end it, and I do not intend to speak here of the number of other things that I, as a consumer, help to bear the brunt of&mdash; things that I would take some pride in bearing the brunt of, if agriculture was succeeding; but we know that it is not succeeding, and that it cannot succeed until the policy has been reversed. Indeed, the only hope we have is that lately there have been signs of a reversal of the policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, still hugs certain things to himself occasionally. Some time last week he talked&mdash;unfortunately behind closed doors&mdash;about self-sufficiency.  He is still thinking in terms of self-sufficiency.  Deputy MacDermot has spoken here of experiments, and I should like to comment on that later, but at any rate if we are experimenting with the lives and fortunes of people, the disadvantages and dangers of experiment ought to be lessened, and can be lessened if people have only the intelligence to look at the examples that are near to them, and to study what has been set down in black and white as a result of similar experiments carried out in other conditions. I cannot understand how, at this hour of the day, there is a man to be found anywhere in a deliberative assembly in this country to say that self-sufficiency, as a policy, is a good thing.  All over the world it has been abandoned, and the only regret that the nations of the world have is that they cannot abandon it more rapidly. The Baltic nations started it.  They say that they were driven to it because their position in regard to each other meant that they must interlap and must have some sort of free trade amongst themselves.  The Danube peoples took it up next, and, after some arrangements were come to, Mussolini dragged six of them along and they formed a series of criss-cross pacts, each two together, and the key-note of the pacts is that they must loosen up and get some better approach to each other so as to bridge the trade frontiers.  The person who was recently Prime Minister <Col N="836" /> of France where, undoubtedly this self-sufficiency business started, announced boldly in his Parliamentary Assembly that national self-sufficiency had nowhere been a success, and he challenged anybody to give him an example where it had been a success, and there was nobody to dare to put forward a concrete example of one country in which this economic nationalism had been favourable to the people.  At Geneva, last autumn, what might be called the second mover originally towards economic nationalism, the American representative, moved a resolution that a trade committee or an economic committee should institute a study with regard to this whole business of self-sufficiency and economic nationalism, because, he declared roundly, it was devastating in its effects.  At the last meeting of the International Labour Office the representative of the same area, America, proposed an inquiry, and the terms of the inquiry were to consider whether or not tariff walls caused employment. He said that, as far as his country was concerned, it was a proven fact that the closing of frontiers and the raising of tariff walls did not provide more employment for workers, but rather the other way about&mdash;and the representatives of the other nations there agreed with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if we are going to go on that line, we might as well say that because we used to weave mats by hand, we should still be doing it.  I admit that there has been a bit of an uplift in the world in the last few years.  There has been an upward trend in the graph, and it is a peculiar thing that that upward trend corresponds almost exactly with another graph, which shows an increase in the world in free trade.  We do not need to go very far abroad to get a more concrete example.  There has been a slight betterment in this country in the last year.  Why?  It is because we are selling more cattle to England and because we are having freer trade with England&mdash;not as free as we should like, and unfortunately we have aroused <Col N="837" /> England's attention to the fact that while we were tariffing her goods she was not doing anything against us. Now, unfortunately, owing to that piece of Fianna Fáil economy, Britain is putting a tariff upon certain things coming into this country, and we have seen in the recent agreement where steel and iron can be subject to tariffs. If England imposed fiscal conditions on this country it was because the Fianna Fáil Government made it practical for them to do so.  There is not the slightest doubt, to anyone who opens his mind and who looks abroad at world conditions, but that self-sufficiency as a doctrine is dead and damned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Until there is freedom of trade&mdash;I do not say free trade &mdash;there is not going to be any increase in the prosperity of the workers of the world.  There is undoubtedly going to be a little bit of increase in prosperity, here and there, for manufacturers who will take advantage of the particular tariff system, and who will reap and make profits while the going is good. Again, may I appeal to well-known facts?  How is it that except in few countries, and I think this country will no longer be an exception, there could not be found a Labour Party in favour of the imposition of tariffs?  Somebody may say Australia is an exception. It is; but it is the exception that proves the rule.  There is one set of circumstances in which a Labour Party will find itself able to support a tariff policy and that is, when they have a wages board, manned by labour people who can ensure that any increase in the cost of living can be at once, and immediately, met by an increase in wages.  And naturally in these circumstances the Labour Party in Australia endeavoured to do that. But only in Australia and in this country has any Labour Party adopted tariffs as a policy.  They know too well that tariffs will mean profits for manufacturers and that these profits will not be passed on to the employees; but that the profits of the manufacturers will be paid out of the pockets of the consuming public.  Labour should be <Col N="838" /> lifted off their shoulders and the community should not have to pay an enhanced price to manufacturing firms. Yet, despite all these things, patent to everybody who looks around the world, the Minister for Agriculture last week still prated about self-sufficiency.</P>
      <P>I said there was a light in the clouds here, but only because of the coal-cattle pact.  Bad as it was, still so far as it helped trade between this country and England, so far as it contains that element it was good. Deputy MacDermot says this Party should have accepted this agreement. Deputy MacDermot has not been renowned while in this House for any great industry.  I do not think he has been the author of more than one or two amendments, each year, to any measure introduced into this House and I do not think other people can rely for their political views on people who flash open their minds occasionally to get a kind of photographic picture of the country.  You have to study the facts and you have to apply world conditions to the particular conditions that are operating here, in order to get some proper understanding of things and work them up and compare them with the conditions of things in this country.  Deputy MacDermot says that we should have accepted the coal-cattle pact.  Did we not?  As I understand it, the objection was that there were so many details and that that was bad; and that having been delayed so long, and taken in two steps and not one, instead of that helping things this country was found to be losing while the British were open to a bargain.  And as a result the British, for the first time since 1931, in operating this pact found a way of restricting our complete fiscal system in this country.  I think we did approve the coal-cattle pact in principle.</P>

The coal-cattle pact was good; it was only bad in so far as it did not go far enough.  Supposing it did go far enough.  Deputy Davin is concerned now about negotiations.  He would not like the setting up of a tribunal but while negotiations were on he would give a token payment of anything from £1 to £4,999,000.

You need not call them land annuity payments; you could call them by any other name. After all, a little matter of nomenclature will not worry people who were able to discover an empty formula. Call the annuities cattle payments, not land annuities at all.  Pay them quarterly instead of paying them on each beast which goes out of the country. Let us have trade.  We might then get back to the conditions we had long ago in which we were quite free to operate tariffs against Britain, and at the same time to get free entry into the British market and to get preferential rates.  In the early part of 1931 the position of this country was that we were getting a preferential footing for our produce in the English market.</P>

      <P>I cannot give them at the moment.  I may have antedated his foolish statement but I am giving the sense of it.  Let us get away from the idea of a tribunal. No one is very fond of a tribunal in this House.  The President, when he would not have a tribunal selected from the Commonwealth, said that, even if he got an international tribunal, he would have to have the full accord of this House before he could consent. Recently on the coal-cattle pact he announced that he had some fears about an international tribunal because there were many powerful nations courting Great Britain and that influence which they wanted to have with Great Britain could be felt at the international court.  Remember, behind it all the Minister for Finance, on June 10th at Mitchelstown, told us that if an international court gave the annuities against us we could still say the land annuities were neither morally nor legally due; that we could turn round and say the annuities were the price of the land war, and the people were as much entitled to have them cancelled as Great Britain was to seek the cancellation of her debt to the United States.  If we even thought of an international tribunal it was well hedged around.  It was to be one of our choosing and, even with our choosing, the terms of reference <Col N="841" /> and the proposals had to be approved by the House.  If that tribunal was established and gave the annuities against us, remember, we could turn around, as the phrase has been, and say we would not pay them because they were not morally due. Deputy Donnelly thinks it is a shame, as this is a national question, that we cannot all be together on it.</P>

      <P>Would he ever give in to taking sides in a particular matter and joining up on the side he conscientiously believed was going to end in ruin?  Conscientiously, that is what we believe here.  Apart from that, this matter of the land annuities, coal-cattle pacts, and the new economic policy cannot be segregated from everything else.  I think the Minister for Agriculture also remarked down the country recently that there was no other country in which a Government leaving office could not continue, at any rate, to see eye to eye with its successors on matters of foreign policy.  What is the foreign policy of this country?  Am I wrong in saying that, in the main, it is based on the allegation that the last Government was treacherous, that it sold the country, and that it can only excuse itself from deliberate treachery by pleading stupidity?  Does anybody expect this Party to side with a Government whose foreign policy is based on that?  Will Deputy Donnelly think of that the next time he pleads for unanimity, even if the facts were with him on such a matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the last mandate given was on the basis of the Government's pledge that if returned to power they would settle the economic war.  That was the position. Finally, I want to say that Deputy MacDermot talked in this House of Fine Gael accepting the Fianna Fáil policy.  A little more industry and appreciation of the facts would make Deputy MacDermot realise that the only change in policy there has been in the last year has not been on the side of Fine Gael, but on the side of Fianna Fáil.  The more they go into coal-cattle pacts, the more of these they bring into this House, the more definitely are they turning their back on their own absurd tillage nonsense and going back to dairy farming.  That is our policy&mdash;it always was.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks we are adopting the Fianna Fáil policy because we say we will give a run to wheat, we do that for two reasons.  One is that it is not good for any country to have a new economic revolution every time a Government is changed; and the other is that wheat should be given its run on a level with dairy farming.  It is only when the two are given a chance together that we can learn by experience which of them the farming community will adopt.  Even if it costs an amount of money wastefully spent, it would be a good thing to give the wheat policy a chance of running side by side with the other, and let us see which will win in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot said that this country was in a mood for experimentation in 1931.  I object to that phrase. I do not mind experiments being conducted at other people's expense.  I think that is Deputy MacDermot's point of view.  If I were the sort of person who was not allied to this country by any tie, if when things went badly I could step on the mail boat and quit it for good and all, I could easily stand up and beg the Minister for Agriculture to continue experimentation. It is the fact that whatever mess this country is in I have to live through it that gives me responsibility. It is the absence of that which makes Deputy MacDermot so irresponsible as to make a statement like that about experimenting in this country.  The <Col N="843" /> country is sick of experimenting.  It has had enough of it.  The few salient facts that I gave to-night ought to teach any man that the experiments have been a failure so far and that there is no hope of conducting them up to any point of success.</P>

      <P>We have had three fairly long days of talk on this Estimate and I think that we can hardly describe what might pass as debating on this Estimate as anything better than talk.  I have listened to eight speeches from the Front Bench opposite and I do not think that any two of the Deputies made a single point that was not made over and over again in the last few years: &ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo; What was said by any speaker on the Front Bench opposite could have been said in a few minutes.  I often wonder if the economic war was settled what would happen?</P>

      <P>Would it happen that when I brought in an Estimate there would not be a word from the other side, because they cannot talk about anything except, &ldquo;Give us back our markets&rdquo;?  I advised Deputy Cosgrave some time ago to instruct his Party to try to exercise their minds a little bit and just imagine that the economic war cannot be settled and see if they could make a suggestion. But evidently they have not the brains to think.  You do not want much brains to be able to say, &ldquo;Give us back our markets; settle the economic war&rdquo;. None of the Deputies opposite, with the exception of Deputy Brodrick and Deputy MacEoin, who made a passing reference to sub-head H, made any suggestion with regard to the Estimates. Deputy Dillon made a speech lasting two hours and Deputy Belton one lasting for three hours, but in these and other long speeches the Estimates were never referred to.  It was all this talk about the economic war that we have heard over and over again.  It is the easiest thing in the world to make a speech like that, as you have not to think, and Deputies cannot think.</P>

      <P>I have appealed to Deputies on many occasions to leave the honest, hard-working farmer alone and to let him pay his way.  He wants to pay his way and not to have to listen to all this political talk at all. <Col N="845" /> He wants to sow his crop, to market his crop, to pay his way and give up all this talk about politics and trying to make political capital out of the situation.  Deputies opposite may think otherwise, but I think this kind of thing is hardly fair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan says I am constantly accusing Opposition Deputies of making political speeches. My goodness, how could I do otherwise? I have sat here for three days.  Deputy Dillon covered 30 columns of the Official Report, and was there a single thing in his speech that would not be in a speech a man would make at a cross-roads?  For instance, did he say anything about the breeding of cattle or about whether we could get a better breed or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Go on with the interruptions. Did he say anything about the caring of cattle or whether we could care them better or grade them better for the market?  No&mdash;&ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo; That is all he wants to say about cattle.  He makes no suggestion about the improvement of cattle, which is really what the Department is concerned with.  Did he make any suggestion about the improvement of our seeds&mdash;how they could be better cared or sown, and how we could get more healthy varieties and better yielding varieties, the things the Department is dealing with?  Not at all. &ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo;  It would be too much trouble to talk about a thing like that because that is what the Department is concerned with.  Then Deputy O'Sullivan says that I accused them of making political speeches because they make speeches about matters that should properly be directed to the Executive Council, although I have no objection to having them brought up here.  I do object, however, to the whole debate being conducted on that one subject and not a single remark made by any Deputy opposite as to the Department's activities.  That is perhaps too sweeping because there are a few small items I can deal with, but if Deputies <Col N="846" /> had confined their remarks to the Department of Agriculture, this debate would have been over in two hours.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Donnelly has rightly said, if our policy in regard to wheat growing is so very wrong as Deputy McGilligan suggests, and if our policy in regard to sugar beet or any of these things is so very wrong, why does Fine Gael adopt the whole thing?  Why do they not have the courage to go before the country and say that it is wrong and that they will not adopt it, as Deputy Dillon has done on a few occasions?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, has not the courage to say that he will not adopt it.  He does not go the whole way.  Some Deputy said&mdash;and it is typical of the remarks passed during the debate&mdash;that farmers could not pay decent wages and grow beet at 37/6 a ton.  The same Deputies are impressing on us in their speeches that the English farmers can pay a better wage.  Deputy Holohan, perhaps, did not say that, but several Deputies on the opposite side have said that the English farmer can afford to pay a much bigger wage than the Irish farmer.  The English farmer is getting the same price for his beet.  He is getting 37/6 for 15½ per cent, and, if you take an average of 17½ per cent., he gets 5/- more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to those in a minute.  He pays more than that extra 5/- for the offals, which our farmers get free, so that the English farmer is in a worse position with regard to beet than the Irish farmer. Still we have this talk about the Irish farmer not being able to pay a living wage to his agricultural labourers. Deputy Dillon condemns flatly all this arrangement of subsidies.  He has again and again said that farming cannot be made to run on subsidies, but Deputy Dillon made an appeal to me during his speech.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I suggest that the Minister should set on foot some scheme for <Col N="847" /> subsidising the production of cheeses of that character.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That referred to farmers' cheese.  He wanted me to encourage the production of farmers' cheese by subsidising it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It would not be at all expensive, because once the thing got under way it would cease to require a subsidy, and would be able to stand on its own feet.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is why I wanted the subsidy.  Why did the Minister not read on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never before heard the Deputy say that he was not against them in principle.  If he advocated them, they were all right, but, coming from this side, they were wrong.  There is another very interesting statement from the Deputy here.  He talks about the mistakes made by the Pigs Marketing Board and in the middle of column 442 there is this sentence:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think there is any use dragging up the absurd mistakes into which they fell, dragging out the purchase of pork that was hawked round the country, put into cold store as pork, sold at one-quarter of its value to the curers, and then thrown out as unfit for conversion into bacon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five errors, absolute untruths, in that statement, and, mind you, five errors in five lines is a bit of a record.  It is a record even for Deputy Dillon to make five errors in five lines.  First, the board did not drag out the purchase of pork.  The board went to the fairs and markets <Col N="848" /> and bought the pork as they got it. How that could be called dragging out the purchase of pork I do not know. It is the same as accusing the bacon factories of dragging out the purchase of pigs because they buy the whole year round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Dragging up&rdquo; it obviously should read from the context.  I referred in the previous sentence to &ldquo;dragging up the absurd mistakes into which they fell.&rdquo;  Then I referred to dragging up the other mistakes I cited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so.  The board had arranged, before they bought pork at any market, what factory it was to go to on every occasion.  There was no such thing as their going around with a lorry to a factory, the factory saying &ldquo;We will not take it,&rdquo; and then the lorry going on to another factory. That never occurred.  It was never hawked round the country.  &ldquo;Put into cold store as pork&rdquo;&mdash;that was right to a certain extent.  &ldquo;Sold at one-quarter of its value to the curers.&rdquo;  There are two absolute misstatements in that sentence.  It was not sold to the curers and, therefore, of course, was not sold at one-quarter of its value, and has not been sold since.  It was never sold to the curers; it was given to the curers to cure on commission; and since has been marketed, not at one-quarter of its value, but at a small loss to which I will refer in a minute when I deal with the other misstatements. &ldquo;And it is thrown out as unfit for human consumption.&rdquo; Here is a Dillonesque exaggeration.  The total would cost £50,000.  The amount thrown out was £60.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

If the Deputy is pinning his faith on <Col N="849" /> that, the House can see to what depths he is sinking.  I admit that there is a loss of £60 on £50,000 worth.</P>

Two years ago, the last time the bacon curers were asked to cold store bacon on their own account, they said there might be a loss on it, and they were guaranteed against that loss.  The Pigs Marketing Board had not the loss that the bacon curers had.  But these factories have all along been held up to us as models of the best business methods.  Well, is it not clear that when the Pigs Marketing Board have not made as much of a loss, that they are a success?  So far I have dealt with five lines out of Deputy Dillon's speech into which he has crammed all these misstatements of facts.  Whether the Deputy is trying to mislead this House about the whole situation or not, I do not know, but he took 30 columns in which to say all that.

That would cost £3,000,000 a year.  I am not now referring to any tariffs by Great Britain.  Even if that whole thing were fixed up it would cost this country £3,000,000 a year.  I do not know where Cumann na nGaedheal would get that £3,000,000 because they have objected over and over again to the tax on tea and sugar and other taxes, and Deputy Bennett objected last year to the tax on footballs. Where are they going to get the £3,000,000 to give 5d. a gallon to the dairy farmers in Limerick and at the same time to sell butter here at 1/- a lb.?

      <P>I know if I suggest another £500,000 it must be raised some way.  Deputy Dillon blames the economic war for the fall in egg prices. That is just ridiculous, because, if the Deputy looks at the subsidy we are paying at the present time on eggs, he will find that it equates with the tariff put on by Great Britain.  The fact is that he cannot blame the economic war for the fall in price, for that is not the case.  We have actually improved the price of eggs to the producer as a result of the economic war. Deputy Corry made a few suggestions a little bit more sensible than what we heard from Deputy Dillon.  He says the Livestock Breeding Act should be abolished.  His principal objection seems to be that members of the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association are selected as inspectors.  It is not true to say that the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association are selected as inspectors, but they should not be disqualified for that reason.  I do not think I need deal any further with that objection.  Deputy Bennett talked about the price of milk.  He says that we held if there was no Government help or no economic war that milk would be 2d. a gallon.  This statement was made, it is true, but it was made at a time when butter in the British market was running from 66/- to 70/- a cwt., so that at the time the statement was made it was true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be getting £3 for them in a creamery district, but I will come to that in a moment.  Now I have to deal with the question of agricultural wages.  Last October there was a question asked about agricultural wages.  Deputy Norton quoted that question and my answer in the course of this debate.  I asked him to quote the supplementary which had been put to that question and my answer to the supplementary.  That answer to the Supplementary Question did not altogether convey what the Deputy conveyed to this House, or convey my attitude to the question. I know the Deputy had only a typed copy of the question and answer and that he had not the answer to the Supplementary Question.  I think the word used in the Supplementary Question was &ldquo;contemplated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton quoted English wages and Irish wages.  He might have made a good case if he stuck to the official figures, but he did not stick to them. He quoted figures that were not the official figures; he quoted figures that were higher and he rejected the official figures here and made a sort of census of his own.  He made out the wages here to be much lower than the official figures indicate.  Whatever the <Col N="853" /> wages may be in Great Britain, there was exactly the same fall there from 1931 up to last year as there was in the Free State.  The point is made by the Opposition that the labourer here has not the same value from the £ because the cost of living is higher.  Let me say that the difference in the cost of living has remained constant; there is the very same gap between the cost of living here and the cost of living in England since 1931.  I do not want to defend the wages here at all, but I will say that the comparison that has been made does not hold water.  There is no economic war, I believe, in England; the farmers there have nothing like that to contend with.  For the four years 1931 to 1935 the wages there have gone down the same as here and the difference in the cost of living in Ireland and in England has remained constant from 1931 to 1935.</P>

      <P>I do not want to wrong Deputy Belton in any way, but Deputy Belton was in the habit of making speeches in this House which were encouraging to me in advocating the growing of wheat, the growing of vegetables, and all those other things. Deputy Belton made a speech which was computed by one Deputy as occupying three hours&mdash;I think that was an exaggeration; it took something over two hours&mdash;and his whole speech was a cattle speech.  He talked about cattle from beginning to end. You could not have beet unless you had cattle; you could not have wheat unless you had cattle; nothing could be done unless you had cattle.</P>

      <P>We have had their programme already.  Deputy O'Sullivan made a very vigorous speech.  In fact one would imagine from listening to him that he was putting his whole heart into his subject.  He almost shed tears over the people of Kerry in their sufferings.  He asked me a question over and over again; he said: &ldquo;Does more tillage mean more live stock?&rdquo; He wanted to know what was the policy that we were adopting on this side with regard to live stock, and with regard to the development of tillage. He said that I enunciated both policies; in other words, that on one occasion I said &ldquo;more cattle&rdquo; and that on another occasion I said &ldquo;less cattle and more tillage.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On a point of order I wish to direct your attention, Sir, to the fact that we on this side of the House listened for three-quarters of an hour without a single interruption to a speech delivered from that side to-night.  You all have to admit that.  Why can they not concede, at least to the Minister, the courtesy of a hearing?  He has a difficult job. You all assembled here to listen to your big man, Deputy McGilligan, and was there a word from this side of the House although he possibly made the best speech that could be made against the Estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big number of matters which I want to deal with, but I am afraid we will not get finished to-night unless we get through them very quickly.  I think, even if we had to go on until to-morrow, it is important to make this clear.  I do not care how often I am quoted on this if I am quoted correctly, but I want to be quoted correctly.  I can prove that we have always done our best to get the biggest possible market for all agricultural produce.  We have been sneered at for going on the Continent to try to sell cattle.  We get the biggest possible quota in Great <Col N="861" /> Britain.  We tried to get the people here to eat more beef.  We have done everything possible to use all the cattle in the country, and to have more cattle if possible.  The same applies to bacon, sheep, and every line of agricultural produce.  We have done our best to extend the market, both at home and abroad.  What is the use of Deputies on the other side first of all postulating that we are trying to cut down cattle, and then building an argument on top of that? The argument topples down because there is no foundation for it.  Have we not got more cows than we ever had in this country before?  We disposed of more cattle in 1935&mdash;let any Deputy look it up&mdash;than were ever disposed of in any one year by Cumann na nGaedheal.  Then they talk about our trying to kill the cattle trade.  We used at home more cattle than usual; we exported more, even to Great Britain, than Cumann na nGaedheal did in any one year when they were in office.  That ought to be sufficient, without going on with this argument that we are trying to kill the cattle trade.  Of course, if they admitted that we are exporting more cattle now than they did, and using more cattle at home, they would have no argument to go on with.  This year the quotas that we have for cattle, both to the Continent and Great Britain, and the amount that we are likely to consume at home, will be even still bigger than last year.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, in answering an interruption by Deputy Donnelly, said that we had lost our market.  He said, I think, that we had lost our entrance fee of £5,000,000, and so on. He gave us to understand that we had lost even the number of cattle that were allowed into Great Britain. We have not.  We can get more cattle into Great Britain under our present quotas than Cumann na nGaedheal had cattle to send.</P>

But I want to make this clear, and let us have no argument about it, that we are endeavouring by every means in our power to get a bigger market at home and abroad for cattle, sheep, pigs, and everything else in the agricultural line. That has been our policy from the very beginning.  There is no necessity for any more argument about it.</P>

      <P>All I should like to say about that is that it was agreed that some speakers would curtail their speeches to-night in order to allow the Minister to take the division to-night.
