      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been called to statements made at a recent meeting of the Waterford Borough Council concerning his refusal to sanction the acceptance of a tender for 70 houses with external walls of brick and roofs of Irish slates; whether he will state (a) if in fact he refused sanction to the acceptance of the tender in question, (b) the reasons for his decision in the matter, (c) the respective building cost per house at the lowest tenders for (1) external walls of brick and Irish slates for roofs, (2) external walls of brick and concrete tiles for roofs, (3) all walls of concrete blocks and concrete tiles for roofs, and (d) if he took into account the loss of employment in the use of concrete blocks as compared with locally made bricks in reaching a decision in reference to the tenders in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the statements referred to in the question. (a) I have refused sanction to the tender proposed to be accepted by the Corporation.  (b) The Council decided, subject to my sanction, to accept a tender for 70 houses with external walls of brick coated with plaster, and roofs of Irish slate, rendered on the under side, at a cost of £22,066, in preference to a tender by the same contractor of £20,079 for walls of concrete blocks (similarly coated with plaster) and roofs of concrete tiles. The difference in cost, £1,987, over the whole scheme is equal to an average of <Col N="1056" /> approximately £28 per house, and would provide for six additional four-roomed houses.  If the roofs were to be of concrete tiles in both tenders the difference would be £1,040, or, say, £15 per house.  In either case the specification provided that the walls were to be plastered outside as well as inside.  (c) The building cost per house at the lowest tenders for (1) external walls of brick and Irish slates for roofs was £315; (2) external walls of brick and concrete tiles for roofs was £302; (3) all walls of concrete blocks and concrete tiles for roofs was £287.  I am satisfied that employment will not be lessened by the use of concrete blocks in the building of the houses.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been directed to the statement of the Mayor of Waterford made at a recent meeting of the Borough Council to the effect that if the Corporation were to continue building houses of an inferior type such as his Department insisted that they should build, they would find themselves in a precarious position endeavouring to maintain them; whether he can state if the cost of maintaining Waterford Corporation's concrete houses is excessive; and, if so, whether he proposes to consult with the Waterford Corporation in regard to future schemes so as to secure a type of house that can be maintained at less expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the statement of the Mayor of Waterford.  I cannot accept the implication in the question that houses of an inferior type are being constructed in Waterford and that there will be an undue cost cast upon the Corporation in maintaining them. I am not aware that the cost of maintaining houses erected by the Waterford Corporation is excessive.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the widespread desire of Irish exiles, particularly those resident in the United States of America, to listen-in to the Dublin-Athlone broadcasting programmes; and, if so, if with a view to making such reception possible he intends to take the necessary steps for the erection of a short wave broadcasting station in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any widespread demand for a short wave broadcasting station for reception of programmes overseas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned consideration of this Bill last week it was put to the Minister that a difficulty had arisen, in the event of a person ordering more than 2 cwts. of coal buying supplies in individual cwts., and the Minister said he would consider the matter, and let us know how he proposed to deal with that possibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed that if people who wanted to buy 5 cwts. of coal went to a coal vendor and bought 5 cwts. in separate transactions no statutory obligation would devolve upon those people to take any turf. The Minister indicated that it was his intention to apply this Bill primarily to rural areas.  If persons whom this Bill is designed to coerce into taking turf do not want to do so, by resorting to the methods I have outlined, it appears that the whole Bill will become inoperative in these areas.  There is no insurmountable difficulty to any person who wants to buy coal in separate cwts. or in 2-cwt. lots doing so.  I think it devolves upon the Minister to tell us how he proposes to deal with that situation, if it arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise that the practical difficulty will be in the case of a person who ordered a ton or half a ton of coal, ordering two cwts. in the morning, two cwts. at lunch time, and two cwts. in the afternoon, making three separate orders?  Would that be an <Col N="1059" /> infringement of the Bill?  Would the coal merchant be compelled to insist on the purchaser taking whatever amount of turf is mentioned if it is in the specified area, or would he be justified on looking upon them as separate orders or as one order?  The Minister knows that that is the difficulty he will be up against in the operation of this Bill.  He either does not realise what is going to happen or he does not want to face up to the difficulty.  It seems to me that he realises the difficulty but he is not taking any steps to deal with it.  This provision is going to make it difficult for everyone concerned, if there is no indication what steps are to be taken. I think the Minister ought to tell the House how this is going to be dealt with, because difficulty is almost bound to arise in every specified area.</P>

      <P>If a person who previously bought ten cwts. of coal to be delivered to his house in one lot, now orders five cwts. and, instead of having it delivered in one lot, has it delivered in one or two days, in small lots at a time, that person can evade the whole purpose of the Bill. Does the Minister not consider that a practical difficulty?  It is hard to believe that he is serious about this measure.  His attitude regarding the arguments put forward on this section seem to prove that he is not serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time for the Minister to remember that he is a <Col N="1060" /> member of the Government.  Deputies on this side are not members of the Government, and when there is a Bill before the House it is the duty of the Government to explain it.  The Minister and his colleagues in the last couple of weeks have fallen into the habit of thinking that it is not their business to justify policy put before the House.  It is not the business of the Opposition to explain how the Government is to work Bills.  The Minister has done this again and again within the last couple of weeks.  Why that has been so in the last couple of weeks I do not know.  Certain difficulties have to be faced so far as this Bill is concerned, and the Opposition and the House is entitled to get information.  We have dealt with several sections but the most important ones are Sections 2, 4 and 13.  I doubt if the House knows the purpose of the Minister regarding the Bill. His performance to-day does not give us any further information, even to clear up one point, whether it is a serious Bill or not.  We have had again and again statements from the Minister that there is no seriousness at the back of this Bill; that it is purely advertising and window-dressing. For instance, could passages in the Minister's speeches be quoted to show that it is the intention to use the compulsory powers ruthlessly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I do not know what the mind of the Minister is.  Certainly I do not think anyone would suggest that it is the business of the Opposition to meet the Minister's difficulties. That is the Minister's business. Whether it is the coming disappearance of the Second Chamber or not, Ministers are treating this House, even before the disappearance of that Chamber, with contempt.  Anyone contrasting this with anything the Minister has insisted upon in connection with his tariffs within certain limits within the last couple of days can see how vague was the information he gave as to what his intentions were.  Here every appeal for information as to the working of the Bill has been met&mdash;hardly with refusal&mdash;with complete failure by the Minister to make a beginning in giving information to this side.  A practical difficulty <Col N="1061" /> has been mentioned, and the Minister simply says: &ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo; He does not say why it is not a practical difficulty.  Obviously the provisions of the Bill can be evaded. This is legislation, and it is the business of the Minister to meet objections that are raised.  The Minister's opinion is that he need not say anything in this House.  Yet we are supposed to have Parliamentary Government.  The Minister is ignoring the rights of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this example to the Minister.  Supposing John Ryan goes to a coal retailer and usually orders a quarter or a half ton of coal, but now orders 2 cwts., and an hour later goes and orders another 2 cwts., and in the afternoon orders 2 more cwts., what is the position? I want the Minister to look at subsection (2), and to remember that there is a responsibility upon the coal retailer.  Because of the Minister's refusal to say exactly what has to be done, is that coal retailer to be put in the position that he may be charged with being a party to evading this legislation?  There is a difficulty there, and the Minister ought to admit that there is a difficulty there.  He should face up to it and tell us what steps will be taken to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this <i>ad nauseam,</i> and I think it is unnecessary to discuss it further.  We have had this Bill before the House for several days, a much longer time than is frequently devoted to much more important measures.  I am quite certain that Deputies do not expect to convince me that their interest in this Bill is a serious one, or that all the questions they are asking are designed for the purpose of getting information.  I do not believe it.  In any event, I cannot answer arguments the purpose of which I do not know. What is the attitude of Deputies towards this section?  Are they afraid it is going to be evaded?  In my opinion, the compulsion imposed by this section on consumers of coal requiring them to take a certain quantity of turf is sufficient.  Do Deputies want them to take more?  I admit <Col N="1062" /> that we are giving this right to consumers to buy coal without turf provided they buy coal in quantities or less than 2 cwts.  If Deputies want to give me further power to prevent persons evading the obligation of purchasing turf, they can do so, but that is what is set out in the Bill.  I am quite satisfied to leave it at that.  I do not know what Deputies are concerned with.  Do they object to my giving that concession, or do they think a much bigger concession should be given?  I think that is sufficient compulsion to ensure the attainment of our immediate purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got to keep at the back of our minds the fact that the position needs to be clarified and that there will be at least three separate sets of inspectors calling on the coal retailers and upon the coal purchasers to see that they do not evade this section in any way.  It is what the inspector, whether he is the inspector appointed by the Minister, the officer appointed by the Board or a member of the Gárda Síochána, thinks that will count.  The Minister, of course, objects to having this matter discussed.  He says it has been discussed fully and that no further discussion is necessary in his opinion.  He suggests that we are raising these points merely for the purpose of obstruction. The Minister has very little knowledge of the way in which this Bill has been received down the country. He has very little knowledge of the fears which have been created in the minds of a great number of people. He has very little knowledge, if any knowledge at all, of the practical difficulties that are going to arise in the working of the Bill.  We are certainly entitled, so long as the House remains here, to look for information, to criticise any measure that comes before the House, and to criticise it for as many days as are necessary to get the infor mation which the House thinks it is entitled to get.  I suggest to the Minister that he should have learned from the experience of some of his colleagues that the quickest way to get legislation through this House is to treat members as members of the House and to give them any information <Col N="1063" /> they require in a full and frank way.  Whatever hold-up there is when dealing with the Bill is very largely due to the attitude taken up by the Minister himself.  The Minister's attitude is: &ldquo;This is my Bill.  I have fully considered it.  It is the best I can do and I cannot improve on it.&rdquo; That is not an attitude which is going to be accepted by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose this Bill because we believe that, primarily, it is a fraud and, secondly, because we believe that in some of its minor sections it is going to work hardships on the small farmer who, as Deputy Victory said, cuts turf and sells it as a side line.  The Minister must have a short memory if he does not realise what our attitude is.  The Bill having been carried through Second Reading against our opposition, our duty is to examine it in Committee and to direct the attention of the House to any administrative evils that may appear on the face of the Bill with a view to correcting them so that the actions of the House will not be a nullity. Section 13 says: &ldquo;Whenever a coal retailer sells and delivers a certain amount of coal.&rdquo; That formula of &ldquo;sells and delivers&rdquo; is repeated in each subsection of the section.  For the benefit of the coal retailers in the country the Minister might explain what will happen in a case such as this: A consumer comes in at 11 o'clock in the morning, buys a cwt. of coal and then leaves, having completed the purchase. He comes back at 12 o'clock, buys another cwt. of coal and again leaves, having completed that purchase.  He repeats the operation every hour thereafter that the coal retailer's premises are open, buying on each occasion an additional cwt. of coal.  In the evening orders for, say, 8 cwts. of coal will have accumulated from that person, representing a series of separate, closed transactions.  Is the coal retailer entitled to deliver in the evening 8 cwts. of coal, represented by these 8 separate transactions that have taken place during the day?  That is one problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies living in the City of Dublin will feel that such a suggestion is <Col N="1064" /> absurd, that nobody would go down town eight times in the day in order to evade the obligation of taking turf. Deputies living in rural Ireland, however, will readily recognise that a person living in a small country town passes up and down a street perhaps half-a-dozen times in the day and it is no trouble to him to walk into the coal retailer's shop each time he reaches it and say: &ldquo;Send me up a cwt. of coal.&rdquo; That raises the question of whether a person must sell and deliver coal together, within the meaning of the Act.  If he only sells coal in individual lots and delivers it all toegther, then that would leave him outside the Act. Supposing that that difficulty was overcome and that the Act is amended to say that no coal retailer shall deliver less than 8 cwts. of coal without delivering the requisite quantity of turf, what will happen in regard to the other person, mentioned by Deputy Morrissey and other members of the Opposition, who deliberately goes in and orders five separate lots of 2 cwts. of coal and asks the merchant to deliver them separately?  It may happen, on the other hand, that the merchant would allow these orders to accumulate on his premises until he has, say, five or six different orders, each for 2 cwts. of coal.  He then proceeds to deliver 2 cwts. of coal to each of his five customers on his delivery cart.  He makes a round of the town, delivers the coal, comes back and takes out another five 2 cwts. and delivers them perhaps to the same people.  Do these persons successfully evade the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister says to us: &ldquo;What do you want?  Are you solicitous that this Bill should work, or are you just trying to obstruct it?&rdquo; The answer is perfectly simple.  Any Bill passed by the Oireachtas should work.  Once we have been overruled on the principle of the measure, our remaining function in Committee is to make it a workable instrument.  Even after we have improved it by making it workable, if we still dislike it, we are entitled to oppose it on Fifth Stage.  The function of the House is clearly to bring to the Minister's attention points of view that might not have been brought to his attention by his officials or by his supporters. <Col N="1065" /> That is what we are doing, and that is what we are bound to do. However, there is an additional reason in connection with this Bill, because this Bill is going to work considerable hardship on the people to whom Deputy Victory referred.  But if this Bill becomes a nullity in operation after a large body of poor people through the country have been induced to accumulate quantities of turf, to establish co-operative societies and involve themselves in expense, the turf will be left on their hands, because they will have been induced by the false representations of the Government to equip themselves to deal with a demand out of all proportion to the demand that will ordinarily develop. Then, if Section 13 breaks down and makes the Bill inoperative, these unfortunate people will be at the loss of whatever turf they have saved and got ready for the demand which they expected would be created under the section.  It is surely the duty of this House to provide against that danger, and it is to provide against these two dangers that we are directing the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to what appear to us to be grave flaws in the drafting of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that there is something strangely inconsistent in the speeches of the Opposition on this Bill in general.  We are now dealing with a situation in which people are conspiring against the turf movement.  There is an anti-turf movement on, but during the Second Reading debate on the Bill Deputy Professor O'Sullivan frequently told us that there was no necessity for compulsion at all; that there was an immense amount of goodwill towards turf in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not qualify his statement in any way.  He said there was immense goodwill towards turf, in the country, and that there was no necessity for compulsion. Now we have got to base the Bill on the supposition that consumers are going to conspire against the operation <Col N="1066" /> of it: that they are going to go to the most ridiculous rounds to defeat its provisions, and that they are going actually to enjoy getting coal into their houses, a thing that householders never enjoy.  I think that most householders usually regard the getting in of coal supplies as a bit of a nuisance.  Deputy Dillon postulates that people will be so opposed to the measure as to object to buying even a bag of turf with their coal; that they will arrange to have coal delivered to them in a number of small lots each day.  That, I think, is a most extraordinary assumption. Really, I do not think that such finicky criticism should be indulged in with regard to a measure like this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the great bulk of the people in the countryside, the average rural family in a bog area, do not use coal.  In many cases the amount of coal they use throughout the year is confined to the quantity required for threshing purposes, and perhaps another quarter-ton or half-ton that may be required for boiling of turnips during the winter.  I would like the Deputies opposite to tell us the classes of people who, in their opinion, are going to make such efforts to defeat this Bill.  Certainly, it will not be the poor people who will not be affected by it, because as a rule they buy their coal in less than 2-cwt. lots.  The extremely poor sections of the community will not be affected by the Bill, and they certainly are not opposed to it.  Then there are those who buy turf for convenience sake.  I imagine they will be prepared to pay even more for turf than they will be required to pay when this Bill becomes an Act.  How many, then, are there who will be so anxious to defeat this measure?  I cannot locate them in any country town or village that I know of.  If there are any such people, I think they would constitute a very small minority.  In my view the whole of this criticism is really looking for trouble.  I do not think <Col N="1067" /> that the Bill requires any further amendment so far as this particular question is concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore is very much concerned about the turf industry and so are we all.  But what has been sticking out in the whole situation since the Government started to meddle with the turf industry?  It is this: that since they began to interfere with the production of turf the quantity produced has declined.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that 300,000 tons of turf are less than 400,000 tons, and so on?  Deputy Moore says that something is destroying the turf industry.  What is destroying the turf industry, and what is going to do further damage to it, is that people are tinkering at it who know nothing at all about it.  Nothing more damaging to any interest that the Minister may have in the Turf Bill has been said of it than was said in a broadcast we had recently in connection with the turf-cutting festival.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to deal with the capacity that the people, referred to in Section 13, have for using turf.  The speaker who gave the broadcast on the occasion of the turf-cutting festival the other day implied that in our towns, at any rate, there were no fireplaces fit to burn turf, and that the whole fault of that was all John Bull's; that John Bull had seen to it very definitely that the fireplaces in houses in this country were such that only English coal could be burned in them.  In order to advance from that poor situation, from the point of view of turf consumption, this person suggested that a prize of £1,000 should be offered by the Government and paid to anyone who would invent a fireplace that would take turf, and then that the people should be forced to get fireplaces of that particular kind.  On the occasion of that turf-cutting festival the Minister told the country what he was not prepared to tell the Dáil, namely, the great amount of money that he was going to spend on a big turf development scheme as soon, I suppose, as he has people in the position that they can be forced to use turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made it utterly impossible for us to help him in a discussion of this Bill in a practical way. Deputy Moore talked about the average rural family in the bog area. If we knew from the Minister that we were discussing here an experiment that is going to be tried on the average rural family in the bog areas then we could concentrate on that; but instead the Minister brings in a Bill which, as far as we know, is as applicable to the City of Dublin, the City of Limerick, and to the town of Nenagh as it is to any small village in a bog area.  If the Minister wants the help of the Dáil in discussing a measure for the improvement of the turf industry, he surely ought not to ask us to discuss on the one Bill questions of administration and questions as to the use of turf in such widely scattered places as the City of Dublin, the City of Limerick, towns like Nenagh, and smaller towns near bog <Col N="1069" /> areas.  It is because the Minister does not know what exactly he is going to do that all this confusion has arisen, or, alternatively, he is not prepared to tell us what he is going to do.  If we accept the Minister's statement that 2 cwts. of coal can be bought, then 2 cwts. more, and another 2 cwts., even then the situation is objectionable because it forces a system of buying coal on people who simply want coal.  There are people who ought not to be told to do that.  Take the case of a person who has a lodging-house. That person keeps three or four lodgers.  Lodger A. will have to order 2 cwt. of coal for himself; lodger B. will have to do the same, and lodger C. likewise, and maybe the servant will have to order another 2 cwts. for herself.  We have a right to object to these plans, without objective, which create personal and family interference of that kind.  We have the responsibility to examine into them to the smallest detail, particularly when the people to be interfered with by this system of inspectorate will, obviously, have to charge their home economies in a manner quite unsuitable to the nature of the home and the means of the persons.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I want to draw attention.  On page 6 of the Bill we are given the first set of fines.  There is to be a fine of £10 in respect of the non-display of his registration certificate by a coal retailer. There is a fine of £50 for a person who has not a registration certificate and who engages in the selling of coal. There is a fine of £10 for purchasing from an unregistered coal retailer, and there is a fine of £1 for every ton or part of a ton of coal greater than 2 cwt. purchased or sold without a suitable quantity of turf.  Where are these fines to go?  Are they to go to the Minister for Finance to bolster up the Exchequer or how are they to be used?  If they are to be used to foster the turf industry, will they be used to buy more sacks, or will they be used for the £250,000 new scheme the Minister has in mind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this section is really the root of the whole Bill.  In essence, the Bill is a measure to provide a subsidy for the production of turf.  That would be all very well if it worked equitably to all sections of the community, but apparently it is going to cut across different people in different ways.  We pressed the Minister to say how many appointed areas he proposed to create. He was not willing to do that.  Having tried the experiment on some of the districts best suited for this measure, success in those districts would invite other people to have areas appointed even up to Dublin.  Coal and turf are two different substances, requiring two different grates or ranges in order to get the best out of them.  To be logical, people compelled to burn turf at one stage and coal at another ought to instal two fireplaces side by side and use one range or grate for coal and another range or grate for turf.  We are all familiar with the difference in these ranges and grates.  A range or grate which is to burn turf requires a bigger fire-box.  What will be the position of people compelled to comply with this Act?  The incidence of complying with it will work out in different ways.  Plenty of grates, ranges and cottage hearths throughout the country are perfectly suited to the burning of turf.  It will not impose the slightest hardship on those people to continue to burn turf.  But what will be the position of other people not so well circumstanced?  Deputy Mulcahy raised the question of the grate installed by John Bull to burn his own coal.  What will be the position of a person down the country who has a range or grate suited to the burning of coal but who is compelled to use turf?  He will not get the same measure of heat out of it. That is the plain truth of the matter, and that is what is going to happen to the poorest section of the community who have coal grates.  They are not going to be as warm as they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the next difficulty which strikes one in connection with this Bill.  Certain people, especially in the cities, have only got limited storage accommodation.  A ton of turf takes up a great deal more space than a ton of coal.  I take it that it is outside the <Col N="1071" /> bounds of possibility that a person in a flat will leave his stack of turf out on the landing.  We all know what would happen if that were done.  What is a person who is compelled to give an order beyond the storage capacity of his coal-bin to do?  The coal retailer supplying a quantity of coal greater than 2 cwt. must also supply a certain quantity of turf.  What would the Minister advise the retailer to say to a person who told him that he had not storage for turf and that he was not going to burn turf?  Certain people may object to the ashes from turf, but in the case I mentioned the retailer will probably say: &ldquo;You got coal at 3/- a cwt. before, and now you will have to pay 3/6 to get 2 cwt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does anyone think that a person is going to leave the appropriate quantity of turf out on the landing or out on the street, if he lives in a flat? I think the Minister ought seriously to consider how he can best promote the use of turf by something that will bear equitably on all sections of the community, because apparently there are certain people who cannot comply with the law.  It will either be that or they will have to pay an excessive price for coal by buying it in 2 cwt. lots.  The Minister, to my mind, has not seriously approached that problem.  Deputy Moore seems to suggest that there is a conspiracy to refuse to burn turf.  I should like, on behalf of the members on this side, indignantly to repudiate that suggestion, but I should like to add that nothing brings the law into such disrespect as finding out that it is quite impossible for the people to comply with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore made a reference to a statement of mine.  May I point out to him that it was fully borne out by the Minister, who, at column 1730 of the Official Debates, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I think Deputy O'Sullivan was correct when he said that over a large part of the country the people would prefer to use turf instead of coal, and, that being so, there can be, I am sure, little objection to a <Col N="1072" /> Bill which is designed to increase its production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is the attitude of the people.  One Deputy referred to people as being too grand to burn turf.  I find no evidence of that at all. It is not there, and surely by this time the Minister and Deputy Moore must have realised the fact that they are tackling this at the wrong end.  The Minister has never given any explanation of his failure to see that even in the houses subsidised by Government aid there were proper facilities for burning turf.</P>

      <P>Not the slightest; the interruptions are most useful.  Last night, when we were dealing with another matter, we found that there was communication between the Minister's Department and the Department of Local Government, and a provision was put in that articles of Irish manufacture should be used in the building of houses where a Government subsidy was given.  Why were no steps taken?  Why was it possible on the occasion referred to by Deputy Mulcahy for the impression to be conveyed over the wireless, in connection with a function at which the Minister was <Col N="1073" /> present, that there was scarcely a grate in the country suitable for turf burning?  These statements, coming from Deputy Mrs. Concannon and from the Minister's own ardent supporters in the matter, ought to bring home to the House what the Minister is trying to do&mdash;to compel people to do a thing for the doing of which, without grave inconvenience, he has provided no facilities or possibly even to do at all.  There is no prejudice against turf in any part of the country with which I am acquainted.  There the Minister and I are in full agreement, but there are not facilities for burning it in many of the houses, and particularly the smaller houses in country towns, which I gather the Minister has chiefly in view, at least in respect of the initial stages of the enforcement of this Bill.  These facilities are not there.  Deputy Moore speaks of an average house, but from this point of view there is no such thing.  A farmer's house in the country with an open hearth is one thing, but the house of an ordinary resident in a country town is a different thing.  So far as this Bill is concerned, there is no average possible between those two types of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, all I can say is that Deputy Moore's statement does not touch the subject, <Col N="1074" /> because the Minister had mainly in view not the farm house where turf and turf alone is burned.  It cannot apply there.  Has he in view then the farm house which is not in a bog area?  Deputy Moore does not refer to that.  The only type of house we can refer to is the type I have spoken of, namely, the house in a country district in a bog area.  There is no average between that house and the country house with the open hearth of the ordinary farmer.  The Minister, instead of taking the normal steps, proceeding in a normal rational way to see that there were facilities for the burning of turf, prefers the method ingrained in the Ministry&mdash;so ingrained that they cannot get out of it&mdash;compulsion, without any advertence to whether or not the people have the facilities for making use of this particular fuel.</P>
      <P>If there is no prejudice against turf, as the Minister says, why do the people not burn it to a greater extent? The Minister admits there is no prejudice. Does that at least not raise the question in his mind that there must be some reason, when prejudice, which he generally alleges against Irish goods, does not operate, why the people are not in a position to use it? If Deputy Moore goes to an ordinary country town situate in a bog area, he will find that that is the view of the people there.  If they were in a position to use the turf, they would certainly do it, but they are not.  It is useless for a broadcaster to refer to the injury done us by the English in imposing English grates not suitable for burning turf.  If that statement by the Minister's supporter is so, objecting that that injury was inflicted upon us by the English does not get rid of it.  It does not put grates suitable for burning turf into the different houses.  A protest against the past conduct of the English does not solve the domestic difficulty of the ordinary householder in the country towns.  Then, the Minister, in the course of one of his numerous interruptions, objected to Deputy Mulcahy's figures.  I wonder why he always loses his temper when Deputy Mulcahy quotes figures?</P>

      <P>Was that the reason?  It would be hard to convince us of that.  I asked the Minister before why he did not give the figures he stands over.  I put that question to him last week, but he has not done so. Why does the Minister have figures published which nobody apparently can understand and from which the obvious lesson that follows is apparently the last lesson to be drawn from them?  The Minister always loses his temper the minute figures furnished by his own Department are quoted.  He protests that Deputy Mulcahy is misunderstanding the figures, but he does not show us how he is doing it and he does not state in what respect the figures are wrong.</P>

The Minister does not explain what his compulsory power is.  I would ask him to take to heart the speech delivered here by Deputy Mrs. Concannon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two possible sets of circumstances.  One set of circumstances would arise where the miller, merchant or industrialist only sold coal in quantities so small that the provisions of the Bill do not apply, in which case there is no obligation to sell turf.  If the merchant sells coal in <Col N="1077" /> larger quantities, then, undoubtedly, turf must be sold with the coal, but that would not impose any great hardship. In any event, any person who sells coal by retail must be registered. There is no difficulty about registration. The register is prepared, and any person who applies can be entered on the register.  The only purpose of the register is to ensure that there will be a method of applying sanctions to such coal retailers as do not comply with the provisions of the Bill, but these provisions will cause no difficulty to these industrial concerns.  I have had representations made to me on this matter from some of the industrialists who engage in this practice. I considered the question as to whether it was necessary to make any provision in the Bill to meet their cases and I decided that it was not necessary. If it happened that they sold coal in quantities over 2 cwt.  I do not think we could release them or the persons purchasing the coal from the same obligations that we are imposing on others in the district, if the area were made an appointed area. As I understand it, Deputy O'Sullivan's argument is this: that because there are some fire grates in the country that are not suitable for burning coal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is for registration. Now Deputy O'Sullivan's argument is this: that because there are some fire grates in the country that are not suitable to burn turf; because there are some ranges in the country that are not suitable to burn turf; and because there are some flats and dwelling-houses in parts of the country where there is not sufficient storage accommodation to hold the turf, we should do nothing to encourage the production and use of turf or that we should do nothing until we recondition the houses in the country and replace the grates and ranges.  That is a very good argument for doing nothing. That is the reason why Deputy O'Sullivan's Government did nothing to encourage the use of turf.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is anything else that has been raised by the Deputies which requires to be dealt with by me.  The existence of grates and ranges not suitable for the burning of turf and the absence of storage accommodation are, in our opinion, regrettable, but, nevertheless, we think we should proceed with our plans to encourage the consumption of turf.  I do not think, because changes may have to be made in certain houses, that we should on that account abandon a programme which offers considerable possibilities to improve the conditions of life for large numbers of our people.  There are very few of those grates or ranges which cannot be adapted to the use of turf.  In fact the modern grate of the most up-to-date design is as suitable an apparatus for burning turf as any grate that could be designed.  When I say that the modern grate is as suitable as any that could be designed, I admit that I have no technical knowledge upon these matters, but there is an examination being made of the most suitable apparatus for the utilisation of turf for all purposes, industrial as well as household purposes, and whatever information results from that investigation will be made available to those interested in the manufacture of this apparatus.</P>
      <P>I think most of the manufacturers have already on the market grates, ranges and stoves designed primarily for the use of turf, in regard to the efficiency of which the manufacturers are quite proud.  When Deputy O'Sullivan desires to recondition his house by the installation of apparatus for that purpose, he can get quotations from a number of manufacturers who will be interested.  The same applies to anybody in the country.  In fact, in most of the country towns I am sure that the grates and ranges in the great majority of houses burned turf before they burned coal, and they burned it efficiently and can do so again.</P>

      <P>There is one matter <Col N="1080" /> upon which I should like to ask the Minister a question.  This Bill sets out: &ldquo;Whenever a coal retailer sells and delivers.&rdquo; I should like to get the word &ldquo;delivers&rdquo; clarified.  Does the word there mean delivered by the carts or lorries of the coal retailer to the residence of the person who orders coal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have the matter made more clear.  If a person drives in a cart to the retailer, orders coal and takes delivery of it, what is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm for an ordinary man in the street, like myself, to get that point clarified.  So far as the trade is concerned, delivery means coal delivered by the carts or trucks of the coal retailer.  As a matter of fact, there is a difference in the price, because a higher price is charged for delivery.  The Minister may not know that, but it is the fact. A person by taking delivery from a particular store may get the coal at a lower rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the miller who has been mentioned, I would like the Minister to be clear on this point: If a miller or an industrialist, who has been supplying coal at cost price to his employees or anybody else, supplies coal in greater quantities than 2 cwts., does the Minister imply that he will have to supply turf as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And he will have to register as a coal retailer and, because otherwise he would be liable to a penalty of £10, he will have to keep prominently displayed during business hours a certificate that he is a coal retailer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1081" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 10 they have to keep prominently displayed during business hours a certificate of registration under a penalty of £10.  Perhaps the question may arise more appropriately on Section 19, but if a miller or an industrialist is able to supply coal in quantities of less than 2 cwts. to any person without having to buy turf, why may not the person who is a dairyman, or runs a small grocer's shop, buy coal without turf and retail it in quantities of not more than 2 cwts.?  It seems to me that Section 19 is going to discriminate against a dairyman or a grocer, while, according to the Minister, a miller or an industrialist will be in a different position.</P>

      <P>I would like to call attention to the flippant way in which the Minister dealt with important aspects of this matter.  I can only say that it is quite characteristic of the <Col N="1082" /> Minister.  He referred to flats and dwelling houses where there is not sufficient storage accommodation for turf, and he dealt with my argument in that connection.  I contend that the majority of grates are not suitable for turf burning.  Indeed, one could gather from the Minister that in many cases they are not suitable.  But I am not referring at the moment to flats.  I have in mind the ordinary houses in the lanes in country towns, in the streets in country towns.  These are places of which, apparently, the Minister has no knowledge.  All the comfort that we can get here is not that the Minister has made an investigation to see whether our complaints are justified, but that an examination is being made.  First you use compulsion and then you proceed to see whether there is any justification for it.  That is quite characteristic of the Government. The Minister speaks of encouraging the people, and his only activity is on the side of interference and compulsion. I think the whole thing represents an absolute abuse of language.  There is one thing clear, he will have a little difficulty about the legal interpretation of &ldquo;delivery.&rdquo; I do not argue that matter now; it is more a matter for the courts to consider.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section again the Minister is taking rather extraordinary powers in regard to prescribing the quantity of turf in relation to coal sold by a retailer to a purchaser.  The section says that the Minister may make separate and different regulations in respect of different appointed areas, and may prescribe different quantities of turf in respect of different appointed areas or different parts of the same appointed area, and may by regulation fix such quantity of turf in respect of each appointed area or parts of the same appointed area.  So we are likely to have this position. We may have a particular appointed area, and for one part of that area it may be prescribed that for every ton of coal purchased a quarter ton of turf must also be purchased.  In another part of that area it may be prescribed that for every ton of coal purchased half a ton of turf may have to be purchased. Does the Minister realise the great difficulties that may arise in connection with that?  Does he realise the amount of hardship and damage that the retailer may suffer in his business in such a connection?</P>
      <P>Let me put to the Minister the case of two villages or towns fairly close to one another.  A person finds that by purchasing his coal in one town he will be only compelled to take a quarter ton or an eighth of a ton of turf, whereas if he purchased in the other town he may have to take half a ton of turf.  It seems to me that it is bad enough to have the amount of turf in relation to coal differing in some appointed areas, but I do not see any reason at all why such a thing should occur in the same area, with the prospect of creating difficulty and trouble and the danger of doing definite damage to the existing business of certain people.  What is the necessity for this, and what has the Minister in mind in putting such a proposal into the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy need be under any apprehension that regulations will be made which will operate in the manner which he fears or that there will be a very sharp distinction between the requirements under the Act in one area as compared with the requirements in an adjoining area.  It is desirable to secure that the percentage of turf which may have to be purchased in relation to coal will vary from locality to locality, from area to area, as the economy of using coal changes.  There are many parts of the country where it can be said that turf in relation to coal is a very much cheaper fuel, even at the present time without organised production or marketing.  There are other areas where that would not be <Col N="1085" /> correct, but where it could be said that turf and coal were on an equal footing. There are parts of the country where undoubtedly coal is cheaper to use than turf.  While the percentage fixed in any area will, of course, have most direct relation to the quantity of turf to be disposed of, nevertheless the intention is to use the powers to ensure that turf will be used most where it is cheapest to use.  That is why power is being taken to vary the requirements from area to area, or in different parts of a single area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that meets the point I raised.  The Minister said I need have no fear.  We have to have fear.  We have to realise that, after all, the Minister is not going to be always there&mdash;there may be another Minister.  Once this Bill passes from this House we have no further control over the matter.  We have to realise further that this whole section is to be given effect to by regulations made in the Minister's Department.  I cannot see any point in what the Minister said.  If it is more economic to burn turf in particular areas&mdash;as I know it is, but they would have to be very close to the bog, practically on the brink of it to make it more economic&mdash; then there is no necessity for this power of differentiation at all.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that what I have stated is much more likely to happen and I can see its creating a very definite and positive difficulty.  I can conceive its damaging very considerably the business of coal retailers. It is bad enough to have the quantity of turf in relation to coal differing in different specified areas, but to have different quantities specified in the same area&mdash;so far as we know there may not be any differentiation, or there may be four or five different quantities specified&mdash;is, to say the least of it, very loose and unsatisfactory and it should not be left in this section at all.  It seems to me that the Minister is going far enough and getting sufficient power when he asks the House to give him power to make regulations specifying different quantities in different specified areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that. If the Minister divides the country into three areas for the purpose of the Bill, and specifies, say, that in the Leinster area there is to be so much turf in relation to coal, in the Munster area something slightly different, and in Connaught and Ulster something slightly different again, that is one thing.  But if the Minister specifies, say, North Tipperary as one area, and then proceeds to say that in the town of Roscrea for every ton of coal bought there must be a half-ton of turf bought; that in Thurles for every ton of coal bought there must be 6 cwts. of turf bought, and that in Nenagh for every ton of coal bought there must be 2½ cwts. of turf bought, what will happen?</P>

A person ordering coal is required to purchase with that coal a proportion of turf, and the retailer is required to supply him with that coal and that proportion of turf, irrespective of where the retailer is situated, in what area he is situated. The proportion that he must sell to that purchaser is determined by the area in which the purchaser resides.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be referred to any explanation that the Minister has given on this point.  The Minister has in his mind, or there was in the minds of the people who prepared the Bill, the idea of appointing certain areas, and having sub-areas inside appointed areas, or at least the possibility of that.  We ought to have some general idea as to what are the characteristics of an area that would warrant its being regarded as a separate appointed area.  Deputy Morrissey spoke of the possibility of having three areas, one of them being Leinster.  If the Minister has any idea that he may make an appointed area as large as a province we ought to know.  If he has at the back of his head that a county is suitable for an appointed area we ought to know that. For instance, if, say, County Galway is to be made an appointed area, surely we ought to be taken to that extent into the Minister's confidence.  We ought to be told whether there is a likelihood of Galway being made an appointed area, of Clare being made an appointed area, or of Galway and Clare combined being made an appointed area.  Then we ought to know something of what would be the characteristics and conditions of an area that will warrant separate regulations being applied to sub-divisions of such an appointed area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has not got any information that I know of as to what is to be the size of the appointed area <Col N="1088" /> normally made by the Minister under the Act.  On this section we would expect that the Minister would indicate what kind of sub-areas will be appointed if this section is put into the Bill.  The people who drafted the section must have had some plan in their minds.  If the Minister wants to persuade us that it was done by people who know anything about the turf industry they would have had some particular appointed areas, and possible areas for sub-division inside the appointed areas, in their minds when drafting the section.  We do not know anything about the likely size of the appointed areas or sub-areas.  The Minister has given no information as to the things that will enter into his mind, or into the mind of whoever deals with the matter, in deciding that differentiation shall be made as to the quantity of turf to be accepted by any person, based upon differences in the price of coal, the particular period of the year, and the place at which the coal will be delivered.</P>
    <P>We are asked to give the Minister permission to fix different quantities of turf for coal at different prices, and we would like to have a general idea as to what is at the back of his mind in that.  We do not want to tie him to any special detailed prices for coal, but we do want to have some idea of the different prices of coal he has in mind when he wants different quantities of turf to be taken with that coal.</P>
    <P>Will the quantity of turf go up with the price of coal, or will the quantity of turf come down with the price of coal?  If the year is to be divided into particular periods from the point of view of the quantity of turf that has to be supplied, will the Minister indicate to us what time of the year the most turf would have to be taken, and what time of the year the least turf would have to be taken?  If differentiation is to be made in the quantity of turf according to the place of delivery of coal, will the Minister tell us into what particular classifications he has put the places of delivery as warranting differentiation in the matter of turf?  Those are points on which we want the Minister to take us into his confidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> Will the Minister tell us what kind of inquiry is going to be held in any appointed area or in any sub-area before regulations providing for those differentiations are made and given his imprimatur?  Will there be an inquiry held in any sub-area, at which persons may attend and give reasons why certain differentiations should be made or why certain differentiations should not be made?  If, in any sub-area, regulations are going to be issued, based on the price of coal, the place to which coal is delivered, and the period of the year, it seems to me that that can be satisfactorily settled only by an examination of the local conditions, and that that examination of local conditions, in order to be satisfactorily done, must be done by means of some kind of an inquiry.  Will turf-cutters, householders or manufacturers in any of those sub-areas have an opportunity of appearing before any such inquiry and giving their assistance in seeing that the regulations are provided upon lines which meet local requirements?</P>

      <P>I am in favour of giving every possible encouragement through this Bill, through the voice of the Minister, and through any agency he may have at his disposal, to induce more people in the countryside and in the villages surrounding the bogs of this country to burn more turf.  I should like, however, to hear the Minister a little bit further in regard to his own intentions in connection with the administration of this section. I should like to know, for instance, whether, before he compels a coal retailer or any other person to buy and sell a certain quantity of turf with a certain quantity of coal, he will have official inquiries made through his own Department to ascertain if there is a sufficient supply of turf available in that particular area to comply with his proposed regulation?  If the Minister, for instance, makes a regulation <Col N="1090" /> compelling people in a certain area, whether coal retailers or others, to buy and sell a certain quantity of turf with coal, and the necessary supply of turf is not available there, I can see the price of turf being put up immediately.  The price of turf, I think, is regulated in the same way as the price of every other commodity, by the law of supply and demand.</P>

I should also like to remind the Minister that in and around the towns and cities where this regulation might be applied he should take into consideration the lack of storage accommodation for turf by the cottage people who have not more than a big garden attached to their houses.</P>

      <P>I say, Sir, that those considerations have to be borne in mind by the Minister.  I was wondering if he could indicate to us whether he took those matters into consideration when he was drafting this section, and, if so, what his intentions are with regard to forcing the purchase and sale of a percentage of turf.  I should like to know whether official inquiries will be made and, if so, from what source, as to whether the supply of turf is there to meet the regulations which the Minister may make under this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are quite a lot of people in the House, I think, who do not believe that there is really any serious policy at all behind the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we can agree to differ.  The Minister was interesting when he told us that he wanted this particular variation in the section, so that he could vary, from village to village, if you like, the amount of turf which he would compel people to buy. One of the reasons he put forward for that was that he wanted to specify a greater amount of turf where it would be more economical for the people to burn it.  Mind you, I thought that the people of this country were sensible enough to realise that for themselves without any governmental or ministerial interference, and I think so still.  I think that the people have always burned turf where it was more economical for them to do so, and it is not necessary for the Minister to go down and tell them: &ldquo;You must burn more turf here, because it is cheaper for you to do so.&rdquo; That is all humbug; the people of this country are not fools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not, but the Minister must have his hand in; he wants to be able to interfere with the liberty of the people in that regard. The Minister also told us that the amount of turf to be bought would be the amount that would apply to the area in which the purchaser resided. If we examine that, it rather brings us to a pretty involved state of affairs. The Minister can make an Order which will entitle him, I understand, to fix the amount of turf, varying, if you like, from week to week and from month to month.  Let us take the case of a coal retailer, say, in No. 8 area, wherever that would be.  That man knows the complement of turf that he must sell with coal in his own particular area, but, according to the Minister, he must also know the amount he would sell to a man from No. 1 area.  He should supply that man with exactly the amount he was entitled to in his No. 1 area.  Does the Minister hope to operate that type of what I might call affliction on the people? He will not be able to do it. It is humbug on the part of the Minister <Col N="1092" /> if he thinks he is entitled to vary his Orders from day to day and from week to week, and if all the retailers in the country must not alone know what is applied to their own particular area but what is applied to every area in the country.</P>

Most of the points raised by Deputy Mulcahy and by Deputy Davin were dealt with in a previous discussion, and it is hardly necessary to go over them again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Davin was dealt with on the last occasion here, and I said that the powers concerned would only be used to the extent that would enable the available turf to be disposed of and that there was no intention of creating an artificial scarcity of fuel.  There will, of course, be precise information as to the quantity of turf available. There are only three sources from which it can be procured: the Turf Development Board, the co-operative societies recognised by the board, or a company approved of under the Bill&mdash; and from each of these sources it will be possible to get, at the commencement of each season, accurate information as to the total quantity available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the commencement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the commencement of the winter season.  The regulations to be made, if any, will be such as to ensure that that quantity will be disposed of.  It is possible that in many areas, or in some years, regulations will not be necessary, and the turf will be available in such quantities that we can hope to dispose of it without the use of the powers contained in the provisions of this Bill at all.  However, in the event of it being necessary in any year, or in any area, to use the powers contained in this Bill, they will be used to such extent as will enable that turf to be disposed of, and to see that <Col N="1093" /> there is no possibility of an artificial scarcity being created, resulting in a rise in price.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to the law of supply and demand in this connection, but in this case there is a price fixed at which the turf will be available, and the price which will be paid by the purchasers and paid to the producers. It was thought desirable to have these powers in order to vary the manner in which the proportion of turf to coal would be determined in accordance with different circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Bill is, of course, in a sense, experimental.  It proposes to confer powers of a kind which have not been heretofore used, and it is desirable, therefore, to have these powers expressed in words which will enable them to be adapted to the requirements of the situation according as the situation develops.  Ordinarily, the requirement in any area in respect of the purchase of turf could be expressed in terms of weight, or the quantity of turf in relation to the quantity of coal, but it may be necessary in some areas or on some occasions, or because of difficulties that we do not at the moment foresee, to express the particular requirement in some other form. Therefore, power is being taken to vary the proportion in whatever manner may be required as the occasion demands.  I think it is a wise precaution, when the Dáil has approved of the principle of conveying these powers, to ensure that the form in which it is done will be such as to obviate any necessity for an amendment of the form at a later stage if it should not prove to be entirely suitable when it comes to be operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir.  When the Minister tells us in this section that, to vary the amount of turf, people will be forced to take <Col N="1095" /> it according to the price of coal, the quantity of coal, the period of the year, and the premises to which it will be delivered, surely we are entitled to ask for information as to what is at the back of it.  We are told that this has been dealt with already.  This has not been dealt with in this House, Sir.  At no other stage of this Bill has the Minister informed this House what are the considerations that are going to make him set up different areas with different regulations inside them.  At no time in the discussion of this Bill has the Minister told the House what are the conditions in any areas that would dictate that a different supply of turf would be taken with a ton of coal according to the price of that particular ton of coal.  I should like to know if there is any Deputy in this House who has heard from the Minister what are the types of premises to which, if one ton of coal is delivered, a different amount of turf should be delivered.  I should like to hear from any Deputy in the House who is in a position to tell me or the other members of the House that the Minister has dealt with that particular point already.  The Minister says that he has.  I should also like to know &mdash;and the Minister ought to be able to tell us this&mdash;how the period of the year is going to affect the amount of turf that has to be taken with any particular quantity of coal.  The Minister says he requires these powers. Apparently, according to his reading of parliamentary procedure, they have been fully approved of in principle by being passed by the Party majority on the Second Reading, and therefore we need get no further information about it.  The Minister thinks that difficulties may arise that they cannot foresee and that these powers would be useful.  That, apparently, is the only explanation that the Minister can give on this particular section, because he seems to have no idea in his head as to why differentiation in the matter of the amount of turf should be related to price of coal or particular premises, except that the premises may be inspected with a view to seeing whether there is suitable equipment for the <Col N="1096" /> consumption of coal or turf in them. If the Minister had any idea in his head, I am sure he would tell us.</P>
      <P>The section, coupled with the Minister's remarks, bears the stamp of what has been emphasised here, that people are dealing with this question who do not know anything about it, and do not know where they are going.  When they drafted the Bill they did not foresee the difficulties that would arise.  Now they want this hotch potch of powers to do the most astonishing things that could be put into a section.  It gives no idea of what are &ldquo;appointed areas,&rdquo; what conditions are going to require sub-areas being called into being, and no idea of what is going to happen inside any of these areas by way of inquiry of any kind to warrant differential regulations bearing upon the various amounts of turf that go with one ton of coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Davin is quite satisfied with the assurance he got from the Minister in reply to his queries.  At the beginning the Minister assured him that he was not going to use this measure to compel people to burn turf that did not exist.  Then he told the Deputy that the Government saw the difficulties that might arise in the event of this scheme being put into operation, but so little did they know of the amount of turf produced, the amount that could be consumed in any particular area, or the period of the year, that they felt it was necessary to come to the Dáil and to ask for a blank cheque, by getting a Bill so loosely worded and so vague that it would be possible for the Government to make any regulations to deal with any conditions that might arise.  That is about the most amazing statement I ever heard made by a Minister.  He said the Bill was deliberately worded so that it would not be necessary to come before the Dáil with an amending measure.  That means that his Department could legislate for this House.  That was the assurance the Minister gave to such a democrat as Deputy Davin.  I am sure the Deputy would not lend himself to that type of autocracy, to <Col N="1097" /> hand the power of this House to pass amending legislation into the hands of officials of a Department.  That is what the Minister is asking.  He admitted that.  Deputy Davin said that he voted whole-heartedly for this Bill.</P>

Under it the Minister has power to &ldquo;declare that a particular area specified or delimited in such order shall, as on and from a date... specified in such order, be an appointed area for the purpose of this Act.&rdquo; In the following sub-section the Minister takes power to make additions or alterations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no power in this Bill by which orders the Minister makes come before the Dáil.  This is a very involved section of a dozen lines, and the Minister can make separate regulations in respect of &ldquo;appointed areas.&rdquo; He can have one area at one side of a street and another area at the opposite side.  He can make them different areas in respect of orders, and still he has no responsibility to the House in connection with such regulations.  Then the whole section stands upon this, that the Minister may take into account the period of the year at which coal is sold, the quantity of coal included in any one sale, the price at which coal is sold, and the place of delivery of such coal.  Now, he has told us that what may be the governing factor in connection with the regulations he is going to make is the quantity of turf that is available. <Col N="1100" /> It was not worth his while to put that into the measure.  Does the Minister know that there are different qualities of turf?  He may make regulations prescribing the purchase by citizens of turf which is not of good quality.  No Minister could possibly get more power in connection with a Bill of this kind than the Minister gets, and no Minister is less responsible to the Dáil in connection with any of the regulations he will make under this Bill.  He makes these regulations, taking into account the price at which coal is sold.  He tells us that the price of turf is out of order on this section.  Surely the Minister has in mind the price of turf when he is considering the price of coal?</P>

He can say at any time that anybody raises any question in connection with this Bill: &ldquo;There is no responsibility on me to defend any of these Orders in this House.&rdquo; The terminology used here is that the Minister may whenever he thinks fit issue an Order.  Will the Minister show where in this Bill it is prescribed that any regulation has to be brought before the Dáil?  Will he show where the sanction of the Dáil has to be obtained in respect to any regulation? Will he not admit plainly and definitely that this Bill throws over parliamentary responsibility completely and vests in an individual absolute power which he can exercise at his own discretion, if and when he thinks proper? He may be asked a question but the Minister himself has had experience of Ministers refusing to answer questions. The Minister himself would be one of the first to say: &ldquo;No responsibility was imposed upon me in connection with the administration of the Act to answer to the Dáil for what I did.&rdquo;</P>

On the last occasion on which the Minister appeared before the Dáil in connection with an Order made by him, the Leader of the Labour Party made a very poor speech in respect to an Order, for which the Minister was responsible, and the Minister was dumb.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that puts an obligation on coal retailers to obtain their supplies of turf from what is known as an approved source. This section is going to impose hard ships not only on the retailers but, what is, perhaps, more important from the Minister's point of view, on the producers of turf.  There are individual turf cutters, and in some cases small groups of families in a turf area&mdash; relatives forming two or three households&mdash;who come together for the marketing of their turf and whose turf, because it is of good quality, commands a better price than that of the local society.  The merchants are prepared to pay for turf that is of consistently good quality&mdash;hard and well-dried&mdash;a higher price than they would pay for the ordinary turf which they would have to take.  It seems to me that this section is going to impose a hardship in that regard.  I gather from the Official Reports that Deputy Mulcahy raised this matter on the last occasion, and that the Minister made some interesting statements in reply.  One of his <Col N="1107" /> statements was of very great interest to me personally and to, at least, one other retailer whom I know.  If the Minister's statement is correct, he has given very useful and, if I may say so, rather valuable information, so far as I am concerned.  The Minister said in reply to Deputy Mulcahy that the railway company would charge the individual retailer the same for carriage of turf as they would charge a co-operative society, that they had no right to discriminate.  That is very welcome news to me.  I can give particulars of my own experience, and there are others also affected.  I can give the names to the Minister if necessary.  These people have been purchasing turf, not under the Government scheme, but from individual turf cutters, and they have been paying these turf cutters a higher price than would be payable to the society.  The Minister said that the people who did this should be in Grangegorman or some place like that.  These people do not pay a higher price for turf for the sake of philanthropy.  They pay the higher price because the turf they are getting is of better quality than the turf which they would obtain from the society.  The flat rate for carriage of turf under the Government's scheme is 6/- per ton.  The Minister says that the railway company will charge indiduals the same rates as they charge people from co-operative societies, that they have no power to discriminate. Would it surprise the Minister to know that, when I asked for quotations from the Great Southern Railways Company for the bringing of turf from Clare to North Tipperary, I was quoted £1 per ton.</P>

      <P>That is beyond me. I hope to have a talk with the Deputy about it afterwards and avail of his assistance.  The Minister is surprised that anybody in his senses should purchase turf in that way and not get it under the Government scheme.  It is worth more than 4/- to anybody in the business not to be tied down by the irksome restrictions made by the Department.  Then, there is also the question of getting good-quality turf. It is worth while paying a higher rate for that.  Are we to have the same position when this Bill becomes law, and are we to be confined to approved <Col N="1109" /> sources with regard to the sacks?  Is the old stupid regulation, originally made by the Turf Board, that retailers will have to keep a minimum of 10 tons of turf in stock to be retained?  What is the purpose of that regulation?  Has the Minister any idea of the storage required for 10 tons of turf?  Many persons who are trying to make a living out of retailing coal have not sufficient storage for 10 tons of turf.</P>
      <P>There are many other irksome regulations. We are asked why we do not get it in sacks, but does not any person who has been in the business know quite well that it would be utterly impossible to keep trace of those sacks? Does he not know quite well that when they are given out, they are very often not returned?  There is no coal merchant or coal retailer in this country who has had anything to do with the Government's scheme who has not had a great deal of trouble and been put to substantial loss, so far as sacks are concerned.  Anybody who has knowledge of rural life knows quite well that when a farmer gets hold of a few good sacks, there is going to be some trouble in getting them back from him. It is quite a common practice in the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, unlike Deputy Davin, he is just as honest inside the House as he is outside.  He knows that it is so, and so do Deputy Davin and everybody else.  I want to get back to the other point, that there is going to be definite hardship so far as these approved sources are concerned, and I want to ask the Minister if he has taken into consideration the people we have spoken about, the people, who, from the beginning or middle of this month until the end of August, cut turf, who live on pieces of poor land adjacent to bogs, and who spend the winter disposing of the turf <Col N="1110" /> in towns and villages by the load or in smaller quantities hawked from door to door.  In that way, they make at least double the price for their turf that it will be possible for them to make when this Bill becomes an Act. There are hundreds of those people in the country and I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that there are thousands of them.  Day after day from next October until the following February or March, so long as their supply holds, they cart that turf into the local towns and sell it in the market to persons who buy turf by the load, or hawk it from door to door selling 3d., 6d. and 1/- worth.  In that way, it is not 11/- or 11/6 a ton they make, but at least double that, and so far as those people are concerned practically their whole market will be wiped out.  I admit it will not be altogether wiped out because many of the people who will not be affected by Section 13 will still be able to purchase some, but even those people, when they go to the local coal store for their coal, where turf is available, will get out of the habit of buying from these people and will get it where it can be obtained at any time of the day.  I think that is a very definite and very big hardship.</P>
      <P>Then the other point arises that these people will lose money.  There is one man&mdash;and I talk from personal knowledge&mdash;who next year will get anything from 2/6 to 3/- per ton less for his turf than he is able to obtain this year, and certain other members of his family also.  I give that just as one illustration, but I have no doubt there are many others.  The other case is that of the men who hawk turf in the towns.  In my opinion, whatever good this Bill is going to do, if it is going to do any good, is going to be offset by the very definite harm and loss it is going to cause to people who have been in this turf business all their lives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The considerations which prompted the inclusion of this section were discussed at very great length on the motion for the Money Resolution and on Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment to an earlier section, and I do not think it is necessary to <Col N="1111" /> reiterate them.  We are requiring people in areas which are made approved areas for the purpose of the Bill to purchase certain quantities of turf.  There is, therefore, I think, on us an obligation to ensure that they get good quality turf, or, at any rate, turf the quality of which can be supervised, and, therefore, it is provided that the turf sold to them must be turf obtained from an approved source, that is, one of the sources set out in the Bill.  The reason for that provision is that we think it necessary to keep under supervision and control the quality of the turf supplied to merchants for resale in accordancce with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The statement I made to the Deputy as to the cost of transporting turf by rail stands.  The railway company applied to the Railway Tribunal and got from the Railway Tribunal an order fixing 6/- a ton as the flat rate for the transportation of turf packed in sacks, and that rate is, and must be, available for anybody requiring turf to be transported, but when turf is packed loose obviously different considerations arise, and the flat rate does not apply.</P>

      <P>When the Minister talks about ensuring the good quality of turf by getting it from an approved source, it is evident that he does not know what he is talking about.  It is a great pity the Minister did not get advice from somebody who knew something about turf and bogs generally before speaking of ensuring the supply of good quality turf by getting it from an approved source.  I should like to tell the Minister what I know is happening in the town of Roscommon and surrounding areas.  There is a turf society in that district, and there are people there who sell turf to that society, but it is not their best turf by any means.  They get a fixed price for it, but they hawk their <Col N="1112" /> best turf through the streets of Roscommon, and sell in competition with one another, and in competition with the different districts.  That is what happens, and the Minister is going to ensure that he is getting good quality turf by getting his turf from the Kilteevan turf society instead of from the man in the street.  The Minister does not know what he is talking about.</P>
      <P>I would invite the Minister down to Roscommon on some market day or any week evening to meet the people from Kilteevan, from Beechwood, from Derrycarberry, from Lisanaria, from Weekfield, from Kilgefin, from Clooncroff and from Clooncundra, and to tell them that in future he will not permit them to sell turf in the town of Roscommon except to people who are not buying over 2 cwt. of coal at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in trying to get away with that kind of stuff. That kind of thing will not wash.  The people who are the ordinary users of coal and who buy a ton of coal at the time cannot buy that turf, and the Minister knows it, but the Minister will try to put any bluff over on the House.  If the Minister does not know the first thing about turf he would <Col N="1113" /> not say that he was ensuring good quality by insisting on the turf coming through an approved source.  If you want to ensure the supply of good turf, or good anything else, you are going to get it by competition, and in no other way.</P>
      <P>The little boy from Lisanaria or Kilteevan who has been coming into Roscommon after school hours with a load of turf to sell to people in the town, possibly for the purpose of buying a pair of boots for himself, or some little household commodities for his mother, must stay at home now. He must deal with the turf society. We are going to have another situation arising in connection with these approved sources.  There are merchants in the town of Roscommon who have country people working for them in their yards&mdash;maybe a country man who has a young family.  There are farmers who have no bogs of their own but whose workmen have a bog, and they cut 15 or 20 crates of turf which they sell to their employers.  That is the usual thing that happens around our place, and it happens with myself. I buy that turf from him.  He has a sure market, and I give him a good price for it.  Now I must cease doing that because that man does not belong to a co-operative society.  There is only a small bog where he is, and quite a few people in it, and he cannot join a turf society.  Consequently he must cut it.  We cannot do without coal; I must buy my turf from an approved source, because otherwise I cannot get the coal.  This is the kind of legislation the Minister brings in here, and Deputy Davin thinks that it is a good thing in the interests of labour and in the interests of the poor.  It is no such thing.  There may be such a thing as the interests of the Turraun peat people, or the interests of the Turf Development Board.  But in respect of the small man who cuts his own turf, or cuts a supply for a neighbouring farmer or shopkeeper, all the help given him is that he is being crushed, and still Deputy Davin thinks that is a very good policy.</P>

      <P>Then perhaps Deputy Davin would tell us.  I can tell the Deputy that I know what is going on. In Roscommon we have good bogs and good turf, and we have also bad turf and bad bogs.  We are users of coal and turf in Roscommon.  I would like Deputy Davin to inform the House as to what is happening in Leix.  I know what is happening in Roscommon, and I invite the Minister to go down to Roscommon and talk to the people who cut turf there and talk to the people who buy turf.  They would tell him some things he does not know and give him their opinion of this Bill.  If the people are to buy turf only from an approved source, what is the ordinary private turf-cutter to do?  He has the right to hawk his donkey-load of turf around the streets and sell to the poor people who cannot buy any coal.  He cannot sell to the ordinary man in Roscommon who is prepared to buy large quantities of turf for his own use.  That is the sort of thing that Deputy Davin says is good policy.  It is the sort of thing we are opposing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing of which the Minister is desirous is the getting of practical information on the subject.  Is it not quite clear from what has emerged in the course of this debate that the Minister is prepared to crush out the ordinary small producer of turf, the man who cuts turf on his farm as a sideline, brings it in and sells it in the local town?  The Minister says there is no provision in the Bill to prevent that.  Of course, there is not.  There is no necessity for it if you destroy a man's market and prevent him from selling turf in that market.  Our contention is that the whole trend of this Bill&mdash;I will not say that it is the purpose of the Bill&mdash;is to wipe out of existence the ordinary man who cuts turf and sells it in the <Col N="1115" /> country towns.  Everything that has cropped up in the course of this debate only makes that clearer.  It makes equally clear the Minister's complete callousness so far as the welfare of the ordinary turf cutter is concerned. The Minister is prepared to let that man be wiped out, so long as the Turf Development Board can produce the turf.  That is the attitude that the Minister is taking up here.  His only defence is: &ldquo;I have no compulsory power to do that; it is not in the Bill.&rdquo; Remember that a man's market is being wiped out, and his trade is being ruined.  There is no necessity to pile up further legal penalties to deal with such a man and to prevent him from selling his turf.  There is the matter that was mentioned by Deputy Morrissey in connection with the question of the transport of turf.  That shows the discrimination that is being used against the private turf cutter.  The Minister pointed out that there was a flat rate of 6/- on turf when packed into bags.  He did not controvert Deputy Morrissey's statement that more turf could be packed into a wagon if packed in loosely.  There was no reason, therefore, why the railway company should charge only 6/- a ton for turf conveyed in bags, while charging 10/- for turf properly packed into the wagon.  There is no extra charge on the company in any way.</P>

I daresay the Minister is not interested in this <Col N="1116" /> matter of transport of turf.  That is my point, that he is not interested in the case of the small producer.  That is the point I am making.  The Minister in the course of this debate calmly sat down and bore out that point.  He is in favour of wiping out the small producer.</P>

      <P>The Minister still persists in his attitude so far as these small turf producers are concerned. He has got many powers of inspection under this Bill.  There is no reason why he could not allow a coal merchant to purchase turf from the turf cutter.  He says it will involve too <Col N="1117" /> much inspection.  That is the excuse he put forward the last day.  It is quite clear from the explanation he gave, even on a small point like that raised by Deputy Good, that he will have to have inspection at the sale.  If what he is interested in is the quality of the turf it is obvious he can inspect that quality in the merchant's yard quite as efficiently and quite as thoroughly as he can on the bog.  There must be inspection there; otherwise there can be any number of evasions under this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the merchant's business to purchase good turf. As for the Minister, he seems to have no conception of the ordinary methods of trading.  He has passed out of them apparently.  His use of regulations and compulsion has been so much that the ordinary considerations of barter and exchange seem to have passed out of his mind altogether.  It is the business of the coal merchant to purchase turf that will pass inspection, and he can purchase as good turf from other sources as the turf board will give him.  Is that the Minister's only objection&mdash;that he cannot rely on the merchants to purchase proper turf or turf of the required quality?  Is that the principal objection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are no use because they conflict with the whole machinery of the Bill.  The objections the Minister set forth there are based on the idea that there will not be much inspection.  It is quite obvious when you come to the sale of turf by the merchant to the consumer that there will be considerable inspection. Why cannot that inspection be got to cover the quality of the turf? It is quite obvious that the Minister is determined to help his board at the expense of the small producer and <Col N="1118" /> he is doing it deliberately.  Everything he has said confirms the opinion that he is doing it deliberately, or at least in this sense, quite irrespective of the loss he may cause that individual. It is because of the crying injustice in that respect that we protest against these powers and against these provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>That is Deputy O'Sullivan's interpretation and the interpretation of his colleagues in regard to this section, but it is not my understanding of it.  Why does Deputy Morrissey go to the County Clare for his turf?  Why is he prepared to pay more for his turf there and to pay the cost of carriage to his home?  There is one point I would like to emphasise, and it is that the turf society will in future, as they have been doing up to the present, turn out turf of a mixed character, whereas the individual who wants to hold his own in the market will have every right to do so and, so long as he cuts turf of a superior quality, he will always find a better market and will secure a better price than the turf societies who will continue selling turf of a mixed quality.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin and the Minister are quite wrong; the only difference is that the Minister knows he is wrong.  Let Deputy Davin get this into his mind, that the individual who now buys turf from an individual turf seller in the market will no longer be able to do so; the majority of the people who now buy their loads of turf in the market will no longer be able to do so.  They cannot get coal from the coal retailer without buying turf. There are people who burned coal and turf before the Minister ever thought of this Bill.</P>

    <Col N="1121" />
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about it.  There are people who burn turf exclusively but they are comparatively few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But there are people who burn it mainly, and they are very numerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  The point is that a man will not buy a load of turf when he knows that to-morrow or next day he may want to buy half a ton of coal, and that he cannot get it except he buys a certain prescribed amount of turf also.  The Minister knows that.  The difference is this so far as the individual turf-seller is concerned, and Deputy Davin will find that this is the case in his own constituency: Persons selling turf in the market now, either to a coal retailer or to individuals, will find that instead of getting £1 for a ton of turf, as he was in the habit of getting, will be lucky if he gets 10/- for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point that has escaped Deputy Davin's attention is this.  There can be no question as to the accuracy of what Deputy Morrissey stated.  If Deputy Davin did not follow it, he can read it in the Official Report later on.  There is an evil going to arise in connection with this whole matter that is not evident on the face of the Bill, and could not be known to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because he knows nothing about the conditions that prevail in rural Ireland.  Under the law, when the Bill comes into operation, any person who buys coal in a prescribed area must buy turf as well. Now let us say the population of any given town consists of 50 per cent. of people burning nothing but turf, and they are not affected by the Bill at all. 25 per cent. of the remainder burn turf and coal, and they are only affected to the extent that Deputy Morrissey explained.  But these people will be driven from getting their supplies from their ordinary turf supplier and will be forced to buy from the coal retailer under this Bill.  Then you have a further section of the people, persons who heretofore burned nothing but coal.  Their houses are adapted for <Col N="1122" /> the burning of coal, and, as Deputy Dockrell pointed out, unless they put in new grates and ranges they will not be able to burn turf&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point with which the section is concerned is the purchase of turf.  The suitability of the grates for burning does not arise, nor does the question as to people who do not burn turf arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the question as to whether people have proper receptacles for storing or burning turf does not arise on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I direct Deputy Davin's attention to the case of persons who ordinarily burn coal.  For reasons of order we cannot refer to whether they can burn it or not.  When they are forced to buy turf they will go to their neighbours, who do burn turf, and say: &ldquo;I do not want this turf which I had to buy from my coal retailer. Will you take it off my hands?&rdquo;&mdash;The ordinary price of that turf may be 10/- or 8/- a horse creel.  &mdash;&ldquo;I ask you to oblige me by taking it off my hands and clear this turf out of my yard.  If you take it off my hands, I will give it to you for 4/-.&rdquo; That person was obliged to pay to his ordinary coal supplier the price prevailing for whatever turf he was forced to take.  Then, later on, comes along the casual turf <Col N="1123" /> cutter who is in the habit of selling his turf in the town.  He goes to his ordinary customer and asks him, &ldquo;Are you buying any turf to-day?  I have a horse rail which I can sell you now.&rdquo; The customer to whom that turf cutter ordinarily disposed of his creel refuses to pay the price asked, and says, &ldquo;My neighbour, who was forced to buy turf with his coal, has sold it to me for 4/-.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You have in this town that I have instanced 50 per cent. of the people burning turf; 25 per cent. who burn turf and coal, and 25 per cent. who only burn coal.  These latter 25 per cent. are going to become a constant source of supply to their neighbours who otherwise would be supplied by the ordinary small man bringing in turf to the town for sale.  The result will be that these people will be driven out of the market simply for the purpose of subsidising this Bill, because the people who are constrained by the provisions of this Bill to buy turf and coal when they do not want turf, will sell that turf to somebody else at whatever price they can get for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell spoke of people clamping turf on the landings of their flats.  Unless the people affected by this Bill are prepared to build clamps of turf in their back yards they must dispose of the turf somehow, and what can they do but sell it to somebody else who wants it?  Deputy Davin knows that if you are going to a market with a commodity that you must get rid of, you will not get the market price for it because you will find yourself in competition with people who get their turf from the retailers and do not want it.  If a man offers his labour and says he will take whatever wages are offered to him, the effect would be to depress wages all round.  If people are driven to sell turf in the market for whatever other people who do not want it are prepared to sell it to their neighbours, the effect will be to depress the price of turf all round.  If the price of turf is depressed below the price at present prevailing, how can any person expect to make a profit out of selling turf as a side line? <Col N="1124" /> These people will be compelled to cut turf, foot it and spread it for next to nothing, or else they must get out of the business altogether.  They are going to be put out of business and no one will be left in existence but the Turf Board in Dublin.  You will have repeated in this case what has happened several times before, namely, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will take the Minister for Agriculture by the throat, roll him in the mud and tell him that the interest of his Department must go, and that the interest of the Department of Industry and Commerce must prevail; and the country people can do nothing because they have been bamboozled by Deputy Davin and Deputy Victory.</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy deny a single syllable of what I have said? So long as he co-operates with Deputy Victory and others this kind of codology will be palmed off upon the people.  We understand the condition of the people, but the Minister does not know anything about them.  He might be expected not to interfere with those people who have been engaged in the production of turf and who, as Deputy Davin must now realise from what Deputy Morrissey has said, are going to be driven out of the market or out of production of turf instead of getting a better price for it.</P>

With great respect to Deputy Dockrell, I doubt it.  As far as I can see, the conspiracy is against developing anything in the line of native fuel here. I wonder will the Opposition consider that there have been two general elections fought and that the question of self-sufficiency was decided in both cases.  If we are tending towards the point of self-sufficiency in fuel, I do not see why the Opposition should carry on what I call wilful obstruction <Col N="1125" /> this evening, because it is nothing else. We are told about the side-line men and my name has been joined up with them.  Deputy Dillon told us that there were 25 per cent. of the people who do not burn anything but turf; that there were 25 per cent. who burn turf and coal, and that there were 25 per cent. who never burn turf.</P>

I go further and say that they can sell more easily now than heretofore, because if there is a standard article put up of good quality people will go in more for turf, and that is what the Government are trying to do.

      <P>I burn both turf and coal, and every year I buy two ricks of turf.  Can I buy those two ricks in future and also be allowed to buy coal?  The man from whom I buy cuts the turf on his own land and is not a member of any co-operative society, and I give him more than 11/- per ton for the turf.  Will I have to come to a merchant in Dublin from whom I buy coal in future in order to buy the <Col N="1126" /> turf?  I would like the Minister to answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is quite easy to answer.  If the area in which the Deputy resides is made an appointed area, and if a proportion of the turf is fixed which must be purchased when coal is purchased, then the Deputy must buy turf from the coal merchant when buying coal, but only to the fixed proportion.  That is as far as the compulsory powers go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, the turf to be sold must be turf produced by a co-operative society or the Turf Development Board.  The great majority of the turf producers are in these societies. I fail to see how it is possibly going to be detrimental to turf producers to require a greater use of turf in the country.  These people who are pretending to be so concerned about turf producers are the same people who opposed every measure introduced here for the past three years to encourage the use of turf.  They even voted against an Estimate to pay the cost of advertising appeals to people to use turf.  They voted against all those measures which helped the individual turf producers just as much as the co-operative societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies are concerned about the individual turf producers now, very concerned, but they are concerned only because they can shelter behind the individual turf producers in order to obstruct a scheme designed to encourage and increase the use of turf as fuel.  That is their purpose.  The rest of it is merely hypocrisy.  Their sole purpose is to prevent the development of turf&mdash;they have no other aim.  All the arguments they have been using upon the Bill, the tactics they have adopted, obstructive tactics designed to waste Parliamentary time and prevent the Bill passing, have all behind them just this desire&mdash;that they are not going to let the Government get the credit of the big development in turf which will put <Col N="1127" /> a large number of people into employment and a lot of additional money into the bog areas and bring benefit to a large number of families in the country.  They do not want that to happen because it may redound to the political advantage of the Government and, therefore, in their own Party interests they are obstructing the measure and trying to prevent that scheme going through and doing it in the name of the individual turf producers.  It is the worst demonstration of hypocrisy which has been seen in the Dáil for many a day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill I suggested to the Minister that he might give sympathetic consideration to this matter.  My reason for doing so was that the members of the Board of the Cork Street Hospital belong to a section of the people who for about 130 years have been carrying out this class of work, and now that it is proposed to make a change under this Bill, I think it would be a very gracious compliment to the philanthropy and energy and work of this community throughout the whole of that period to insert the words proposed. I think that on the Second Stage of the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary saw no objection to this, and I hope that in the meantime he has given the matter the consideration which in my opinion it deserved, because it is a continuity of long service, and it will appeal to many <Col N="1130" /> who have been identified with the treatment of contagious diseases to know that their work has been appreciated by adding to the name of the new hospital the name of this former hospital.</P>

      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept this amendment proposed by Deputy Doyle. I think when the matter came up on the Second Reading he almost expressed his assent.  In one sense it is merely a sentimental matter, but sentiment has a considerable amount of bearing on human activity, and I think it is only fair that the people who have carried on this charitable work for 130 years or thereabouts, and who maintained an institution of which Dublin had in the past a right to be proud, should have the continuity of their work made clear in the future, so that when we have a new and improved fever hospital as a result of this Bill those who come after us may recognise that it had not a beginning in the year 1936 or the year 1937, but had its beginning more than 100 years ago, and that the activity has been continuous.  The hospital has had a creditable and honourable history, and I am sure that those who remain of the people who maintained it throughout those years will be pleased to find that by some continuity in the title the continuity of the institution is maintained.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary has seen no reason to take a less favourable view of this suggestion than he took when it was made to him earlier.</P>

      <P>Since the Second Reading stage I have very carefully considered this matter, and I am not disposed to accept the amendment.  On full consideration, notwithstanding the case that has been made by Deputies Doyle and Rowlette, there does not appear to be much to be gained by adding &ldquo;House of Recovery&rdquo; to the name of the proposed new institution.  It is a fact that when this institution was first established it was called &ldquo;`House of Recovery and Fever Hospital&rdquo; but at that time and for some considerable <Col N="1131" /> time after the establishment of the institution various other types of illness were treated there.  The activities of the institution were not by any means confined to the treatment of fever.  In later years, following some extensive outbreaks of infectious diseases in the City of Dublin, the institution came to be devoted almost entirely to the treatment of fever cases.  The institution that would be set up under the proposed legislation would be entirely a fever hospital, and would, of course, be recognised by the public as a fever hospital and would be called &ldquo;fever hospital&rdquo; regardless of anything that we may put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there is any great sentiment attached to the name &ldquo;House of Recovery.&rdquo; I discussed this matter in considerable detail with representatives of the existing trustees, and while I suppose it would be accurate to say that they certainly would have no objection to making the alteration proposed, I do not think they felt very strongly on the matter.  If they had felt very strongly on the matter&mdash;there is no great principle involved in it; I am only aiming at some kind of uniformity in the names of such institutions&mdash;I would be disposed to accept the amendment.  We had legislation dealing with the provision of a fever hospital in the City of Cork.  I quite agree, of course, that we were not confronted with a name such as this in the existing institution, but at any rate we called the institution the &ldquo;Cork Fever Hospital.&rdquo; As I said, the proposed institution here will be recognised and known as the &ldquo;Dublin Fever Hospital,&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;House of Recovery&rdquo; in the altered circumstances ceases to have the significance that it had at the time the institution was set up.  I think that in the circumstances Deputy Doyle might not press his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has not seen his way to accept the amendment, because I think he will admit that by the Bill the work of those who devoted such attention to sickness in Dublin for this long period is being cast aside.  In changing the position through this Bill, I do not <Col N="1132" /> see that any effort is made to give any appreciation or pay any tribute whatsoever to the good work which was done during that period.  I do not think the reference to the Cork Hospital is any argument at all against the acceptance of the amendment, and I am sorry that the Minister has not given it the consideration which we had hoped for from his remarks on the Second Stage, because I think that there should be some little compliment paid to those who carried out that class of work which has been done so well during all that period.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, when speaking, said that he did not think there was much to be gained by the insertion of the words proposed in the amendment.  Of course, while there really is not anything to be gained, there is still very much to be preserved, and I think that, on the whole, old associations of this kind, extending back to 130 years, and carrying on the type of activity that those people have carried on, are very well worth preserving after all. Although the institution may be known as the Dublin Fever Hospital in the future, I hope that House of Recovery would not be regarded as a misnomer, and that the Parliamentary Secretary does not think that it would be a misnomer. On the whole, if there is a general desire on the part of people to have this kind of continuity preserved in this particular way, I think there should be no great opposition to it, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to agree to the wishes of those people, and to allow the proposed words to be inserted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 33, to delete all after the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section and in lieu thereof to add the following new sub-section: &ldquo;The hospital board, and their officers, shall, in the performance of their respective duties, observe and carry out any recommendations made to the board by the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2), as it stands, puts the resident medical superintendent in the position that he has got to be responsible to the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin, and also the hospital board. Now, it is quite possible that, if any contentious matter should arise, some difficulty might be created for the resident medical superintendent in dealing with the matter.  I suggest that my amendment would meet the case intended by the Minister in sub-section (2), and I hope that he will see his way to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Doyle in supporting this amendment.  I think that sub-section (2), as it stands in the text of the Bill, might possibly lead to misunderstanding and trouble.  I have not the slightest suspicion that, in connection with the present hospital board and the medical superintendent officer of health of the city as well as the resident medicál superintendent, any difficulty would arise between the respective officers, but one must remember that one would not always have the same persons in the offices now held by these gentlemen, and there is, I think, a possibility of friction arising in the future if the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin has the power to give directions over the head, possibly, of the resident medical superintendent on points which are properly within the discretion of the resident <Col N="1134" /> medical superintendent.  It might quite easily happen that in the future the gentlemen holding these positions might not be on the amicable terms which, I am sure, exist between the present officers, and which, I am sure, will exist for some time.</P>
      <P>However, there is the possibility of friction in connection with other gentlemen in the future, and there is the danger that that might interfere greatly with the working and discipline of the hospital and with the authority of the resident medical superintendent.  If the medical superintendent officer of health of the city were to give orders over the head of the resident medical officer, it might do very great damage.  Now, medical superintendent officers of health should be assumed always to be reasonable people, but one cannot wisely give them powers which might be used unreasonably.  Another important point in the amendment is the suggested substitution of the word &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;directions.&rdquo;  Deputy Doyle's amendment imposes on the board and their officers the duty of carrying out any recommendations made to the board by the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin.  I think that eases the matter considerably.  Although it may be their duty to carry out directions, I think that the spirit in which they carried them out is very important, and for that reason I think the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; is a wiser term. One recognises that a medical superintendent officer of health must have a joint authority over the general management of the hospital, which is largely financed by the City of Dublin, and that he should have a certain authority, but that authority, I suggest, should be exercised by his recommendations to the hospital board in the first place, rather than by direct instructions given to an officer of the hospital without the knowledge of the hospital board.  I think that this is a reasonable amendment, intended to make the working of the hospital easier and to make the hospital more efficient, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, Sir, I cannot accept this amendment.  I think that if this amendment were accepted by the House, it would create an entirely anomalous position.  Under the amendment, the hospital board, and their officers, shall, in the performance of their respective duties, observe and carry out any recommendations made to the board by the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin.  Now, that would mean that the medical superintendent officer of health of the County Borough of Dublin would be in a position to direct the hospital board even in their administrative duties.  He would be absolutely supreme in so far as the carrying out of the duties, even of the hospital board, was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the amendment the officers in the institution would be bound to carry out any directions given by the medical superintendent officer of health.  That is all right as far as it goes, but the difference in the relationship between the medical superintendent officer of health mentioned in the amendment, and the Bill is, that the directions would come through the hospital board, and the hospital board as well as the officials would be there to carry them out.  That would be a difficult and probably in actual practice an impossible position.  I doubt very much if the medical superintendent officer of health of the City of Dublin would undertake such a responsibility. I feel very much inclined to believe that he would not.  I do not anticipate any of the complications that Deputy Rowlette has in mind.  If it would meet the position, and I think it would, to alter the word &ldquo;directions&rdquo; to &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; I will consider it.  Deputy Rowlette appears to think that the word &ldquo;directions&rdquo; is liable to be the cause of friction in the future, and that &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; would be a more acceptable term.  I think I can go that far to meet the Deputy.  It would be undesirable to place the hospital board entirely under the medical superintendent officer of health of Dublin City and to place the board under a statutory obligation to carry out in the performance of their respective <Col N="1136" /> duties any recommendations made by him.  That would be an impossible position, and I am sure Deputy Rowlette realises that.</P>

If there was a difference of opinion between these two authorities where would the resident medical officer be?  That is the objection I see to the section. I am not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment as it stands.  Perhaps he could make some suggestion that would meet the point I raised.</P>

      <P>To insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The resident medical superintendent shall, after the establishment of the new fever hospital, reside therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While the present resident medical superintendent of Cork Street Fever Hospital does not reside in the institution, it is desirable that in the new institution the resident medical superintendent shall do so.  The only reason why the present medical superintendent does not reside there is the fact that there is no accommodation for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, if I were a member of the hospital board, that accommodation should be provided for, the resident medical superintendent, and that ordinarily he should reside in the hospital.  That is desirable.  At the same time, I think it is very undesirable to put such a clause in a statute.  Circumstances may arise in which it might be undesirable that a resident medical superintendent should be compelled to reside in the hospital. There might be difficulty on the part of the hospital authorities in providing the necessary accommodation. Whatever the size of an hospital, there should be accommodation for the resident medical superintendent, and if the authorities desire that the services should be efficiently administered, they should require him to live there and be in close touch with the work.  But it is quite a different <Col N="1138" /> thing to put that into an Act of Parliament which could be altered only by legislation.  It would be almost certain to prove very inconvenient in certain circumstances that might arise. Take the case of Cork Street Hospital. During its whole history the medical superintendent resided there until recently, when accommodation was no longer available.  That might happen in other places where the authorities would be up against the question of finding accommodation, and the work of the hospital might be held up because of the wording of a statute. Again, there might be conditions concerning a resident medical superintendent which would limit the choice of the hospital board in appointing the most efficient superintendent.  It would be undesirable for a resident medical superintendent with a young family to have to bring them to such an institution.  The hospital board might have to choose between such a man and a man with no family, as a result of which a less efficient officer might be appointed because of an obsolete clause in an Act of Parliament. I doubt if the Parliamentary Secretary could find such a clause in any legislation dealing with fever hospitals. It would seem to me to hamper unduly the work of the institution and the choice of the hospital board in the selection of their officers.</P>
      <P>In the very efficient fever hospital in Belfast&mdash;as efficient an hospital as exists &mdash; the medical superintendent resides four miles away, and at the same time performs his duties very efficiently.  In many cases affecting public health work, the medical superintendent may have more than one institution under his control, and these may be situate some distance from each other.  Here it is contemplated that the medical superintendent will live in the fever hospital, but he may also have to superintend a convalescent hospital as well.  Ordinarily, I agree that the medical superintendent should reside in the institution, but it is extremely undesirable and mischievous that such a clause should be inserted in an Act of Parliament, as it might tie the hands of hospital boards in years to come unless other legislation was passed amending it.</P>

      <P>Until I heard the explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary I was inclined to take objection to the amendment.  I assumed that the medical superintendent would reside in the institution, if possible.  It is inadvisable that such a clause should be inserted in the Bill, because, as Deputy Rowlette pointed out, no one knows what circumstances might arise in the future.  I do not think it right to have any clause in the Bill that could not be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be generally admitted in ordinary circumstances that it is desirable that medical superintendents should reside on the hospital premises.  I quite admit that a set of circumstances might exist such as Deputy Rowlette foreshadowed when it might not perhaps, be in the very best interests of the hospital to have the resident medical superintendent compelled to reside there.  But on the point that accommodation does not exist at the present time, or that ample accommodation may not exist in future, I do not think there need be any anxiety at all, as in planning the new institution the necessary steps will be taken to provide adequate accommodation for the resident medical superintendent.  I think that even in the possible case mentioned by Deputy Dr. Rowlette, where the resident medical superintendent might have a family, that point can be covered in planning the institution and in securing that the resident medical superintendent's residence is sufficiently detached from the hospital proper.  I think that if that position is safeguarded, his family will not run any greater risks than they would run if he were living a considerable distance from the institution.  I am quite sure that the amendment could be debated for a considerable time and arguments advanced for and against it, but really the determining factor in my mind when circulating this amendment was to meet the expressed wish of the existing hospital trustees.  They have very definitely expressed the opinion that the resident medical superintendent should reside on the premises. Had it not been for the representations <Col N="1140" /> they made on the question it is quite possible, and likely, that this amendment would not have been circulated. These amendments were all discussed with representatives of the existing trustees and I am more or less committed to them, more or less bound in honour to stand by any understandings we came to in relation to them.</P>

After all, we are doing quite a lot of things by regulations at the present time.  We are providing for a lot of matters by regulation which are much more difficult and much harder, if you like, to relate to what may be termed administration than that particular matter would be.  I think if the Parliamentary Secretary were to meet this by regulation he would still be standing by his word to the people from whom he received these representations and he would be avoiding putting in a statute a provision that is very objectionable in a statute although it may be a very desirable thing to have in operation.  I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary reconsider the proposal to embody this in a statute.  He could provide for it by a regulation of the Department, which could be withdrawn should an occasion arise on which it would not be possible to carry it out.</P>

I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has sufficiently realised the inconvenience of putting detailed matters into a statute.  He recognises, in most of the legislation for which he is responsible, the necessity for doing certain things by regulation.  I suggest that he is putting a very inconvenient clause into the statute by the amendment he is putting forward, unless some such qualifying words as I suggest are added.  I hope he will reconsider the matter and deal with it perhaps at a later stage.</P>

      <P>This is another point I raised with the Minister on the Second Stage in regard to Section 28.  I think it is a recognised rule in the medical profession that one medical officer will not intrude on the work of another.  That is to say, when a patient is being treated by a particular doctor, he should not be interfered with in any way by another doctor that might be called in without consulting the doctor by whom he was first treated.  As the section stands, the medical superintendent of the Borough of Dublin and the county medical officer of health for the County of Dublin shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter any institution for the time being managed and controlled by the hospital board, and to inspect such institutions and to inspect and examine, respectively, the city patients and the county patients.  I think that that should not be done without some consultation with the resident medical superintendent, and I am, therefore, moving that the words &ldquo;after consultation with the resident medical superintendent&rdquo; be inserted at the point indicated.  I think it is a very reasonable suggestion and I have every reason to believe that it is a provision that should be inserted in the Bill. In referring to the matter on the Second Reading of the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary gave an explanation which was far clearer to my mind than is provided by the reading of the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary will find any difficulty in accepting this amendment. It clearly does not limit the power of the medical officer of health in any way.  It makes sure that when he does visit the hospital to inspect and examine the arrangements that he does so in consultation with the resident medical superintendent.  Clearly, to do otherwise would lead to friction and, perhaps, to something even graver&mdash;indiscipline in the hospital. For a patient under the care of the resident medical superintendent from day to day to be examined suddenly by a strange doctor might give rise to the feeling that he was in some way superior to the resident medical superintendent. I expect that the Parliamentary Secretary will not see any difficulty in agreeing to insert the words proposed, which are in line with what he himself has put in in regard to research work.  If he is willing to accept the amendment, I suggest that instead of saying &ldquo;after consultation,&rdquo; the amendment should be altered to read &ldquo;in consultation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The only difference of opinion between Deputies Doyle and Rowlette and myself on this question is based on the reliance that I would be prepared to place on professional etiquette as compared to the reliance that the Deputies are prepared to place on it.  I do not anticipate that friction or complications would arise if the medical officer of health went into the institution to examine patients without consulting the resident medical superintendent.  I am reluctant to admit that this amendment is really necessary.  I have no great objection to it, and if it is strongly felt that such an amendment is necessary I am prepared to accept it.  But as a medical man myself, I would prefer that we should rely on medical etiquette safeguarding the position.  If the amendment is to be accepted, I would prefer the wording proposed by Deputy Doyle to the altered wording suggested by Deputy Rowlette.  In my opinion the phrase &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo; with the resident medical superintendent is not quite the same thing as &ldquo;in consultation with&rdquo; the resident medical superintendent. <Col N="1144" /> Deputy Doyle's amendment contemplates that the medical officer of health would acquaint the resident medical superintendent of his intention to inspect and examine certain patients in the institution, and, presumably, they would discuss the case.  There are times, however, when it might not suit the resident medical superintendent to go around with the medical officer of health in the course of his inspection or examination.  If the amendment were worded &ldquo;in consultation with the resident medical superintendent&rdquo; it would appear to me to be necessary for them to go around together.  Now, I do not think that we need make that a statutory condition.  If we make it a statutory condition that the medical officer of health will first consult with the resident medical superintendent, we might leave it at that, and if we do I think that the point the Deputies have in mind is adequately covered by the amendment proposed by Deputy Doyle.</P>

      <P>Suppose the resident medical superintendent is not present when the county medical officer of health calls to the hospital&mdash;suppose he is ill or away on leave&mdash;would it be necessary to make provision for consultation with his substitute?  The medical officer of health may send in a suspected case of fever to the hospital. The case may not have been perfectly diagnosed in the early stages, and the medical officer of health may desire to inspect the patient in hospital. When he calls the resident medical superintendent may be away for some reason or other.  In a case like that, the efficiency of the medical officer of health may be impaired if he is not able to see a patient during the absence of the resident medical superintendent, and perhaps it would be well to make provision to meet a situation of that kind, should it ever arise.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The hospital board may, without prejudice to the generality of any other powers conferred on it by this Act, do all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in any case where the relatives of any patient, dying in any institution (being a fever hospital or a convalescent home) for the time being managed and controlled by the hospital board, are not known, or by reason of their absence, or poverty or otherwise, are unable <Col N="1146" /> to provide for the burial of such deceased patient, defray all necessary and proper expenses incurred in the burial of such deceased patient;</P>

This amendment has been submitted after consultation with representatives of the existing trustees who had some anxiety about the income from their trust funds.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is a very long and rather involved section, perhaps we might have some short explanation from the Minister as to the meaning of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to have some such powers as the section confers in order to make other provisions of the Bill effective.  The purpose of the section is, I think, obvious.  It is to ensure that if a coal retailer has not purchased from an approved source sufficient turf to enable him to discharge his obligations under the Bill, he can, by Order, be required to purchase under penalty the amount of turf necessary to fulfil his obligations.  It is a section which confers powers which may not have to be utilised, but which are necessary in order to make other provisions of the Bill effective.  Without possession of these powers it would be possible for a coal retailer who wished to do so, successfully to evade, without punishment, other provisions of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill is going to be operated, I have not any objection to any reasonable provision which <Col N="1151" /> will ensure that it will be observed, and that, so to speak, the person who wants to evade it is not going to be put in a privileged position over the retailer who desires to carry out the law, once it is the law.  I should like, however, to draw the Minister's attention to one of the sub-sections which says that the notice served on the retailer shall, until the contrary is proved, be evidence of the several matters of fact stated in it, and a further sub-section says that an error in the statement or notice will not invalidate such notice.  There seems to be something rather loose about that.  The Minister seems to want to have it both ways, and I should like him to deal with that point.</P>
      <P>There is another matter, and perhaps this is the most appropriate place to raise it.  It is, perhaps, a small point, but it is of some importance.  I take it that when the Act comes into operation, credit will be given to retailers for whatever stocks of turf they may have on hand on that date. There will be certain stocks which may not have been acquired from an approved source or from one of the societies, and I take it that full consideration will be given to whatever stocks they may have at a particular time.  As I say, it is perhaps a minor point, but it is important in a sense. I would like the Minister to deal with the other point as to the notice being taken as evidence, and the provision whereby that notice is not to be invalidated by any error in the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) provides that the notice shall be evidence, until the contrary is proved, of the several matters of fact stated in such notice in respect of the quantities of turf obtained by, in the possession of, or sold and delivered, or which ought to have been sold and delivered by such retailer; (b) an error in the statement of all or any of the said matters of fact in such notice shall not invalidate such notice if the quantity of turf which such coal retailer is required by such notice to obtain does not exceed the quantity of turf which he could law fully have been so required to obtain if <Col N="1152" /> all such matters of fact had been correctly stated in such notice.  That is merely a legal provision to see that a mere misstatement of fact does not invalidate the notice if the notice does not require the retailer to do more than he would be required to do if the facts had been properly stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point but this is a completely new departure.  In an ordinary court of law if a summons is found to have been technically wrong, that summons, as far as I know, is thereby invalidated. In this case even though the notice may be wrong it may be taken as evidence. It seems to me that this is very loosely drafted.  One thing that does emerge is this, that even if the notice is wrong on the face of it, it is to be produced as evidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to any coal retailer who desires to evade the obligation under this section to so arrange his books that his deliveries of coal may appear as deliveries of less than 2 cwt.  If a man delivers, say, 10 tons of coal he can have his books so arranged that it will appear he delivered in consignments of not more than 2 cwts.  He does not make any entry of these for under the Act he is not compelled to do so.  How can an inspector check up on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be easily got over.  The powers of this section only arise when, from observations carried out by an inspector, or from the records, it is obvious that somebody is successfully evading the Act.  There would be little difficulty in finding out if the records are faked in the way in which the Deputy suggests.  Faked records have been passed as genuine in the past and probably will in the <Col N="1153" /> future, but it will be possible to check up on these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an exactly analogous system operating on which he will possibly get the Revenue Commissioners to advise him as to the checking of frauds.  The licensing laws require that a wholesale spirit dealer will not send to any spirit dealer a quantity of spirits of less than two gallons in any one consignment.  I think the Revenue Commissioners will tell the Minister for Justice that they have long since abandoned any attempt to enforce that regulation because they know that very small publicans get a half pint or a pint of spirits, not being in a position to provide cash for a larger quantity, and when they draw 16 pints they get the necessary revenue licence.  In the case of this Bill what will be done will be that the retailer will make deliveries of 2 cwts. of coal until&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Somebody whose business will be prejudiced if the fraud is successful will be bound to complain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the man can deliver 1 ton of coal and report that he has delivered ten 2 cwts.  The retailer is not bound to keep a record of every transaction of coal.  If a man pays him for 2 cwts. of coal he puts the money in the cash till.  Let us suppose the man is under suspicion; he is challenged and the inspector says to him: &ldquo;You apparently sold more coal than you ought to have sold for you bought turf from an approved source,&rdquo; and the retailer answers: &ldquo;No, the coal I sold carried with it the requisite quantity of turf, but I did sell a great deal of coal in 2-cwt. lots to small purchasers.&rdquo; There will be no record of these.  The inspector may say: &ldquo;The obligation will be on you in court to prove this,&rdquo; and the retailer will answer, &ldquo;I could not prove it to my own shop assistants.  I could not tell you how much coal I sell in any one day.&rdquo;  There are some people in this country who believe that they have not only a statutory but a moral obligation to obey the law.  Such men will obey the law and the result will be that the person who believes there is a conscientious obligation on him to <Col N="1154" /> obey the law will refuse to break the law and to send out a quantity of coal to a customer without a corresponding quantity of turf.  What will happen in that case?  The customer will say: &ldquo;So and so down the street will do it and will make no difficulty about doing it.&rdquo;  A quarrel will ensue and the man who is trying to obey the law loses a customer.  There is no means of bringing the law breaker to justice because there is no way of proving the case against him.  The end of it is that the man who is trying to evade the law has to choose between losing his trade and obeying the law.  There are limits to the strain that you are entitled to put upon a man's public spirit.  I submit that in dealing with a merchant of whose business the coal trade forms only a part, you are putting too great a strain upon that man in getting him to quarrel with his customers.  That is the position in which you are putting people who are trying to obey the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the Minister's view.  Let us assume that these people have a heavy moral sense of responsibility, and that they report to the inspector another merchant for evading the law&mdash;that such a man is selling coal without the corresponding quantity of turf&mdash;and the inspector goes in and says to that merchant: &ldquo;From information received I believe you are evading the Turf Act.&rdquo; Thereupon the evading merchant makes the defence I have just outlined. He will say: &ldquo;I am not evading the Turf Act; I am supplying turf with every order of coal, except orders which I have received for less than two cwts. of coal.  I have no record of those orders, and nobody in my establishment has any record which would inform me how many cwts. of coal I have actually sent out.  We took cash for those orders, sent them out without question, and I kept no record of them.&rdquo;  He cannot be trapped.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;We will get a few of them.&rdquo;  You may get an odd <Col N="1155" /> one, but the evasion is going to go on generally through the country and it is going to operate to put an entirely unjust burden on the merchants who are trying to keep the law.  It will act in the direction of driving every merchant into evading the law, in so far as his customers are bent on making him do so.  Trading in this country is hard enough as it is, and to carry on trade on scrupulous lines, abiding by every statute passed in this House, is rapidly becoming almost impossible.  I put it to Deputies that they should not pass further legislation which will make it absolutely impossible for the conscientious traders to carry out the obligations this House imposes on them.</P>

When the facts are recited it can be argued: &ldquo;That does not matter; the facts are wrong; we are protected by paragraph (b) of sub-section (4).&rdquo;  Whether the allegations are right or wrong the man can be prosecuted.

      <P>Some of the difficulties that the Minister will be up against in the country in connection with this may be emphasised by what happens here in the City of Dublin.  I have come up against cases which would seem to indicate that the practice is general.  When bell-men go to buy coal from an importer they take the coal and pay their money, but the importer refuses to give them a receipt.  It is a transaction in fact there.  The beginning and the end of it is, that the bell-man takes the ton of coal and pays his money, but there is no record.  I have come across cases which indicate that is a fairly general practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I understand what was possibly at the back of the idea at the time was that they did not want to come under the control of prices, although the Controller of Prices was pretty soft with regard to the price of coal.  I gather from the Minister that approved societies are going to complain that such and such a merchant appears not to be carrying out the statutory duty of buying the necessary quantity of turf, and then there is to be an inspection of that merchant's records.

In connection with such a prosecution&mdash;a prosecution for failure to act on a statutory notice issued in accordance with earlier provisions&mdash; sub-section 4 (b) provides that the notice will not be invalidated merely by reason of the fact that some of the statements in the notice are erroneous.

      <P>Will the Minister explain a point raised on Second Reading?  He said then it did not matter.  I am taking the case now of the merchant who sells to the bellman.  This section is what I might call the bellman's section. The coal merchant who sells to him must buy turf.  Is he a turf merchant at present?  He must become a turf merchant for that purpose.  Supposing there is an intermediate man down the country who sells coal to people to dispose of it in small quantities.  He has to buy turf which he cannot dispose of compulsorily.  He will have to dispose of it somehow.  I think there is a great deal in the point raised on Second Reading by Deputy Belton, I think, and to-day by Deputy Dillon.  He now enters into competition, because he has stuff that, in the ordinary way, does not belong to his business and he will sell it at a sacrifice if necessary, thereby interfering with the market of the ordinary turf retailer, so long as he is left in existence at all after this Bill.  You are compelling a man to buy turf and you are not giving him any compulsory power to dispose of it.  Is not that the position so far as this man is concerned?  That seems, at first blush at all events, an extraordinary provision which would seem to require a little more justification than the Minister gave in his reply on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>It would be difficult on the Deputy's description to say whether those people whom he describes are coal retailers or sub-retailers.  I put it this way.  I have no desire whatever to put this obligation upon the bellmen.  I represent a City of Dublin constituency and, for many reasons, I would prefer to avoid having to enact that obligation; not that I think it is going to be any great inconvenience to them, but obviously such a provision as this is necessary.  We must put the obligation upon sub-retailers to purchase turf from the retailer, otherwise any coal retailer will just resell all the coal he purchases to his son or brother or neighbour, and the whole of the provisions of the Act are nullified.  If we do not put in a provision that a sub-retailer purchasing coal from a retailer must purchase the appropriate quantity of turf, then there is an obvious way of evading the obligation. Therefore, to make the Act effective there must be a provision like this.  The only objection there could be to this provision is that it might impose some difficulty on the bell-men who hawk coal for sale in small quantities.</P>

      <P>It will not, because turf is sold by them as well as coal. The hawking of turf is a common feature.  They sell turf in small quantities, frequently by the sod. As they are the same people who sell coal in small quantities, they will have very little difficulty in disposing of whatever quantity of turf they will be required to take as well as the coal.  It will be a comparatively small quantity, certainly for some time to come in the cities, if the Act is in fact applied in the cities, which is not very probable in the immediate future.  My answer to the arguments put up is that obviously some such provision must be there.  The Act could be made completely inoperative by a simple device in the coal retailers' office, if that obligation were not put upon sub-retailers.</P>

      <P>That is the most extraordinary statement I have heard <Col N="1164" /> for a long time.  The Minister said that turf is hawked in Dublin at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many bellmen hawk turf? Does the Minister realise that, under this section, he is going to compel every bellman in Dublin, and other cities and towns, to hawk turf?  He is overlooking this fact, that so far as bellmen are concerned, and I think this applies to the vast majority of them, their total storage capacity is the length and breadth of their cart.  Will the Minister tell us where they are going to store this turf?  Turf is hawked in Dublin and is sold by the sod, but for what purpose?  Merely for the starting of the fire in the morning.  It is used as a sort of fire lighter and not for any other purpose.  It seems to me that this is the most absurd and most unworkable section of the whole lot.  You are going to compel every bellman, it does not matter whether he has a converted perambulator, or an ass's or pony's cart, to take a certain amount of turf.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that I have any great knowledge of Dublin City beyond what I can observe in the ordinary way.  We have all seen these bellmen on their rounds in the city and we know that their carts are small.  At the very utmost, they may have a couple of cwts. of coal as well as the scales on the cart, and there is no room on it for turf. It would be no use for them to cart it round anyway, because they could not sell it.  There is no obligation on those to whom they sell the coal to purchase it.  But, in order to get the coal, these bellmen must also buy turf.  Will the Minister tell us how these people are going to dispose of the turf he will compel them to purchase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on the Minister, as he is compelling these men to purchase turf, to satisfy the House that he is not <Col N="1165" /> going to penalise them.  I suggest that he is going to penalise them. He said that if this section were not inserted the whole Bill could be evaded, but he has not explained how.  I should like to hear him explain how it could be evaded.  You have two operations under this Bill, one under Section 13, I think it is, and the other under Section 19.  One relates to quantities of coal over 2 cwts., and the other to quantities under 2 cwts.  The position is quite clear that any person engaged in the coal trade, with the exception of bellmen, you might say, can sell any quantity of coal from I stone up to 2 cwts., without any obligation so far as turf is concerned. The bellmen cannot do that.  There is no obligation on the larger coal merchant or the larger retailer to purchase or sell turf in respect of any quantity of coal up to 2 cwts. But the bellman, who has no storage capacity whatever, cannot buy coal from one of the coal yards in the city, or any other city, without taking a certain quantity of turf as well.  It seems to me that that is not only absurd but unjust and unfair.  In my opinion, it is going to put a terrible burden on people who already have enough to do to eke out a living in the rather miserable way they have of doing it.</P>

      <P>Why will it not if they have no storage place for the turf?  Take the case referred to by Deputy Curran in the country districts where you have a particular place in which no turf is used.  My own county is not one of those, but I understand that there are places in which no turf is used.  If coal is to be bought by anybody in greater quantity than 2 cwts., turf must be bought with it. Will not the enforcement of that provision be sufficient to secure that all <Col N="1166" /> the way up along the line the requisite quantity of turf will be bought?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if this section were not here that would undoubtedly be the position in practice.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the sub-retailer who disposes of his coal in quantities of 2 cwts. and less.  He is saddled with a quantity of turf and he must dispose of it.  If he disposes of half a ton of coal to me without giving me any turf the Minister will say that he is left with turf which he would have to dispose of.  But his whole business lets him in for that. The Minister insists that he shall become a turf merchant as well as a coal merchant.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I say we may expect to find anything in the Bill when we find that in it.  When we do find those things, let us be straight about them.  The Minister says that to force bellmen in the City of Dublin to buy turf with their coal is not going to be any great inconvenience to them.  I want the Minister to picture a bellman going off in the morning to get his supply of coal down at the importer's. He draws his supply of coal; he pays for it.  Not only has he to get a supply of coal, which is usually limited by the size of cart, but he has to take the turf on the cart with the coal.  The Minister says that is going to be no inconvenience.  The bellman travels through an area like Dominick Street, selling his coal, and his turf if he can. The Minister says bellmen sell turf at the present time, but I should like to know if the Minister has investigated the case of any single bellman in the City of Dublin who sells turf, and considered the quantity of turf that he sells in relation to the quantity of coal that he sells.  The Minister will probably find that those of them who do sell turf are people who have small shops as well, and that they sell the turf at the shops in the way which Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has referred to.  At any rate, he starts off in the morning, taking his coal and taking his turf.  He disposes of his coal, and is left in the evening with his turf.  He has no place to take the turf except to his home.  He starts off again next morning, and his space for coal is limited.  He takes less coal than in the past, and he takes his turf as well.</P>

      <P>Section 20, Sir, provides for the purchase of land to be afterwards taken over and paid for by the board.  The section implies that the board has some capital and some income.  I should like to hear from the Minister what exactly the board's income is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board's income at the moment consists almost entirely of grants-in-aid voted by the Dáil, and any purchases which the board might make under the provisions of this section would be provided for out of the Dáil Vote.  It is desirable to have this power, as the board will require to purchase land for the various purposes mentioned.  As the Deputy is aware, when the State or anybody acting for the State seeks to do that, the price immediately jumps very high unless there is compulsory power in the background.  It would, of course, be better to acquire it by agreement, if possible.</P>

There were a few words about that on Section 19. A definite definition is applied to retailers, but there is no such definition of sub-retailers.  A bellman is a retailer.  The Bill says: &ldquo;the expression `coal retailer' means a person who carries on the business of selling coal by retail.&rdquo;</P>

It might not then be possible to have all the sales entered up that night, while an inspector of the Gárda Síochána might be in on Monday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section 3 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every record kept in pursuance of this section may be inspected at any time during office hours by an inspector or by an officer of the board authorised for the purpose by the Minister in writing or by a member of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Sub-section 5 also says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) inspection of a record or document shall include taking copies thereof or making extracts therefrom; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all sure that that is desirable. It may conceivably be open to a certain amount of abuse.  An inspector or officer does not require any authori- <Col N="1175" /> sation from a superintendent to inspect the records, and he may take copies of all invoices kept by retailers.  The wording of the sub-section is open to a certain amount of abuse, as any inspector, officer, or member of the Gárda Síochána could walk into a coal retailer's and take copies of papers dealing with his business and, so far as we know, might make any use he liked of them; perhaps communicate them to other persons in the trade.  I do not say that that is likely to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event a member of the Gárda Síochána would belong to a disciplined force and would act under the authority of officers.  I may consider the question of requiring the Gárda Síochána to be authorised to perform this duty.  In any event a member of the Gárda who did it on his own would be liable to disciplinary action within the force.  I think it would be no harm in the circumstances to have a member of the Gárda Síochána authorised to perform this duty by some officer in the force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned we have to go by the wording of the section, which says: &ldquo;a member of the Gárda Síochána,&rdquo; while there is nothing about authorisation. While I do not suggest this would be abused by the Gárda Síochána, it is quite possible that it could be abused without being detected.  The wording is rather loose, and I should like if the Minister would reconsider it.</P>

In the immediate future it is not contemplated that any drastic enforcement of the Act will be necessary, and consequently the amount of inspection required will not be very extensive, but as the Act is enforced over wider areas, and as the regulations are made more rigid over particular areas, the degree of inspection will increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the fourth Telephone Capital Bill since the establishment of the Saorstát. Funds for development of the telephone service, as distinct from its operation and maintenance, are provided by Telephone Capital Acts. These Acts authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund such sums, not exceeding a stipulated amount, as may be required for development of the telephone system in accordance with estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.  The funds so provided are repaid by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 20 years. Funds so far provided under Telephone Capital Acts amount to £1,250,000&mdash;£500,000 by the Act of 1924, £500,000 by the Act of 1927 and £250,000 by the Act of 1931.  The amount asked for in the present Bill is £500,000 which, together with £43,000 unexpended out of the moneys provided for under the 1931 Act, will probably suffice for the next four to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds provided by Telephone Capital Acts represent an investment by the State in the telephone service as a business.  In 1922, when control was first taken over, the capital investment in the service was about <Col N="1177" /> £750,000.  It is now nearly £2,000,000. The cost of the service has risen from £275,750 in 1922-23 to approximately £382,000 in 1935-36.  Revenue has increased in the same period from £229,736 to £487,100.  In 1922-23 there was a loss on the service of £46,014. It continued to be unremunerative up to 1931-32, when the turning-point came, and since then there has been a progressive yearly profit.  The profit for the year 1934-35 was £78,067, and it is expected that the closing accounts for 1935-36 will show an increase on this.  The financial effect of the reductions in charges, which will become operative on the 1st July next, remains to be seen.  At the outset they are estimated to cost, approximately, £56,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary in connection with this Bill to refer in any detail to the very undeveloped and deteriorated condition of the service at its transfer in 1922 or to the various steps which were necessary in subsequent years to bring it to a reasonable state of expansion and efficiency.  These matters have already been very fully dealt with in connection with previous Telephone Capital Acts&mdash;suffice to state that as compared with 1922 the number of telephone exchanges is now 769, an increase of 577.  There are 1,503 call offices, including 81 kiosks, an increase of 918.  The number of subscribers is now 23,106, an increase of 11,391; and there are 35,962 telephone stations, an increase of 16,744.  There are 15,885 miles of trunk line, as compared with 6,603, and 108,769 miles of underground single wire, as compared with 27,141.</P>
    <P>Of the capital funds provided so far for development, about £120,000 has been spent on the establishment of automatic exchanges in Dublin; £296,000 on providing subscribers' circuits; £476,000 on local line underground systems; £100,000 on new manual exchanges and call offices, and £107,000 on trunk lines.  These are the main items.</P>
    <P>One of the most important improvements carried out in recent years was the introduction of automatic working in the Dublin area.  A start with automatics was made with the establishment of the Merrion Street and Ship Street <Col N="1178" /> Exchanges, and early this year the Rathmines and Terenure Exchanges were converted to automatic working. Of the 11,200 subscribers in Dublin City and suburbs, 9,300 are now served by automatics.  Future plans in this connection include a large automatic exchange at Crown Alley, which will, it is hoped, be completed early next year. The whole of the Greater Dublin area will ultimately be brought within the automatic system but existing manual exchanges will be maintained so long as they are capable of giving satisfactory service.  It will, however, be necessary within the next couple of years to provide a new automatic exchange at Dun Laoghaire and also to relieve the position at Drumcondra; but whether in the latter case there should be an entirely new exchange or whether the subscribers should be served instead from Crown Alley has yet to be determined.</P>
    <P>A new exchange at Cork will also probably be necessary within the next three or four years.  A decision as to the type of plant to be installed has not yet been taken.</P>
    <P>Our telephone capital programme for the current financial year originally contemplated an expenditure of approximately £114,000.  To meet the increase of trunk traffic expected to follow on the reduction of the trunk-call charges in July next and the additional demands for subscribers' installations induced by the reduction of rentals and the extension of the free mileage area from one to three miles, a considerable expansion of the programme will be necessary and a supplementary programme has been drawn up the cost of which, together with that originally proposed, will amount for the present year to a total of £176,900. Of this, approximately £70,000 will be in respect of new trunk lines and equipment and will cover the provision of additional circuits of the highest efficiency on the Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Sligo-Claremorris routes; also between Dublin and Waterford, Dublin and Drogheda, Clonmel-Waterford, Dublin-Port Laoighise, Cork-Bantry, Athlone-Galway, and in the Ennis, Nenagh, Roscommon, Cavan and various other areas.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the <Col N="1179" /> considerable augmentation of the general telephone network which will be necessary will impose a heavy strain upon our engineering branch and this, coupled with possible delays in obtaining new plant from manufacturers (who, by the way, are very much pressed at present) may mean that for some little time after the 1st July a certain amount of congestion on some of the longer distance circuits may be unavoidable; also some delay in providing service for new subscribers where any substantial pole route construction is involved.  The Department is, however, making every effort to secure the necessary additional equipment and, by the taking on of extra staff, to meet all demands as quickly as possible.  I trust that where unavoidable delay does occur the public will endeavour to realise the difficulties and for a time, at any rate, refrain from unduly urging their requirements.</P>
    <P>It is probable that a particularly marked increase of traffic will materialise on the cross-Channel circuits, the charges for cross-Channel calls being substantially reduced.  We are discussing with the British Post Office the possibility of securing some additional direct circuits via Belfast, or, in the event of there being difficulty in this respect, of the laying of another direct cable from Dublin.</P>
    <P>The telephone system now extends to all the towns and the great majority of villages throughout the Saorstát, and I think the Department is entitled to claim that it is on the whole a very satisfactory service.  With the forthcoming reductions, charges all round will be particularly reasonable.  As regards the few remote areas and the smaller villages which are without service owing to the heavy cost which its provision would involve and the negligible traffic which would arise, the solution must lie in some form  rural automatics.  Experiments are proceeding but a decision in the immediate future is not likely.</P>
    <P>I am considering at present whether in connection with the reduction of rates after 7 p.m. some extension of the existing attendance at exchanges which now close down at 8 p.m. may <Col N="1180" /> not be feasible.  I am hopeful that in the case of all head post offices and other major exchanges it may be feasible to afford attendance up to 9 or 10 p.m. so as to give the public the benefit of two or three hours' service at the night tariff.  I may add that continuous attendance at all exchanges is out of the question.  The cost would be prohibitive and would be out of all proportion to the &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; traffic.  The question is one which must also depend for its solution upon the development of country automatics.</P>
    <P>The rate of capital expenditure for the past five years has been approximately £55,000 per annum.  This rate will naturally be increased by the ordinary growth of the service, but there will be a particular rise in expenditure during the next couple of years by reason of the special measures being taken to increase equipment.  As already stated, however, the £500,000 now being asked for will, it is expected, suffice for the next four or five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us what, approximately, is the life of the plant which he proposes to use the additional £500,000 on?  I do not know whether the Minister has had many expressions of appreciation of the improvement that has been brought about in the City of Dublin as a result of the introduction of the automatic telephone, but I think the Department deserves to get an expression of thanks for the rapid extension that has taken place and for the efficiency with which the automatic system is working.  I am quite sure that quite a large number of people in the commercial life of the country will be grateful to hear that something is being done to improve the telephone service between this country and Great Britain, in spite of the fact that the war still goes on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Mulcahy in what he has said about the telephone service, which is now a really up-to-date service. I agree that the Minister is endeavouring to give us a really efficient service.  I suppose he realises <Col N="1181" /> the decay that is taking place in connection with the telegraph service. That is largely due to the fact that the occasion for sending telegrams usually arises at night, on bank holidays and on Sundays, and because of that people find that the real solution for communicating over large areas of the country is to be found by availing of the telephone service.  I think that the Minister is going the right way with regard to the extensions that he is carrying out in that system.  There is just one matter that I would like to put before him.  I think there are far too many overhead wires and too few underground wires.  After a heavy storm, and in the winter after a heavy snowfall, we usually get the information that the wires are down all over the South and West, and, possibly, in the North.  I would urge on the Minister that, as far as possible, he should make an attempt to put a large part of the main-line service underground.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the question of cross-Channel calls.  I think it is correct to say that at the present time you cannot get a call through during the middle of the day under an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That may happen occasionally, but that is not the general experience of the Department.  The Department has not received any complaints from people who are constantly making these cross-Channel calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the delay that takes place is far too long.  I can tell the Minister that wires are frequently received from people on the other side naming an hour at which they will ring you up. That would not happen if you knew that you could get your call through in a reasonable time.  If the Minister makes inquiries he will find that if what I say is not absolutely correct at any rate there is far too little service for what business is offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question with which I should like the Minister to deal when replying.  On the other side enormous reductions have been made in the cost of telephone calls during the after-hour period.  I do not know whether or not <Col N="1182" /> that has resulted in the telephones on the other side reaping the benefit of calls to subscribers on this side.  If you can ring up from the other side of the water for half what is charged to ring up from here, I suppose the Minister will understand that more calls will come from the other side. I do not know whether, by reducing the cost to the subscribers or the person making the call, to something commensurate with what it is on the other side, the Minister would not reap an increased revenue.  Of course these questions require to be gone into very carefully, and I sympathise with the Minister's statement that they could not maintain an all-night service right through the telephone exchanges. The Minister and his Department are doing their very best, and I think that it would be ungracious not to acknowledge that on behalf of the business community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>While the city members are throwing bouquets at the Minister, I think that some of the country Deputies should say a word or two in regard to what the Minister proposes to do.  Personally, I would congratulate him on taking courage to deal with the telephone service in the country. Hitherto, it has been a luxury service in the country.  The rental of a telephone would be beyond the means of any ordinary country person.  With what has been visualised as starting from the 1st July, the rental, if what I have been told is correct, will be brought within reasonable limits.  The telephone service, so far as the ordinary country person is concerned, has really not been within practical range.  Of course, one can go to the telephone exchange but the telephones in country houses are few and far between.  That the Department is seeking to remedy that shows that the Minister and those behind him have some enterprise, and country people will appreciate this little service which it is proposed to give.  Now that we have turned from controversial matters, perhaps I might say that the telephone&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy will agree with me in this.  I am sure&mdash;will come in handy now that we have to order coal in 2-cwt. lots.</P>

      <P>That would make £3,000,000, but, perhaps, the figure of £1,250,000 mentioned by the Minister is the sum of the three items which he read out.</P>

      <P>That explains the difficulty I had.  The Minister mentioned £2,000,000 as the capital value afterwards.  I thought that these were four separate sums but the £1,250,000 represented the total of the others.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether any further reduction could be made, especially for long-distance trunk calls.  These present a difficulty at present.  I am sure that, if the Minister reduced the charge, he would get five or six times the number of calls which are obtained at present.  Take the case of a constituency like mine.  It is rather expensive to phone up that constituency from Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the chorus of congratulation to the Minister on having shown some signs of enterprise.  I do not know that I would go so far as Deputy Dockrell went and call him up-to-date, because we have been clamouring for such improvements as these year after year. It seems to me that this country is lagging behind the rest of the world as regards the telephone.  The particular point I want to urge on the Minister is, as I suggested in former years on his Estimate, that more might be done to make the country telephone-minded. If he wants to make these new plans of his a success, I cannot help thinking that a great deal more could be done than has been done by way of a publicity campaign and by circularising people in country districts who are likely to become telephone-subscribers. If you ask some people why they have not got a telephone in their houses, the reply is: &ldquo;What is the good of having a telephone when so few other people have telephones?  The people I should want to talk to are without telephones.&rdquo;  If once you could get a regular movement towards the telephone, it might quickly assume very large proportions.  I cannot help feeling that the Department has been sluggish in this matter of  the claims of the telephone and pointing out its value, especially in the country districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to know if anything could be done to make the lines better in the country districts.  If you are talking from London to Dublin, my experience is that you can hear better than if you are talking to some country town in the Irish Free State.  Whereas you can hear London extremely well from Dublin, if you try to talk to London from some country town in the Irish Free State or from some country house in the Irish Free State, communication becomes very difficult, indeed.  I do not know whether it is the lines or the instruments that are bad.  I am completely ignorant of these technical matters.  But I feel that some part of the equipment must be at fault or it would be easier to have clear conversations by telephone from country parts.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is going to make an <Col N="1185" /> effort to extend the hours, and I hope he will not weaken on that.  It may be that 9 o'clock is as far as he can afford to go until the country does become more telephone-minded.  At any rate, I hope and pray he will extend, everywhere he possibly can, the hours from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock.  It is often after dark that the telephone becomes of greatest value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the point made by Deputy MacDermot, I represent the same constituency as he, and naturally I am as anxious as he or any other Deputy to improve telephone facilities in the country, but, as he knows, the country is not telephone-minded enough to warrant it.  It would certainly be a very costly thing to provide all these improvements. An all-night service would be almost impossible, and, after 9 or 10 o'clock, we think there would be very few calls, except emergency calls, and it is even questionable whether we would get many such calls after 10 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot to mention Sundays.  What about an extended service on Sundays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We can consider what can be done in that respect.  We hope that, as a result of the experiments and investigations being made, it will be possible in years to come to have some of these rural automatic telephones which will make it much easier to communicate with the whole country than it is at present, but we cannot do much better than we have done at the moment.  I think that when the figures for telephone charges which will come into operation in July next are examined, it will be found that they compare very favourably with charges in England.  I think they are pretty much the same, and, on that ground at least, there cannot be much complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has always been asking us to have a publicity campaign, but there are difficulties in that respect.  There has been a great increase in the number of telephone subscribers in certain areas, and that means a lot of additional plant.  If we <Col N="1186" /> had the suggested publicity campaign, we feel that it is in those areas which are what we might call saturated. where the plant cannot carry any more, we would get most of the demand. Deputies will understand that we must make provision for the added calls we expect we will get.  That is why I ask Deputies not to be too unreasonable in their complaints of delays for a few months after the new charges come into operation, because we do expect that there may be a rush in Dublin, and possibly in other parts of the country.  We are doing all we possibly can to meet that, but there may be difficulty in getting all the equipment we require in a reasonably short time.  The Department has already been warned that there will be difficulty in getting all we want, because the countries which make this equipment are engaged on other work. We found that when we tried to get our stuff delivered.  We found that in some cases it would take 12 months to get what ordinarily would be delivered in not more than three months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Germany, Sweden, and even Britain.  We believe that the delay in getting equipment is due to preparations for trouble or something of that kind which are being made in these countries.  At any rate, they are engaged on other work, and we find that we cannot get stuff as soon as we order it, and I want Deputies to bear that in mind.  We cannot simply say: &ldquo;Send us over so many gross of these things right away.&rdquo;  There will be some delay, and it is due to the initiative of the staff, and to the influence which they have with certain firms in England, that we are able to get stuff which otherwise it would not be possible to get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing, anyway. We will know where we are when we have a pact.  It will not be all the one way as it was before.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked for a further reduction <Col N="1187" /> of charges, but I am sure he does not expect that we can reduce further than we propose to reduce for the coming year.  I hope that when we have got this new scale of charges in operation, and when it pays, as I am quite certain it will, there may be further reductions.  I probably will not be in the Post Office then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be anyone on that side either, but, whoever it is, he will have very good grounds for asking the Government to spend more money on the further development of the telephone, because I am perfectly certain that this venture on which we have embarked is going to justify itself in a very short time.  There will, however, be a little delay, as I say, until we get things working.  With regard to cross-Channel reception, the difficulty, I think, is due to the fact that the wires in England are, in the main, underground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not due to the fact that the wires are overhead here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To Holyhead they are submarine cables, and are underground to some extent in England, while here, of course, most of our wires are overhead. The cost of putting them underground is very high, and, while everyone will admit that it is desirable to have them underground, the cost is very high, and I do not think there is any chance of our facing that cost until we have served all the districts in the county and tried to cover every area, even those areas which are uneconomic.  To put the wires underground would cost an enormous sum of money, and I think it is far better to take the chance of an occasional <Col N="1188" /> break-down when you have a storm, and serve all the country, rather than to spend a lot of money in putting the cables underground and allowing other parts of the country to wait for the telephone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to any extent.  You may practically say that there are none.  Everyone can see the desirability of having them underground, but the cost is what has to be considered. I do not think there is any more I need say.</P>
