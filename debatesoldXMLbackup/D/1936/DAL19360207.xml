      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been called to a statement that persons who are registered in the current University register of electors should take steps to transfer their representation to the local constituency registers, in anticipation of the passing of the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill, and whether the statement is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Seán T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be some misapprehension as to the position of University electors if and when the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>Amendments in the Constitution such as this are declaratory in form and do not contain the changes in statute law which are necessary to give effect to the amendment. Accordingly, the passing into law of this Bill will automatically require the passing or a Bill to make consequential amendments in the Electoral Acts, and also a transitory provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transitory provision which will be submitted to the House will be found to obviate the necessity on the part of University electors to take any steps to transfer their registration from the University constituency to the local constituency.  This Bill to amend the Constitution comes into operation immediately upon the dissolution of the Oireachtas occurring after the passing of the Act, and if any University Deputy ceased to be a Deputy before the dissolution a <Col N="368" /> by-election might be held.  It will, therefore, be necessary to maintain the University registers for the purposes of a potential by-election.  There is a constitutional limit of time within which a general election must be held, but no fixed date as in the case of local government elections, and any statutory provisions with respect to elections to Dáil Eireann must of necessity be framed on the assumption that an election may be held at any time during the statutory period fixed in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>So far as the registers in force up to 31st May, 1937, are concerned, it will not be practicable to note those persons who are University electors and who will have a local constituency claim to vote at a general election, and the best solution appears to be to arrange to have the University lists extracted and make special provision for voting.  On and after the 1st June, 1937, electors who are University electors can be specially noted in the local registers so that they cannot vote in respect of that entry at a by-election which may happen before the general election, but will be able to vote at a polling booth in the ordinary way at the next general election and at any subsequent by-election.</P>
    <P>It will be a difficult task to correlate the University register with the local registers, as I understand that the University registration officers are not always informed of the changes in residence of University electors. It would materially assist everyone who is in any way concerned with the work of keeping these registers concurrent for an indefinite period, if every University elector would report to the University registration officer his or her address on the 15th November, 1935, and also his or her address on the 15th November next if he has changed his residence.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, however, the best way to safeguard votes on the University register, in case of transfer to the local register, is that persons who have been on the University register in the past would see, when the register is being made up now, that their names are put <Col N="369" /> upon the new register&mdash;that is, the register that is now being made up and that will come into force on 1st June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think that is correct.  I think the simplest and best way would be to see that their names are on the University register, and, when the University register is completed, after this present register that is being made is completed&mdash;the one that will come into operation on 1st June&mdash;the Department of Local Government, with the various registration officers, will endeavour to secure that every person who is on the University register will be transferred to their proper place on the general register for the register that is now being prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what the Minister is now doing is that he is giving an undertaking to University graduates that, if they report their present address to the University registrar, he will see that after the 1st June next, even though they do not appear upon the local register, they will not be precluded from voting at a general election after the 1st June next?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort will be made by the Department, in consultation and in co-operation with the local registration officers, to see that every University graduate registered on the University register will have his name transferred to its proper place in the local register for the new register that will come into operation on the 1st June, 1937.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, will admit that his statement is about as clear as mud.  The position as we can understand it is this: until a general election takes place this University register must be maintained. Therefore, it cannot go out of existence unless and until a <Col N="370" /> general election takes place.  It remains until that moment.</P>

      <P>I think the statements that I read and made would be understandable by the ordinary intelligence, but I cannot undertake to make them understandable to the drab mediocrity that Deputy McGilligan told us the other night is a common thing in those who are elected for ordinary constituencies.  Deputy Cosgrave can take that to himself if he thinks it fits.  Those who are on the University register now will be kept on, I presume, if they so wish by the University registrars in both cases.  If they are marked as University voters they will be on that register, and will have no power to vote until this law comes into operation.</P>

      <P>It has not, but the Dáil yesterday passed Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill.  I am taking it that that measure will be passed into law.  When that comes into operation the Department of Local Government, with the co-operation and assistance of all the registrars responsible for the compilation of the local registers, will do everything possible to ensure that those who are on the University registers will have their names transferred and put into the new register that will come into operation in June, 1937.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2.  After the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in line 38 the words &ldquo;or to some other person nominated by such employer&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>The definition of outworker in Section 2 of the Bill was, it was through, such as to permit of the possibility of the obligations on employers under the measure in respect of outworkers to be evaded by bringing workers outside this definition through an arrangement under which the work done by the outworker would be delivered not to the employer but direct to the customer or some other person and, consequently, the insertion of these words was suggested in order to prevent such a possibility of evasion arising.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;applied&rdquo; in line 30 the words &ldquo;in their entirety&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> This amendment was carried on a division by the Seanad on the motion of a Labour Party Senator.  I think that there is a misunderstanding in certain quarters as to the effect of it. Labour representatives in the Dáil and Seanad expressed some concern about the provisions of Section 4, which gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to grant exemption from the Act where the amount of industrial work done in the carrying on of an undertaking is so small that the provisions of the Act could not be conveniently applied.  There was evidence of a desire to limit the circumstances under which that power could be exercised.  The amendment, however, in my opinion creates the possibility of the power being exercised much more frequently than would be the case if the amendment were not there.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of the Act cannot be conveniently applied in relation to a particular establishment, subject to whatever regulations or exclusions under another part of the Act may be made, then this exemption can be granted.  But if it is found that the obligations of the Act can be applied in their entirety, then different considerations arise and it is quite possible that the result of the insertion of the amendment would be that the powers under Section 4 would be exercised more frequently.  I think the amendment was really due to a misunderstanding.  It seems to me to be directly contrary to the interests of Labour and that it is also at variance with the attitude taken up by members of the Labour Party in the Dáil and Seanad on the general provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 35 the following words inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;Other than the provisions relating to annual leave, the minimum age for the employment of young persons, the employment of outworkers, <Col N="375" /> employment on Sundays and public holidays, the registration of wages agreements and the provisions relating to penalties for offences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This again relates to Section 4, and in my opinion if it were inserted it would make Section 4 inoperative entirely.  If there is necessity to have power to grant this exemption licence in the case of an undertaking where the amount of industrial work done is so small that the provisions of the Act cannot be conveniently applied, then the exemption must be complete. It would be impracticable to provide that certain and only certain provisions of the Act should apply.  If it is practicable to operate the provisions of the Act which are named in the amendment in respect of such undertakings, then it is possible to operate other provisions of the Act also.  The circumstances under which I contemplate that such a licence will be issued will be where only one or, at most, two workers out of a large number will be employed upon work that might be held to be industrial, but which is really carried on for the purpose of a commercial undertaking. In such circumstances it is not merely administratively more convenient, but it is also desirable from other points of view that the workers concerned should be really treated as commercial workers.</P>
    <P>I informed the Seanad that it was my intention to introduce proposals for legislation to provide for the regulation of the conditions of employment in trading establishments similar in principle to those provided by this measure in relation to industrial establishments.  It would be a very undesirable situation if we had in an establishment of that kind one worker whose conditions of employment were subject to regulation under this Act and all the remaining workers subject to regulation in respect of conditions of employment under another code. There is, I think, no ground for the apprehensions which have been expressed that this power may be used generally.  I think it will be used very rarely indeed, and then only where it is obviously desirable in the <Col N="376" /> interests of the workers concerned as well as in the interests of the administration of the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the acceptance of this amendment would be likely to result in the creation of the numerous difficulties the Minister has endeavoured to mobilise in respect of the case for the rejection of the amendment.  The object of the section is to say that where the amount of industrial work carried on in a particular establishment is so small that the provisions of this Act cannot be conveniently applied to it, then the Minister may upon an application from the person carrying on such undertaking grant a licence to employ workers to do that form of work while remaining exempt from the provisions of the Act.  I think in that portion of the section the Minister has ample power to get over any difficulty which may present itself in applying the entire provisions of the Act to that particular form of industrial work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to provide that while you may grant exemption to an employer in these special circumstances in respect of the entire provisions of the Act, there are certain provisions which you ought not to exclude the employer from; in other words, if he secures exemption from the provisions of the Act in the general way, that you ought at least to tie the employer down to recognise that he ought to grant to such worker the annual leave which is provided for the same class of worker in other sections of the Bill; that he ought to be required to observe the minimum age for the employment of young persons; that he ought to be obliged to comply with the section dealing with the employment of outworkers; that employment on Sundays and public holidays should be made to conform with the provisions of the Bill, and that the registration of wage agreements should also be observed in respect of each worker.  The Minister has not told us in what particular respect it is difficult or impossible to retain those sections of the Act for application to an industrial worker <Col N="377" /> who might be exempt from the other provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of an establishment mainly commercial but employing two industrial workers.  An application is made to the Minister to exempt those two industrial workers from the provisions of the Act.  The Minister may make an Order under this section granting such exemption, but he can insist that in respect of those two industrial workmen they are to get their annual leave the same as other industrial workers; that the minimum age of employment is to be recognised; that the wages agreements are to be registered, and that they are to be treated the same as other industrial workers similarly classified are treated in respect of employment on Sundays and public holidays. There is no real difficulty for the Minister in accepting this amendment. I cannot see any single difficulty in the way of making it applicable as part of the licence which may be granted to an employer in respect of any exemption which he may secure under this section.  The Minister says it is his intention ultimately to introduce legislation for application to trading and commercial establishments similar in their effect upon the workers to the provisions of this Bill, but that is not a reason for rejecting this amendment. If the Minister is ultimately going to apply conditions of this kind to workers in trading and commercial establishments I think he ought to accept this amendment; leave it in this Bill until such time as the new Bill is operative; then when conditions are uniform for both industrial and commercial workers the effect of this section will cause no real difficulty either for the Minister or for the employer, because whether the worker is commercial or industrial he is automatically covered by one section or other of either Bill.  I think the Minister ought to accept this amendment. It is an eminently reasonable one, and I think the Minister will find it extremely difficult to show in what way it would be inconvenient either for himself or for the employer to observe the limited provisions set out in this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me completely illogical to say that where the Minister is satisfied that the amount of industrial work done in some establishments is so small that it is impracticable to apply the provisions of this Act he may grant an exemption licence, except in relation to all the main provisions of the Act&mdash;the provisions of the Act relating to annual holidays and minimum age employment, and so on.  The effect of the amendment is to nullify the section.  If there is need for the section then the amendment must be defeated, but if the amendment goes in the whole section may as well go out, because it is completely foolish to say that an exemption licence may be granted, if it is not practicable to apply the Act, except in relation to all the main provisions of the Act. The provisions set out in the amendment are in fact all the main provisions of the Act.  I again quote the example of the case that gave rise to this section, the case of the girl in Woolworth's operating a small printing machine for the printing of visiting cards on the counter of the shop. That was held to be industrial work, and if the Seanad amendment were accepted the particular employee engaged upon that work would have not merely certain rights that the other employees have not yet had conferred upon them, but the management would be under the obligation of displaying the statutory notices provided for in relation to these matters, and the Department would be under the obligation of arranging for a periodic inspection of the place to ensure that in relation to these matters the provisions of the Act would be carried out.  In relation to such establishments we will have a similar code of legislation, with similar but alternative enforcing machinery.  It is obviously more convenient from the administrative point of view that the other legislation and the other enforcement machinery should operate in relation to such establishments, rather than that this Bill and the machinery which will be established under this Bill should apply.  It is not a matter of very great importance.  My objection to <Col N="379" /> this amendment is that it nullifies the section.  If, in fact, it were passed it would be completely impracticable and impossible to grant the exemption licences which we consider may be necessary in very rare circumstances.</P>

      <P>The only argument is that one or two employees throughout the country may be delayed in having applied to them the principles for the regulations of the conditions of employment that this Bill lays down for industrial workers, but the particular workers concerned are not properly industrial workers at all. They are much more properly described as commercial workers, and consequently should be dealt with under the legislation dealing with commercial workers.  It is essential to have this power of exemption to deal with that very rare case that may arise.  The effect of this amendment would be to make it impossible to use this power, because if we are going to apply all the main provisions of the Bill to such worker, we may as well apply the whole lot.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he has in mind the case of Woolworth's where the printing of cards is done. It may be no harm to remind him now that that establishment is, I am told, making latchkeys.  There is probably no limit on the extent to which they may develop in other respects.</P>

      <P>Would it be any great harm if a sufficient amount of inconvenience were caused to Woolworth's to induce them to abandon the printing of visiting cards, and let that work go back to recognised printing establishments in the city?  Would it be any great harm if sufficient inconvenience were caused to induce them to abandon the making of latchkeys by young girls, and allow proper keysmiths in the city to do that work? I do not see that the Minister ought to take power under a section of this kind to treat in any specially sympathetic manner the activities of a firm of that kind who are invading the normal spheres of industrial activity, which is at present qualified in a very definite way and recognised as belonging to particular spheres of crafts, the Minister wants a section in this Bill to say that if Woolworth's want to undertake the printing of visiting cards they ought to get exemption for the time being, and that if Woolworth's are to engage in the making of latchkeys they are to get exemption for the time being for the girl making the latchkeys; and that if next week they want to engage in the making of any other commodity of an industrial character, they are to get exemption.  I would imagine that the Minister would have taken the other view.  He would lose probably the only argument he has if he took the other view, for Woolworth's would rapidly adjust themselves and they would change very rapidly.  If that firm is able to pay 100 per cent. on its shares it is not the kind of institution that should come to this House and ask for special legislation to get them out of a difficulty.</P>

    <P>Section 7, sub-section (4). A new sub-section inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(4) Any employer may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons in his employment, substitute, for the purposes of this section, in any year any of the following days for Easter Monday, Whit Monday, or the first Monday in August, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Ascension Thursday,</P>

    <P>These amendments provide as follows: Under the Bill as it stands an employer can substitute for any of the public holidays set out in Section 7 (1) any of the Church holidays mentioned in sub-section (3).

The purpose of them is to provide that the only holidays that can be substituted for Easter Monday, Whit Monday, or the 1st Monday in August, are Ascension Thursday, the Feast of Corpus Christi, the 29th June or the 15th August.  The amendments provide that the substituted holiday must occur at the same time of the year as the public holiday substituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with the Seanad in amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10. After the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 38 the following words inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;upon being so laid and no sooner shall become operative and shall have effect but&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that regulations made under the Act will not come into operation until they have been tabled.  The case made for the amendment was that there was a possibility that delay might occur in tabling the regulations and that consequently the power of the Oireachtas to revoke by resolution. any such regulations should be lessened, in so far as annulment might be delayed by delay in tabling the regulations.  While theoretically there may be some force in that contention, in practice it is necessary to have regulations come into force upon a date about which the public can be fully informed.  If there was a possibility of misunderstanding as to the date on which regulations became operative, it might have serious administrative consequences, and, in fact. cause injustice in certain cases.  Furthermore, it is desirable that there should be power to bring regulations into operation as quickly as possible after it has been decided to make them.  That applies particularly to a Bill of this kind.  Section 10 of the Bill, as Deputies know, is similar to sections which have appeared in all measures providing for the making of regulations.  I agree that the effecttiveness of the section depends upon the action of the Minister in charge of the particular Bill in carrying out the obligation of laying the regulations upon the Tables of the Houses as soon as may be after they are made.  But it would be undesirable to have regulations operating from any other <Col N="387" /> date except the date upon which they were made, because that is a date which can be clearly and definitely known and of which adequate notice can be given to the interested parties. The difficulties that would arise if there was any doubt as to the actual date from which the Act should operate would be very great and for that reason the amendment must be disagreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defence is the lamest I ever heard put forward in this House.  On that line of argument it would be desirable that every Bill introduced into this House should become law on the date of publication, and not on the date on which it was passed by this House on the grounds that there is uncertainty as to how long the Bill will take to pass and receive the signature of the Governor-General.  There is no more difficulty about making regulations setting out the date on which an Act will come into force, on the face of the regulations, and laying them on the Table of the House, some days ahead, than including in the body of the Bill the date on which it is intended the Act shall come into operation.  It is further evidence of the steady and resolute determination of State Departments, and particularly the Department of Industry and Commerce, to usurp the functions of this House.  It is becoming more manifest every day that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is impatient of any restrictions by legislation upon the activities of his Department.  He wants to have delegated to him the power of legislation particularly in relation to every industrial and commercial enterprise carried on in this country.  It is not desirable that regulations of far-reaching effect should be rapidly made and immediately brought into operation.  We have every reason to know that the tendency of the present Government is to act precipitately in almost all things, and it is highly desirable that there should be afforded an opportunity to think twice before indication of the date upon which their Acts come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> We have been told that the necessity for the Seanad does not exist.  But we have pointed out that it is a very desirable thing that the Seanad should remain in order that legislation passed by this House, at the instance of the Government, should be re-examined and reconsidered in the light of more mature reflection.  And the very Minister who wants the power to act precipitately comes down to this House with the Conditions of Employment Bill, which was-debated at very considerable length here, with no less than 32 amendments made to it in the Seanad most of which he is about to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a point of order? The Minister is a disorderly person, but I look, with confidence, to the Chair to restrain him.  The Minister as usual waxed eloquent in his gratitude and appreciation of the action of the Seanad which had helped him to clarify his intention by passing 32 amendments to his Bill.  In the same breath he asks for power to legislate widely and without reference to this House at all.  He asked for power to table regulations on the date on which Dáil Eireann adjourns for the summer recess, to leave these regulations in force indefinitely&mdash;as far as I can see, without any obligation upon him <Col N="389" /> to lay the regulations on the Table of the House except as soon as may be.  The only justification he has offered is that it is very necessary that regulations of that kind should be brought promptly into effect.  That is the one reason he offered: that there should be no confusion in the public mind as to the exact date on which they should take effect.</P>
      <P>It is not desirable that regulations made by a Minister should come into effect without very careful review, as we have ample reason to know that the Minister is a very irresponsible person and ought not to have powers of this kind at all.  That is the first point.  The second is that there is no necessity whatever for any obscurity in the public mind as to when any regulations are to be put into force because it is easy to provide in the regulations that the Act will come into force, say, on the 1st of October or 1st November or 1st December, and to say in the regulations that it would come into force on such date as will give the Minister time to table regulations in this House or the Seanad before the date set out in the body of the regulations.  I, therefore, urge the House to adopt this amendment and thereby put a very necessary restraint upon the Minister and his Department.</P>

      <P>This amendment could cause no administrative difficulty for the Minister unless he has a desire to prevent the Dáil from knowing the type of regulations which had been made, or are about to be made, until such time as this power to annul the regulations had elapsed.  If the Minister desires that the Dáil should know the regulations made under this section, or under any other section of the Bill, then there is no difficulty in accepting the amendment which only imposes upon him the obligation of laying the regulations upon the Table of each House, as soon as may be after they are made.  On so being laid upon the Table, but not sooner, the regulations become operative and these may be annulled in the usual manner provided in Bills which passed through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple purpose of the amendment, <Col N="390" /> therefore, is that the Minister, let us say, to-day makes up his mind that a regulation in certain terms has to be made.  He is obliged to lay that regulation on the Table of the House, and it is only when he takes the positive action of laying it on the Table that it becomes effective.  That is not imposing on the Minister either any undue burden or putting in his way any unnecessary impediment. What the Minister has to do in order to ensure that a regulation becomes operative is to lay it on the Table, and from that day, but not carlier, it becomes effective.  What the Minister is really resisting in this is any obligation requiring him to put a regulation on the Table to show that that is the starting date on which the regulation becomes effective.  Unless there is to be complete contempt for the principle of laying regulations on the Table of the House, and complete contempt of the right of the Dáil to annul regulations, I do not see what reasonable objection the Minister can have to an amendment of this kind.</P>
    <P>After all there is need for imposing this obligation on the Minister, and particularly on the present Minister for Industry and Commerce because, as he may recollect, the Unemployment Assistance Act provides that the Minister may make two employment orders.  The House is presumably to have the safeguard of annulling regulations of that kind.  Last year we had the most interesting spectacle of an Order having been laid on the Table of the House after the period of the Order had expired.  Have we any guarantee that either out of a spirit of contempt for the House, or because of what I fear is a growing disposition on the part of Departments to treat this House perfunctorily in respect to regulations, we may not have another example of an Order being laid on the Table long after the House has ceased to have any power to annul it?  That position in respect to that Unemployment Period Order was one that showed the danger of allowing Departments and allowing Ministers to be able to issue regulations, as if they were writs issued by the courts, and not apparently to be responsible for the <Col N="391" /> terms of the regulations, until such time as it is probably ineffective, from the standpoint of this House to annul it.  I do not think this amendment imposes on the Minister any restriction that is unreasonable.  It asks him to accept the position that when he makes a regulation he should lay it on the Table.  If he makes a regulation to-day it can be laid on the Table of the House the same day or the following day, and there is nothing to prevent it becoming effective.  The House should endeavour to safeguard itself from the possibility of the Minister, under this Bill, granting an exclusion or an exemption Order for a month, as the month might have passed before the regulation was actually laid on the Table, and the House might be presented with the position that it was not able to annul it no matter how unfair it might appear to be.  The advantage of the amendment is that at least the House will know the regulation has been laid on the Table, and it can investigate what is involved in it, or take steps to annul it.  Under the section as drafted the Minister may follow the very same kind of tactics as were adopted in connection with the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was an unmitigated nuisance not merely to me but to members of his own Party. He will recollect that they spent a lot of time in the House in putting him right upon matters upon which they were informed, but upon which Deputy Dillon was misinformed.  The fact that Deputy Dillon was misinformed does not prevent him speaking. We have had evidence of that to-day.  I am not asking the Dáil to give me power to usurp its functions or to do anything in regard to regulations made under this Bill which has <Col N="392" /> not been done heretofore.  The particular section referred to, Section 10, regarding the laying of regulations before the House, is precisely similar in form to corresponding sections in every Bill providing for regulations since the Dáil was established.  This section appears in all similar enactments passed by the Dáil.  We are carrying this section in this Bill because we think it is a suitable provision and necessary for this type of legislation.  The section caused a difficulty before.  The Dáil may not remember, but Deputy Mulcahy will remember that this section was made inoperative by our predecessors, not by the device of delaying the regulation, but by the device of refusing to provide Parliamentary time for the discussion of a motion tabled for the annulment of an Order.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from memory, but the motion related to the lease of workhouse lands in Co. Clare. It was tabled by Deputy Hogan (Clare) about 1929 and there was failure to provide time for discussion.  The particular difficulty arising from this section was met by a common-sense arrangement.  Arrangements relating to the Order of Business in this House can be similarly dealt with.  The power of the Dáil to deal with the tabling of regulations can be met by a common-sense arrangement.  I agree that it will occur.  It has never occurred except in very exceptional circumstances.  In so far as there is a difficulty arising out of this section, the particular method which the Seanad proposed for dealing with it is the wrong method.  I am quite prepared to consider suggestions for the amendment of the section.  I point to the fact that the section has been made every year, and has been embodied in every Bill of this kind for 13 or 14 years and was never questioned until now.  I do not know why the form of the section should be proposed to be changed in relation to this Bill, rather than in relation to any other measure.  It is desirable that there should be no doubt as to <Col N="393" /> the date on which regulations can in practice be dispensed with.  It is necessary to make these regulations operative from the date on which they are made, and in relation to this Bill probably more than most Bills, it is necessary that the regulations should become operative, certainly during the initial stages of the measure expeditiously.  Most of the regulations made at the very beginning, that is immediately the Bill becomes operative, will be regulations exempting certain industries from the observance of some of the provisions of the Bill, until the position can be examined or new regulations prepared.  The regulations therefore will enable industries to carry on the existing practices, where it seems necessary that these practices should be allowed to continue, but which otherwise might be illegal if the regulations could not be made operative forthwith.</P>
      <P>The question that arises here is a general question.  It does not relate to this Bill only.  The section is in the common form which has appeared in all such measures.  This particular modification has never been suggested previously.  I do not think it should have been suggested in connection with this measure, and the contention that it is necessary for the protection of the rights of the House, or to prevent usurpation of the functions of the Dáil by the Minister, is just nonsense.  This type of legislation has become the practice and is the regular form not merely in this country but in other countries.  The legislature approves of the enactment of certain measures laying down certain lines of procedure, and gives to the Minister responsible certain powers to deal with the detailed application of the principle of the measure in the particular cases they are required.  It is necessary in view of the nature of modern legislation, and its effect upon economic activities, and the complex nature of those activities, and no other method of applying principles of the kind that are dealt with in this Bill to the complex conditions of modern industrial life would be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a very weak case against this <Col N="394" /> amendment.  In the first place, he introduces an irrelevant example that this has been the practice in various Bills since the establishment of the State.  It happens, fortunately or unfortunately, that the State gets older every day and while there was necessity for including such a provision as this in the earlier stages of the formation of the State, it has now become almost a regular practice.  It cannot be done without and the principal reason for it is that Ministers do not know their minds from one day to another.  In any case, assuming that it has been the practice for ten years, what exactly was the practice? Would the Minister read the precise section in the measure?  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There was at least that safeguard and there was at least that opportunity afforded of the regulation in question being raised in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have a situation in which by reason of the stupidity, the blundering, the incapacity and the incompetency of the far side of the House, the Ministry and the Labour Party, we have not got the safeguard of a second House of the Oireachtas, or at least we are going to be deprived of it within a month or two, and if Ministers and the Labour Party could do it we would be deprived of it tomorrow. At any rate, there was that safeguard.  This is not a particularly important matter in view of what the Minister says.  It is not terribly important and the power he is getting is not exhaustive, but he has no case whatever for objecting to the House withholding from him power from Friday until Wednesday of any week. The House sits here on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and, if necessary, it will sit on Tuesday.  He is prevented from making an order only from Friday until the following Tuesday, and he objects to that and cites 10 years' experience of having these regulations laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Is there such a case likely to arise that the Minister is <Col N="395" /> going to be impeded in the administration of this Act because he cannot make an order on Friday which he can make on the following Tuesday or Wednesday?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows there is no such thing and what the Labour Party has to make up its mind about is, that, while it can give a vote very easily for disposing of one House of the Oireachtas, when it comes to a matter of this sort the other House of the Oireachtas should have an opportunity of discussing a matter such as this and <Col N="396" /> ventilating its objection to it, even if it were not to pass the House.  It would focus public attention upon it, but that security is gone, and what we are provided with now is a position in which, although you have two names to a bill, the person who gets the benefit of the bill can withdraw one of the names.  That is a nice situation. The Minister, if he has any experience of business, will appreciate at once what a great power it is to be able to take one name off in a case of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that local authorities in towns and cities should be empowered by legislation to supplement their revenue by levying a rate upon moneys received by ground landlords in respect of ground rents.</P>
      <P>In submitting this motion for the consideration of the House, I should like to point out that it was first put down on the Order Paper before the last general election.  Shortly after June, 1932, I again added this on the Order Paper when the present Government had taken office.  About that time I addressed the following question to the Minister for Finance.  To be accurate, it was on the 8th June, 1932.  I asked the Minister for Finance:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he can state for the latest available financial year the annual amount paid by way of ground rents by property owners in the towns and cities of the Saorstát.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I received the following reply from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret that the information for <Col N="403" /> which the Deputy asks is not available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be observed from the date on which I asked the question here that this motion had not any kind of inspiration from any recent movements established in the country, some of which aim at the complete abolition of ground rents, or what I would rather term the confiscation of ground rents.  Neither had it any urge or inspiration from kindred associations which have been established such as the Leaseholders' Association, etc.  I want to make that perfectly clear before I develop my argument in support of the motion.</P>
    <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis held on Thursday, 4th December, 1935, the Minister for Finance is reported to have said: &ldquo;For every pound paid in ground rents the State took 5/- or 4/6 if their circumstances permitted.&rdquo; I assume that the 5/- or 4/6 referred to by the Minister must have been paid by way of income tax.  It is the only method by which I know he could collect that money.  If that is so, I wonder why the Minister was unable to answer my question on 8th June, 1932.  I will pass from that because, perhaps at the time he had not the information available.  On the same occasion, but at a later stage in the proceedings, the Minister is reported to have stated that &ldquo;On the question of ground rents generally, a prolonged inquiry was essential.&rdquo;  I thoroughly endorse that view.  However, it would be very useful for the House and the people generally to know the amount of money that is leaving the country by way of unearned increment, as well as the amount that leaves the country annually and the amount retained annually I mean money accruing from ground rents.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that this motion is not designed or calculated to confiscate the property of any ground landlord or even his interest in his ground rents, but it asks that a portion of the revenue derived from ground rents should be returned to the community.  Some people may <Col N="404" /> suggest that this is an unfair or unjust proposal to put forward, but I submit that the same argument might be applied to income tax or to the taking over of land under the various Land Purchase Acts.  As a matter of fact, the same old arguments were used when land purchase was first mooted in the early days of the land agitation.  We then heard the term &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; used.  But I do not want to hear the term confiscation used in connection with this debate because this motion, as I have said, is not designed to confiscate the property of any individual ground landlord.  Of course it may be that at some future date a movement will spring up in this country, if any considerable volume of opinion is organised, in relation to the whole question of the taxation of land values.</P>
    <P>Some people, perhaps, may describe this motion as an emasculated form of the doctrine preached by Henry George.  It is nothing of the sort. There is a difference between the two policies or theories.  The motion only asks that some portion of the revenue derived from ground rents should be returned to the community through whose efforts this source of wealth was created and built up.  It may be that at some future date when a considerable volume of opinion is organised in relation to the taxation of land values and when the relationship between unemployment and the land is better understood, when all parties in the State will have been brought to realise that nowhere except in modern civilised society are unemployed willing workers to be found&mdash;then will the opportunity arise for a movement wider in scope, more general in its appeal, and of greater importance, which will have for its object a tax on the value of land, whether used or not, in so far as it has a value for other than agricultural purposes, and all land that is not specially exempted will be valued at its true market value apart from improvements.  The reason why I make the reservation: &ldquo;land other than land for agricultural purposes&rdquo; is because we all know the tradition <Col N="405" /> of the land war in this country.  We all know the great fight that not alone the men of the present generation but of many generations past put up for the land of this country, and he would indeed be a brave if not a foolish man who would suggest for one moment that you should put a land tax on agricultural land in the same way as you would impose a tax on the man deriving a good deal of unearned increment from ground land in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Various estimates have been made as to the amount paid by way of ground rents in the Saorstát, but as they are only estimates I will only give one or two instances in which exorbitant prices have been paid for land contiguous to the cities.  It may be assumed, however, I think, that considerably over £1,000,000 is collected yearly in the Saorstát in the way of ground rents.  We all know that most of this money is sent out of the country.  In view of that, surely the local and municipal authorities have a moral right to demand that at least a portion of that sum should go in relief of rates.  In Mercer Street, Dublin, £1,200 per acre was paid for slum-built real estate, and £212 an acre for land on which the owner had paid agricultural rates only, somewhere beyond Cabra village, and £1,000 an acre in Bray.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Undeveloped, I presume. In any case, it does not matter even if it were developed; £1,000 an acre must, as Deputy Belton himself should know, represent a considerable amount in rent to be paid by the working-class people who are still clamouring for houses.  The Minister must be aware, and most members of the House must also be aware, that valuable land held for speculative purposes escapes rates, while elsewhere ratepayers have to pay heavy rates, particularly ratepayers paying on house property.  I hope in this matter I will get a good deal of assistance <Col N="406" /> from Deputy Belton.  I must say I do not anticipate much.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think at least we should endeavour to secure for the community a portion of the wealth which the community helped to build up.  In large centres of population particularly, the least the community should get from those who are receiving big unearned incomes is some return in the shape of a tax or levy which could be devoted towards social services.  Public money, both State money and local rates, is expended on improvements in cities and towns and that enhances very considerably the value of property in those cities and towns.  The local authorities should be given power to levy a rate on ground rents and should be free to determine the nature of that rate. They may be trusted, I think, when they know the local conditions not to make that rate exorbitant or beyond the capacity of the person or property to pay.  I suggest that rate should be in addition to the ordinary rates struck under the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is conceded, I think, that land value is created by the community, and therefore something should be given back to the community to meet the cost of social services.  It must be remembered that under the present system the ever-increasing value in land is passing into the hands of private individuals at an increasing rate.  Most of these people have done nothing whatsoever to create the increased value of the land.  In recent years the speculation in land must have broken all previous records&mdash;I am only hazarding a guess&mdash;having regard to the volume of house-building that has taken place, particularly during the last two or three years.  It would be interesting to discover what was the gross amount paid for land by the Dublin and Cork Corporations for the purpose of housing the working classes.  At the moment I have not the figures available, but I am certain that a request directed to the city managers in Dublin and Cork would <Col N="407" /> bring forth that information.  I could furnish that later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Deputy not furnish that information now?  He told us that this motion has been a very considerable time on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now the chance of a lifetime, because it was only yesterday I prepared most of my data.  Anyhow, that does not get us much further.  It is a well-known fact that a plot of land on the outskirts of a big city and a plot of a similar size in the centre of the city will show a very big difference in price, ranging from £100 to many thousands per acre.  It is evident that the buyer pays for the position of the land, and the value of that position depends on the growth of the city in wealth and population.  It is not in any sense due to the activities or otherwise of the owners of the soil. The value of the ground in the places I have mentioned has been considerably improved by municipal effort. Municipal improvements made at the expense of the ratepayers, a new bus or a new railway service&mdash;any of those things might easily enhance considerably the value of property in a locality.  There are, for instance, such important amenities as lighting and a water supply.  These things are a local charge and they go to enhance the value of land in the vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is kept in nearly every big city waste land, withheld for a considerable time, the idea being that at some future date a public-spirited corporation or town council might develop the district or might add to its amenities in the way municipal councils do, extending sewerage, lighting, and so on.  This land is withheld from sale until the time is ripe for development.  Every additional service established at the cost of the ratepayers enhances the value of land in that neighbourhood.  There are certain serious economic effects following from the present system which place a burden upon house occupiers and users of business premises.  I think that will not be challenged by any Deputy.  For instance, it increases <Col N="408" /> the cost of housing and forces many of the working-class people and others to live in inferior houses and unhygienic surroundings.  It tends to stop the extension of social services because of the crippling effect of increased rates on local trade and industry.  It discourages building and general improvements, because any increase in the rental value increases the rateable value.  It encourages the withholding of land from use because no rates are being paid on vacant land.</P>
    <P>I do not know and I do not speak for Dublin, but I do know that the citizens of Cork are faced with an increase of 2/- in the £ in the rates this year.  Although we were told that, owing to the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, home assistance would be very considerably lowered, if not abolished altogether, the fact is that the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act has not in any way reduced the amount paid by way of home assistance.  In fact, home assistance is on the increase. Unemployment assistance, as the Minister must know, is financed by the ratepayers in the cities and towns to the tune of £195,000.  The employers and workers contribute between them something like £250,000.  Those burdens are becoming too great to be borne by the ratepaying public, the poor and the working-class people being amongst the greatest sufferers under the system of transferring State or national responsibilities to the ratepayers.  If the Government are not willing to shoulder their responsibilities in this connection, at least they should open up an avenue to the local bodies through which they would be able to collect at least some revenue as a set-off to the increasing burden which is now thrown upon them.  I have endeavoured to show that land values, or ground rents as I prefer to call them, are entirely due to the presence and activities of the community.  I have had letters from one or two public bodies in which they call for the abolition of what is designated by one borough council as &ldquo;the enormous annual tribute paid by way of ground rents.&rdquo;</P>

I must candidly confess that I was disappointed by the case made by the proposer of the motion.  I hope he will not take it ill of me when I give it as my opinion that he has not made a case.  He used a lot of generalities.  I do compliment him on the fact that he dispelled the notion that might be created in the public minds by a motion of this kind when he emphatically assured the House that there was nothing by way of confiscation prompting this motion.  That was a useful assurance. The Deputy read resolutions that were based on wide, wild and uninformed generalities.  He read a resolution from Letterkenny which talked about millions that were collected by way of ground rents, unearned increment collected for nothing and exported out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Anthony did not say that but that was the gist of the resolution from Letterkenny.  Now, it is well to know at the outset that the largest ground landlord in Ireland is the Dublin Corporation and if the Dublin Corporation give £200 or £300 an acre for virgin soil for building houses, they get £9,000 or more an acre for land let to private individuals. I am Chairman of the Estates Committee of the Dublin Corporation and I know what I am talking about. Leases have lapsed in the corporation. They are lapsing every day. It is only this morning I posted a few orders that had been sent to me as Chairman of the Estates Committee. We actually increase the rents when the leases lapse.  We will not relet them even subject to an increase without a guarantee of expenditure on capital outlay towards rebuilding, renovating or reconditioning. We have authority in the powers given to the corporation to do that on our own.  Sometimes certain technicalities come into it and when those operate we have to get the sanction of the Local Government Department.  When we suggest <Col N="413" /> an increase in the rents the Local Government Department does not disagree with us in imposing the increase.  They have held that we have not increased the rents enough. I say that without fear of contradiction, and I say it without finding fault with the Local Government Department.  I am merely stating a fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony's motion states that special taxation over and above all other taxation should be levied on moneys received by ground landlords in respect of ground rents.  I intervene in this matter because I know its importance.  I have no special ability for knowing of its importance, but I have been thrown in the way of having its importance brought directly home to me.  For instance, a loan was recently floated by the Dublin Corporation.  I am sorry I was not aware that this motion was coming on to-day or I would have got some substantial figures which would convey to Deputies the size and importance of the matter I refer to.  It is a very considerable amount running into many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands.  That is the revenue derived from the Dublin Corporation from ground rents.  The Corporation, roughly speaking, have a public debt of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 which they have borrowed. These ground rents are an asset.  Are you going to undermine that asset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Dublin Corporation wanted over £1,000,000 last year for the housing of the working classes a deputation waited on the Minister for Finance.  It was a composite deputation of people of various brands of politics and of no politics. I think the Minister will concede that we met him in a businesslike way and I must say that he met us in a businesslike way.  Our one concern was to get money and we forgot politics for the time.  The Minister outlined a programme for us to carry out and told us that if we did not get the money we were to come back to him, and we all genuinely thanked the Minister.  That committee proceeded to get some money <Col N="414" /> in other ways.  We got £250,000 from a certain source for the housing of the working classes.</P>
    <P>We had our 1935-36 housing programe ready.  The contract was ready for signature and everything was ready to go on with the work, but we could not move until we had the money.  That was before Christmas. As a matter of fact, we had our schemes ready a year ago, but we had not the money to go on with them.  We started off then.  Then we wanted another £750,000 for the erection of working-class houses in Crumlin and some schemes of flats in the city and £250,000 for loans to people to purchase their dwellings under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Then the deputation switched on to the Banks' Standing Committee.  We interviewed them and communications passed between us, until finally we made a deal with them which produced this loan which was so successfully floated the other day.</P>
    <P>I was one of the few members of the corporation who were in all these negotiations and it is in that way, if I had any doubt about it, that the fatal danger of dealing with this matter in any flippant manner was brought home to me.  I should say that we had already advanced nearly £1,000,000 under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The question of the security and the percentage of default in the repayment of that money was very sternly put up to us and very carefully considered by the Banks' Standing Committee before they agreed to underwrite the loan. The question of our ground rents is another matter, as it is a very important asset.  If you interfere with the ground rents of any individual you must interfere with the Dublin Corporation and such bodies who also have ground rents.  If the Dublin Corporation ground rents were in any way damaged, considering the difficulty we had in getting the Banks' Standing Committee to underwrite our loan and take the risk of having to put up any portion that was not subscribed, I would not like to be a member of the corporation which <Col N="415" /> would attempt to negotiate a loan next year.  Neither would I care to see it done considering that it is only on the credit of the corporation and their capacity to borrow money that the housing of the working classes can proceed.</P>
    <P>That is by way of showing the facts and the absurdity of these uninformed resolutions which are being passed and people saying, perhaps, that some man may be living in London and drawing £100 a year in ground rents out of property in Letterkenny. They see that man drawing these ground rents, but they do not consider the cases of other people in the country who have ground rents. In the case of that man the ground rents may have been created 100 years ago and he may have inherited them.  I have heard of a case in a place not 1,000 miles from here where old leases lapsed and without doing anything in the way of improving the property, the owners of the ground rents trebled them.  I do not think that is fair and it should not be allowed if it can be prevented without introducing a principle which would in the long run do more harm than good.  Speaking generally, I do not think that that should be allowed but the question of how to stop it would have to be considered very carefully.  Only last night I was told by a gentleman in the estate business of the case of a street or a road near the city; for all practical purposes you might say it is in the city.  In that case the ground rents of the houses are about £7 or £7 10s. per year and the people have been notified that the ground rents will be increased to £24 per year.  That is a substantial case, and if it is of any interest to the Minister, I shall get the full particulars and give them to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against an increase of that kind.  But take the modern ground rents.  Take a plot with a frontage of 20 or 30 feet and a depth of from 150 to 200 feet.  Various <Col N="416" /> ground rents are put on that, say from £8 to £12.  Let us say the land as virgin soil is worth £250 or £300 per acre.  People will say, &ldquo;That is the value of that land for agricultural purposes; why should a man get £8 or £10 or £12 for a little plot of that land?&rdquo; What the public do not realise is that a man taking virgin soil to build upon may have a small frontage to it on which he can put a few houses, but if he goes into the hinterland he has to make roads and footpaths and put in sewerage and surface drainage.  He has to enter into an agreement with the E.S.B. that he will put so many houses there or guarantee that there will be a certain consumption of electricity by a certain time, and he will either have to give a bond or put down money as a guarantee that that will be done by a certain time. If that is not done by then it may be confiscated. Further, when all that is done, the Dublin Corporation requires that not only must the roads, footpaths and everything in that line be laid to their specification, but the builder must put up the public lamps and pay for them, and then the corporation will take them over.  A man walks into a grass field.  He does all that and leaves them standing. He has to pay for all these.  Is his money which he has put into that land to be confiscated?  If it is you can say good-bye to all further building operations.  Where are you going to get ground developed, and built upon, if the money put into the land is confiscated or if the recipients are to be branded as public parasites getting something for nothing?  The Minister for Finance has gone a long way, perhaps many think too far, in the direction of getting more of that money.  These ground rents have to pay income tax.  The proposer of this motion asked why should these people get away with anything more than the income tax they pay, but they pay income tax upon these ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man creates a ground rent, in the way I have mentioned, the Minister for Finance, although he claims <Col N="417" /> that the provision was there before he put it into the last Finance Act, decided that if a £10 ground rent is paid, that ground rent is to pay income tax although the recipients of it are liable for income tax in the ordinary way.  But over and above ordinary income tax the Minister taxes that £10 ground rent if it was created between April 1935 and April 1936.  He says that that £10 created this year, and received this year, is not the income on that ground rent for the initial year, but that the real income is from the capital that created that.  In other words, 12½ or 15 years' purchase or whatever number of years the Revenue Commissioner takes, is the capital.  Once the principle is conceded the Revenue Commissioners are not really ravenous; they do not want to take the breeches off a man altogether.  It is not the principle I find fault with. I only want to say that the people who created these ground rents are pretty well skinned already and ought not to be skinned any further. If that £10 ground rent is capitalised in the year it is created, it becomes not £10 but £130 or £150.  The recipient has to pay that tax so that he may have to pay 150 times 4/6 in that year, and the following year he has to pay ten times 4/6.  If the Revenue wants more the best thing to do would be to make it illegal to have ground rents at all and say that the system should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>On what principle do the Revenue Commissioners work in this matter? What principle has the Minister adopted in making a case for the capitalising of ground rents?  Take a particular plot of land.  A house is built upon it and sold for £1,000. There is a ground rent out of that &mdash;a profit ground rent would be the easiest way to explain it to the House.  In many cases a builder rents building sites at, say, £5 per site.  He builds a house, sells it for £1,000 and puts on a profit rent of £5 and a ground rent of £10.  What the Revenue has been maintaining, and what the Minister in the last Finance Act wanted to put beyond doubt, as there was a decision in the <Col N="418" /> Circuit Court against what the Minister or his Department had determined, was that the £5 profit rent created by some means or other an extra building profit.  So if a man sold the house for £1,000 and returned for income tax purposes £100 profit, the Revenue Commissioners say no; it should be £100 building profit plus £5 capitalised.  So that where ground rent cannot be shown to represent outlay, it is capitalised to its full value and has to pay 4/6 in the £ income tax or whatever the standard rate is.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Anthony has made a case for any more over and above that.  I hope the Deputy will not think I am speaking as an interested party.  I have a little interest in it but I can say more money was spent in Dublin in developing land for builders than otherwise would have been spent on the land.  People interested in virgin soil down the country have trouble perhaps, but it is only a bagatelle compared with the development costs here.  Sums of £200 or £300 are nothing as capital value compared to development costs.  It is not the municipality that develops land.  The municipality of Dublin and the County Council&mdash;and I am intimately associated with the administration of both&mdash;give the same facilities in their area.  All that is done in the way of new development is on public roads where that is a practical proposition. Where ribbon development would mean going half a mile with a sewer or with pipes that would accommodate only one house that is not a practical proposition and it will not be done.  It will be done if the man at the end pays for it.  He could not expect it any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Davin applauds that.  Where the development is continuous, either in the city or in the county, public services will be put in and public roads.  That is not so when it comes to the development of the hinterland.  I have developed a good deal of hinterland, and all the facilities I got from the Corporation, of which I am a member, was what <Col N="419" /> anyone else would get.  I took good care to get what everyone else got.  I wanted no more and no less.  All I got was the water mains, but I had to pay £75 to get a sewer, before a pick was put into the ground.  It is not all a bed of roses.  You do not get ground rents for nothing.  I am sorry that other Deputies have not spoken, because many points might be introduced that I might know a little about, and that I might be able to support or to oppose.  In discussing this motion generally I hope that it will be approached in an unbiassed way, and with due regard to the credit of the country and the credit of municipalities. I have seen letters in the Press about this question.  I should have replied to them only that someone might say I did so because I had a little 2½d. interest in ground rents, and that it was selfish motives prompted me.  There is talk about the advantage it would be to industrial development and to local rates if ground rents were taxed or reduced.  Ground rents, when considered in the whole national welfare and wealth of the country, are a very small item.  They are there by contract.  If you set out to attack contracts you are going to put a price on the money that you want for national and local services, as well as increasing the cost of industrial development, business development and social services, particularly in reference to the housing of the working classes.  The Dublin Corporation got a loan of £1,000,000 at 4 per cent. or a little over that figure.  If the Corporation could have got that money at 2½ per cent.  Deputies can realise what it would mean to the municipality, and what it would mean in the housing of the working classes.  Think what it would mean if the Corporation had to pay 5 per cent. or 5½ per cent. for that money.  If we start to attack something established by contract we are seriously damaging the credit of the country.  I except from that private individuals who use their position in the case of lapsed leases to extract rack rents.</P>

      <P>It was made before the Deputy came in.  We waited a long time and he did not turn up.  I quite agree with what Deputy Anthony has said, and I think it is the general feeling all round that anything done in this matter needs very careful inquiry and consideration, and, without anticipating the result of that inquiry, it is absolutely necessary that it should be held, particularly when there has been so much opposition voiced against ground rents.  It does not follow that anything terrible is going to happen, but it would be important to settle the public mind on the question by having an exhaustive inquiry into the matter. Whatever the report is, people can examine and criticise it, and I am sure it will bring to light a lot of information which is not at the moment before the public, including those who sent that resolution to Deputy Anthony, and they might be wiser, if sadder, men when they got the information. If there is an inquiry, and I hope there will be, everybody interested can put up his case.  Meanwhile, I hope that the wishes of the proposer of this motion will form the keynote of the <Col N="423" /> debate here, and that we will request the Minister to take steps to have an inquiry into this matter, rather than that we should anticipate the results of that inquiry by dogmatising on any particular line on the matter here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is always perfectly clear as to what he wants, and when he says he wants a prolonged and careful inquiry, what he really wants is some kind of vehicle that will take him away from the necessity of having to do anything in the matter at the moment, and <Col N="424" /> probably may take him to a point at which a set of circumstances will exist which will probably not necessitate his having to do anything at all.  As a Minister, he may have changed his responsibility so that he would be prevented from having to deal with a financial matter, and another set of circumstances might give him complete freedom from responsibility for legislating on a matter of this kind.  Let us be perfectly clear, however, that this new community of interest between Deputy Anthony and the Minister looks to me, at any rate, like a conspiracy to enter into a prolonged and careful inquiry, the ultimate object of which is to do nothing in respect of ground rents.  I am surprised that a radical like Deputy Anthony should now have moved so close to the Minister for Finance as even to agree with the Minister's Ard-Fheis speech, that a prolonged and careful inquiry into ground rents is essential.</P>

      <P>He would probably do a lot of listening, judging by his speech to-day.  We have Deputy Belton coming along, in case Deputy Anthony would be too radical, even after his protestations of agreement with the Minister, to advise Deputy Anthony to be very careful in this matter and not to go too quickly lest he might damage the interest he intends to serve in this motion.  I am not at all in agreement with the way in which this motion is phrased.  Deputy Anthony wants prolonged and careful inquiry&mdash;the same kind as the Minister wants&mdash;but his motion does not ask for an inquiry at all.  It asks for legislation, as if all the facts on the matter were already well known and Deputy Anthony had a recipe for solving all the evils and ills that flow from ground rents.  After proposing a motion which demands legislation, he now does not want legislation at all.  What he wants is one of the Minister's inquiries, with this addition, that the inquiries are to be prolonged and careful.  We will probably get the result of an inquiry <Col N="425" /> of that kind ten years hence, if indeed it ever sees the light of day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton has pointed out certain weaknesses in a resolution of the kind proposed here.  I agree that there is need for a thorough examination of the ground rent problem, but there are some very obvious facts which scarcely require any further examination, and the hardships and injustices which flow from some of the methods of exacting ground rents are so clear as not to require that prolonged consideration of the problem which some people now advocate.  The fact of the matter is that we in this country have always been confronted with the problem of adequately housing our people, and to-day, when efforts are being made to repair the shortage of houses, and when the State is making such heroic efforts to provide the citizens with decent habitations, we find a section of the community which owns land&mdash;the manner in which the land was got is immaterial for the purpose of this argument&mdash;demanding of the community that it must pay for the land the high prices which the present landowner is demanding.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was half an hour on his feet and while there were a lot of figures used, they were not very helpful.  When we come to examine this question of the demands made for land for the purpose of house-building, we find that there is no machinery in existence to ascertain what is a fair price for any land sold for house-building purposes.  A local authority may wish to acquire a particular site because it is the most convenient one within its area of jurisdiction for house-building purposes. A local authority may consider that the development of a particular site is advantageous for house-building purposes because of the ease with which it can be connected with sewerage, water, light, and various other municipal services; or a private builder, following his normal avocation, might say that he also desired to acquire a particular <Col N="426" /> site for the purpose of providing houses which he could sell at a profit to himself&mdash;and I do not regard that as in any way a reprehensible occupation, since he provides the community with its needs, and a builder is entitled, like everybody else in the community, to a reasonable return for his labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, because of the famine in houses, a local authority may be required, if it wants a particular site, to pay an extortionate sum for that land.  In considering the value of the land, the owner naturally says, firstly, that there is a shortage of houses and a scarcity of suitable land, and that factor enters largely into the sale of his commodity.  In addition, however, that land may have been bought by the owner, in the first instance, when it was not situated in a developed portion of a town or city. It may have been bought originally as land simply for agricultural purposes, or, by the efforts of the community, it may have been developed by the construction of roads, by lighting, or by sanitation close to it&mdash;by the provision of transport, electric light and water supply convenient to it.  All these assets, in the form of transport, water, public health, lighting and road construction, which have been created by the community, are all community-created assets which, in relation to <Col N="428" /> land, have inevitably the effect of increasing the value of that land, and the person who thus sells land for the purpose of house-building is selling it in many cases at a very enhanced price due, in the first instance, to the fact that there is a scarcity of land, and, in the second instance, to the fact that there has been added to that inflated commercial value a new value made possible by the efforts of the community in providing additional services.</P>
      <P>A local authority or a private builder is, therefore, often compelled to pay for ground rents, as rents for land, a sum of money which represents to the purchaser an income for property which was considerably increased in price by efforts other than those of the property owner.  An artificial scarcity of the commodity which is sought will increase the value of the land, and the addition to that land of community-created assets inevitably will have the effect of forcing up the price of that land with the result, particularly in recent years, that persons who have had land for sale for house-building purposes have been able to dispose of that land not merely at inflated prices but often at a still greater inflation of the price because of the community-created assets which have been added to the land.</P>

The Minister can make inquiries in his own constituency in the south county and he can there ascertain the extent to which sites are being sold and the prices which are being charged, compared with the prices of similar land, almost side by side, which was sold ten years ago. Let the Minister ask the town clerk of Dun Laoghaire or the borough commissioner and he will be supplied with the information.  Anybody, who has not his head in the clouds, must know that advantage is being taken of the housing boom, and if the Housing Acts were repealed to-morrow, land could be purchased for very much less than the amount it can be purchased for to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that because of the shortage of houses land has been sold at prices which are inflated.  There has entered into the sale of the land, to the benefit of the property owner, an additional value which has been secured to him, in many instances, by the fact of community created assets. I think it is within the knowledge of Deputies that, in a period when there is an extensive scheme of public works being carried out and when there is a shortage of houses, a person with suitable land to sell for house building purposes is often able, purely by reference to these two factors, to secure for his land a price which is altogether extortionate and which must ultimately be borne by the community in respect of its desire to find decent accommodation for its people.  To-day, although land is being sold at this inflated price, there <Col N="431" /> is really no effective taxation on the income so derived in the form of ground rents except the charge which is imposed under the income tax code, and it, in my opinion, simply assesses income tax on an income of that kind without any reference whatever to the specially enhanced prices which are being secured for land in existing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  Ground rents of that kind may pay income tax of 4/6 in the £ in the higher scale, but that is not a new development.  That is an application of the principle of paying the higher tax on the ground rent.  You may say that if there are more ground rents there are a greater number of four and sixpences to be paid.  In my opinion, the income which is being got out of ground rents is inflated to such an extent as to neutralise completely the imposition of a tax of 4/6 in the £ on income derived from ground rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be capitalised, but the desire of people to acquire land and create new ground rents out of it shows that the capitalisation of ground rent income does not in any way deter them from doing so.  Even the Deputy in his speech admitted that the Revenue Commissioners, under the formula they adopt, do not impose any intolerable burden on the ground landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Deputy that coming from the ground alone, apart from the expenditure incurred on development, ground rents do not amount to £1 a house.  If you take the figure of £250 an acre and divide it up you will see that it does not amount to more than £1 per house per annum.  Ground rents of £10 are due to development and to the money sunk in the ground and to that only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with the development side of it later, but I regard the imposition of a tax of 4/6 in the £ on incomes derived from ground rents as utterly inadequate.  It is utterly inadequate in recent years because of the facilities provided by <Col N="432" /> the State for house-building purposes. Advantage is being taken of the scarcity of houses and the scarcity of suitable land convenient to towns.</P>

      <P>Because the district of the Thatch is inconvenient to live in, having regard to the high transport charges to and from that district. Deputy Belton, in the course of his speech, talked of the builder who bought land, went in on a site and put in roads, sewerage, footpaths, light, and built a house, and, having thus transformed the character of the countryside, disposes of the house and walks out.  He may, of course, retain an interest in the ground rent.  The Deputy seems to think that such a builder was a kind of public benefactor who built roads, sewers, footpaths, and erected lights&mdash;generally improved the amenities of the place&mdash;and then sold his house, which he had erected on the land, without any relation to the cost of these services to him. Deputy Belton is too astute a financier not to have adverted to it in his own case, that when a builder goes in to build houses on a site one of the elements in his cost, and one of the elements in the sale price of the house, is the fact that he has had to construct footpaths and roads to the satisfaction of the Corporation, to lay down sewers and to erect lamps.  Is it not a fact that the value of all these services is aggregated and added to the cost of the house?</P>

      <P>I do not know what method Deputy Belton has of regulating his house building affairs, but I do know that builders, particularly those who are not very well equipped with money, find it necessary to charge the seller a proportion of the cost of providing those other services which are necessary if the houses are to be sold.  There is no serious challenge to the contention that in the sale of the house it is not merely the sale of the houses itself but of the ancillary services provided with the house, such as roads, sewerage, water, light, etc.</P>

      <P>Subject to a ground rent and it is the ground rent that pays for these services, the capital cost of putting them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have shown, in any case, that the normal method of ascertaining the cost of a house is not merely concerned with the house itself, but with the cost of providing the other services.  The cost of these other services is added proportionately to the price of the house and the purchaser pays both for the house and the services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton speaks of a builder as a philanthropic man who provides the community with all these services, but he really does not mean it, because the house-builder ultimately exacts his cost from the purchaser and even exacts a profit on the services he provides in the same way as he exacts a profit on the house he provides.  The Deputy talked about house-builders providing services of that kind.  I doubt if he imagines that anyone believes that builders are such philanthropic individuals that they can afford to do that.  I do not see any reason why they should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; there is no objection to ground rents, then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy proceeds to masquerade as a public benefactor. <Col N="435" /> providing services of that kind, so to speak, for nothing.  The services which the Deputy is supposed to provide free of cost are not provided free of cost. The cost is borne by the purchaser.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may do it through the ground rent or by an addition to the price of the house, but no matter what way he does it, the Deputy will not lose on the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the provision of these services does not impose any burden on the builder.  If he adds to the ground rent the cost of these services he is making an addition to the ground rent over and above what he would charge.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is building them and I will give him credit for being able to organise the finances of a scheme and I am sure the Deputy sees bankruptey a long way off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a striking admission from Deputy Belton.  In any case, he knows very well that, particularly in boom periods, those who have land to sell or those who provide houses have not been prominent in the bankruptey courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither are those who have labour to sell in the boom periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Few of them ever have enough money to be able to get to the bankruptey courts; the workhouse often provides a convenient via media.  I am afraid the Deputy is not making a success of his housing scheme, if that is his admission.  This method of his, which is contrary to the normal method, may be an explanation <Col N="436" /> of it.  I agree with Deputy Belton on one point, and that is that the motion is defective to the extent that it would appear to impose on local authorities an obligation to levy a rate on themselves as ground landlords. It seems to me to be a childish piece of legislation to enable a local authority to impose a levy on its own ground rents.  There is no purpose served in imposing a levy on Corporation ground rents, because such surplus as is made on the Corporation ground rents is used for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
      <P>One must distinguish between the ground rent used for the benefit of private individuals and ground rent used for the purpose of the municipality, for the benefit of the municipality. If, as Deputy Belton says, the corporation buys land at £200 an acre and arranges a ground rent of £400 an acre, what is the position?  The land is bought from someone within the area of the corporation and sold to people within the same area, and such surplus as is realised from the ground rent is used for the benefit of all the people within the area of the corporation. Surpluses which may be raised in that manner find their way back into the pockets of the community in one way or another, in the form of better municipal services or a remission of rates which would otherwise be necessary if there were no ground rents of that kind accruing to the corporation. I think Deputy Anthony has made a mistake in not differentiating between the private ground landlord and the municipality which may be a landlord.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but it is necessary. Deputy Anthony may have made it clear that his desire is to impose additional taxation on ground rents which are secured by the sale of an article which is in extensive demand and the value of which has been enormously improved by the addition of community-created assets.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
