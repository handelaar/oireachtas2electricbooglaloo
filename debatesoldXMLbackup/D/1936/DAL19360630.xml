      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the revocation of the quota order regulating the importation of cement involves any alteration in the terms of the coal-cattle pact as published by the Government Information Bureau on the 18th February, 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The revocation of the quota order regulating the importation of cement involves no alteration in the provisions of the coal-cattle pact other than those dealing with cement.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he prepared to publish the details of the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the quota flow from the agreement?  It was as a result of the agreement arrived at that the quota was established.  People in the cement trade are anxious to see where they stand, and I should like to ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to tell us where we stand, will he give us details of the agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely separate question.  So far as the people in the cement trade are concerned, all they want to know is that the quota order has been revoked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>They want to know something much further.  Are they going to be thrown back again, at a <Col N="530" /> later period, to take their supplies from England?  That is the part that is interesting them.  Having had their supplies from England cut off, and having had to obtain their supplies from the Continent, are they going at a later stage to find that the position has been again reversed?  That is what we are anxious to find out.</P>

      <P>I have seen certain statements in the public Press which would appear to refer mainly to prospective rather than actual operations by the East Atlantic Fisheries Limited.  There has been no consultation so far with my Department beyond a call paid by one of the Directors, a London businessman, who explained that he and some friends had formed a small company and purchased the assets (including, apparently, certain lobster ponds and oyster beds at, or near, Dawros) of the former West of Ireland Fisheries Company, which had not proved a success.  The object of his call was to gather particulars of the current by-laws and regulations dealing with fisheries, the procedure for importing parts of marine motor engines, the conditions governing bounties payable on certain exports of fish, and similar routine matters.</P>

      <P>Ex-Private James Mack, Rineen, Waterville, County Kerry, submitted a claim under the Army Pensions Act, 1927, in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis.

      <P>My attention has been drawn to newspaper reports in which it was stated that the Central Council of the Catholic Clerical Managers' Association, at a meeting on the 16th instant, passed a resolution on this matter.  I have not received a copy of the resolution. I must remind the Deputy that the existing programme requires the work of the infant classes to be entirely in Irish only where the teachers are sufficiently qualified.  This principle was accepted and recommended by the National Programme Conference in 1926, which included amongst its personnel two representatives of the Catholic managers.  I see no reason to make any alteration in the present programme.  I am satisfied that satisfactory progress has been made, and that effective work is being done to make the children Irish speakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, on Friday afternoon, when the Minister for Finance called attention to the fact that there was not a quorum present in the House, I was speaking on this First Schedule, and I was pointing out to the House that this First Schedule is half the Finance Bill, and that this is the Schedule that imposes, I think, 44 or 46 new duties.  The Minister, apparently, thought that it was not necessary for the House to discuss this matter at all.  Some of us cannot agree with the Minister.  We know that last year the Minister, as a result of duties imposed, collected the very great sum of, I think, £10,500,000 in customs alone, and we know that those duties&mdash; I think the majority of them&mdash;fall particularly heavily on the poorer sections of the community here.  A glance through the First Schedule here will show that many of those duties are bound still further to increase the cost of living in this country.  The Minister himself, in the Schedule, as I pointed out on Friday, is not satisfied that the greater number of those articles are going to be produced in this country during the coming year, and certainly not going to be produced in sufficient quantities to meet the <Col N="537" /> home demand.  Now, of course, we are told by Ministers, and particularly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that not only is there no increase in the cost of living, but that, as a matter of fact, the cost of living has fallen.  In fact, I think that on one occasion the Minister went so far as to say that the cost of living is lower to-day than it has been for a considerable number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is lower than it was in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a few years ago.  In any case, however, I doubt if there is anybody in this country, outside the members of the Front Bench opposite, who believe that the cost of living has fallen.  I doubt if there is a housekeeper in this country who thinks that the cost of living is lower to-day than it was in 1931.  I am satisfied that there is nobody in this country who does not believe that the cost of living has been increasing for the last few years, year after year, since the present Government came into office.  There is no doubt about that, certainly, so far as the necessaries of life are concerned. On articles that must be bought for use in every household, there has been a considerable increase in prices, even over the last two years.  My point about the First Schedule is that it is going further to increase the cost.  We have not got from the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce any idea as to what benefits are going to flow to this country as a result of the imposition of these considerable duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House by going into details, but certain items could be picked out about which one could ask why it was necessary to put duties upon them.  For the first time duties are being imposed on certain articles, and that at a time when the Government say they are going to make £2,500,000 available for employment.  Some of the materials that will be taxed by this Schedule are used in certain classes of work, and as there is no likelihood that they will be made here, one can only come to <Col N="538" /> the conclusion that the attitude of the Government is that they will have to be imported for schemes of employment that are to be started&mdash;if they are started&mdash;and they are proceeding on the same basis as that in connection with cement that, as there was a boom in house building, the Government was entitled to rake in 5/- on every ton of cement used.  Some of the materials mentioned in this Schedule are used in sewerage and other works and are not produced here.  The general effect, in my opinion, will be to increase substantially the cost of living, and to divert some of the money that is supposed to be available for employment towards the purchase of materials necessary to carry out these schemes.  As far as I am concerned, and apparently the Minister is of the same opinion, I do not think many of the materials will be made here, and certainly not in sufficient quantities in the year covered by this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has rightly drawn attention to the implications of this Schedule.  When the Minister for Finance introduced his emergency Budget, in 1932, he boasted that he was putting £4,000,000 additional taxation on the people, and he went through the country pointing out that the additional taxation was being imposed on the rich.  I have already quoted the words of the Minister for Defence at Navan, in 1932, where he stated that the additional taxation being put on was coming out of the pockets of the rich. We have repeatedly referred to what has happened since, and by the time we came to the Budget of 1935, we had reached a point in which it was necessary, after dodging it for a couple of years before that, to ask brutally: &ldquo;Why should not the workingman pay?&rdquo; Coming to 1936 we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and also the Minister for Education, emphasising the fact that the working classes had to pay.  Now, when we look at the size of the bill marked &ldquo;paid&rdquo; at the end of the last financial year, we find that customs duties brought in, in the year ending March, 1936, £2,000,000 more than they brought in in the year ending March, 1932.  I pointed out that <Col N="539" /> the general bill payable by the people in the first normal Budget was £250,000 more than the bill put before them in the emergency Budget.  The figures disclosed by the customs duties show the extent to which workers are being forced more and more to pay for the cost of government here.  The Minister for Finance emphasised only the other day, when dealing with the question of additional educational relief, that if it was granted it would come out of the pockets of the working people.  The present Schedule adds a large number of articles which are to be subject to customs duty, necessitating an increase of £2,000,000, and when that is compared with the increase in the general wages bill in industries covered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Census of Production, between the years 1931 and 1934, the wages bill of £4,200,000 rose only by £730,000 as a result of the industrial development brought about by tariffs, so that the people have been paying increased customs duties, amounting to £2,000,000, between March, 1933, and March, 1936. The Census of Production for 1934 shows that only £730,000 of an increase in wages has been secured in industries governed by the Census of Production figures, accompanied by the fact that, in a large number of industries, the average amount of wages received by the workers has fallen.  The figures also disclose the fact that the capacity of our people to buy the necessaries of life has fallen, so that the burden of the additional customs duties is falling upon people whose capacity to purchase the ordinary necessaries of life, to the extent that they did before 1932, has substantially fallen.  Again it has to be pointed out that these duties are falling upon people whose capacity to buy boots, soap and hosiery, to the extent disclosed by the figures for 1933 and 1934, which is the last year for which statistics are available is less.  In 1933 they were able to spend £256,000 less on boots and in 1934, £387,000 less.</P>

In one year alone 120,000 dozen pairs of boots or shoes were bought at 17/4 a dozen.  The Minister has replied now just as he replied before to criticism on this point, but I have yet to see his reply to the letter contributed to the Press about six weeks ago by Professor Duncan, a member of the commission inquiring into banking, currency and credit, which gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce another side-line on the boots situation, which he has very carefully refrained from answering.  Perhaps the Minister has something to say on the hosiery question, as to the quantity used being value for £229,000 less in 1933 and £140,000 less in 1934 than in previous years.  The Minister will admit that they are necessaries of life. Do not tell us that it is because civil servants are not wearing stockings.</P>

This bill is imposed upon them on the pretence that it is bringing about industrial development here but, in fact, the increased wages for the classes of industry created within three years is only one-third over what the increased bill for customs duties is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points raised by Deputies have been already adequately answered.  Deputy Mulcahy has obviously left out of account one very important consideration when he refers to the fact that the yield to the Exchequer from customs duty increased by £2,000,000.  He says that in effect the people had to pay £2,000,000 more and therefore the customs duties were not worth having.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They had to pay £2,000,000 more but they had to pay an additional sum for native products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will readily appreciate that money that comes into the Treasury does not stop in it.  It goes out to meet the cost of government, the cost of social services.  If that £2,000,000 did not come from customs duties it would have to come from some other form of taxes.  It is surely better, if people have to contribute <Col N="542" /> taxes, that they should do so in a manner which helps development rather than a manner which retards it. The money required to meet the cost of government must be provided from some source and the fact that additional revenue came from customs duties does not mean that unnecessary taxation was raised.  It merely means that taxation was raised in one way rather than in another.  Deputy Mulcahy is not quite honest when he quotes figures showing the decrease in the total amount spent on boots, shoes, hosiery and clothing when in fact he has had supplied to him figures showing that the actual number of boots and the actual quantity of hosiery and clothing used has increased.  It is our desire to encourage the increased use of clothing.  We may desire to make this country one of the brightest spots on earth but we have no ambition to turn it into a garden of Eden.  For the moment our aim is to achieve the development of industry by encouraging the people to use more clothes. Perhaps at a later date that policy may be reversed.  Deputy Morrissey was entirely incorrect in his statement concerning the possible effect of the First Schedule or in stating that there is any article made subject to duty by the First Schedule, that is not at present made, or that will not at some future time be made in the Saorstát. There is no article made subject to duty by the First Schedule the importation of which will be necessary for the purposes of the relief works to which he refers.  The whole effect of the Schedule as regards revenue to the State will be negligible.  In fact the estimated yield of all the duties is about £14,000 so the Deputy can be quite satisfied that the whole design behind the First Schedule is a protective one and has nothing to do with balancing the Budget or increasing the surplus of the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that nothing is made subject to duty under this Schedule which is not going to be produced in this country. I should like to join issue with him on that statement and for the purpose of illustration I would refer to the first items in the Schedule&mdash;plaster of Paris, Keene's cement and Parian cement. The Minister in explaining the articles on which it was proposed to impose a duty gave a very clear and a very concise definition of these articles.  The duties were intended, as far as I am aware, to assist the production of certain articles that are being manufactured in this country.  I do not propose to quarrel with his statement in that respect but I should like to call his attention to the fact that there are a number of items which you might call border-line cases.  It is only by analysis one can discover what these items are.  The chemical analysis of most products imported into this country is well known and can be pretty easily got.  It is merely a question of the Government taking up the analysis to see if the statements made regarding these articles is correct.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that practically nothing that is classed as a border-line case has got through since these duties were imposed.  I would suggest to him that it is up to the Government as they have put a duty on these articles, when these articles are put up to them for analysis, either to say that they agree with the statement of what these articles are supposed to contain or to give their own analysis of them.  They should not hold up a number of items indefinitely by merely saying that they are dutiable and that it is a matter that must be gone into. That is as far as reference No. 1 is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we come to reference Nos. 20, 21 and 22, which refer to paper and printing.  Again, I do not wish to embarrass the Minister's efforts to give employment and to create industries here, but I should like to say that nothing creates such discontent as to put duties on certain articles which are not manufactured here, and which cannot be substituted for articles manufactured <Col N="544" /> here when the public are unable to discriminate on the question of whether they are manufactured here or not.  They merely have a vague idea that the Minister must be profiteering &mdash;when I say the Minister I mean the Government&mdash;at the expense of the Irish consuming public.  As an instance of that, I should like to mention two items.  The Minister talked of a duty on photographic apparatus and sensitised paper, as brought in here.  He gave me the impression&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that photographic sensitised paper, either bromide or gaslight paper, is not made by any manufacturer in this country.  I do not wish to quarrel with the stationers, who have a legitimate protection for their goods, but if you dare to print the word &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; on the back of a piece of sensitised paper or card, it is liable to a 50 per cent. duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not under this section; but it is paper all the same. That is an illustration of what is going on under this section and other sections. I merely wish to point that out, as an illustration.  Sensitised paper is brought in, but because it has the word &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; on the back of it, it is classed as stationery, and is liable to a duty of 50 per cent.  I am rather afraid that, in spite of the Minister's protest, the Government are very pleased to say, &ldquo;We are protecting Irish manufacture by the swings, and any we miss on the swings we catch on the roundabouts by some comprehensive tariff.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another illustration of what I mean is this: In the sale of stocks of sensitised paper, certain manufacturers throughout the world have the habit of printing their own proprietary name upon the paper.  That is considered a protection for the public and others.  But what is done here? Instead of looking upon the fact that there is no sensitised paper made in this country, the fact that there is printed on the back of the paper some words by movable type, makes it subject to 10 or 15 per cent. increased duty.  I would like to ask the Minister to be more precise in his definitions. <Col N="545" /> There is no advantage to the public either in increasing the duty on the necessaries of life, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, or on the amenities of life, as Deputy Morrissey mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to call attention to, and that is item 32.  We have a very comprehensive Schedule there, almost a Schedule within a Schedule.  I know one firm coming into the Saorstát, and it is intended to give them protection under this, but I would like to ask the Minister to give a guarantee that any firm carrying on business in this country will be in no worse position for obtaining articles not manufactured in this country than the later comers.  Nothing creates such a position of discontent as to find that people coming in later can obtain facilities that others cannot obtain.  These are the few observations I desire to make upon the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the First Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECOND SCHEDULE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part I, in columns 2 and 4, to delete the figures 18/8 in each case in which they occur, and substitute therefore the figures 14/- and to make consequential amendments elsewhere in Part I of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is contained in the wording of the amendment itself, and is intended to reduce in some part the duty that has been imposed on sugar.  The present Government, since they came into office, have increased the duty on sugar from 11/8 to 21/-.  The Minister for Finance, in this Bill, has taken 1/4d. off that day.  The total increase on sugar amounted to 1d. per lb.  The reduction made by the Minister takes ¼d. per lb. off the duty and my amendment seeks to still further reduce that duty.  I think it will be admitted, as was, in other times, contended by the Minister very strongly, that this duty inflicts a hardship upon the people, and particularly upon the poor.  I think I can recollect the present Minister for <Col N="546" /> Finance, when in opposition, making a very strong case against the then price of sugar in this country.  We know that sugar is a commodity which is used in every household and, perhaps, more largely in the houses of the poor, because of conditions known to everyone, than in the houses of better off people.  Of course, the matter is aggravated by the fact that, alongside the very substantial increase in the present price of sugar, the Government has also put a duty of 4d. per lb. on tea.  I do not propose to delay the House in this matter, but I say the reduction I ask for in this amendment is comparatively small and reasonable.  If the amendment were carried it would leave the duty on sugar still higher by 4/8 than when the present Government came into office.  The amendment speaks for itself, is quite clear, and if accepted would relieve somewhat the very sharp advance that has been made recently in the cost of living in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The increase in the cost of sugar has inflicted a very serious hardship on a very considerable section of the people and particularly on the poorer section.  But I approach this matter from a different angle, and that is to call attention to the effect it will have upon traders in towns situated along the Border. Sugar and flour are two essential commodities very extensively used.  At the present time the price of both articles is very much higher in the Free State than in Northern Ireland. One can see at a glance the temptation this is to smuggle.  As a result of the wholesale smuggling going on, in sugar and flour, traders in these towns have been very badly hit.  With sugar at its present price in the Free State, it is only natural to assume that traders have lost a very considerable portion of the trade they did with people living on the other side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself knows the geographical position of these towns as well as I do.  He knows Dundalk was the natural market town for that Northern hinterland right up almost to Armagh.  During the past few years, <Col N="547" /> with the increase in the price of sugar, this trade has gone almost entirely to Newry.  The result is that, to my own knowledge, traders in the northern portion of Dundalk have suffered considerable loss.  Some of them have been forced out of business altogether. As a matter of policy, I think it should be the duty of the Government, leaving out all other considerations, and seeing the peculiar position of this country owing to the Border, to see that the price of certain commodities in the Free State should not be greater than the price obtaining for the same commodities in Northern Ireland.  That is an aspect of the situation which I commend to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  He himself knows the position.  The difference in price as between the Free State and Northern Ireland for sugar and flour is too great at present.  The result is that a very considerable share of the trade of towns along the Border, not alone in County Louth, but in County Monaghan, County Cavan, County Leitrim and County Donegal, is lost to them. For those reasons I support the amendment, even though I know it will not pass.  Possibly, the Minister cannot see his way to effect a reduction, but I should like to bring the other aspect of the matter to his notice.  It should be the duty of this or any other Government so to arrange matters in future that the prices of the commodities I have mentioned would be no greater than the prices existing for the same commodities in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was dealing with sugar taxation on the Budget, he gave us some indication as to what the sugar duty and the Government's general sugar policy mean to the people.  He said on the 12th May:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On our present yearly consumption of sugar alone an all-round duty of 1¼d. would give us about £1,200,000.  We could bring our revenue from sugar up to that level quite easily therefore, and in addition reduce the present retail price of the article by 1¼d. per lb., if we were to do as is done across the Border&mdash;<Col N="548" /> import all the sugar we consume. But are we prepared to throw the beet fields back into pasture and leave our sugar factories to the rats and the moss?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister thus indicates to us that our people are going to pay £1,250,000 more than they need pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much more than that, as a matter of fact.  He says he could get a substantial addition to his revenue while reducing the actual price to the people by £1,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister reduces the price of the 104,000 tons of sugar consumed in the country by a 1¼d. per lb. retail, he will find that the people will have to pay £1,250,000 less than they would have to pay if the retail price were not so reduced.  The Minister will not deny that.  As well as giving them that reduction, he could get £1,250,000 into his revenue.  I take it that he is there referring to the difference between what he is now getting and what he would get &mdash;probably £300,000.  From the Minister's statement, I take it that he could save the people £300,000 in taxation and £1,250,000 in the price of sugar if he were to adopt the Northern Ireland position.  I indicated to the Minister, when dealing with this matter before on the Resolution, that when we take into consideration what the consumer is being over charged, and that the price of imported sugar has fallen, the amount the sugar consumer, as a taxpayer, has unnecessarily to make up is about £1,100,000 at the present time.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You are paying all this in der to provide substantial employment in agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He asks if we are prepared to throw the beet fields back into pasture and to leave the sugar factories to the rats and the moss.  Before the people had to pay this additional sum for sugar, the beet fields were not in pasture.  In the Province of Leinster last year, 18,079 acres of beet were grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1935.  For every 100 acres of beet grown there, there were only 25 acres additional tillage, because 75 of the acres which were growing beet in 1935 were previously growing turnips and mangolds.  Take the Province of Connacht.  There there were 13,427 acres of beet grown last year.  For every 100 acres of beet grown there, 90 acres were not in substitution of pasture, but in substitution of turnips, mangolds and potatoes.</P>
      <P>The people are paying this additional sum for sugar, not so much to put more people into employment in our fields in Leinster or in Connacht as to change the crops from turnips, mangolds and potatoes, to beet.  The figures have been reiterated here, and they will have to be reiterated until Ministers show that they realise their significance.  How hollow is the statement of the Minister about the beet fields going back to pasture, when we recollect that there were fewer agricultural labourers employed permanently last year than were employed in 1931.</P>
      <P>On top of the price that has to be paid by the ordinary consumer for sugar to fill in the gaps made by the general policy of the Government in the pockets of the farmers and the labourers&mdash;I should say that only a small portion of the moneys paid for sugar goes into their pockets&mdash;we have to pay £700,000 or £800,000 to maintain a Government which is costing £8,00,000 more this year&mdash;the first normal year&mdash;than it did before the Minister  set about helping the farmers and farm labourers.  Why is it necessary to pay all this money in order to induce people to turn from the growing of turnips and mangolds to the growing of beet?  I think the Minister shows great effrontery in asking the people to meet this bill and saying that, if they do not, our beet fields will go back in pasture, when, out of every 100 acrs of beet grown in the province of Connacht, 90 acres represented land which had been previously growing mangolds, turnips and potatoes.</P>

      <P>What are the facts about the sugar duty as it exists at the present moment?  I know that in the last year of the Cosgrave Administration Deputy Morrissey was so full of admiration for it that he threw in his lot with the then Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the position? In the year 1931-32 they introduced a Supplementary Budget.  That Budget was brought in in the autumn of that year when Deputy Morrissey was so filled, as I have said, with admiration for the tax policy of my predecessor that he declined to accept the Labour Party's Whip and attached himself to Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported them on the Public Safety Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And on the sugar duty&mdash;on the whole policy of the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government. What was the position then in regard to sugar?  In the year 1931-32 the total yield from sugar duty was £1,371,901, almost 50 per cent. more than it was for the year 1935-36, and about 120 per cent. more than it will be for the year 1936-37.  In 1935-36, the total yield from sugar duty was £954,825.  Of course, Deputy Morrissey will chime in and say that last year we got in taxes from tea £370,000.  The total yield from both tea and sugar was £1,324,825 for the year 1935-36, while the sugar duty alone in the year 1931-32 was £1,371,901.  For the current year it is estimated that our yield from both the customs and excise duty on sugar will be £625,000, and from tea £430,000 odd.  Out of the two together we expect to get <Col N="552" /> £1,055,000.  The total yield from both duties is to be compared with £1,371,901 for sugar duty in the year 1931-32.  That sum was collected from the people by the Administration which Deputy Morrissey supported in 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider this: in the year 1931-32 &mdash; for the greater part of the year&mdash;the customs duty on sugar was 1¾d. per lb.  We are now reducing the duty so that the customs duty on it will be 2d. per lb.  But in the year 1931-32 the excise duty on home manufactured sugar was ½d. per lb.  After the 1st August this year it will be ¼d. per lb.  Moreover, in the year 1931-32, almost 83 per cent. of the sugar consumed in this country was charged at the higher rate of duty of 1¾d. per lb., and only 17 per cent. was charged at the ¼d. rate per lb.  In the current year the position is almost the exact opposite, for 80 per cent. of the sugar consumed here will be charge at the rate of ¼d. per lb., that is a rate of duty which is 50 per cent. below what was charged by the administration which Deputy Morrissey then supported, and only about 20 per cent. of our sugar consumption will be charged at the rate of 2d. per lb.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from the act that, as I have said, the revnue has not been the gainer by the change, the more important matter to consider is, who has been the gainer.  Of course, as usual, one examines Deputy Mulcahy's fibres&mdash; some of these rash statements he makes in the House&mdash;one will find tit the Deputy is not quite corret.  He stated that I said that not merely could we bring the sugar duties up to £1,200,000, but that also I admitted that sugar consumers were paying £1,250,000 unnecessarily for sugar.  I asked him what was the basis for that, and he told me the basis of the calculation was an approximate sugar consumption of 104,000 tons per annum and, an unqualified statement apparently, that sugar could be reduced by a 1¼d. per lb.</P>

Even taking it on that basis, the Deputy is not correct, <Col N="554" /> because 1¼d. per lb. on 104,000 tons does not come to £1,250,000.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose Deputy Mulcahy does not take a great deal of interest in the efforts of his colleague, Deputy Dillon, in this House. But, on the 30th April last, Deputy Dillon asked some very searching questions as to the production of sugar and sugar beet in 1934-35 and 1935-36.  The information he got seems not to have been too satisfactory from his point of view, because Deputy Dillon, who used to be very eloquent about the iniquities of this sugar tax, has been strangely silent throughout the whole of the Budget discussions in regard to this question of sugar. He had embarrassed himself by getting a certain amount of information which, from his point of view, was undesirable. That is possibly why the Opposition recently have changed their tactics in regard to these Budget discussions, because now they make a point of coming in uninformed in regard to the matters which they propose to debate and then fling questions at the Minister asking for information which ought to have been extracted, as this information was extracted in regard to sugar by Deputy Dillon, by way of Parliamentary question and answer.  At any rate, what do we learn?  That in the year 1935-36, as I have said, the total amount of revenue collected by the Exchequer from the sugar tax <Col N="555" /> amounted to £954,000 odd, as against &mdash;again I must emphasise it&mdash;£1,371,901 collected in 1931-32.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the customs duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is customs and excise.  The total amount collected in customs duty was £1,331,000 in 1931-32, and the amount collected in excise duty was £40,889.  If the Deputy wants a little more statistical information he can find that in 1935-36 the customs collection was £653,000 odd, and the excise collection £301,772.  In any event, the total sum paid to the growers of beet delivered in the year 1935-36 was £1,055,000, and the total freightage, excluding deliveries under the private arrangements of the growers, in the year 1935-36 was £153,295.  If we add these two figures what do we get?  We find that this extra £1,213,000, to be exact, which Deputy Mulcahy ought to have used instead of his figure of £1,250,000 when he was trying to decry the advantages which the cultivation of sugar beet under the new conditions has brought to the farmers, and which represents, even at a price of 1¼d. per lb., the total amount which we ask the consumers of sugar in this country to pay to implement the Government policy of producing all the sugar that we require in this country, as against the position in Northern Ireland, where no sugar is produced, but is all imported, is offset to the extent of £1,209,000 by the amount paid to the growers of beet here and the amount paid to the public carriers for freightage. That takes no account of the amount distributed in wages to workers in the factories, nor to those who are making the ancillary requirements of these factories, such as the sugar bags, those who are producing the lime used for cleansing the sugar, those who are producing the coal, almost all of it from Irish mines, which is now being burned in the factories of the sugar company and the hundred and one other people who find employment in the subsidiary industries which are dependent upon these sugar factories. That is the real position in regard to <Col N="556" /> this article of sugar.  Again I say the Government will this year in taxation get much less than one half of what was collected from sugar, mainly imported sugar at the high rate of 1¾d. per lb. of a customs duty, by the Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael Administration in 1931-32.  In addition to whatever else the Irish sugar consumer has to pay by way of an increased price for that article, remember this: that, at the best or at the worst, it is not more than a 1/2d. per lb. dearer to-day than it was in 1931-32.  The average price of sugar in February, 1936, was 3¾d. per lb.  The price in February, 1931-32, was 3¼d. per lb.</P>

      <P>That has got nothing to do with it, because there is no guarantee that the world price will remain at anything like its present depressed level.  We have made ourselves virtually independent of the world supply, and if there were to be again disturbed conditions on the Continent of Europe such as there were during the period 1914-1918, the people of this country would be very glad that we are able to produce all our requirements of sugar out of the beet fields of the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the white elephants will now defend this country.  The Minister talks very often about the changes of other people.  I do not know who was responsible for the phrase: &ldquo;The zeal of the convert,&rdquo; but I often wonder how it was coined without the person who coined it having some knowledge of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister has been converted in a good many ways, but in none has he shown more zeal than in relation to this particular matter.  He now tells us about all the figures.  Naturally, he devoted practically the whole of his speech to the effect of this tax on the revenue. Just before he sat down, the Minister spoke a few words about the real point at issue in which I and most members <Col N="557" /> of the House are concerned, and that is the effect of the price of sugar on the consumer.  The Minister took Deputy Mulcahy to task about the accuracy of his figures.  The Minister said that the price of sugar in February, 1930, was 3¼d. per lb., but when he was asked where he got that figure he did not reply.  As far as we have been able to get figures, they go to show that the ruling price then was 3d. per lb.  The Minister quoted the figure of £1,213,000 and the figure £1,250,000.  I am sure the taxpayers will be relieved to know that there is a difference between these two figures of £37,000.  The Minister then proceeded to tell Deputy Mulcahy that he ought to be more accurate about his figures.  I suggest to the Minister that the taxpayers would be far more relieved if he would now produce the £2,000,000 that he promised them as soon as he had the opportunity of making a careful and minute inspection of the Estimates.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the consumers of sugar in this country are now paying ¾d. a lb. more for their sugar than they had to pay in 1930.  The Minister, in his reply to Deputy Mulcahy, spoke about the substitution of crops, but his statement on that was not supported by any evidence whatsoever.  There was simply the Minister's statement and nothing to support it.  The Minister, having started on that line, soon realised that he was treading on very soft ground, and he blundered on to tell the House that there was a 100 per cent. increase.  Would the Minister produce some proofs in support of his statement?  The figures quoted by Deputy Mulcahy were figures supplied to members of the House by Government Departments.  Deputies, no matter what Party they belong to, if they come from the rural areas and are in touch with rural conditions, know quite well that it is largely substitution of crops that has taken place and that there has been no actual increase in tillage.  They also know quite well why farmers are growing beet at all at the price and under the conditions in which it has to be grown at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about the <Col N="558" /> amount of employment given.  The growing of beet certainly gives a certain amount of employment, but no thanks are due to the Minister for that. If the Minister had his way at one time there would be no sugar produced in this country at all, so that we would be absolutely dependent on outside countries for our supplies.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to address himself to the net point before us and that is the price that has to be paid for sugar by the consumer, and particularly when regard is had to the fact that tea has been taxed to the extent of 4d. per lb.  The Minister's statement had very little bearing on the net point before the House, which is whether the consumer is going to get any reduction in the price that he is now compelled to pay for sugar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a great song and dance out of the fact that in 1931-32 the Revenue got out of sugar the sum of £1,371,900, and that he was only going to get this year £625,000.  Let us examine that statement. According to the Minister's statement, at the period he refers to, the people were paying out of their pockets £500,000 less for the sugar they bought, and the Revenue was getting £1,300,000, or £746,900 more than the Minister is able to get now. Let us count the losses there.  To-day the people are losing £500,000 out of their pockets, and the Revenue is losing £746,000 which it is taking out of the people's pockets in another way, not to talk at all about what the people are losing if we compare the position here with the world price of sugar.  Take all these factors into consideration. At present the people are losing £500,000 out of what they pay for their sugar; they are losing £746,000 out of what they pay by way of tax to make up the hole in the Minister's Budget, and they are losing in addition £450,000 because they ignore the world price in regard to sugar, so that the people are paying to-day £1,700,000 unnecessarily for sugar.  If the Minister thinks that is not a fair figure to be taking in round figures, then I will give him the exact figure, which is £1,696,900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The Minister says that we should not shut our eyes to the fact that the farmers are getting £1,213,000.  When you take that amount out of the farmers' pockets, if they have it in their pockets, they are going to have that much less, but if there is an absolute addition of £1,213,000 to the farmers' income for the purpose of their own use and for the purpose of agricultural labourers' wages, why is it that at a time when they are getting that income, compared with a time when they had not such an income, the agricultural labourers' wages bill is down by £1,000,000 a year, that there are less permanent labourers employed on agriculture throughout the year, and that we have 63,562 more acres under grass?  The Minister and his colleagues used to refer to the previous Minister for Agriculture as the Minister <Col N="560" /> for Grass.  Here we have a Ministry for more grass.  Do not let the Minister obscure himself or attempt to obscure the public as to what the situation is.  You have less permanent agricultural labourers, substantially reduced agricultural wages, a substantial increase in grass, and the people paying £1,700,000 more for their sugar than they need pay.  That sums up the whole position.</P>

    <P>The object of the amendment is, I understand, to reduce the licence duty paid by licensed grocers and vintners from one-half to one-third of the valuation. The present licence was fixed at a time when the number of hours available for trading were far greater than the number available at present and when the volume of trade was at least double what it is at the present time.  Members of the House will realise that the quantity of beer, wine and spirits now sold has decreased by, roughly, 50 per cent. in the last 12 years and, of course, hours of trading have been considerably reduced. It is contended that many of the traders who in former years found little hardship in paying the licence duty find to-day that there is considerable hardship entailed in meeting it.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country in the last ten or 15 years a number of traders have expended fairly considerable sums in improving their premises, carrying out improvements that in many cases were very necessary.  As a result, their valuations were increased, very substantially in some instances, and that means higher rates and an increase in the licence duty. The Minister, for what appeared to him to be very good reasons, refused certain concessions sought by the licensed trade during the course of this year on the ground that the loss to the revenue would be very substantial <Col N="561" /> and that that loss could not be met in other ways this year.  I am informed by Deputy Rice that the loss to the Government through the granting of this concession will not be very considerable. I daresay the Minister has the exact figure as to what the concession would cost, but my information is that it would not be a very considerable figure.  That being so, I think the Minister ought to consider accepting this amendment in view of the fact that the present licence was fixed at a time when traders were doing nearly double their present trade and when the hours available for trading were considerably greater.</P>

      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of the amendment proposed by Deputy Morrissey. It is well known to the Minister, as it is to everybody in the community, that not only have the hours of opening been reduced, but that the volume of trade has diminished almost to vanishing point in several rural towns.  In fact, in the case of some of those poor people who try to eke out a wretched existence in a publichouse in the country this tax is appalling and intolerable. Some people seem to consider that a publican is the devil's fishing rod, that he is a man to be shunned and be anathema maranatha.  As a matter of fact, some of the decentest members of the community are publicans. I should like to bring before the Minister the outstanding fact that during the Land League agitation, which I well remember, in the fight against landlordism&mdash;and a fierce struggle it was&mdash;the farmers had no sounder or more faithful allies than the publicans in the towns and also the workers in the towns.  I need hardly say that the congregated toilers of the towns can always put up a better and a bigger fight than the scattered tillers of the fields.  I think, in view of their services to that agitation and to nationality in these days and since the publicans deserve some consideration, and I hope that if the Minister can do it without putting any undue burden on the other members of the community and without disrupting in any considerable way his Budget proposals, he will hearken to and favourably consider this appeal of the <Col N="562" /> publicans, most of whom, as I have said, are very respectable people, law-abiding, well-conducted and good citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of things attached to the licence duty at the present time, and I am just referring to the annuity in respect of compensation payable on redundant licences.  I think that is a relevant matter.  This Act, which formed the idea of wiping out licences and paying compensation raised off the surviving licensed traders on the grounds that their trade would be increased by the wiping out of those so-called redundant licences, was not passed by the Fianna Fáil Government, and I am not blaming them for that at all.  I do not want the Minister to think that I am not trying to throw any asmhucháin on him on account of that.  I want to point out that there is a big falling off in trade, and a great hardship on the existing publicans in some parts of the country who have to meet the annuity for compensation payable to other publicans whose trade they did not get because the trade had ceased to exist.  It was found at the time that this Act was not necessary.  The publicans began to obliterate themselves owing to loss of trade, and that Act was never persisted in, so that any publicans who went out of business by force of circumstances got no compensation. It is, therefore, unfortunate that those few who are now paying this compensation should still be saddled with it.  The Minister cannot give them any big relief owing to the operation of the law, which he is bound <Col N="563" /> to carry out, but if he accepted this amendment he could make things easier for them.  I think this is the only practical way in which it could be done, and I suggest to the Minister that he should give sympathetic consideration to this amendment.  I do not know exactly what would be the amount of money lost to the revenue, but it would be small, and would be a great consideration to those people who are very hard hit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  As I said the other day on other amendments, I base this case not on the cost, but on the question of justice.  Here is a section of the community, as Deputy Burke has said, who have rendered great service to this country.  If you take all the sections of the community that were involved in the national struggle, no section of the community contributed more to the war chest than they did. I could go on and deal with their contributions in regard to the development of this State, but every Deputy knows them.  As I said already, I base this case on justice.  I referred the other day to the taxation in this matter; there is an increase of 1,190 per cent. over 1914.  We had a new Licensing Act which greatly reduced the hours of business and, of course, from a business point of view some of its provisions looked silly.  To have a business house closed in the afternoon, at perhaps the busiest time of the day, strikes me from a practical point of view as leading to disorganisation of the business.  You have a trader opening at 10 o'clock in the morning and closing the door for an hour or two in the afternoon, while the employer and employees go out and come back in again, and this hide and seek proceeds during the day.  That is a serious handicap to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the portion of the Licensing Act prescribing for the abolition of redundant licences.  I took part in the courts at the hearing of some of those cases, and I have never seen anything more farcical.  A certain number of traders were notified that their licences were to be abolished. They came along to the circuit court <Col N="564" /> and then valuers were brought in to put a face on things by valuing the trade done in those houses proposed to be abolished.  The thing was a huge farce.  Even taking the best value that some valuer plus the man who owned the business could put on the place the thing was ridiculous, and yet they were awarded a certain sum, and it was levied on those people for a trade which did not exist.  The trade of those houses was already dead.  If the Act were not there at all the principle of the survival of the fittest would have applied, and those houses would have naturally died, but yet the cost of that compensation was put on the remaining publicans.  Surely a body of people like these are entitled to say as of right&mdash;it is a question of justice &mdash;that the State should not continually and perpetually year after year come along with a milestone of taxation, and have no other use for them except to be the milch cow for the Exchequer. When you look at the figures of increased taxation they are so appalling and overwhelming that the one result which must inevitably follow from them is that trade will be practically extinguished.  Should not the Minister take that into consideration? Does he not think it wiser to take the long view in this matter, and to give them some small relief?  The question of reducing the figure on which the licence duty will be assessed from half to one-third is a very meagre thing.  I hold no brief for those people in particular, but I hold a brief for justice for every section of the community, and since our native Parliament was established in this country the people who did their own part and more than their own part in providing the sinews of war have got nothing but the milestone of taxation around them.  I think those people can justly claim that they have been badly treated, and are entitled to some relief.  I think the relief asked for by this amendment is a meagre one, and I would ask the Minister to grant it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  In supporting it I do not propose to describe the persons engaged in that particular occupation as being the milch cows of the State, because perhaps they <Col N="565" /> have done a certain amount of milking themselves, and the brew which the cows produce may not always be as favourable as that of Deputy Bennett's cattle.  I do feel that they have a case in equity, and I should like the Minister to take this matter seriously, as I know he will.  Taxation should be distributed as equitably as possible.  In whatever way the Minister brings in his Budget, or in whatever way the Finance Bill is drafted, some section or some party or some group will have a grievance.  In this particular case I think the Minister will agree with me that the licensed trade have a grievance.  It has already been said that the reduced hours of trade have interfered with their income.  In Paris, as the Minister knows, the hours are fixed on a very interesting basis, which perhaps he should take into consideration.  You can keep your tavern open as long as you like provided you pay for it and the public-house&mdash;if I may apply that term to Paris&mdash;is open till four or five in the morning, and they pay a tax or duty according to the number of hours it is open.  In this country, we have reduced the hours in which persons can ply their trade.  It certainly must be admitted that it is a sheltered or protected trade&mdash; nobody may sell spirits, or stout or beer here, or any of those other beverages that are so pleasant to some people, except with the permission of the Government.  It is, as I say, a sheltered and protected trade; but, sheltered and protected as it is, it should not be prosecuted and persecuted. It must be remembered that quite a number of the persons who are engaged in this business, not only in Dublin, but throughout the Free State, took on this business at a time when they could start work at 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning and continue until 11 o'clock at night, and at a time when the <i>bona fide</i> trade was on quite a different basis from that on which it is to-day.  The Government here to-day has restricted the rights of these people to carry on that trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began by saying that it was a sheltered and protected trade, but within that protection the trade has <Col N="566" /> been crushed and bruised more and more in recent years as a result of the causes I have mentioned.  The hours of opening in that trade now are later in the morning and the hours of closing are earlier in the evening, and I do feel that there is really a case to be made for this particular trade.  I am not talking now about the price of beer or stout or any of the other beverages sold by these people.  I am speaking purely of the equities in the case.  I am speaking of the equities in the case of the man who has been engaged in a trade for many years&mdash;a protected trade, if you like&mdash;but a trade that is now bruised and crushed.  I think there is an equity there that the Minister ought to recognise and that this is an amendment the Minister ought to accept.  Whatever might be said about the resolution that, I am sure, the Minister got with regard to the danger of reducing the price of drink&mdash;resolution that, I am sure, he received as well as people on these benches received, to the effect that he and his collagues on those benches, as well as we on these benches, would go to the devil if the Minister reduced the price of drink&mdash;I suggest that that does not arise in this case at all.  It has nothing to do with the case.  The customer does not arise in this case. As a matter of fact, it is the absence of customers that constitutes the equity of this case, as I put it to the Minister.  I am concerned with the trader himself.  The trader has been in that particular business for years, and we crushed him out of it.  When I use the word &ldquo;we,&rdquo; I mean the Oireachtas&mdash;the Dáil, the Government. The Government has ordered that the trader in this particular business may not open his door before 10 o'clock in the morning and that he must close his door at 10 o'clock in the evening.  It is on that ground that I appeal to the Minister.  I ask the Minister to realise the equities of the situation and also to remember that this would not cost very much to the Exchequer.  It would not interfere with the Minister's budgetary arrangements.  If it did interfere&mdash;if it were, so to speak, a major problem&mdash; I should feel that I should not speak <Col N="567" /> on the subject.  In that connection, by the way, I wonder would the Minister tell us what it would amount to?</P>

Although I say that, I am not denying that there is a problem here that will have to be faced some day or by some Administration. I agree that there is a problem, but I cannot deal with it, this year anyhow. In this connection, also, it must be remembered that we are not responsible for either the legislation or the restrictions to which the licensed trade is subjected at the present moment.  I do not wish to be misunderstood here. I do not wish it to be understood that I think there is any great merit in imposing conditions that make it impossible for the trade to carry on.  As I say, the conditions under which the publican has to carry on his trade to-day have deteriorated as compared with the years 1918, 1919 and 1920, but it must be remembered also that the conditions are no worse than they were any time during the past six or seven years.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act of 1935 imposed a tax of 5/- a cwt. on slabs formed of cement not otherwise liable to duty.  Reference No. 20 includes under that tax slates and slabs, and I understand from persons engaged in the building industry that it puts a substantial burden on some of their costs.  The Minister may indicate that he is extending this duty <Col N="570" /> in order to protect the cement industry that is going to be established here, but the argument I heard put up was that slates and sheets made from cement are not available and are not made here, and that the duty will substantially increase some of the cost of house-building.  A statement was published in the Press by certain house-builders stating that there is going to be an increase of 4 per cent. in the cost of houses.  There is a point as to why this tax is being put on before these things are actually being turned out by a cement factory here, and then the increase in the cost of house-building. In addition to the 4 per cent. increase in the cost of house-building the most recently published figures of the number of workers in the building industry who are unemployed show a remarkable increase so that from that point of view alone this matter is worthy of consideration, and I should like to hear the Minister's comments.  It is just another sample of the type of procedure adopted very often by the Minister.  An industry is going to be established here, a tariff is put on, and that raises costs immediately, but the revenue picks up a couple of pounds, and by the time the industry is started the people are accustomed to paying a substantially increased price.  It is very ingenious but a very brutal way of developing industry.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Mulcahy is reading more into this than is in it.  It is being introduced merely as an alteration in the definition, because of the difficulty of distinguishing tiles and slates from slabs and sheets.  There is no difficulty in manufacturing these things.  The duty has nothing to do with the establishment of factories for the manufacture of cement.  These slates and sheets are at present manufactured from imported cement by a number of firms, and will no doubt be manufactured from home-produced cement. The main reason for this reference is to meet an administrative difficulty, due to the fact that customs officers found a difficulty in distinguishing one class of slabs and sheets from tiles and slates.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that there is no difficulty in making these things.  That is quite common in modern industry and apparently quite true, yet certain industries seem to become specialised in certain places for no apparent reason.  I can understand the Minister's difficulty about separating a slate from a slab, but surely the question of size enters into it.  I am not aware that asbestos cement slabs are manufactured in this country, but if the Minister has better information I suppose he will not mind mentioning the manufacturers.  This is another instance of what I referred to earlier, to which, by the way, the Minister did not reply, as to the cost involved where duties are imposed to protect tiles which are being made here, and extended to cover slabs that might be described as tiles.  The duty is then extended to large sheets and slabs which are not made here, but the Government is going to get revenue or to force builders to use home-produced material which, while it can be used, may not be as useful. The asbestos cement slabs are vermin proof, rot proof and also rat proof.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate provides for the sum immediately required for the development of Clonsast bog.  I mentioned some time ago in this House the intention to proceed with the development which arose as a result of the report made by a delegation which visited the Continent last year to investigate certain aspects of the turf industry and the further investigations pursued subsequently in the matter by the Turf Development Board.  The Government came to the conclusion that we ought to endeavour to secure that a beginning would be made in the development of Irish bogs along the lines pursued by certain German companies on bogs in Germany.  In principle, the method pursued is no different to that carried on by Sir John Grffith at his bog at Turraun for a number of years, but certain advances in practice and technique have been made, and it is intended to <Col N="575" /> incorporate these into the efforts pursued along the same lines here.  It is intended to undertake a large-scale development of Irish bogs along these lines, and, as a first step to that end, it is proposed to provide the Turf Development Board with the necessary capital to acquire and develop the bog known as Clonsast bog, which is situated about four miles north of Portarlington.  That bog is about 4,000 acres in extent, and will be developed to provide for a production of about 120,000 tons per annum.  It is estimated that the total capital required for the venture will be about £162,000, in addition to a sum of £33,000 for working capital.  These sums will provide for the purchase of the bog, the purchase of the necessary machinery, the drainage of the bog, and the erection of buildings.  Money will also be expended on the construction of bog railways and electrical power lines.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to advance that money to the Turf Development Board at 4¾ per cent. interest, and the Board have undertaken to repay the money over a period of 25 years.  In the selection of the bog and the planning of the operations the Board have had the technical assistance of a German expert familiar with the method of carrying out similar work in Germany. Drainage operations on the bog will commence at once.  They have, in fact, commenced, but it will be about three years before the bog is likely to be in production.  The sum now asked for in the Supplementary Estimate is to provide the cost of purchasing the bog, the cost of the initial drainage operations and for the erection of buildings. The Government has been impressed by the potentialities of this system of production as a method of lessening unemployment in many parts of the country.  The work to be done at Clonsast will provide immediately employment for a number of people, which will increase in each year.  In the course of the present year it is anticipated that an average of 130 men will be employed, increasing in the next year by 100, and in the third year to something less than 400 men.  When <Col N="576" /> the bog is in full production it is estimated that 600 men will be employed in seasonal operations and 200 permanently all the year round.</P>
    <P>These figures should allay the idea that has been expressed in some quarters that the mechanical production of turf will displace labour.  The turf machines macerate the turf, mixing the top and the bottom sods, and give a uniform quality of turf from the one bog, which it is not possible to obtain in hand-won turf.  It is the Government's intention gradually to extend this system of production throughout the country, but it should be realised in that connection that before a bog can be proved suitable for the machine-winning of turf, an exceedingly detailed survey must be made both of the outfall drains of the bog, the quality of the turf and the floor bed of the bog.  The Turf Board are endeavouring at present to secure suitable bogs for similar work in the west and south-west.  It is their intention to extend their operations into those areas subsequently, but of course no part of the money now asked for is expenditure to cover any cost arising from such development.  In fact, the amount of this Vote is intended to meet the initial cost arising in connection with Clonsast bog in Leix; the subsequent amount, up to the full sum I have mentioned, will be voted as required. The whole sum is repayable, and interest will be charged on advances of the various sums which are made available from the dates of the advances.  The purpose is, as I have mentioned, to provide employment as required, and to establish here large scale operations on lines which have proved, where started, to have been successful, and which will result in a considerable extension in production.</P>

      <P>While this is only voting money in this particular way, money which is expected to be paid back, nevertheless, in view of the importance the Minister is attaching to the turf production industry, and in view of the importance which he no doubt attaches to a scheme involving so much money, which is to be expended in that way, we would like a little more information on the matter. Beyond the remarks he made at the end of his statement that the top of the turf bank is to be macerated and mixed with the bottom, we have no information at all as to what exactly is to be done.  The Minister simply told us that there was a mission sent to Germany on this matter, and that they brought home something that impressed him.  But we have no report as to what they saw, or what they propose. If the Minister is so impressed by them as to start this venture on which he is going to spend so much money, I think we ought to hear the outlines of this scheme.  They told him that the top is to be macerated and mixed with the bottom, and the only thing he told us is that he is going to proceed along these lines which are adopted in Germany.  He told us that that was not different, in purpose, from what was done at Turraun, but there was some difficulty in technique between what is done in Germany and what is done in Turraun.  He told us that on the German lines there are going to be large scale operations carried out here.  I think that in connection with an industry in respect of which so much is attempted here, and to which the Minister attaches so much importance, and in view of the vesting of so much capital money in the scheme, and the hope that it is going to be a definite industry in the country, we ought to hear a little more about the practice and the technique of the work, and we ought to get an outline of what exactly is going to happen to the bogs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult for me to give anything like the technical exposition of the work involved.  It is similar in principle to that done at Turraun by Sir John Griffith.  I do <Col N="578" /> not know if the Deputy is familiar with what Sir John Griffith was doing at Turraun.  He succeeded in producing a quality of fuel superior to the ordinary hand-produced turf, but it was only produced at a price which made it uneconomic in relation to hand-won turf and coal.  Obviously it was necessary to have an examination into the question as to whether the method of working there could be modified so as to give better results.  Very valuable work of an experimental nature was done.  In fact, one of the recommendations was that Turraun should be acquired and extended and its operations carried on with greater financial resources than Sir John Griffith could make available and it was on that basis that an examination was undertaken. It was found that, subject to certain conditions&mdash;first, the carrying out of the operations on a larger scale than was possible at Turraun; second, the drainage of the bog in a more successful way than was achieved at Turraun, and, third, the utilisation of more up-to-date and efficient machinery than the Turraun machinery &mdash;it would be possible to get fuel produced superior in quality to the Turraun fuel and at a substantially lower price than was possible in the case of Turraun.  It was with the knowledge that that was being done in Germany, and successfully done, that the delegates went there.  They also went to Russia where large-scale turf development is occurring; but the nature of the peat in Russia is somewhat different from what it is here, and many of the mechanical methods adopted there would not be suitable or necessary in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The German practice appeared to be more suitable to our conditions, and it is with the advice of German experts that the development at Clonsast was prepared.  The process is mainly mechanical.  A machine, which is specially constructed for the purpose, is run on rails over the bog.  By a process of scooping the turf from the top and the bottom, simultaneously, it is macerated, pressed out and dried. The result is you get a better and more uniform fuel from the bog.  By carrying on the production, on a large scale, by continual process during the <Col N="579" /> season, costs can be kept down considerably so that the fuel can be made available at a cost that will make it very definitely attractive in regard to the price of other fuels with which it will be in competition.  It is only in a certain class of bogs that this process can be carried on.  There has to be a considerable extent of bog and the floor of the bog must be fairly even, which is not always the case.  Strange as it may be, there are hills and hollows in the floors of bogs which would make it impossible to operate this machine at all.  But given a bog of some extent, this process can be adapted and that is the reason we are proceeding to try it out.  I grant that the bog at Clonsast is one that appears to be one of the most favourable in the country for this experiment.  Possibly on that ground the success of the experiment made may not be a guarantee that that work done there would be equally successful on other bogs. But we feel when we get into the method, and gain the experiment that Clonsast will provide we will be able to adapt that knowledge to the circumstances and conditions of other bogs and that similar experiments can be carried out successfully in other areas.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I asked anything unreasonable of the Minister.  I think that he is treating the House in a most absurd way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not deal with that point.  The Deputy referred to the possibility of the report being published.  He will understand that it is not possible to do that when I say that the delegation were given information in confidence by private firms in Germany.  That information was available to the Turf Development Board and to the Government, but it was obtained on condition that it would not be published.  For that reason it is not possible to make the <Col N="580" /> report of the delegation available to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report made to the Minister may not be in a form that would be suitable for placing in the Library and I should not ask for the publication of the report unless the Minister was prepared to recommend that course.  I do think, however, that the report by the experts on the technical processes which are to be adopted here should be made available to the House.  On the question of producing fuel that will compete with other fuels, we ought to get the calculations on which the experts, in asking the Minister to assist them in financing the scheme, based their contention that the price will be economic.  I do not think that the Minister could expect anybody in the House to have any very close technical knowledge of what happened at Turraun.  The only thing we do know about Turraun is that when the Board of Assistance in Dublin City wanted to get turf, at the time when money was available for supply of free turf, the Lord Mayor was able to have coal delivered to poor people at a smaller price than the Board of Public Assistance were able to deliver Turraun peat to them.  That is the last information we had about the Turraun works, except that they went out of business because there was a preference for hand-won turf.  I think it is quite reasonable to ask to have a technical memorandum dealing with the new scheme made available to Deputies.  If the Minister wants interest taken in the scheme and if he wants the assistance of public opinion in carrying it out, I think he should comply with that request.  To refuse to do so rather prejudices the Minister's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the Tariff Commission is the investigating of tariffs, but the members of the Tariff Commission seem to be performing other functions as well. The members of the Tariff Commission are also members of the Merchandise Marks Commission; some members of it also constitute the Fruit and Vegetables Tribunal, and the Chairman, I understand, is also acting as Chairman of the Dairy Disposals Board, so that while they are not, I might say, fully engaged in Tariff Commission work they are fully engaged.  This particular Vote covers their activities under these three or four separate heads.  One of the members is also in charge of the Stationery Office, a Department of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be possible to relieve members of the Tariff Commission from some of their duties on these other bodies to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers, for the purpose of getting them to look at some tariffs that have been imposed.  For instance the Minister for Agriculture told us the other day that the Government had sent the <Col N="585" /> Muirchu over to some shipyard in Great Britain to have repairs carried out there, because the tenders for repairs that were received from the Dublin Dockyard were higher I think by 41 per cent. in one case and 66 per cent. in another case than the tenders sent in by the British dockyard.  On the other hand, that is equivalent to saying that a tariff of 41 per cent. or 66 per cent. was denied to the ship repairers or shipbuilders here in the city of Dublin as against an outside tender while the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Commerce with the greatest possible lightheartedness have been asking the Dáil week in and week out to put a tariff of 75 per cent. on cutlery and things like that in connection with cutlery assembling and a tariff of 100 per cent. on assembling of clocks.  Even to-day we had I think a tariff of 75 per cent. put on some clock cases and things like that.  If the position is that there are some heavy industries that we do require to have here, I think it would be worth while to ask the Tariff Commission at least to take up such cases as I have mentioned and to carry out an examination as to whether in fact it was the reasonable and correct thing to send the Muirchu out of this country for repairs rather than give a tariff as substantial as 66 per cent. to the ship repair workers here; and on the other hand to say if it was reasonable to give 100 per cent. protection to clock assemblers.  The tariff position is now settled, and rather definitely in some cases, behind high tariff walls and I think the time has come when the Tariff Commission should be relieved from some of their other duties in order to enable them to review the whole tariff situation as it exists and give us in greater detail than the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance is able to give us the case for preserving these tariffs at their present level.  There are certain things that can very well be compared and it does to my mind seem rather tinkering with industrial development if, as I say, wanting some heavy industries badly, we are to refuse this tariff to dockyard workers and <Col N="586" /> at the same time thinking we are performing the greatest national service, give 100 per cent. to the clock assemblers in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I am not questioning that at all.  At the moment so far as the Estimate is concerned, so far as the people concerned here are shown to be engaged in full-time work then the Estimate is all right but the Deputy has asked to what extent there has been any review as to the actual consequences of tariffs.  I remember when the tariffs were introduced under the previous régime that we were told they were for experimental purposes.  I certainly as a student was extremely interested in these tariffs and in their experimental purposes.  I did go to some trouble&mdash; and I was met with courtesy by the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;in attempting to find out what information had been obtained in relation to these experiments and what conclusion had been drawn from them.  I was at the time disappointed to find that there were no apparent recorded experiences in connection with them, and this is a thing I regard as a defect in relation to the tariffs introduced.  I think there should come a time when there should be some attempt to find out exactly the consequences of tariffs in particular and, if possible, from experiences of actual tariffs, to formulate some rules under which you could decide the question of tariffs.  I think the Deputy will agree that at the moment there are no agreed criteria under which you could estimate the value of tariffs. Governments in all countries are introducing tariffs on different degrees and varieties of articles apparently with no scientific basis at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning that.  The Deputy will agree that there will be no agreement in this House at the present moment on the matter of those criteria upon which tariffs could be imposed.  I agree that what the Deputy has said is one statement on the tariffs, but I am putting to him that until you have some agreed basis upon which tariffs can be judged you cannot set up that investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to have an answer to the question you must know that the important matter is the formulation of the terms of that question, and it is not the slightest use to assume that the Tariff Commission was in a position to do so.  Unless and until this House is agreed on the nature of the question to be put to the Tariff Commission, it would be impossible to put that question usefully to them.  I have, said it when in Opposition, and I say it now: that there should be the most critical examination of the results and activities of this kind, and I should like to see some method by which that could be done.  It is again evident that that could not be done because the Tariff Commission under the terms of reference which the Deputy regarded as good, but which I do not regard as good, required two or three years to investigate one single tariff.  If it is the policy of this House that this country should be effectively protected by tariffs, then it is perfectly obvious that the method used by the Tariff Commission would not meet the case&mdash;I am merely putting this to the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary misunderstands me, I think. I asked that the Tariff Commission be used now to see what actually has happened without going into what would happen if a tariff had gone on in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To ask the Tariff Commission to say what has happened means nothing.  The Tariff Commission would not know what you meant when you put them that question.  They would say that under this a whole series of industries has been started, X, Y and Z, a certain increase of wages has been distributed, a certain increase or decrease of prices has taken place in certain places.  They have ascertained that.  Are they then to be asked to decide whether that was right or whether it was wrong?  Are they to be asked to balance one against the other, or what are they to be asked to do? The returns of industrial production is an investigation of that kind from the most material point of view.  It shows in relation to every industry the increase in the distribution of wages; the increase and the use of material; the increase of prices of the commodities; the relation between manufacturings costs; and the relation between materials and total costs.  It seems to me that the returns of industrial production in relation to every industry give to the Deputy all the facts upon which he could formulate a case, if he desired to do so.  What it does not do is, it does not lay down any standard by which we can judge whether an increase of X in the price of a particular commodity being balanced by an increase of Y in the distribution of wages, a benefit is being obtained by the community and, if so, what is the amount of that benefit?</P>

      <P>Vote No. 10 deals purely with staffs.  It includes the staff which is used upon the administration of all schemes.  It specifically covers the staffs used on the administration of the relief schemes.  There is an increase of £13,788 this year which is practically all represented by an increase of staff. The net increase is accounted for by extra assistance under the provision of public works and buildings and new works, and with the necessity of providing the establishment branch with sufficient staff to meet the requirements of special works and to make provision in relation to the increase under unemployment schemes.  Previously the unemployment relief Vote did not bear the cost of its own administration. The cost of administration was charged up to the Office of Public Works.  This year, as the House is aware, there is a very large increase in the unemployment relief Vote to a sum of £1,565,000.  Provision is made <Col N="593" /> in that Vote this year for dealing with its administration.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Board of Works covers a huge variety of individual activities which it would be quite impossible to discuss in a general way.  This particular Vote is more or less put down so that Deputies who have any particular questions to ask in relation to the work done under the activities of the Board of Works may do so, and may also satisfy themselves that every possible progress is being made.</P>
      <P>The relief Vote of 1935-36, as Deputies are aware, consisted of a nominal sum of £500,000, and of a real sum of £350,000.  The difference between the total amount voted, and the part which was a re-vote, was due to schemes which were already in process of being carried out and of being financed from previous votes.  In this particular year the House has had a return in the form of maps and other particulars showing the complete distribution of that particular fund.  They have also had certain maps which were intended to be of an informative character&mdash;to enable them to criticise the fairness, the equality and the efficiency of the distribution of those funds relative to the condition of unemployment or distress, as the case may be, in the country.  These were put up for the purpose that Deputies would be in a position effectively and constructively to criticise the administration of that matter.  I need only say that any criticism of that kind which any Deputy can bring to our assistance will be regarded not in any way as a criticism but as a help.  Of the total of £371,000 available the sum of £142,000 was devoted to local government and public health schemes of one kind or another.  The distribution was about even between the counties and urban areas.  The sum of £25,000 was for land reclamation, seed oats, potatoes and matters of that kind.  The sum of £50,000 was allocated to peat, and £4,500 to minor mineral investigation. The Office of Public Works was given £125,000 for minor relief schemes, and a total of £20,000 for other schemes of various kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year there was made, as the <Col N="594" /> House is aware, an experiment in relation to another method of employment under the relief funds.  There has been expressed throughout the whole country, and very strongly, I think, by members of all Parties in the House, that both from the material advantages and the social advantages that would be gained, it was desirable that, as far as humanly possible, men who were getting unemployment assistance money should have the opportunity of doing work for it.  That problem was investigated purely as a problem, as to whether that could be done, and, if so, how it could be done, and what would be the reactions of one kind or another to the attempt.  The line of country which was adopted was that, in proportion to the amount of money which a person was receiving from the unemployment assistance fund, he should, in the form of standard wages for work for which he was fitted in his own district, be given the opportunity of earning a certain sum representing more than that unemployment assistance. The actual formula used was to take the value of the free beef which the unemployment recipient was getting and the amount of unemployment assistance which he was getting, and to add to that 40 per cent.&mdash;to give a man as near as we could the amount of work at the standard local rates which would mean that amount.  As Deputies can realise, it was not possible to do that with absolute accuracy in every case.  What I mean is that while one man might get a little more than the 40 per cent., another man might only get 39 per cent. in the actual working out of a scheme.  But, in practice, a very close approximation was obtained. It is obvious, under this scheme, that in a working month of 24 days different men would be getting different amounts.  They would be getting the same rate per day, but they would be getting a different number of days' employment.  Under some schemes it ran from a difference of 9 days in 24 to 16 days in 24.  That difference would seem to suggest some very difficult administrative problems for any one who had to try and do normal work with gangs which would apparently, vary in that manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> Another objection which was in our minds and in the minds of other people was that men under those circumstances would not work well; even if they wanted to work well, that the conditions of disorganisation and dislocation which would be represented by a condition of that kind would have very unfavourable reactions on the output from the scheme.  In practice none of the difficulties that were anticipated arose.  I may say that this experiment was carried out in seven counties, in two of the boroughs, in a couple of the smaller towns, under a variety of men and supervisors and in a great variety of conditions, the intention being to ascertain the facts. Somebody has defined an experiment as a question asked of nature.  These were questions asked of the whole social condition here, and all the administrative conditions, as to whether a plan of this kind could successfully, comfortably and with the agreement of those concerned, be put in operation. All I can say&mdash;and I had very intimate personal acquaintance with what was going on; I think I saw most of the schemes personally, and I had an opportunity of discussing them with those who supervised and worked on them&mdash;is that, from the point of view of showing that these things can administratively be done and done with the agreement and consent and co-operation of all concerned, the success of those experiments was absolute.</P>
    <P>The next question was whether the work itself was likely to be well done. Here again I can say from experience that the work was as well done under this system as it could be done under any system with the same men.  A further difficulty which arose was that it was suggested that, even when the administrative difficulties were got over, it would be only used upon work of a very elementary character.  Well, it has now embraced practically the whole ambit of possible local government activity, from the most elementary work in the sense of widening and straightening roads and clearing hedges, to the carrying out of a public health scheme, a scheme of sewerage under the strictest technical supervision. It certainly did not seem at <Col N="596" /> first sight that the rotational operation, men working two or three days a week, a gang which varied practically every day, would be the material which anyone would choose for the purpose of carrying out a technical scheme which had to measure up in the end, both financially and technically, to the highest possible and most critical standard.  We were fortunate in finding a county surveyor who was satisfied that that could be done and such a scheme has been put into operation both from the technical and from every other point of view.  There is every reason to believe that it is going to be an outstanding success.</P>
    <P>I remember when the scheme was first mooted that I asked the question of myself: &ldquo;Even if it can be done, at what extra cost can it be done?&rdquo; The evidence in our possession at the moment bears out the assurance that we were given that it can be done at as low a cost as it can be done by any other possible system of administration, given proper and sound technical supervision.  That has to some extent solved one of the biggest difficulties which we had in relation to a certain portion of the Relief Vote of £1,565,000 as a State contribution and a further £825,000 as a local contribution, making a total with the £110,000 in Vote 69 of £2,500,000.  It is intended this year on relief schemes where the system is applicable and to the degree to which it is applicable to use this method for the purpose (1) of getting value for the U.A. expenditure which is now being made and (2) for the purpose of the very high social value that will be obtained in enabling men to work who are willing to work and who desire to work.</P>
    <P>I would rather like to say that our experience in relation to men who have been called to work in this matter has been entirely satisfactory. The proportion of men who apparently do not want to work is very low.  The proportion of men who are eagerly anxious to work, instead of receiving money for nothing, is very high indeed. As I have told the House, I have had the pleasure of seeing these gangs at work and I have come in personal contact with a good many of them.  I <Col N="597" /> am perfectly satisfied that the vast majority of those at present on the U.A. panel will actively welcome an opportunity of this kind.  There were a couple of cases where there was a proportion of people who did not, but it was very remarkable the way the scheme seemed to produce its own antidote to feelings of that kind. What I might call the better elements, the elements anxious to work, morally dominated those who had another point of view in the matter.  There were only a couple of cases in which there was any difficulty at the beginning, and I am satisfied that at the end they were working as well as any gang and as willingly and happily as any gang could be expected to work under those conditions.</P>
    <P>I think, with that preface, I might ask the House to do, as I am very glad to say in the last few years it has done, put at the disposal of those who have to administer these funds, to do those works, their experience and their co-operation.  In the case of these rotational schemes, it would quite easily have been possible while these experiments were going on for people to criticise them destructively, to impede the possibility of their success. I have to pay a tribute to men of all Parties in the sense that, while these experiments were going on widespread all over the country and while I am aware men of all Parties were very closely in contact with them, I received from no one anything but constructive criticism and co-operation. I hope that that atmosphere which we have succeeded in building up in relation to this matter will continue. If so, I believe that it is probably the biggest thing which tends towards efficiency of administration.  The House is aware of the distribution which took place last year.  It is aware of the atmosphere in which the work has been done, and I shall be very glad indeed if, in relation to relief work&mdash;both now and in relation to the larger funds this year&mdash;they will give us co-operation.  At the same time, there is an understanding to day that the Votes of the Board of Works generally, that is Votes Nos. 11, 69 and 73, can all be discussed on this Vote to-day.</P>

      <P>On the question of the scheme as adumbrated by the Parliamentary Secretary, there are just a few points to which I should like to draw his attention, and to which I think it would be well for the Parliamentary Secretary to have regard. He indicates that it is possible that an extension of this sum will now take place towards Minor Relief Schemes or schemes of that kind.</P>

      <P>There is just one section which seems very hard hit by the application of this method. Naturally a line had to be drawn somewhere, and 6/- is the line of demarcation chosen.  Anybody in receipt of less than 6/- unemployment assistance is not allowed to participate in this work.  Even granting that the allocations have always been fairly made, a good many people are rather hard hit because of the fact that they are completely denied access to those schemes.  In a good many cases, undeniably wrong assessments have been made, and, owing to the methods obtaining in the application of unemployment assistance, once the Appeals Officer says it is so&mdash;well that's that; there is no other method of redress.  Having been reduced to a very small stipend from the unemployment assistance, whether rightly or wrongly, they are now denied the right to participate in the works that are going on.  I suggest it would be well worthy of the Parliamentary Secretary's consideration as to whether he may not find it possible to confine the work to a lesser area in a particular district, and include men of a lower grade from that area, rather than draw them in from a wider area on the higher rate of unemployment assistance.  It is a source of great discontent when a man living, for instance, in a particular district where one of those schemes is being administered, can see another man coming in from a remote district because he happens to be on the 7/- or 8/- rate, whereas he himself although living locally cannot participate because he is in receipt of only 5/-.  I think if this matter could be <Col N="599" /> attacked in the method that has been applied to this scheme all along it may be possible to have a re-allocation which would cause less friction and lead to greater harmony in the working of the scheme.</P>
      <P>There is also a good deal of unrest in connection with the amount of money that is capable of being earned on those schemes.  The number of days varies, I understand, from nine in the month to a maximum of, I think, 15. A man with nine days is entitled in my county to 45/- over the period of a month.  That is the total earnings he can get under those schemes.  He is debarred from getting anything in unemployment assistance.  It may be suggested that he can get alternative work in between, but I suggest that the alternative work available is negligible, if it exists at all, particularly because of the fact to which I previously adverted that there is already a huge number of men who cannot avail of those schemes and who are naturally grasping for anything that may turn up in the way of an odd day's work.  If we were to find men working on the Parliamentary Secretary's scheme for the couple of days' work permitted, and also getting alternative work, while others were being excluded, it would not make for harmony in the district.  I suggest, therefore, that the people who are working under those schemes are definitely committed to the amount of earnings so available to them.  A man on the nine days' minimum can earn only 45/- in the month, and on the maximum can earn only 75/-.  That standard is not very helpful for a man with a wife and family to maintain, even in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the fact that a very wide range of work has been undertaken and very successfully carried out.  I wish to mention a sewerage scheme in my county, which is being done, I believe, very satisfactorily as far as workmanship is concerned.  The standard rate for road work in the county of Limerick is 5/- a day, and hence that is the rate applicable to this sewerage scheme at Kilfinnan.  We have had sewerage schemes carried out by contractors <Col N="600" /> in similar sized towns in County Limerick during the past couple of years, and in none of these schemes that I am aware of was the low standard of 30/- paid.  In the town of Ballylanders 32/6 was paid by the contractor, with the addition of a half-day on Saturday; 33/6 was the rate at Askeaton, and the same applied to Glin.  Those were the rates paid by contractors.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he ought to see his way to making a differentiation in the case of men engaged on higher types of work of that kind; otherwise, there is a danger of lowering the standard in that particular line.  It would be very difficult for us to ask the private contractors to pay a higher rate for doing sewerage work in a town down the country than the figure for which it has been carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary. I do not suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary has that in his mind, but that is going to be the result of it.  I think he ought to consider whether, in regard to the varying types of work carried out under the scheme, it is possible to make some differentiation in remuneration in order to ensure that it is not going to be utilised as a lever for further forcing down the wages in those particular types of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of remarks on Vote No. 11.  I notice an Estimate for a new post office in St. Andrew Street.  That building has been held up for a very long time.  There is a hoarding round it, on which there are remarks rather derogatory to the Government.  I suppose that is inevitable in the case of any building which has been under review for a long time.  That portion of the city is a very important and congested area and, apparently, there is going to be put up there a very considerable block of buildings.  I think there is some doubt as to whether the Government is actually putting up a post office, or whether they are merely going to move in to a portion of a building there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is a building put up by somebody else, a portion of which, the <Col N="601" /> St. Andrew Street Post Office people are going to inhabit, or whether it is a building put up altogether by the Government, certainly some consideration ought to be given to the town-planning aspect of that site.  Trinity Street is a very narrow and congested street, and apparently some of the houses have been built on a frontage&mdash; or rather rebuilt on a frontage&mdash;in Trinity Street.  There is a very considerable area of ground at the back, or at the side&mdash;whichever way you like to put it&mdash;and it seems a pity that something could not have been done for the widening of Trinity Street. However, there still remains St. Andrew Street and the buildings that are to be put up there.</P>
    <P>Now, I can quite understand that in the case of a site which is very valuable, and on which there would probably be considerable building, it would be rather difficult to get somebody in the Government service to see that the amenities of the district and of the city would be improved by setting that building back a sufficient distance to allow for adequate traffic accommodation in passing it.  Another aspect of that question is that it is just facing St. Andrew's Church, and I should not like to hear that the Government had put up a building and that then, having found in the next year or two that the thoroughfare was too narrow, they would say to themselves: &ldquo;Well, I suppose we will have to put up our building, and the only thing to do now is to take down the church.&rdquo;  I sincerely trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will avoid getting into that position.  I understand that there is a post office being put up in that vicinity, and I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider how far it may be possible to arrange for the accommodation of post office vehicles inside that building.</P>
    <P>Another matter in connection with this Vote is this question of a swimming pool for the Curragh Camp.  I hope that, before the Parliamentary Secretary finally passes that scheme, he will see that it is in accordance with the latest ideas in swimming and diving.  I do not necessarily suggest that he need spend one shilling more <Col N="602" /> than he proposes to spend, but I do suggest that he might as well lay out the money at his disposal to the best advantage and see that it is laid out in such a way that, if some improvement is required afterwards, it can be added on and that it will not involve doing away with something that has been provided already.  I notice another item here in connection with harbours&mdash;improvement of the mail boat pier at Dun Laoghaire.  The column appears to be left blank. Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us whether or not some considerable improvement is suggested, or what is holding up the improvements to the pier?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that some of this money was being spent on mineral investigation.  I should be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, if that is so, whether some of that money would be earmarked for the area I represent, where we have a large number of men unable to obtain any class of work and where, in the case of the single men, they are not even in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if any grant or assistance could be given in that area it would be a great improvement.  I am very glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that he has got a very good return for the money he spent on minor relief schemes and on relief schemes in general.  His statement, at any rate, is somewhat different from that of the Minister for Finance, who stated on one occasion that the men were too lazy to work.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I am very pleased to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that he has had very good returns in connection with this matter. I should like to know from him whether sewerage work and other such schemes were carried out by direct labour or not.  I am aware that public bodies, in certain cases, have had such schemes carried out by contract, and I should like to say in this connection that we have been able to carry out sewerage, housing and other schemes of a similar nature, by direct labour, and we have proved that we can carry them on efficiently by that method and provide more employment and pay better wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <P>This particular scheme that I referred to has been carried out by direct labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am very glad to hear that.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary give us any idea as to what is the intention of the Government in connection with work on this relief scheme?  We have heard of money being allocated, and we have heard statements as to the amount of work that will be available.  Schemes have been submitted by various public bodies in connection with roads and <Col N="604" /> sewerage and other matters, but, beyond receiving an acknowledgment, these public bodies are still in the dark in this matter, and it must be remembered that we have a large number of unemployed.  With reference to the constituency that I represent, I should like to know whether any of the money promised by the Minister for Finance two years ago for the development of tourist roads is to be allocated to my constituency.  In the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance two years ago, I understood that £500,000 was allocated for the opening up of tourist roads.  I understood the Minister to say that he hoped to give tourists the benefit of seeing the beauties of this country by the opening up and improvement of these roads.  The Wicklow County Council were going to open up a road between East and West Wicklow, and a number of rural workers who were unemployed at the time were to have been employed on such work.  The county council, I understand, have renewed their application to the Minister for Finance and to the Local Government Department. The urban areas were also interested in opening up the Silver Strand from Wicklow to Arklow, and there is a large number of men unemployed there also. As a matter of fact, very few men are employed in that district.  We believe that from now on would be an opportune time to provide employment in that district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on farms would not be interfered with, because I think the returns from the area will show that very few men are employed on tillage.  When selecting men for employment the labour exchanges in seaport towns should not send sailors or fishermen to do the work of navvies or road workers.  I consider it to be a hardship that sailors or fishermen who are out of work should displace unemployed men suitable to that class of work.  Of course, if they refuse to go when sent by the Labour Exchange they are deprived of benefit.  Seeing that large numbers of labourers are unemployed, they should be selected for suitable work.  I wish to renew the protest I made on previous occasions against paying 24/- a week to men on relief schemes.  The <Col N="605" /> Parliamentary Secretary is familiar with my objection.  It is not right that the Government, or that any Party should set a headline to employers by paying 24/- a week, simply because people are unable to get other employment. I also protest against the decision that carters employed on minor relief schemes do not come under the Conditions of Employment Act, as far as holidays and other advantages are concerned, while county council employees are included in the provisions of the Act.  I understand that a circular has been sent out by the Department informing county surveyors and engineers that the Act does not apply to carters, and that they are not entitled to the holidays mentioned in the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy tell me in what way they do not come under the Act?  I do not understand the hardship to which he refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Carters employed by county councils are entitled to be paid for holidays, such as Easter Monday, Whit Monday, but a circular has been sent out to the county surveyors notifying them that these conditions do not apply to people employed on relief schemes.  In other words, men working on these minor relief schemes might be engaged for 80 or 100 hours weekly. It was the same in connection with relief works under the county councils, when men were classed as agricultural labourers.  I am afraid that it is the thin end of the wedge, and that it will be a headline for public bodies, and that carters will only be engaged for a few days weekly, but not for short days like Saturdays.  The fixing of wages in an area should be left to the public bodies.  The Government should not be in the position of paying a smaller rate than that paid by the ordinary contractors or public bodies.  I hope that on the direct labour sewerage schemes local rates of wages will be paid.  I make no objection to the practice followed in the towns where the public bodies are free to pay certain rates.  No matter who controls local bodies they are not over generous in the payment of their workers.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to <Col N="606" /> provide useful employment for sailors and fishermen by giving a grant for the cleaning and dredging of harbours. Why should preference be given at all times to Dun Laoghaire?  Why should a special arrangement be made for the mail boats?  Other ports and harbours along the coast, that are not in a prosperous position, should be considered.  Those responsible have to try to maintain these harbours out of local revenue, or at the expense of the ratepayers.  As to the necessity of maintaining Dun Laoghaire harbour and spending money on it, there is no reason why the Act of Parliament dealing with that harbour should not be extended to other harbours like those of Wicklow and Arklow.  The argument of city people is that all trade could be diverted to Dublin, Cork, or Limerick.  The other harbours should, however, receive some financial assistance, so that they would be a benefit to local residents.  All employment should not be centralised in Dublin, and public money should be spent throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give the Parliamentary Secretary credit for this much, that he understands the needs of our harbours and the position of seafaring men, and I know that he will consider this appeal on their behalf sympathetically.  I am certain that there would be a good return from the employment of sailors on many public works in connection with harbours like those of Wicklow and Arklow.  I should like to know how this relief grant is going to be spent?  Will it cover coast erosion.  If so, I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to bring influence to bear on the railway companies. Considerable sums of money have been spent in connection with coast erosion and, incidentally, to protect railway property, but the response of railway companies has not been as generous as it should be.  As far as the ratepayers of County Wicklow are concerned, having spent £5,000 recently they are determined that it is the last money they will spend protecting the property of the railway company if merely a pittance is spent by the companies. After the ratepayers spent £5,000 the company offered to spend <Col N="607" /> £75 if more public money was spent. If any money is to be spent on coast erosion it can be diverted to other work than the protection of railway property. Plenty of schemes to provide employment have been sent to the various Departments and have been acknowledged as receiving attention. As they have been under consideration for two years something definite should now be done.  I do not want to say anything against any officials in the Department of Local Government or in the Board of Works, as every Deputy who has to deal with them has been treated fairly irrespective of Party or politics.  I intend to give the Parliamentary Secretary plenty of trouble until I find out if the Government is really serious about giving grants for useful public work, which would not only provide employment but help to develop towns and places affected.  If these schemes were approved of, I am certain that with the co-operation of the public bodies friction about wages and conditions of work could be overcome in an endeavour to meet the unemployment difficulty.  The opening up of new roads, the development of harbours, coast erosion work and the linking up of east and west by a national road could be undertaken. If so, I have received promises from public bodies that they will give their co-operation and be prepared to pay their share for having useful work done.  They want, however, to be sure that the Government is really in earnest, and the way to show that sincerity is to undertake some big scheme immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared, as I have always been prepared, to give every possible encouragement to the Parliamentary Secretary to go ahead with useful schemes of work and to help to provide work for the overwhelming number of able-bodied men of the country who prefer to work under reasonable conditions rather than be compelled to subsist on unemployment assistance or home assistance, as the case may be.  I am, however&mdash;and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will excuse me for saying so&mdash;a bit suspicious as to the present attitude, <Col N="608" /> not of the Parliamentary Secretary personally, but of the whole idea behind the wages policy of the Government in connection with the promotion of these schemes.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has any personal responsibility for the initiation of these piece-work schemes which have apparently recently been put into operation on Land Commission work and peat development work as well as on schemes provided under Votes of this kind.  I cannot understand why, for instance, one set of men employed on these experimental schemes are asked to work at piece-work rates whilst men employed on another section of work financed by moneys provided under the same Vote are paid at a daily rate.  There has, I think justifiably, been a good deal of contention in some cases in my area as to why certain individuals should be selected for piece-work as against day-work rates.  Allegations have been made to me that the men selected for piece-work rates in some cases are merely selected because the ganger has an edge on them, or does not like them and wants to force them out of the job.  I put that point to the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that he will watch it more closely.  I think I am entitled to ask him here what are the grounds on which two sets of men employed on the same kind of work and paid out of the same Vote, are called upon to work under different conditions?  I think the work should be at a daily rate and that the man who is not prepared to give the necessary return at the daily rates should be dealt with by the ganger, who knows his business, in the same way as he would be dealt with not alone in the carrying out of other State-aided schemes but in ordinary industrial employment.</P>

      <P>I had in mind the case which Deputy Norton brought under the notice of the House by way of question about six weeks ago where, in the County Offaly, in the Edenderry area, two sets of men are <Col N="609" /> employed on day work and piece work rates and where that system was extended even to the carters who were employed on the job.  When I made inquiries, I was told that it was one of the experimental schemes carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary. There was some trouble locally as a result of that.  I personally object to any such system under any Vote provided by this House and I should like to hear reasons why it is operated. I am aware, for instance, of a case in my constituency&mdash;and I am wondering whether it is part and parcel of the same system&mdash;where men working on Land Commission improvement schemes are expected to be able to build seven yards of double ditch per day before they get the daily rate. If they are unable to build seven yards of the double ditch in one day, they will have to work the next day until the seven yards are completed before they get the daily rate previously paid by the Land Commission for carrying out work of this kind.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if he has any responsibility for the initiation of that system in my area or in other parts of the country.  This Land Commission improvement work is being carried out in an area where the men have been used to hard work but I have been assured by men who have always worked hard, not alone on Land Commission work but on mining work in the same area, that it is impossible for a hard working man to build up seven yards of a double ditch between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.</P>

I can see the same mentality behind the schemes to which I am referring. <Col N="610" /> Surely it has not been by accident that the Land Commission recently adopted this system of piece work which was previously unheard of in any part of my constituency?  I daresay these people have heard something about the activities of the Board of Works in the carrying out of minor relief schemes.  It is an extension of the system initiated by the Board of Works.  I may be wrong and if so I should like to be corrected by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I say that I am suspicious of the administration of these schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would prefer the daily rate, and if men do not give the necessary return under that system they can be dealt with by the gangers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know, and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot evade answering me on this point, upon whose advice the Department fixed the rate of wages recently paid on the Goul drainage scheme in County Kilkenny at 25/-, while the rate paid a few yards across the border in County Leix is 27/1 per week?  The two areas are within a radius of about a mile of each other.  One set of men, because they happened to be working in County Kilkenny, are paid 25/- per week, and in the immediate vicinity 27/1 per week is paid to those who are employed in the County Leix.  Now all these men have to go into the same little village and buy their necessaries of life, and the price that a Kilkenny man pays for his food and certain other commodities is the same as a man from Leix employed on the same job.  I want to know who are the super-men associated with the Wages Advisory Committee responsible for the fixing of such rates, and on what basis they arrive at them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told the wages paid are supposed to have some bearing to the wages paid to agricultural labourers in the same districts, and that farmers are paying the same rates of wages in the same areas.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that Deputies like myself, who cannot have the same source of information, are entitled to some education upon the subject of the carrying out of these minor relief works and arterial drainage schemes under the Board of Works.  There is no reason that I can see for a difference of 2/1 being paid between those employed in Kilkenny and those employed in Leix, on the same scheme, in the very same area, and who have to buy their food and the necessaries of life in the very same <Col N="612" /> village.  I would be obliged to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would tell the House quite frankly&mdash;and he is always frank when asked to be frank on matters of this kind&mdash;whether the rates of wages and conditions on which men are employed in these experimental schemes are intended to bring down the standard of wages and the rates paid previously by contractors who carried on the same kind of work?</P>

      <P>Deputy Keyes has given a case in point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered your question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keyes gave a case where sewerage schemes were carried out in Limerick with direct labour when the rates of wages were 30/- per week, but when contractors carried out similar schemes they reduced the scheme by 2/6 and 3/- per week because of the wages paid by the Parliamentary Secretary.  These are likely to be taken as a headline by unscrupulous employers and by all classes of employers for bringing down the standard rates.  If they can point to the rates of wages paid by the Government of the country as a headline for paying certain figures, they will do that.  I do not want the approval of the House to be given to the Parliamentary Secretary, or authority to be given for money of this kind, if it is going to be used to bring down the standard rate of wages previously paid in the same part of the country for the same class of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would give the Parliamentary Secretary every encouragement to carry out schemes of this kind by direct labour.  But from my experience he is not going to get the enthusiastic support of the county and district engineers for carrying out this work by direct labour.  There is a tendency in the country, and especially where the managerial system is in existence, to cut out direct labour and to have the work carried out by contract. The only reason for this is to make the jobs of the engineers and surveyors much easier than in the <Col N="613" /> past.  Instead of providing more employment, the effect is when these schemes are carried out by contract to reduce the number of men employed.  I could quote clear cases where the direct labour system has been wiped out and the contract labour system is now adopted, and where the officials of the borough concerned are delighted with the soft jobs they have, compared with what they had when the direct labour system was in operation.  Of course, the direct labour system means more work and more patience.  I know something about making out and checking a pay sheet; but, at the same time, the making out of such sheets would provide employment.  All a county engineer or surveyor would have to do is to put his name at the end of the sheet when it is made out. The argument for doing away with the direct labour system is simply to increase the profits of the contractor. I am not now suggesting that the Parliamentary Secretary is in favour of the policy of the contract labour system, but his views on the matter would be very interesting to the members of this Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health knows a good deal about it.  In the engineering section of his Department particularly, I am sorry to say, there is plenty of evidence to show that they are encouraging the contract system as against the direct labour system.  I invite the Minister for Local Government to come down to a certain town in my county and to examine houses built by direct labour&mdash;the cost and the result&mdash;and to compare these houses built for £250 with the present condition of houses previously built for £400 under the contract system.  I do not know whether the Minister would accept my invitation to come down there unless he is in favour of carrying out work by the direct labour system.  There we have glaring examples of the work carried out by the two systems, and the costs and the results, in the clearest sense, are there to be seen by any one who has his eyes open.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the system generally adopted, with the consent of the Parliamentary Secretary, for recruiting <Col N="614" /> men for work on these employment schemes?  What is the area from which men are expected to take up this work or forfeit their unemployment insurance benefits?  I recently got a case where men were compelled, by the manager of the local labour exchange, to travel 12 miles to work on a peat development scheme where the average wage was at the rate of 22/- per week.  What is the area from which men are drawn for work of this kind?  Let me give a clear instance of that.  I quoted a case to the head of the unemployment branch of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, where a manager ordered men to travel five miles, to break stones in a quarry, or forfeit their unemployment benefit. One of these was a man who worked all his life as a carpenter, and was 60 years of age.  He had been for some time, and was then, physically unfit, and had been in receipt of national health insurance benefit.  That man took the risk of losing his unemployment assistance and refused to go and take that employment.  That is a clear case, and such cases should not be allowed to occur again.  That is the reason why I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to enlighten the House, and particularly his officials, as to what are the limits of the area from which men are to be drawn for such work, or how far are they compelled to travel to work of this kind, or else forfeit their unemployment assistance. I feel fairly certain that the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Minister responsible, are allowing too much scope to the managers of labour exchanges in matters of this kind.  That is why I am definitely encouraging the Parliamentary Secretary to make the position for the future quite clear to the men who prefer work to unemployment assistance but who must get that work under reasonable conditions.  If they cannot get work under reasonable conditions they must be allowed the alternative.</P>

      <P>They would not be given a preference over men who are actually drawing benefit, but they would be considered. &ldquo;Preference&rdquo; in this connection means preference.  It involves examination of conditions, and a single man who comes under an Employment Order would be in competition with other people who would be entitled to employment if there was a demand. <Col N="618" /> But, as a rule, during the employment period, there are not relief schemes demanding more than the total number of these men.  I am asking quite sincerely for help in this matter.  It is a difficult matter to settle.  In Connemara I have come upon a job at which there were working five men who had travelled ten miles that morning.  These men would have had a definite grievance if I had refused them work, because they wanted it.  What am I to do?  There should be a limit, undoubtedly, beyond which you would not compel a man to go, but you cannot say that a man who wants to travel ten miles for work should not be allowed to do so if his U.A. qualification is a high qualification.  What I say now does not refer to relief schemes more than to any other schemes.  It applies to every job to which a man is sent. If he does not turn up, it is the Department of Industry and Commerce which, under the existing law, decides the matter.  We do not decide; the umpires decide.  What the Deputy is asking for is an alteration of the law&mdash; that the Parliamentary Secretary should decide the matter.  What we do is report that the man did not turn up for work.  Then the law operates.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that a man should not be allowed to take up work wherever he was willing to do so.  I did suggest that a man should not be compelled to travel 12 miles to work at the risk of forfeiting his unemployment assistance if he did not turn up.  There is a difference between allowing a man to travel and compelling a man to travel under conditions that are intolerable and unjust.</P>

      <P>I think that normally a man will walk four miles to a job. That is quite common.  In certain cases, there is no difficulty at all in a man coming five miles to a job.  Where a man has a bicycle he may come seven miles.  However, I have not got the statutory authority, nor has anybody but the umpires, to generalise in the matter.  Everything is to be decided in a particular case in relation to the nature of the work, the man's circumstances and everything else concerned. The general view, in our opinion, when laying down relief schemes, where the scheme is of a particular size, is that we would notify the labour exchanges of the electoral area within a radius of four miles.  If we find that that area is not sufficient then we are faced with another question.  There was a case in Wicklow where there was a particular work which needed being done, and we had to look considerably farther away than four miles.  The men came quite willingly.  In the first place, we have not the statutory power to decide this matter.  I have tried in the statement I have made to give you the atmosphere in which the matter is decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I say again that in any minor relief work which may be sanctioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to be carried out in my area, he will be almost certain to find the necessary number of men within a three-mile limit.  If he thinks that the necessary number of men is not to be found within the three-mile limit, that is, men in receipt of unemployment assistance, I suggest if he takes into consideration the large number recently deprived of assistance by the Employment Period Order he will certainly find the necessary number within the three-mile limit.  The Employment Period Order was put into operation for the purpose of saving money and I submit that the people who are deprived of employment under that Order are entitled to preference in any employment under relief schemes.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the men who were in receipt of unemployment assistance up to the 3rd June and who were then suspended, under the terms of the Employment Period Order, are <Col N="620" /> entitled to employment on minor relief works?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary order of preference is that the men are employed in proportion to the amount of unemployment assistance they got&mdash; that the 12/- man would be employed before the 6/- man; that is to say, men who were on the disqualified list but who are not now on the list due to the Employment Period Order would get preference in that order.  The extent to which they would be included in the scheme would be in proportion to the amount of help they were drawing previously.</P>

If he can only get 50 men in receipt of unemployment assistance within the limit but that there are 50 others qualified for unemployment assistance but deprived of it because of the operations of the Employment Period Order, will he go outside the limit and take men outside the area or will he take the 50 men who have been cut off from unemployment assistance?</P>

This House has experience of almost a riot here on another occasion because of a person being required to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  In the case the Deputy has put we would investigate the actual conditions; we would get the register of the unemployed.  We take a scheme in an area where the men to carry out the work could be drawn. I welcome this question.  I do not regard it as a controversial matter. The Deputy is now asking the question which we have to ask ourselves in the office every day.  It is not <Col N="621" /> an easy kind of question which can be answered by &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo; We would send for one of those returns and we would look at the number of men in the district who were getting unemployment assistance, and see what their particular rates of assistance were.  If we had a lot of 12/- a week men on the border of the three-mile limit in the electoral area we would recruit them first even though they were just outside the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said anything in my own constituency that would discourage men from taking work, where work is available.  I should like to hear something from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the conditions and qualifications of men employed as gangers on work of this kind.  I understand that in order to secure the position as ganger on one of these schemes the man must be registered at the local labour exchange.  I am curious as to what other qualifications are required to secure the position of ganger.  Who is to decide who is the most competent person for the position?  I should like to know in whose hands is the final selection.  Is it in the hands of the county surveyor or of the officials of the Board of Works? I should like to know further what is the procedure adopted in connection with proposals put forward for minor relief works?  I am aware that cases are sent up from the local authorities.  I encourage the people in my constituency to send up schemes through the local authorities.  I think proposals may be sent from the Fianna Fáil clubs or the Labour clubs. Has the board the necessary inspectors for the purpose of reporting on the particular scheme submitted and giving an estimate or is it the general practice to refer back the scheme to the county surveyor and ask him to make a special report?  I would also like to know the nature of the preference given to one scheme as against another.  I know of schemes that are regarded as very urgent, such as a bog road repair scheme which has been turned down because the Department saw that in the <Col N="622" /> unemployment register in that area there was not the requisite number of men available to carry out the scheme.  I submit that if a bog road scheme is urgent it should be done. I am certain that in one particular case the men could be found in that area who could carry out the work. If you have not in the immediate vicinity of the bog road the number of men necessary to carry out the work that is no reason for postponing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised that question.  This money is voted specifically for relief.  The predominant partner in the issue is relief and we look for the most urgent and very best scheme we can find in the area in which relief is required by the unemployed men.  Does the Deputy think I would be entitled to use any of this money for the purpose of doing work in a district in which relief was not relatively required? There was a Parliamentary question the other day in relation to a bog road which was regarded as urgent and there was not a single person on unemployment assistance in the electoral area.  There was one, I think, at 12/- a week.  It would take, I think, about 800 years out of the savings on unemployment assistance to do that.  I am simply putting it to the Deputy that there are two qualities in relation to a job.  One of them is, its capacity to relieve existing distress, and the second is, the merits of the work.  Am I entitled to do work out of this money in a district in which there is no relative distress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not paying very much attention to the words &ldquo;relative distress.&rdquo;  If we are going to help to solve the unemployment problem by carrying out urgent schemes of public works, the urgency of the work is the first consideration for me, especially in cases of bog road repair work.  How does the Parliamentary Secretary expect the Minister for Industry and Commerce to carry out peat development schemes which are waiting to be carried out all over the country, if they cannot get into the bogs where the work is to be carried out?  I brought <Col N="623" /> cases under the notice of the Minister for Lands and of the Parliamentary Secretary where people could not get out last year's turf because the roads were impassable.  No explanation can be given to me, at any rate, as to why that work cannot be done out of moneys provided out of a Vote of this kind, if that kind of work is at all justified out of moneys provided by this House under this sub-head.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary the name of the area where bog drainage work is urgently required and where he cannot get the required number of men to do the necessary relief work.  Let him give us the name of the bog district in which such a splendid state of affairs exists at the present time.  I am certain that the necessary number of qualified men can be got within a three-mile limit from a place of that kind.</P>
      <P>I want again to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the practice of his Department in not allocating in the one year the sum required to carry out a minor relief work.  If the repair of a bog road is going to cost £270, which in one particular case it was estimated to cost, why should that work be carried out over three different years?  One third of the road is made the first year, and that portion is again in a state of disrepair before they come the second year to do the other portion.  In this case, and it is not an exceptional case, it took three years to complete a bog road repair scheme.  If it is going to cost £270 to repair a road into a bog used by a very large number of people, I suggest that the work should be carried out inside the one year.  The result would be more satisfactory if the work is completed within the one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy to relate that to the fact that this is a limited sum of money?  If that particular district is entitled to an allocation of £200, relative to the necessities of other districts, and if I spend £600 on doing a road in that district.  I am robbing two other districts which are entitled to it, of £200 each.  I would not be doing that if I had an unlimited <Col N="624" /> sum of money, but having a limited sum of money, if I allocate to any district at any time more money than it is entitled to, relative to other districts, then I am robbing other districts. That is my difficulty.</P>

      <P>I know that when we come to examine promises of that kind we find that the statements made by Ministers are not always acted upon, especially in connection with the innumerable demands coming from local authorities for grants for the carrying out of public health works.  I have a large number of cases in which for the past two or three years public authorities in my area have been putting up these demands.  They were told that they could only carry out two schemes in a county in any particular year.  They must wait until the resurrection day in order to carry out the last one which will have to be carried out in the areas concerned.  I think it is unbusinesslike to take three years to carry out schemes for the repair of bog roads.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is next inspecting works of that kind, to look up the files of his Department, and <Col N="625" /> when he is in a certain area to have a look at the roads carried out under schemes of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague here, Deputy Everett, says it is very easy to satisfy the Parliamentary Secretary and I am inclined to agree with him. I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that he has this year, as he did last year, made provision under sub-head J (2)&mdash;arterial drainage&mdash;for the carrying out of a drainage scheme on the River Douglas in Leix.  On the last occasion when I raised the matter of delay in the carrying out of that scheme I was informed by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I think correctly, that the delay was due to the fact that the work could not be commenced until the Barrow drainage inquiry had been finished.  I want to know what is the present position in connection with that particular inquiry, and whether there is any hone that in the near future even preliminary work will be commenced upon that particular scheme.  I press the matter on the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary because there is a considerable amount of unemployment in the district, and I am of the opinion&mdash;of course, I am only an ordinary layman in matters of this kind&mdash;that useful preliminary work, such as the removal of obstructions, could be carried out on this river during the current year. In any case, I do not see any use in making provision for this money last year, and again putting it into the Estimate this year, if it is merely there for the purpose of having the pleasure of looking at the figure in the Estimate with the knowledge that the work is not going to be carried out even this year.</P>
      <P>I should also like to know the reason why a very large number of men were disemployed last week-end on the Goul drainage scheme in the County Leix.</P>

I know that a large number of able-bodied men in that district were, up to about a fortnight ago, employed on a big road-works scheme, and that there is now no work available in the area&mdash;at least, so I am informed&mdash; except work which is given to a few men on an afforestation scheme.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would look into that matter and see that, as soon as possible, instructions are issued to have the men who were disemployed re-employed, that is unless there is some good engineering reason against such a course being taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks.  I join with Deputy Everett in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to try and find more work for our able-bodied unemployed men in the country by carrying out the making of, or the repair of, tourist roads.  I have a fairly good knowledge of the roads in all parts of the country.  I have also travelled through a number of Continental countries, but I know of no country where there is such an amount of work available, if we have the will and the way to do it, as on the roads in this country. Within the last ten days I have travelled over a number of our so-called tourist roads, and I say quite deliberately that on them there is a vast amount of work available for our able-bodied unemployed men.  There is work of that kind to be done in Wicklow, Kerry and in other counties. Personally, it does not matter to me where the work is undertaken, but I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will keep this matter before his mind if and when the Minister for Finance is willing to provide the necessary money for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to draw the attention <Col N="627" /> of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that in some cases in my area, at any rate, contractors for the erection of Civic Guard barracks did not pay to the workers engaged the recognised rates of wages paid locally.  I would like to hear from him whether a clause is put into all such contracts obliging contractors to pay the recognised rates of wages to the workers employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If such a clause is inserted in all contracts, I would like to know what steps are customarily taken by the Department to compel contractors to pay the recognised rates of wages.  I reported a case of that kind to the Board of Works some time ago in connection with the erection of a Civic Guard barracks at Clonaslee, and I am not aware that very effective action was taken to compel the contractor concerned to pay the rates of wages which were paid in the same area by other contractors engaged in building houses for the Board of Health.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to what extent, if any, complaints have been received under that head, and what action had been taken by his Department. I am sorry that I was not aware that this Vote was coming up for consideration this evening, and I hope that I have not given the Parliamentary Secretary too much trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say sincerely that I do not want to discourage any able-bodied man in this country who is anxious and willing to work from taking work under reasonable and fair conditions, but I do not want to be a party to the voting of money, either through this particular Vote or any other Vote this year or any other year, to be used by the Board of Works for the purpose of bringing down the rates of wages previously paid by contractors who carried out the same kind <Col N="628" /> of work under the contract system in the areas mentioned.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary has considerable influence in matters of this kind, and I hope that he will encourage, wherever possible&mdash;from some remarks that he made here this evening I think that he can find good reasons for doing so&mdash;the Department of Local Government and other State Departments to carry out such works by direct labour. By doing so these Departments will be providing much more employment. By adopting the direct labour system, they will be helping to spread the amount of money available over a far greater number of people.  It is surely preferable that they should do rather than encourage the carrying out of public works by the contract system, thereby providing big profits for contractors. As I have said, the adoption of the direct labour system will help to spread the money available over a larger number of people than if the contract system were invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the experiment on public health schemes, referred to on this Vote, as providing a very good argument for developing the policy of direct labour in connection with the execution of public works.  There is no need to defend the direct labour system as the best and most efficient method of doing public works.  It has now been established as the only efficient way of maintaining public roads.  It took very many years to get people to agree with that proposition.  Some years ago there were people who pretended to believe that the old and now almost universally condemned contract system, in the case of roads, was the better one.  The old contract system has very few apologists in these days.  What is true in regard to the roads is equally true in regard to public health schemes.  I respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, following on his experience in regard to public health schemes, the direct labour system should be employed by his Department in regard to the erection of all public buildings over which he has control.  He has responsibility for a big building programme.  I grant that there are objections to the direct <Col N="629" /> labour system.  These come, in the main, from people with vested interests, from people whose desire is not to get the work done with the greatest efficiency and to be of the greatest service to the workers employed, but rather with the least exertion and trouble to themselves.</P>
      <P>Members of this Party are quite right in stating that many examples of that kind can be quoted.  There was a notable one in the constituency which the Parliamentary Secretary himself represents.  The Cork Corporation decided recently that a certain big public health work in Cork would be done by direct labour.  At the next meeting the City Manager informed the Corporation that the work was being done by contract.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary himself will in future be, so to speak, a direct partner in schemes of this kind, as a result of the policy that is now being entered upon, with the Department contributing to the finances of public health schemes, it should be quite easy for him, if he so wishes, to order that all this work will be done by direct labour.  That should be made a condition in all cases where money is made available by means of a Grant-in-Aid to local authorities.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, as a result of the experiments that he has carried out, is now convinced that the direct labour system is the more efficient way of doing these works.  I would suggest to him, as I did on a former occasion, that to some extent, at least, the same policy might be examined in a practical way so far as the carrying out of the general building programme of the Office of Public Works is concerned. Like other Deputies, I want to refer to the fair wages clause in public contracts, which is more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  In many cases I know that clause is kept because there is an effective trade union organisation to see that it is observed, but in the case of the rural areas it is largely a fraud. Complaints that I and other Deputies, as well as Deputy Davin, have made have not resulted in a fair recognition of the principles enshrined in that clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the general execution of <Col N="630" /> minor relief schemes.  I have little complaint to make except on the score that enough work has not been done in that direction.  Although I say that, for other reasons, works of the kind are not usually done at this time of the year, I suggest that there are many minor relief schemes that could be very admirably carried out at this period.  If it is suggested that people who would at other times be on unemployment assistance now have alternate work, I am afraid that is not in accordance with what is happening in rural areas.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some assurance, before the debate closes, that a speeding-up of the schemes that have been already agreed upon will take place. There are some schemes of which I know that the Cork County Council have agreed to subsidise to a certain extent, and the fact that the Office of Public Works communicated with the county council and got a guarantee of a small subsidy would lead me to believe that the works have received favourable consideration.  I would be glad if an opportunity can be found at an early date to put them through.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to a few other little matters in connection with which, if he thinks he ought to get information in more detail, I will try to provide it for him in a short time.  In certain districts in West Cork last year, in certain seaside districts, there was a gratifying and unsual influx of visitors.  Places that formerly were not widely known or extensively patronised had a very good year.  One particular place that has been much favoured in that direction is Glandore.  There were some very distinguished visitors from this country and from far outside this country in that pretty seaside place last year.  The fact is that since last year the path leading to the strand in Glandore has been wiped away as a result of the storm.  For at least two years proposals for the provision of a reasonably safe pathway to the strand have been under consideration.  There is no objection locally in regard to the small portion of land required and, using this as a typical case, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that where there are requirements of this <Col N="631" /> kind a comparatively small sum would be a considerable boon and it would help to enhance the many little seaside places that are coming into popular favour.</P>
    <P>With reference to the completion of unfinished works, I notice that the promise the Parliamentary Secretary gave in recent years that partly completed works would be carried to completion has been, on the whole, well observed.  There are some cases where one is surprised that that is not the case.  I know of one case at Ballingeary, in the heart of the Gaeltacht, where £600 has been spent on an accommodation road, which is also a turbary road.  On two occasions the local authority has given substantial assistance to the carrying out of the work, but the road is not quite completed and for that reason it is absolutely useless.  It leads nowhere yet, because it is unfinished.  The sum required to finish it would not exceed £100; probably it would be considerably less.  Recently a creamery was erected there for the purpose of assisting local farmers.  It is represented that quite a number of people who require to have their needs served by that creamery are considerably handicapped by not being able to reach it over this road which, if finished, would provide an easy, comfortable way of getting there.  I do not want to overload a statement of this kind with details, because it is not the proper way to bring forward matters of the kind.  I merely mention those two cases in order to point to what might be done in that direction.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement, but I would like to get some more information about the work of the InterDepartmental Committee.  The Minister for Finance referred to the Committee in his Budget statement.  We have heard very little about the Committee, and, while the modesty of the members of the Committee is very commendable, it is regrettable that they should continue to blush unseen.  We would like to hear about the ambitious programme that filled the hearts of many people with great hope.  The <Col N="632" /> references to certain schemes of a novel and useful character must have resulted in tremendous numbers of proposals being put before the Committee.  What has been done in that direction and how far can schemes that came under the consideration of the Committee be given effect to?  In view of the period that had elapsed, I think it is only reasonable to expect that we should now have some indication of what has been done.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the Parliamentary Secretary has not the decision in his hands that results in depriving persons in receipt of unemployment assistance of that assistance if they do not accept work offered to them outside a certain radius.  Not directly, but indirectly, however, the Office of Public Works may be responsible for such a matter.  There are certain numbers of electoral divisions, and I think it is right to say that the selection of electoral divisions comes from the Office of Public Works, so that to that extent a radius for works of that kind might be devised which would entail considerable local hardship.  I welcome the advance the Parliamentary Secretary made in the discussion on this matter, because it is the cause of irritation in some districts.  I would like that there should be formal discussion between the members of various Parties for the purpose of endeavouring to delete the peculiarities and hardships that arise in regard to certain works.</P>
    <P>I had a case recently where a man was employed in a creamery for upwards of 30 years.  He never did any other work in that time.  He lost his employment because the sons of the proprietor of the creamery&mdash;it was a small proprietory creamery &mdash; were available to do the work formerly done by this man.  This man, having exhausted his claim to unemployment insurance, was then an applicant for unemployment assistance.  At a place over three miles from where he lived he was asked to undertake work on a minor relief scheme.  He explained that he was not able to do work of that kind; he had not done that type of work for a great number of years.  His claim for unemployment assistance was <Col N="633" /> then rejected.  I think cases of that kind are terribly hard, because in that case the man would, in my opinion, gladly do any work.  It was not so much the question of distance as that, by reason of what happened for 30 or 35 years, he was not physically fitted for that particular work, while he might be able to do work of another kind.</P>
    <P>There are also cases which arise in this way.  Small drainage schemes are undertaken from time to time, and that work takes place during winter or early spring.  I have in mind work of that kind undertaken in January last at a time when there was heavy frost.  It was a continuation of work partly carried out in a previous year.  In the previous year the workers were supplied with waders because they had to work in water which was practically up to their waist, or at least beyond their knees.  Practically the same gang of men turned up for the work.  They would not get any waders, so they declined to take the work, and were denied their unemployment assistance for a considerable time.  It is right to say that, after the fullest investigation, the point of view of the men was upheld by the umpire.  At the moment there are parallel cases under consideration, and awaiting consideration for a considerable time.  As I said, I have no fault to find with the manner in which the works are carried out, beyond the rather minor criticisms which I have uttered.  I have to join with my colleagues in protesting against the wage conditions.  We can only regard them as entirely, unsatisfactory, and our views on that matter remain unaltered.  I commend to the Parliamentary Secretary the few points which I have made.  They have been made in the hope that consideration of them would evolve a more satisfactory way of doing certain things, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give them such consideration.</P>

      <P>Some recent correspondence in the Press has disclosed the fact that negotiation or intercourse has been going on between parties interested in the development of an airport near the City of Dublin, <Col N="634" /> and the Ministry of Finance, with a view to having portion of the Phænix Park developed as an airport for the City of Dublin.  I want to characterise a proposal of that particular kind as an outrageous piece of vandalism in itself, apart altogether from its being an invasion of certain very necessary amenities for the growing City of Dublin, and an invasion of, I might say, national amenities.  I, therefore, think it is important that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister should indicate what exactly have been the proposals which have been made in this connection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to refer to it briefly, because I think it is better to have the matter aired with a view to getting a statement on it from the Government.  Letters have been written which have indicated that there has been communication with and proposals made to the Ministry of Finance in respect of the use of part of the Phænix Park for that purpose. I think that we ought to have a statement right away from the Minister for Finance&mdash;if the Parliamentary Secretary has no personal responsibility in connection with the matter&mdash;which will assure the House that it is not contemplated that any part of the Phænix Park is to be devoted to the development of an airport.  There are fields long enough and wide enough and plentiful enough to the east of the City of Dublin to develop any airport that may be necessary for the city.  I do not want to develop the matter further at this particular stage, but I think that in view of the correspondence that has been published we should have a statement from the Minister with regard to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for spending a certain amount of money on volunteer halls.  I should like to ask where exactly any halls which have been built up to the present are located, and what areas they serve? What work has been done up to the present, and where is it expected that <Col N="635" /> volunteer halls will be built throughout the country during the coming year? The Estimate also provides something like £4,000 for the maintenance of the Viceregal Lodge.  It was indicated on a previous occasion that the Government had adopted plans for turning the Viceregal Lodge into some kind of a museum.  I should like to ask whether any progress has been made in that direction, and what particular kind of museum is going to be established there.  I should like to ask also&mdash;in connection with the new constitutional proposals which have been mentioned here recently in regard to having an elected head of the State who will have certain definite powers and responsibilities&mdash;whether any change has taken place in the proposals for disposing of the Viceregal Lodge, and whether it is intended that if and when there is an elected head of the State, with the responsibilities and powers that have been indicated to us, he will have an official residence, and whether the Viceregal Lodge is being maintained for that particular purpose?  The Parliamentary Secretary, I think, also indicated that, during the last 12 months, £50,000 was spent on the reclamation of land.  If that is so, I should like to ask the Minister how many acres of land have been reclaimed.</P>

I saw no serious objection to that.  I would say that that is an expression of opinion as far as the people on these benches are concerned.  It is not intended to be an expression of opinion in respect of any other part of the House.  They can be here just as well as we can, and can raise points at suitable times just as well as we can.

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I do not want to say that I am not perfectly willing to discuss the More O'Ferrall case, but I think it proper to draw your attention, Sir, to this fact: Four men were arraigned and tried before a jury.  The first jury before which they were brought disagreed. They were subsequently tried <Col N="639" /> before a second jury and were acquitted by that jury, and the judge informed the jury that he agreed with their verdict.  I do not know whether it is in order or proper to discuss that trial here in this House, or to suggest in any way that these men were not properly acquitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <P>I do not propose to suggest that.  I could say a very great deal on that subject, but I do not propose to do so.

I submit, Sir, that I am in order in asking the Attorney-General whether or not he adopts the explanation given by the Acting-Minister for Justice on the Justice Vote&mdash;an explanation that had never been offered in this House before and that, if offered at all, ought surely to be offered by a legal expert and discussed and criticised by legal experts. The explanation given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, acting as Minister for Justice, was that the offence committed at Lissard was not one that could be regarded with certainty as having been committed with the object of impairing or impeding the machinery of government or the administration of justice.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the fact that the Minister accused me <Col N="641" /> of flippancy for suggesting that this case was one that could go before the Military Tribunal, and he said that I had evidently not considered the provision in the so-called Public Safety Act, to which I am referring now&mdash;the particular part of the Schedule to the Public Safety Act which covers offences that are committed with the object of impairing or impeding the machinery of government or the administration of justice.  Now, what I want to suggest. Sir, is that a very large number of cases have, in fact, been tried before the Military Tribunal where there was much more difficulty in holding that there was an attempt to impede or impair the machinery of government or the administration of justice than in the More O'Ferrall case.  In fact, I could hardly imagine a murder more directly connected with the impeding and impairing of the machinery of justice.</P>

      <P>The position demands some clarification.  The Deputy seems to be replying on this Vote to a speech made by the Acting-Minister for Justice on another Vote.  The Attorney-General stated that he does not always decide what cases should be referred to the Military Tribunal.  The responsibility did not rest upon him in the Longford case.  Therefore that matter may not be discussed on this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose I should accept responsibility where I have none.  I would be quite glad to do so to enable the Deputy to discuss the matter, but I referred already to clause 7 of the Appendix to the Article which sets out the offences which may be sent to the Tribunal without any certificate.  Then we have:</P>
      <P>Any offence whatsoever... in respect of which an Executive Minister certifies in writing under his hand that to the best of his belief the act constituting such offence was done with the object of impairing or impeding the machinery of government or the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I may take a view with regard to certain offences, and I may apply for the Minister's certificate and I may not get it.  He is master of the situation and must be satisfied.

I do not think I was at all singular in that misunderstanding.  I imagined the matter ought not to be fully gone into on the Vote for the Minister for Justice and I accordingly postponed remarks that I would otherwise have made then to this occasion. There is one other piece of legal advice about which I hope this evening to get some elucidation from the Attorney-General, and that is the advice which I presume comes from him, and must come from him, that the organisation known as the Irish Republican Army was so manifestly an illegal organisation that there was nothing to be gained <Col N="643" /> by proclaiming it as such under the Public Safety Act.  I want to ask the Attorney-General to tell us when he first tendered that advice to his colleagues.  Did he tender it when he was in Opposition?  Did he tender it before the general election in which they associated themselves as closely as they could with that body?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make many remarks about this Estimate, but, at the outset, I wish to draw the Attorney-General's attention to one matter.  I endeavoured to put a question about it in the House some time ago, but it was not allowed. Subsequently it was raised in a discussion as to the legality of the action of the Land Commission when dealing with certain lands in County <Col N="645" /> Mayo.  The Attorney-General then undertook to look into the matter, and I have reason to believe that he is in a position to answer.  I will put the facts as concisely as possible.  The Land Commission purchased a certain farm belonging to a man named Hession, on the Byrne estate in County Mayo, as we were told, for the relief of congestion. The Land Commission did not utilise that farm in its entirety for the purpose for which it was bought, but proceeded to give very substantial portions of it to a doctor and to two national teachers.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated in the House subsequently that the land was given to the doctor and the two school teachers as building plots, but it transpired that the doctor received seven acres and the national school teachers five acres each. The land was sold to them for cash. The statement that it was given as building plots had to be retracted in this House, and then we got from the Parliamentary Secretary the statement that it was given to them as cow plots That is a description which is new to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land which was purchased for the relief of congestion, was used as to 17 acres thereof&mdash;a very respectably-sized small holding in the County Mayo, a holding admirably suited for the relief of congestion&mdash;not for the purpose of relieving congestion, but was distributed amongst the three people whom I have named.  I should say in passing, though I think it was practically abandoned in discussion, that the Parliamentary Secretary did at one time say that while this land was being used by the doctor and the national teachers for feeding cows, it would not be able to feed the cow, either by grass in summer or by hay in winter, of the person who had left a congested holding and that, therefore, this land was not suitable for the relief of congestion. However, as I say, it is pretty obvious that that absurd contention could not be persisted in for very long. Therefore, the position is that the Land Commission having purchased land for the relief of congestion have utilised that land for purposes other than those of the relief of congestion. It had been stated here, again and again, by the then Minister, Mr. <Col N="646" /> Connolly, and by the Parliamentary Secretary to the then Minister and the present Minister, Deputy O'Grady, that the Land Commission are not under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary or of the Minister where reserved services are concerned, that this matter of the acquisition and distribution of land is a reserved service, and that the Land Commission acted completely in this matter without any control of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or of this House.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is abundantly clear that if there is any check at all on the Land Commission if they act illegally, the only person who can keep the Land Commission in check and who can take proceedings to prevent their acting illegally and to set aside any undertaking they may have entered into, is the Attorney-General.  Accordingly, the question I now put to the Attorney-General is this.  This land having been acquired for the relief of congestion under a statute very recently passed by this very Dáil, it can only be used, in my opinion at any rate, for the relief of congestion.  It has been utilised for other purposes by the Land Commission and their action, it seems to me at any rate, is clearly and obviously <i>ultra vires.</i>  They had no power to enter into these sales.  It was a violation of their statutory duty and, accordingly, I ask the Attorney-General, now that he has had a full opportunity of considering the matter, if it is his intention to take proceedings before the proper tribunal to have this question tested, if he considers it necessary that it should be tested or if it is plainly, void <i>ab inito</i> as it would appear to me at any rate, I would ask him whether it is his intention to take proceedings to have the sale of this bit of land, acquired for the relief of congestion, to two national teachers and to a doctor, set aside.  I await with interest the reply of the Attorney-General.  I hope the Attorney-General will give a favourable reply and, at any rate, that we shall have the views of a competent tribunal on this matter.  This, of course, is not a Party matter.  It is a matter of very grave interest and very grave importance to the whole country because if the Land Commission are not under the <Col N="647" /> control of the Minister or under the control of this House in these matters, their proceedings must be very carefully watched and, if they exceed their statutory powers, steps must be taken to set the matter right by remedying that excess.</P>
    <P>That is the only remark I have got to make on that matter.  It is almost the only remark I have got to make upon the Estimate for Law Charges, but there is just one other matter that I should like to place before the Attorney-General in connection with proceedings that are being taken before the Military Tribunal, and in connection, to some extent, also, with the speech of the Acting-Minister for Justice, who is moving about at the present moment so much like the busy bee gathering honey wherever he can. No doubt I entirely agree with the speech made by the Acting-Minister for Justice that the I.R.A. in its constitution is entirely illegal, that there has never been any doubt, or could be any doubt, about the legality of that association.  It is is plainly illegal under the terms of the Constitution Amendment Act No. 17.  But for a long time, although it was plain and beyond doubt to the Acting-Minister for Justice and plain beyond doubt to the Attorney-General and to the people of the country as a whole, that there was this illegal association in existence, yet the law was held in abeyance as regards that association. Persons who joined that association, though they must have known that they were acting illegally, thought at the same time that they were joining an association whose members were not going to be proceeded against by the Government.  Suddenly there was a change of attitude on the part of the Government.  For my part I welcome that change of attitude and I welcome the determination, no matter how late in the day, of the Government to put the law into force.  I welcome the determination of the Attorney-General to put the law in force against the I.R.A. as an unlawful association but I want to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to this one matter.</P>
    <P>The I.R.A. for a very considerable time was not proceeded against, and <Col N="648" /> persons had an idea that they could join the I.R.A. without running any risk of punishment or of imprisonment for joining that body.  It had not been proclaimed.  This is not a matter for the Attorney-General, of course, and I can only refer in passing to the advisability of following the procedure which the last Government followed in similar circumstances, a procedure which had very successful results, namely, that of giving every person who was a member of the I.R.A. an opportunity of leaving that illegal body and of knowing that if he signed a declaration that he had left that body&mdash;as so many of them did in 1931 when the Act became law&mdash;no proceedings would be taken against him. This is a matter for the Executive Council and I have only barely alluded to it.  I wished I had an opportunity of making these few remarks on the Vote for the Minister for Justice but, of course, I could not have made them then, the proclamation not having been issued at that time.  I want to impress on the Attorney-General that when anybody is indicted before the Military Tribunal, membership of the I.R.A. prior to the proclamation should not be a count in the indictment. It was only when the proclamation was issued that such men knew they were acting illegally or if they knew they were acting illegally heretofore they were not aware that the law would take any cognisance of it. They did not know that until this proclamation by the Executive Council was issued or until the speech was made by the Acting-Minister for Justice the day before.  It does not seem to me quite fair, therefore, that anybody should be indicted for membership of that association prior to the date of the proclamation.  It is very important in dealing with a body like the I.R.A. that there should be no sense of injustice or hard dealing on their part.</P>
    <P>That body I know, and I had to deal with them.  I hope the Attorney-General will adopt the method that I always adopted.  Let them know that the law can be strong where strength is necessary.  Let them know that the law can be severe where severity is necessary; but at the same time let <Col N="649" /> them know that the law is scrupulous, just and fair, and that the law will not be put in force against a man except in circumstances of having committed, or been charged with committing, an offence for which he knew he would be proceeded against at the time the offence was committed.  I fancy the Attorney-General will very much agree with the spirit of what I have just put forward and will see that no further counts will be contained in any indictment of membership of the I.R.A. when the membership dated from before the proclamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All the observations I have to make upon this Estimate will, I am afraid, be extremely prosaic.  I find I have only one grievance against the Attorney-General since last year; and a discussion of this kind is bound to be prosaic unless you can bring up some grievances against the head of the Department.  When I have unburdened myself of the one grievance I have against the Attorney-General, I should then like to put one or two questions to him.  First of all, I want to ask why it was, when a State Solicitor was appointed recently for Clare, a Mayo man was exported from Mayo and imported into the County Clare?  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate the point I am making, because there are in his constituency at least 14 competent solicitors.  It struck me, looking at it purely as an <Col N="650" /> outsider, and viewing the practice as it was when I was vested with that rather appalling necessity of making one of these appointments, that the policy then adopted was to give the appointment to a practitioner in the area in question.  During the entire time that I had the appalling necessity of making such appointments&mdash;and I sympathise with the Attorney-General when faced with that job, because there is no more trying experience in one's duty as head of the Department than to have to select one from 14 people who are extremely active in pursuit of the job&mdash;I always appointed a local man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I sympathise with the Attorney-General, I still feel a considerable grievance that somebody from Mayo had to be brought in and placed over the heads of the 14 local practitioners in Clare.  99 per cent. of these men&mdash; indeed, I think the whole of them&mdash;are competent.  Why it was necessary to bring in a complete outsider from Clare to fill the job passes my understanding. I should hurry to say that I understand that the gentleman in question has Clare connections.  I think if he had not that equity, so to speak, he would not be able to put his nose inside Clare.  Knowing Clare as I do, having practised there on many occasions at Quarter Sessions and Assizes, I think the Attorney-General did a rather bold act, if not a rash act, even though he satisfied himself of the fact that the person in question had Clare relations.  But it does imply a vote of censure, on the part of the Attorney-General, on the 14 practitioners in Clare.  I do press upon the Attorney-General, and I do so in all seriousness, that in all future appointments to be made the proper person to be appointed is a local practitioner. Bringing in an outsider is in itself some sort of censure upon local practitioners. I think local people are better able to deal with matters that they have to hand on to the Attorney-General from their own county.  They have to practise in a variety of matters before the District Court in connection with summary proceedings.  They are familiar with local conditions and with the local people and with all things <Col N="651" /> which are of inestimable value to the Attorney-General when prosecutions are being considered, and when, subsequently, after a conviction is obtained through the District Court, in considering what attitude the Attorney-General would take up if the conviction be a question of punishment.</P>
    <P>The question of prosecuting for indictable offences is a matter of considerable importance.  On the Estimates for the Department of Justice I raised a question as to whether or not an abnormal number of cases had not been transferred in the last couple of years from the country to the City of Dublin.  In that matter, in the connection as to whether or not a particular case should be transferred from the country to the City of Dublin, for trial, a question upon which the Attorney-General would want advice, he must rely mostly upon the advice of the local State solicitor.  Speaking generally, the Gárda are most anxious to have these cases transferred.  There is a natural reason for that, because the City and County Dublin jurors are more or less apart from local considerations, and have been doing their duty in a courageous and upright fashion in the last 12 or 14 years.  The result is that the local Gárda authorities think that they are more certain of a conviction from jurors in the City or County of Dublin than locally, and consequently they press, in 90 per cent. of their cases, for a change of venue.  The State solicitor is an interested individual, too.  He discounts the chances of a prosecution, if conducted locally, and he wants it taken somewhere else. Accordingly, if a transfer takes place the responsibility is passed on to somebody else.  At the same time, he knows the local conditions and is in a good position to take an impartial view of the question whether or not a case is fit to be transferred to the County or City of Dublin.  When I raised this point on the Estimate for the Minister for Justice, the Attorney-General assured me that it was his intention to carry on the policy of the office before he was Attorney-General and, as far as possible, to have criminal cases tried locally.  If the local jurors fail to do their duty, the proper policy, in my <Col N="652" /> view&mdash;I think the Attorney-General largely concurs with me in this&mdash;would be to let loose the local criminals on the local people and let them take them to their bosoms if they want to do so. The Attorney-General assured me that there was no great increase in the number of transferred cases.  I was not quite satisfied with the explanation of the Acting Minister for Justice as to the greatly increased number of trials in the Circuit Court in Dublin and in the Central Criminal Court.  It appeared to me that there was either a very large increase in ordinary crime in Dublin or else that the whole crime of the Saorstát was being tried in the City and County of Dublin.  On behalf of the hard pressed jurors of Dublin, I venture to enter a protest.  Perhaps the Attorney-General will deal with the matter when replying.</P>
    <P>There are a few routine matters which I want to mention.  As regards the payment of State solicitors, I notice that the amount in the Estimate is reduced by almost £800.  I should like to know the reasons for the reduction. It may seem strange that the Opposition should raise questions as to the reduction of an Estimate.  Usually protests are directed against increases in the Estimates.  I should, however, like to know what is the reason for the reduction in this item.  There may be a genuine reason for it, but I want to calm any query in my mind that the remuneration of State solicitors is being decreased.  I know that it is the policy of the Department of Justice, aided and abetted by the Department of Finance, to cut down the salaries and fees of professional men&mdash;solicitors, barristers, engineers and everybody else.  That is their set policy.</P>
    <P>It appears from the Estimate for the Attorney-General's Office to be so, because the salaries paid for assistant solicitors in what used to be known as the Treasury Solicitor's Office are really a disgrace.  I notice a rather interesting point&mdash;that women solicitors are paid less than men solicitors. While £175 is supposed to be a good salary for an assistant man solicitor, £10 less is supposed to be sufficient for an assistant woman solicitor.  So far as I know, there are no women solicitors <Col N="653" /> in the Civil Service of this State, but provision is made in this Estimate for women solicitors.  Why they should have a smaller salary than men solicitors I do not know.  They are both solicitors.  The point, however, is that they are both being paid at an extremely low rate.  I want the Attorney-General to give me an assurance that, so far as he is concerned, he will not stand for reduction of the salaries of State solicitors.  In my time the State solicitors were given an undertaking that their salaries would remain fixed.  Already, during the period of the present Administration, their salaries have been cut.  I want an assurance that they will not be further cut and that advantage will not be taken of new appointments by the Department of Finance, aided by the Department of Justice, further to reduce the remuneration of State solicitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would apply it to Ministers.  A certain friend of mine, who, I am glad to say, used to give me business, was accustomed to say that <Col N="654" /> cheap law was bad law.  That is my view in every department of life.  If you want results you must pay for them.  That goes for labour as well as everybody else, so far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>One of the activities of the Attorney-General's Department is to look after the statutes.  An official in the Parliamentary Draftsman's section of the Department every year prepares an index for the annual bound volume of the statutes.  In my time that was done with great expedition and complete accuracy.  I am sure it is being done with the same accuracy and the same speed now, but while I was there I was never able to get the bound volumes of the statutes published in time.  They are not published for six, eight or 12 months after the relevant year.  I was never able to understand why that was so, and I was never able to track down the place where the delay occurred.  Certainly it did not take place in the Attorney-General's office.  Everybody repudiated liability for the delay, but the net result was that the statutes were late in making their appearance and still continue to be late.  Sometimes they are not published until nearly 12 months after the lapse of the year to which they relate. I want the Attorney-General to carry on that fight on behalf of the ordinary practitioners who have to look to the bound volumes of the statutes in their daily task.  In reply to a question I put down during the year, the Minister for Finance said that he was not aware that any great public inconvenience was caused by delay in publication of the bound volumes of the statutes. The Attorney-General will appreciate the difficulty of a practitioner when these various statutes come out at irregularly intermittent intervals.  They do not come out in sequence.  Sometimes the unbound copy of No. 5 comes out before No. 1, and No. 10 may come out before No. 3.  It is sufficiently difficult for the ordinary practitioner to keep abreast of the flood of legislation without having to search in the rags and tatters of the unbound volumes of the statutes.  I ask the Attorney-General to direct his attention to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> The last point to which I want to allude has been touched upon by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  On the Estimate for the Department of Justice I raised the question of the statements of witnesses taken by the Guards.  Now the one thing on which we must be all united in endeavouring to secure is that the ordinary people will have respect for the administration of the law whether conducted by the judiciary or conducted by police witnesses. That is an absolute necessity if the State machinery is not to break down.  In connection with that matter the Attorney-General has very considerable responsibility, and I think I am right in saying that the Attorney-General realises that and performs that duty to the best of his skill and ability.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General has to be convinced at some stage, either before a prosecution is directed or after the proceedings are instituted in the District Court or carried on after their institution, and the party has been returned for trial to the Circuit Court or Criminal Court.  The Attorney-General ought to scrutinise scrupulously those so-called statements by people charged with offences, and if he has any doubt as to whether those statements have been made voluntarily or not he should not offer them in evidence. There are cases of this kind in court from time to time, and the number is growing.  Again I appreciate the position of the Attorney-General in this respect.  In these cases he is placed in a position of delicacy, having regard to the zeal of the Guards in extracting confessions from prisoners.  After having considered them he is in a delicate position in deciding whether these confessions are to be nullified.  I say that that position is growing in the country.  In a large number of these cases if the evidence were left without the statement made by the prisoner there would be no case against the prisoner.  That class of case now is growing.  Very often we have the position that suddenly, when there is no case at all against the prisoner, there <Col N="656" /> is produced a complete confession on the part of the prisoner.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the vast majority of the Guards, superintendents and ordinary Guards, do not take an unfair advantage of the prisoner.  At the same time the feeling is undoubtedly growing that those so-called voluntary statements taken by the Guards as voluntary statements are not being got as voluntarily as some people say they are being got.  If that feeling grows, it will tend to minimise greatly the value of State prosecutions and ultimately it will bring the administration of the law into disrepute.  We must put up to the community the importance of having the law vindicated and of educating public opinion in this country in respect for the law and for its administration. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney appealed to the Attorney-General in the matter of initiating certain prosecutions. I would add my voice to what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said.  I would say even in prosecutions before the Military Tribunal&mdash;perhaps I should say particularly before the Military Tribunal&mdash;the utmost scrupulousness should be, and I am sure will be, observed by the Attorney-General in the conduct of cases.  I would appeal to him to say that only such evidence as would be held to be legal in an ordinary criminal court will be put forward by him at trials before the Military Tribunal.  If the Military Tribunal gets the reputation in the matter of these trials of convicting on evidence 90 per cent. of which is alleged to be made up of voluntary statements, then any respect for the law through that particular channel will undoubtedly be undermined and a great public danger will have to be faced.  I commend these few observations to the Attorney-General for his serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the suggestion put forward by Deputy Costello regarding the filling of vacancies for the position of State solicitor.  I thoroughly agree that if the Attorney-General wants good service from State solicitors in connection with work which these gentlemen have to perform, he should make a selection from the men making application from the local circuit in which the vacancy occurs.  If it is to get abroad that the <Col N="657" /> position of State solicitor in a particular circuit is open to every solicitor in the country, I pity the Deputies in regard to the canvassing that is sure to go on.  The ordinary solicitor has a very glib tongue, and he has many means of approaching Deputies and other politicians.  Apart altogether from the fact that it is very undesirable, from the point of view of getting the best results, that selections should be made from outside the circuit in which the vacancy occurs, the Attorney-General should make it clear that these positions in future will be filled from applications in the area where the vacancy takes place.  I support the other suggestion made by Deputy Costello and I am sure he is making the suggestion from his experience of the work of the Attorney-General's office&mdash;that is, that the assistant solicitors should have a higher commencing salary.  The Estimate before us shows that there are four assistant solicitors in the Attorney-General's Department.  I notice that the commencing salary for a qualified solicitor with large experience, possibly, is the miserable sum of £175.</P>

      <P>Plus what you like; every officer in the Department has plus with the exception of the Attorney-General himself.  There are four legal clerks who have no qualifications as solicitors with a commencing salary of £200.  I assume that the legal clerks with a commencing salary of £200 are not qualified solicitors.  A qualified solicitor has to spend a good deal of money and a good deal of time in qualifying for his profession.  Though I have been a quill driver myself for over 30 years, I am of opinion that professional men are entitled to more consideration in regard to salaries than the ordinary law clerk.  I submit this as a serious matter for the Attorney-General's consideration.  I hope he will give some thought to it.  The lords in the Department of Finance believe they are the last word in regard to everything.  Some of us know that the Minister for Finance is very much inclined, if not altogether inclined, to <Col N="658" /> swallow whatever advice is tendered to him by the lords of his Department. I would like to hear the Minister for Finance, if he has the inclination or the courage to do so, to defend a commencing salary of £175 for qualified solicitors as against a salary of £200 for legal clerks.  The Minister preaches the gospel about Christian social policy; let us have some of it in this matter and let some of it permeate his advisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is helpful to the House, I have no objection. There have been several points made, of varying degrees of importance, and I shall try and take them in the order of their importance as they strike me.  The first point of importance was the point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, which I think Deputy MacDermot also mentioned, in regard to my attitude towards men charged with being members of the I.R.A.  First of all, I should like to make it clear to Deputy MacDermot that prosecutions have been brought against a number of men for being members of an unlawful association, namely, the I.R.A., long before the recent proclamation.  There was a full-dress argument on the question before the Tribunal many months ago.  By reason of documents found on certain individuals, the case was made that the documents established that the individuals charged were members of an unlawful association promoting or encouraging the use of firearms and convictions were secured. In fact, as the acting Minister for Justice mentioned in the debate on his Vote, about 275 members of the I.R.A. have been tried and convicted before the Tribunal&mdash;not all of membership of an unlawful association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To pass on to what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asks.  I appreciate the spirit of the suggestion which he makes and I am sure he will at once understand that it is not my prerogative to adopt the attitude he suggests. That is a matter on which I could not act on my own responsibility.  He suggests that I should not charge anyone with being a member of the I.R.A. prior to the date of the recent proclamation. I mentioned the matter, as the Deputy raised it, to the acting Minister for Justice and he tells me that I may say this much to the <Col N="661" /> Deputy: that if any individual severs his connection with the I.R.A. and signs an undertaking that he will have nothing further to do with it, no proceedings will be instituted against him. I will go further and say that if any of the individuals who have been recently charged before the Tribunal with that offence, combined perhaps with the offence of refusal to answer questions, give a similar undertaking, the Minister tells me that he is prepared to recommend that they be released.</P>
    <P>I think that goes the whole way to meet Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's suggestion on that head.  I do not think that I would give, although I will bear in mind the suggestion, any undertaking that, if asked to prosecute for membership of the I.R.A., I will not lay a charge of membership at a date prior to the recent proclamation, for the reason that, as I have just stated, persons have already been charged. It will be within the recollection of the Deputy that about six or eight months ago a number of men were charged with being members of the I.R.A. and were convicted.  While the proclamation, as the President stated, makes the position clear to anybody beyond any doubt, there was an indication given in several cases which have come before the Tribunal to the effect that if documents were found on individuals, on which membership of the I.R.A. could be brought home to them, that if it could be shown from documents in their possession that they were members of a body which came within the list of associations which were unlawful under Article 2A, they ran the risk of being charged, and a number have been charged and convicted.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot asked me a question as to when I advised the Minister or the Executive Council as to the I.R.A. being an unlawful association. I do not really think that it is proper to ask me to state in the House what advice I gave to the Executive Council in regard to any particular matter. That is a matter for the Ministers responsible.  If they wish to reveal that I have given certain advice, it is quite open to them to do so, but I do not <Col N="662" /> think I am entitled to tell the House what advice I have given.  I do not suppose it is necessary or that the Deputy will press for any further clarification of the position than what I have just stated&mdash;that I have had no hesitation, where persons arrested have had on them evidence of the fact that they were members of an organisation which promoted or encouraged the use of firearms, in prosecuting them for being members of an unlawful association, and have, in cases where the evidence was available, put in as evidence against them the document which calls itself the Governmental Constitution of the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>I feel that Deputy MacDermot labours under a sense of grievance against me.  He suggests that he was induced to leave over the discussion of the More O'Ferrall case until my Vote came on because of something I said here.  I would dislike very much to have been responsible for inducing the Deputy to abandon raising something on the Minister for Justice's Estimate in the expectation that he could raise it here.  I have searched through the debates to see if I did make such a suggestion to the Deputy.  If he has the column in the debates before him in which he says that that appears I shall accept contradiction of my statement that the Official Reports bear no report of any such promise or suggestion by me.  I did, undoubtedly, make it in connection with another matter raised on that Estimate, but I think I did not make it on this matter. I do not want to be absolutely too certain of it, but I do not think I did make it.  I find it very hard to believe that I would, for the reason I gave when I raised the point against the Deputy.  I have already given the reason, that I think it is not proper to discuss the More O'Ferrall case here in the way it has been discussed. It seems to me that there is a limit to the discussion of a case which has come before the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not really want to lure the Attorney-General into a discussion on the More O'Ferrall case, but I did hope, if it was in order, to get him to clarify the principle which I quoted the Acting-Minister for Justice <Col N="663" /> as having laid down in the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  I have since turned up the passage in the speech of the Acting-Minister for Justice, and I think it confirms what I said.  I did not misquote him or misrepresent him in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe the Deputy has not turned up the other passage.  I was going on to meet the Deputy to this extent, that had I been asked my view upon the facts in that case I would have taken the view that it was a case in which it was extremely difficult to give a certificate.  I think the Minister would have to hesitate very much before he could give the required certificate in that particular case.  As the Minister himself pointed out, he has had no hesitation in giving a certificate in other cases, even though the charge was murder.  A certificate was given, in connection with the McGrory case and in other cases, perhaps not of murder, but where it was clear that the act constituting the offence was done for a particular purpose I would have no difficulty in obtaining a certificate.  There are border-line cases, and the Deputy must believe that in any case that comes to me for advice the Minister responsible must endeavour to discharge his duty conscientiously and make up his mind definitely as to whether it can be said that, in his belief, the particular act constituting the offence was done for one or other, or both, of the two purposes mentioned in the Schedule to the Act.  I merely go that far lest the Deputy might think that I was trying to evade discussion on the matter when he raised it earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has asked me a question in connection with certain lands in Mayo.  When the Deputy raised the matter here on a previous occasion I promised him that I would read the debate that took place to try and discover the particulars of the case.  I have done so.  I have gone to a lot of trouble to consider my position with regard to the Land Commission in a matter of this <Col N="664" /> kind.  I daresay that, if a case is made out that the Land Commission have clearly been guilty of a breach of their statutory duty, some means of challenging that can be found.  I, however, have examined this case carefully myself. I have had the opinion of senior counsel on it, and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot find any statutory restriction upon the Land Commission which would disable them from disposing of the particular lands in the way they did in this case.  I think the Deputy cannot have had all the facts before him.  I am not now going into the question of policy which was really at the back of the Deputy's attack upon what was done in this case.  I am merely discussing the question as to whether the Land Commission, where they have a certain area of lands in their hands and cannot find for it suitable persons of the class which the Land Acts mainly aimed to give it to, can dispose of it to other persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot assume that.  Surely, the Deputy is well aware of the answer which the Land Commission have made, and I am in the awkward position of having to ask the Land Commission for particulars to enable me to say whether or not action should be taken against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>From the practical point of view the answer of the Land Commission seems to me to be very complete.  They point out that they resumed a holding; that they cut it up into a number of economic holdings; that they found on their hands a certain area of land, about 29 acres, but that in that neighbourhood there was no suitable migrant whom they could conveniently migrate to it.  There were no suitable persons <Col N="665" /> in that congested area with a sufficient quantity of land to enable them, economically, to apportion land as an addition to their holdings.  Consequently, they were left with this parcel of land on their hands, and they did in this case what, I am sure the Deputy knows as well as I do, they have been doing for a number of years&mdash; that is where they have a parcel of land in their hands which they cannot dispose of in the ordinary way they divide it up into plots.  As far as I can see, they have ample powers to do that.  Once that appears to be so, I do not think the Deputy is serious in suggesting that I should come forward with proceedings to challenge the action of the Land Commission and set aside all these sales on the ground that the persons to whom the land was given were not persons entitled to receive land under the Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin asked a question as to the number of persons arrested and charged and dealt with before the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.  I understand that particulars in connection with this matter were given to the Deputy by way of reply to a Parliamentary question in the House some time ago.  If the Deputy puts down a further question I have no doubt the particulars can be brought up to date. I have no material at my disposal now to give him the particulars he asks for.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello asked me about the appointment of a State solicitor in the County Clare.  While the Deputy was right in saying that the solicitor appointed was practising in the County Mayo, he must be aware of the fact, because he referred to it in the course of his remarks, that the man appointed is, in fact, a Clare man, and was only temporarily out of his own county.  He has gone back there now, and I am satisfied, from what evidence I have of his abilities, that he will make a very efficient, and, I am sure, popular State solicitor.</P>

      <P>As regards the transferred cases, the Deputy raised this matter on the Vote for the Minister for Justice.  The acting Minister, in his reply at Column 2645 of the Dáil Debates, gave figures as to the number of cases tried in the Central Criminal Court and in the Circuit Criminal Court from the year 1925. They are not segregated and this table does not say how many of them were transferred cases.  I do not gather whether the Deputy was repeating the point he made there or whether he was relating his statement to the State solicitorship appointment.  The State solicitor is undoubtedly a person upon whose advice I must rely when a question as to whether a case should be transferred or not comes before me. I am quite certain that the recent appointee in County Clare will quickly familiarise himself with the conditions sufficiently to enable him to give correct advice in regard to such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite relevant.  As regards the reductions in the State Solicitor's office, which Deputy Davin discovered, the Minister for Finance is here and he is the person responsible for that. Deputy Costello stated that he thought the salaries were too small.  I naturally take an interest in the salaries paid to solicitors in the Chief State Solicitor's office and to State solicitors. I suppose it is not a breach of confidence to mention that occasionally there may be conflict with the Department of Finance and that our views clash. In this instance the Minister for Finance is fortunately in a position to be able to put forward the argument that when he advises a post at that figure the number of efficient and highly-qualified solicitors who apply is surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>We have it stated that a surprising number of highly-qualified solicitors make application. They apparently consider the figure offered a sufficient inducement, together with chances of promotion in the service.  These, it would seem, are sufficient to induce them to come forward and offer themselves for the post. The reduction in the figures is due to the fact that there has been a reorganisation of the staff.  There was recently a man appointed and I am quite satisfied, from the little experience we have had of him, that he is most excellently qualified for the post.  Perhaps we may be able to induce the Minister for Finance later to increase his salary. I must say, in justice to the Minister for Finance, that I have got him to agree to increase the salaries in the Departments under me wherever a case has been made out.  Although, generally speaking, the Department of Finance are very hard, they are sometimes surprisingly generous when a good case is made out.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>They have treated a number of officers with whom I have some connection quite fairly and I do not think it fair to the Minister for Finance to claim that he always refuses to do anything but reduce salaries.  Deputy Costello asked me about the printing of the Statutes. Although we are responsible in my office for the preparation of the Statutes, I think I can say that no responsibility for delay can rest with me.  I understand one of the reasons for delay is having the Statutes translated into Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of using statements made by prisoners, I do not think the Deputy is right in suggesting that there has been a growing tendency to rely upon what he terms so-called voluntary statements solely in criminal cases.  I was not aware of that until he mentioned it and it did not strike me that there has been any increase in the number of cases where we had to rely on the statements of prisoners. <Col N="668" /> I appreciate what Deputy Costello says about the responsibility which rests upon the prosecution of giving a fair trial.  If there is a reasonable doubt that a prisoner has not made the statement voluntarily, or that he or she has been induced to make it for some reason which would make it unacceptable in evidence, I would not hesitate to refuse to proceed with such a case.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not know that I share quite fully the Deputy's view about statements.  I cannot see any better evidence of guilt than a voluntary confession made by a person charged with an offence.  I think some people are inclined to go a little bit too far the other way with regard to the admissability of statements.  The law leans very strongly in favour of the prisoner in ordinary cases in the ordinary courts.  Unless it can be shown that the prisoner was duly cautioned and informed that he need not make a statement and, if he chooses to make one, that it may be used in evidence against him, or if it can be shown that any inducement, threat or promise was held out to him, any statement he makes cannot be used in evidence against him.  A prisoner who is undefended and quite ignorant of his rights is given every protection. If any of these elements creep into the taking of a statement, he has the opportunity of challenging the statement in court before the judge.  The trial judge is the arbiter as to whether or not the statement is to be admitted.</P>
    <P>With all that in favour of the prisoner, it is very doubtful indeed if there has been any case in which a person has had a conviction based upon a statement which was improperly obtained.  I assure the Deputy that I realise there are exceptional cases in which over-zealous Guards may obtain statements under circumstances which are not proper.  If such cases come to my notice, I will have no hesitation in declining to use the statements; but even if I do put forward the statements, accepting the explanation as to how they were obtained, there is the further safeguard to the prisoner in the protection which the law affords him and the assurance that he will obtain that protection from a skilled and <Col N="669" /> experienced judge.  I do not think there is any other point upon which I need comment.</P>

      <P>There is one point that I overlooked mentioning.  During the course of the last year a decision has been come to by the courts as to the right of a private individual or a private prosecutor to conduct prosecutions. It is quite clear that the Attorney-General's function is to conduct prosecutions on indictments, and that no private person can do that.  There has been in existence practically since the District Court started a perfectly ridiculous form, and I want the Attorney-General to use his influence to put an end to it.  In the District Court prosecutions for indictable offences are at the suit of a particular member of the Gárda Síochána.  The way that appears in the form is this&mdash;&ldquo;the Attorney-General (at the suit of Guard 101Q)&rdquo;.  That is taken from the old form where the prosecutions were in the name of the Crown&mdash;the King at the prosecution of Police Constable Cox.  I want the Attorney-General to use his influence to put an end to that entirely misleading form which is in general use throughout the country. For the first time since the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act, 1924, the position has been clarified by the decision of the court that in all ordinary prosecutions before a District Court it is the right of a private individual to prosecute.  A police constable who prosecutes in those courts in his own name is what is known as &ldquo;a common informer&rdquo;.  I do not want that particular capacity in which he prosecutes the same as every other private individual to be mixed up in this adaptation of an old form&mdash;the Attorney-General at the prosecution of Guard So-and-So. It is an entirely ridiculous formula, which in my view should be put an end to as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>May I say to the Attorney-General that I always had the idea of stopping it if I could.  The only <Col N="670" /> reason why it could not be stopped was that an interpretation of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act, 1924, had never been authoritatively declared. I myself had the privilege of having it authoritatively declared last year and now at the first opportunity I am making a plea to my successor that what I wanted done will be done.</P>

      <P>I cannot help expressing some disappointment at the information which the Attorney-General has given the House.  On the question which I raised in connection with the Land Commission acting <i>ultra vires,</i> I should like to point out certain things to the Attorney-General. In the first place proceedings to acquire land for relieving congestion, for which purpose great powers are given to the Land Commission, were taken for the first time under the Act of 1923.  I should like to point out that it is only since 1933 that the Land Commission has been freed from Parliamentary control.  I should also like to point out that while even prior to that the Land Commission may have had land attached to mansion houses and things of that kind which they gave to persons who were not directly migrants, yet the land which those persons surrendered could be utilised for the purpose of enlarging holdings. While of course I do recognise that the Attorney-General is handicapped by the fact that he had to get his facts largely from the party against whom he was proceeding, that is, the prisoner pleading not guilty as it were, still I think it is a matter of very considerable gravity that land should have been improperly distributed in this fashion.  It is absolutely absurd to say that the land could not be utilised; that the land which would be barren and sterile in the hands of a small holder is fertile in the hands of a doctor, or fertile in the hands of a school teacher.  That is the case which the Land Commission has made, and that is the case which the Attorney-General has gravely advised upon.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Attorney-General a question.  I take it he is charged with giving the prisoner at the bar as good a chance as the law entitles him to, and is charged with the general good conduct of any prosecution carried on in this country.  A case came before the Central Criminal Court in Dublin recently, in which a man was being prosecuted for introducing explosive substances into the household fuel of a neighbour.  It was alleged that this crime was perpetrated in an area which is within the Fior Ghaeltacht, and in that area the Civic Guards very properly do their business through the medium of the Irish language.  When the man was brought before the court of first instance the Guards who were giving evidence for the prosecution gave their evidence in English, although the court of first instance was situated within the Fior Ghaeltacht and the district justice could understand Irish.  The prisoner was returned for trial to the Central Criminal Court, Green Street, and was there arraigned before a jury, not a single member of which understood a word of Irish.  The trial judge did not understand a word of Irish.  Certainly some of the counsel for the defence understood no Irish.  I do not think any of the counsel for the prosecution understood Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have; I am not sure about that.  Certain it is that counsel were engaged in the case, on one side or the other, who did not know Irish.  The Attorney-General had no reason to believe that any single member of the jury understood Irish.  The Attorney-General had every reason to believe that the trial judge did not understand Irish.  The case proceeded to a certain point, and then the Guards who were in charge of the prosecution were produced.  They entered the box and announced that they were going to give their evidence in Irish, whereupon an interpreter was sent for.  The <Col N="672" /> farce was then gone through that a man who spoke English, and, I believe, had English as his vernacular&mdash;the Department of Justice says that Irish was the language into which he was born, but he certainly spoke English more fluently than he spoke Irish&mdash;was in the witness-box giving evidence, and he solemnly gave evidence in an acquired language to an interpreter who translated it to the jury and the trial judge.  That was in itself ludicrous enough, but then as I understand it counsel asked that Guard a question in a language which he well understood. The Guard sat with his mouth open until the question was translated into Irish by the interpreter, whereupon he proceeded to absorb it and to reply to it in Irish, when it was retranslated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to submit that that kind of conduct brings justice into disrepute. I fully see that that is the aspect of the question which should primarily concern the Attorney-General, but I think I am entitled to add&mdash;although I cannot make the Attorney-General directly responsible for this&mdash;that that kind of &ldquo;codology&rdquo; brings the Irish language movement into disrepute.  I do not think any rational believer in the revival of the Irish language in this country wants Irish to be made a public show-off in the Central Criminal Court, or wants Irish to be made a medium for obstructing the course of justice where the question is one of clearing the character of the man in the dock, on the one hand, or of bringing a criminal to justice effectively if the accused person is really guilty.  It does seem to me that if vital evidence is going to be tendered to the courts it should be done in the language which is best known to the witness, to the members of the jury and to the judge upon the bench.  If that is not done, an obstacle is put in the way of the effective administration of justice. Nobody wants the Irish language to appear in the public life of this country as an effective obstacle to the administration of justice, but that is what all this &ldquo;codology&rdquo; amounts to.  Now, if the Guards want to use the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and make it their daily vehicle of communication in the Gaeltacht and in the course of their work in the Gaeltacht, in my <Col N="673" /> opinion, they will do very valuable work, but they should not be asked to make exhibitions of themselves in the way I have referred to.  I should be glad to hear from the Attorney-General what his view is on the propriety of the proceedings that took place in Green Street in connection with the case I have mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want the Attorney-General to understand what was in my mind.  I do not want to elaborate this.  It is not for a layman to pit his opinion against the Attorney-General on a point of law, but I have difficulty in understanding how a raid on the house of an officer of the court, for the purpose of intimidating, and any crime committed in the course of that raid, can not be properly described as being with the object of impairing or impeding the administration of justice.  With regard to the other point I raised, the Attorney-General has told us rather triumphantly that he was successfully prosecuting members of the I.R.A. for membership of that body long before the illegality of that body was proclaimed.  I am quite conscious of that and always have been, but it seems to me to be treating the members of that body rather unfairly.  After all, I suppose prevention is better than cure, and the position has been left extremely ambiguous in their eyes.  They saw that, in spite of continuous pressure, their organisation had not, in fact, been declared illegal.  They saw that its parades and ceremonies were allowed to take place without interference all over the country and that it was only when somebody for <Col N="674" /> some specific reason got into the bad books of the Attorney-General that he was actually prosecuted by the Attorney-General for membership of that body.  My question to the Attorney-General was prompted by some natural curiosity, and, I think, by some natural regard for the public interest. It was designed to ascertain at what period the Attorney-General first realised that the organisation in question was, by its very aims and constitution, illegal, and when he tendered that advice to his colleagues; because I feel that something is needed to explain that tremendous transition through which they have passed.</P>
      <P>I am not out to make Party capital out of this.  I have not any Party for which to make capital, but I do think that any member of this House has a right, if not a duty, to be informed as to when it was that the Attorney-General brought his colleagues from the frame of mind in which the prosecution of a member of the I.R.A. seemed to be an act of intolerable tyranny or a steam-rolling of one's opponents or, in the words of Deputy Hugo Flinn, &ldquo;a damnable creation of a low and mean intelligence.&rdquo;</P>

I could not insist on a Guard giving evidence in English, even if I wished to do so, and I think it is absurd that I should be asked by the Deputy to give a personal opinion on the matter when what is under discussion is my conduct in my official position.  I could not insist on a Guard doing otherwise than he wished in the matter.  I do not think the judge who tried the case would agree that he did not understand Irish.  Certainly counsel prosecuting in the case and representing me not alone understood Irish but examined in Irish in that case.  The Deputy referred to the fact that this case was some time pending before it came to trial in Dublin.  The case was tried in Galway. I am not sure if all the evidence was given then, but there was a disagreement of the jury and I transferred the <Col N="679" /> case to Dublin.  That is merely incidental, and if the Guards in the case chose to give evidence in Irish, they were quite entitled to do so.  If evidence was given in Irish, and a proper translation was before the court, even though the jury did not understand Irish, I do not see why they were not capable of deciding whether the accused was guilty of putting a bomb in a sod of turf, and seeing it reached the house of a certain man with the intention, when inserted in the fire, that the place would blow up.  That was the issue in the case.  I do not think evidence given in Irish would prevent a jury coming to a conclusion on the facts.

      <P>There are two other points on this Vote that I want to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary. It has been suggested that during the last 12 months £50,000 has been spent on land reclamation.  I should like to get some particulars of the work carried out for that £50,000; first, whether any of the money spent was given as grants to persons to carry out reclamation work on their own farms; how much was spent in that way, and what amount of land was reclaimed. Was any of the money spent on land in the possession of the Government, <Col N="680" /> and, if so, how many acres were dealt with, and what was done with the land?  Was it sold or retained by the Government, or how is it being used? The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the wages paid on relief schemes were based on a calculation made on the amount of unemployment assistance paid to a man, and the value of the free beef given him, with the addition of some percentage.</P>

      <P>I am sure the country will be very much delighted and obliged to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to-morrow morning when, without the blare of trumpets or the beating of drums, there is revealed the Government's conception of a Christian social State.  It is a minor relief scheme, financed half-way by public bodies and, to a similar extent, by the Government, to be carried out by unemployed at the rate of 24/- a week, and by unemployed men who will not be able, or will not be allowed, to work more than 15 days in the month.  That is the Government's conception of a Christian social State.  That is the Christian social State in which for the next 12 months all the unemployed will be able to get £9 per man.  That is the position we have to face and we have to face it with the knowledge that the Parliamentary Secretary is going to indulge once more in an orgy of slap-dash schemes scattered over the country without any express purpose, with no cohesion and with no objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these schemes have been in operation for some years past, we have had the Parliamentary Secretary's designs on the Government's masterpiece&mdash;a drainage scheme here, cleaning rivers which are likely to get choked after a couple of years if they are not looked after, and the making of roads which, if they are not looked after, in a few years more are likely <Col N="681" /> to be as bad as before the Board of Works started on them.  We have had that system or want of system going on, with no direction whatever.  The one design of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department is to carry out schemes to relieve unemployment.  I suggested to the Minister on another occasion&mdash;and even at the risk of repetition and of being tiresome I am going to suggest it again&mdash;that there should be some objective in the Parliamentary Secretary's schemes, that he should set himself to create some standard towards which he would work.  I suggested that there should be a minimum standard of social service as his objective, that he should direct himself towards that, and that he would find in that a plentiful source of schemes in which he could usefully employ the money that is to be expended and the labour that is at hand.  I suggested to him that there should be a minimum standard in housing and that he should concentrate in effecting that through the machinery which he has at his hands under this Relief Schemes Vote.  I suggested to him that he should work towards a minimum standard in service and that he has got here the machinery through which he might usefully expend this money.  I suggest to him that there should be a minimum standard in sanitation and water supplies and that he could usefully work towards that through the machinery he has at his hands in these relief schemes.  Nothing of that kind is being attempted. There is no objective of any kind as far as I can see.  We merely have these slap-dash schemes all over the country.</P>
    <P>We had a good deal of talk about the method of recruitment of labour and the Parliamentary Secretary gave us a very clear indication that he is not entirely acquainted with the means by which employment is given on these schemes.  I want to say definitely that I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is at all evading the position. I believe that he is endeavouring, and has always endeavoured since he undertook the administration of these schemes, to keep in close touch <Col N="682" /> with them and to see that fair play is given in the recruitment of labour on these schemes, but he has not accomplished his purpose.  He has certainly failed to a great extent to accomplish that purpose.  I know districts where people are brought three or four miles to work on schemes while people who are drawing unemployment assistance are left idle at the very verge of the work.  I do not know where the people who are brought from the outside districts are registered, whether it is in the labour exchange or somewhere else.  I do know that they are not registered at the local employment exchanges and I do know the people who are registered at the employment exchanges and who are drawing the highest scale of unemployment assistance are left idle. I have taken occasion to bring these matters to the notice of a number of Government Departments but I have found that the work in a great many places is completed or very nearly completed before the necessary investigations are carried through.  That is a state of affairs of which the Parliamentary Secretary should take cognisance and endeavour immediately to rectify.</P>
    <P>I have got information from people who are in daily touch with schemes in three districts in my own county. I know one district where people were brought five, six and eight miles to work while people who were living in the middle of the village where the work was being carried out were left idle.  I know a district where a water scheme is being carried out and where people were left idle in the village. By the time the water scheme reached the village most of the work had been given away to people whose valuation was up to £5, £6 and even £8.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought to take cognisance of these matters.  One Department which I approached in connection with this matter informed me that it was no concern of that Department.  When I made representations to another Department, I was referred back to the Department which had told me that it was no concern of theirs.  I refuse to be made a shuttlecock between Departments in trying <Col N="683" /> to ascertain who is responsible in that way.  I think some Department ought to take responsibility.</P>

      <P>It can occur in various ways.  It can occur through the activities of an energetic ganger who would go to the exchange or indicate to the exchange the particular district or number of districts from which he wants to get men and who will deliberately cut out a number of other districts because he does not want to give employment to men from these districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary that I do know this method is employed.  The exchange is supposed to get a list of the townlands from which labour in that particular area has to be drawn.  I know that <Col N="684" /> an energetic and prejudiced ganger can give a particular number of townlands from which he wants to recruit labour and deliberately cut out a number of other townlands from which he does not want to take any labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not perturbed.  But I promise that if there, is anything wrong or any machinery going wrong I will take means, as far as is in my power, to prevent that occurring again. I have no knowledge of any such case, nor has any member of the House, or anyone outside the House, brought any such case to my knowledge.  I am more anxious to have an examination into a case such as that alleged to have occurred than people can possibly imagine.  I am very anxious to get a case in which things have gone wrong so that I may stop it.  I do not know of any such case now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary would stop such an occurrence as I have alleged if it happened again.  If I report a case to a Government Department, and point out irregularities that have occurred, it is surely the duty of the particular Government Department, if I made a mistake in going to the wrong Department, to send me to the right Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an idea that the Board of Worrks is a clearing house for the investigation of all sorts of grievances without any relation to the fact that our Department <Col N="685" /> was not responsible and where it is really only a matter of courtesy to get these things treated in the proper Department.  But it is not my responsibility, or the responsibility of any particular Department, when some one sends them a case with which they have nothing to do to do more than say that.  Their responsibility ends there.  But as a matter of fact and consideration people are very often helped to find the right Department to which the complaint should be sent.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's dogma.  If I write to the Local Government Department about something that has gone wrong, for instance, in regard to the recruitment of labour, it is the duty of the Local Government Department to send it on to the Department dealing with labour.  I am not now discussing Local Government.  I am discussing the recruitment of labour.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Parliamentary Secretary information which I have, and upon which I can base my statement.  I would like that this statement should be immediately investigated so that the work that is being carried out in a particular district would not be completed before justice is done to the people who are entitled to get that work there.  In connection with the recruitment of labour I know that very grave injustice is being done to these people.  First of all every possible means should be taken to investigate before people are deprived of their unemployment assistance. People have been knocked out of unemployment assistance; while their cases are being investigated they are not entitled to be put to work on the scheme and by the time a case is decided the scheme has concluded in their area.  That is a matter the Parliamentary Secretary should take into consideration.</P>
