      <P>The number of factories, workshops and other places to which the Factory and Workshop Acts apply in the administrative County of Clare which are on the factory register kept in my Department is 262.  I have not information at my disposal which would enable me to state the numbers employed by these factories or the rates of wages paid but, in the case of certain of the trades to which the Trade Board Acts apply, minimum rates of wages fixed by the boards apply.  The information furnished in connection with the Factory Acts includes a general indication of the nature of the work carried on at the premises but this would not enable me to state precisely the nature of the commodity or articles produced in all these establishments. Forty-five of the premises mentioned are in Kilrush and district, 54 in Ennis and district, 44 in Ennistymon and district.  The remainder are scattered in other parts of the county.

Farmers' wives bringing 10lbs. or 20lbs of butter to town are stopped on the streets and their baskets examined by inspectors.  It is a thing that would not be allowed to happen even in a non-Christian country.  It is no laughing matter.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Liffey Reservoir Bill, 1936, be read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for additional advances to the amount of £2,734,000 from the Central Fund to the Electricity Supply Board for the purposes <Col N="45" /> of financing capital commitments to be undertaken by the Board in the period ending on the 31st March, 1938. That sum is required to provide for the installation of two additional steam units, for substantial extensions to the Board's transmission and distribution systems, and for the hydro-electric development of the River Liffey.  The Bill before the House gives statutory effect to an agreement which was concluded in last June between the Dublin Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board, and it confers certain powers on the corporation, the effect of which is to combine with the hydro-electric development of the Liffey a scheme for the provision of an improved and additional supply of water for the City of Dublin and the surrounding area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of this measure, and particularly the provision for the utilisation of the Liffey, affords what I think is a convenient opportunity for a brief survey, in retrospect, of the progress of electrical development in the Saorstát in recent years since, as a result of the expert investigation which was undertaken in 1924, legislation was first promoted to provide for the hydro-electric development of the Shannon.  On the completion of the construction works the Electricity Supply Board was established in August of 1927 under the powers conferred by the Electricity Supply Act of that year: and under the powers conferred by the Act, and also by a series of subsequent enactments, capital advances have been made on many occasions from the Central Fund to the Electricity Supply Board to enable it to discharge its functions.  When the experts presented their report at the end of 1924 the total generating capacity of public electricity works in the Saorstát, including the generating station of the Dublin United Tramways Company, was 33,000 kilowatts. The present capacity is 124,000 kilowatts, and this Bill before the House makes provision for the installation of 70,000 kilowatts additional capacity, bringing the total generating capacity of the Board's system to 194,000 kilowatts. The total amount of current generated when the experts made their report was estimated at 55,000,000 <Col N="46" /> units per annum.  It is now 270,000,000 units per annum and, when the additional capacity contemplated by this Bill is available the current generated will be in the region of 400,000,000 units per annum.  The number of electricity consumers in the Saorstát in 1925 was 36,000; the number to-day is 130,000.  The annual consumption of electricity in 1925 was 18 units per head of the whole population; the consumption to-day is 81 units per head, and the Board hopes to treble that figure in the course of the next few years.  Industrial motive power load, which is the index, not merely of the increasing popularity of electricity as a source of industrial power, but also of our rapid industrial expansion, has increased from 29,600 horse power in 1931 to 68,800 horse power in 1936.  The average price of current per unit has fallen from 2.66 pence in 1929-30 to 1.84 pence in 1935-36.  The Board's capital receipts at the 31st March last, including the cost of all the Shannon works, and liabilities taken over from local authorities, was £11,206,000, and this Bill, as I explained, provides for additional advances amounting to £2,734,000.  The revenue of the Board has increased from £478,000 in 1929-30 to £1,430,000 in 1935-36, and the revenue for the first seven months of the present year shows an improvement of £84,000 on the corresponding period of last year.  The Board has paid all interest charges due to the Exchequer, and last year was able to set aside the substantial sum of £230,000 to a depreciation fund, and, I have no doubt, in a relatively short time, it will be in a position to provide full depreciation charges and, in addition, commence the repayment of Exchequer advances.  The total number of persons employed by the Board is now approximately 2,500.  I think the House will agree that the figures which I have just given present an impressive picture of progress, and provide me with ample justification in asking for the powers which this Bill proposes to confer.</P>
    <P>Public interest in this Bill will, no doubt, be concentrated in the main on the Liffey hydro development scheme. I want to emphasise the fact that of the total advances of £2,734,000 for <Col N="47" /> which the Bill provides, only £634,000 is appropriate to the Liffey scheme. The capacity of the Liffey plant may be taken at 30,000 kilowatts.  The capacity of the two additional steam units, for which provision is made in the Bill, is 40,000 kilowatts, and the cost of these two units is £432,000.  If any comparison is to be made between the figures which I have just given, it must be borne in mind in this connection that the cost of the operation of steam plant is relatively higher than that of hydro-electric plant, as the outlay on coal, in the first place, offsets the increased standing charges incidental to the higher capital expenditure which a hydro-electric scheme involves. Again, the maximum theoretical number of units which can be produced from the Poulaphouca scheme, that is the Liffey development scheme, excluding possible subsequent development at Leixlip, is 39,000,000 units in an average flow year; and it is estimated that the amount of power which can be usefully employed will be 30,000,000 units at the time when the total consumption of the Board's system is 400,000,000 units per annum, increasing to 34,000,000 units when the Board is generating 500,000,000 units per annum.  For as far ahead as it is possible to see, the Shannon will remain the most important source of supply of electricity; new and existing steam plant will reckon second in importance, and the Liffey third.  It is necessary to stress these facts so as to place in proper perspective the scheme for hydro-electric development of the Liffey.  The output of the Liffey will always form a relatively small fraction of the total output of the Electricity Supply Board's system.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the hydro-electric development of the Liffey have been discussed from time to time, since the question of electricity development in the Saorstát first attracted attention. In 1922 Doctor Buchi, the well-known Swiss water power engineer, reported to the Dublin Corporation on the subject of the utilisation of the water power of the Liffey for generating electricity for Dublin and district. The experts who sent in a report at the end of 1924 on the Shannon hydro-electric scheme visualised the development <Col N="48" /> of the River Shannon in two possible directions.  They stated&mdash;I am quoting from their report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One way would be to develop the Shannon river fully with as large storage basins as possible.  Only at a later stage would supplementary energy from steam stations or from the Liffey be resorted to for covering the deficiency in dry years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And further they stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another way would be to take in supplementary energy from a future development on the Liffey or from steam stations at an earlier stage of the Shannon development. The possibility is by no means excluded of the latter course being the better one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board decided in practice that the second of these alternatives was the more desirable, and the Board's policy has, accordingly, followed that line.  Hence we have had a gradual development of the steam station at the Pigeon House as a stand-by for dry weather, and now it is proposed to utilise the Liffey before installing the fifth unit on the Shannon.  This alternative method of development does not mean that less use is to be made of the resources of the Shannon, and that can best be seen by reference to the figures given in the experts' report from which I have quoted.  They anticipated that, with six generating units installed on the Shannon, 237,000,000 units of electricity would be developed there.  In fact, in the last financial year, although the water-flow was 14 per cent. below the average, 211,000,000 units were developed from the Shannon, and by the introduction of steam and this proposed Liffey development the Board anticipates that it will be drawing about 301,000,000 units per annum from the Shannon before the fifth unit is installed at Ardnacrusha.  Thus, as the experts suggested it was possible, a better utilisation of the Shannon resources has been secured by the alternative method of developing supplementary energy in parallel.</P>
    <P>On page 115 of their report the experts, in speaking of the Liffey scheme, stated that they were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Of opinion that for general, national and national-economic <Col N="49" /> reasons, the combination Shannon-Liffey had advantages over the combination Liffey-Shannon, and that, accordingly, the further study of the Liffey scheme in its connection with the Shannon plant could be deferred at least until such date as the partial development of the Shannon was utilised to the full.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That last stage was, in fact, reached about 1934.  On page 117 of their report the experts continue:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the opinion of the experts, the Liffey river will also be developed later on, either during the further development of the Shannon or more probably after this, depending on how the consumption of electricity develops.  The Liffey storage would in all probability make possible a valuable compensating system for the full development of the Shannon. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to examine if it would not be more advantageous to use the existing steam stations, or eventually a new steam station for energy supply at low water periods or for covering peak loads.  In about 20 years the fully developed Shannon, together with the Liffey plant, and the steam stations, would together probably build an advantageous source of electricity supply for the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the quotation from the experts' report.  That report was submitted in 1925, and they were then visualising the situation which would exist about 1945.  Broadly speaking, it may be said that the scheme appears to be developing in accordance with their anticipations.  The Electricity Supply Board submitted a preliminary report to me in 1934 on the question of the development of the Liffey.  The board thought it advisable to call in consulting engineers to examine the proposals. Dr. Buchi, who had reported to the Corporation in 1922 upon the Liffey scheme, as I have mentioned, and Professor Meyer-Peter, one of the experts who reported to the Government in 1925 on the Shannon scheme, were retained.  These two engineers submitted a report to the Electricity Supply Board in 1935.  Dr. Buchi made a separate report to the Dublin Corporation. I may say at this stage that <Col N="50" /> the proposals recommended by these two engineers, and adopted by the Board, do not differ essentially from those submitted originally to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides for the erection of a dam in the rocky gorge a short distance above Poulaphouca Bridge. The erection of this dam will create a reservoir, the water level in which will be 615 feet above Ordnance datum, with provision for a possible raising of the level to 618 feet.  The level of the water will be, roughly, the level of the existing Poulaphouca Road Bridge.  The area which will be flooded will be, approximately, 5,500 acres, and the volume of the water which will be stored will be 166,000,000 cubic metres for utilisable storage of about 148,000,000 cubic metres.  From the retaining dam a head-race gallery some 1,300 feet long will lead the water to a surge tower from which a penstick will lead to the principal power house, situated on the right bank of the river about 300 yards below Poulaphouca waterfall.  Below this main power house a smaller power station is proposed at Golden Falls in which the water will be again utilised.  The maximum fall available, including Poulaphouca Fall and Golden Falls, will be approximately 220 feet.  The power could be made available in one power house situate at Golden Falls, but it has been found that the two power plants will be a more economic proposal.  The water below Golden Falls will pass down the channel of the river.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation will design an arrangement by which they will be able to draw off a supply of drinking water from the Poulaphouca reservoir. There is a further utilisable fall on the river at Leixlip.  The development of that fall was included in the original Dublin Corporation proposals to which I have made reference.  That fall may in time be developed by the Electricity Supply Board, but its development is not provided for in the present proposals. The potential production of the Liffey power plant must, as I have already indicated, be described as small in comparison with the present production of the Shannon power <Col N="51" /> station.  But its value lies less in the actual quantity produced than in the fact that owing to the large storage capacity of the Poulaphouca reservoir it can generate energy when the Shannon power station has not sufficient energy owing to lack of water, as for example in summer, or when the Shannon power station, in consequence of its limited output, cannot quite cover the peaks of the system, as in winter.  The Liffey power may be regarded as first-class power, in asmuch as it can be made available at any season of the year, and when it is most wanted. The storage at Poulaphouca will impound 50 per cent. of the total flow of the Liffey in an average year, whereas on the Shannon the storage amounts to, approximately, only 5 per cent. of the annual flow.  The River Liffey has the further advantage that it is a comparatively short distance from Dublin, which, as Deputies are aware, is the chief centre of consumption, so that the energy can be transmitted safely and cheaply to that centre.  Owing to the large storage capacity of the Liffey it can be called upon to supply to the system at its full capacity at any time, and at short notice, if there should be a temporary breakdown elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the Liffey power development can be regarded as economic as compared with steam power when the total consumption on the Electricity Supply Board system is about 400,000,000 units.  At present it appears probable that that point will be reached in approximately four years' time.  At that point of time, according to present plans, the installed capacity of the machinery at Ardnacrusha will be 80,000 kilowatts; the installed capacity of steam plant, 84,000 kilowatts; and the probable installed Liffey plant, 30,000 kilowatts. Apart from the Liffey scheme, provision is also made in this Bill, as I have stated, for the installation of two new steam units.  One of those will probably be brought into commission at once, or at any rate as soon as possible. The Electricity Supply Board considers that a second additional unit must be installed in time to carry the peak load in the winter of 1938.  Each <Col N="52" /> of these two new units will have a capacity of 20,000 kilowatts.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the construction of a new 110 k.v. line from Dublin via Waterford to Cork.  This is necessitated primarily by the growth of the load, but the building of the new line will also provide additional security for the supply of the City of Cork which is at present fed by a single 110 k.v. line form Ardnacrusha, and it will increase the capacity of the complete 38 k.v. net work in the South. Provision is also made in the Bill for an extension of the Inchicore plant, and an increase of its transformer capacity, as well as for an improvement of the 38 k.v. transmission system at Dundalk and Galway.  £200,000 is provided for distribution services and meters, and represents a normal provision on the basis of the current rate of growth.  £182,000 is provided for the extension of the distribution system, £120,000 for cooker hireage and water heater hireage schemes, and £120,000 for additional capital outlay in connection with public lighting. Provision is also included for expenditure on the acquisition and maintenance of the Shannon fisheries.</P>
    <P>So far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, the provisions of Part III of the Bill are based on the corresponding provisions of the Electricity Supply Acts, with such consequential modifications as the circumstances of the present scheme require. Deputies will observe that, while Part III of the Bill, which relates to the Electricity Supply Board, and Part IV, which relates to the Dublin Corporation, are complementary to each other, there are certain differences in the form of the provisions relating to the acquisition of land and so forth as between one part and the other.  These differences are attributable to varying procedure under different codes of law. In the case of the proceedings of the Board under Part III, the Lands Clauses Acts, as incorporated and varied by the Electricity Supply Acts, have been applied, and, as regards the proceedings of the Corporation under Part IV, the relevant provisions of the Public Health Acts have been applied, but not varied except to a minor extent.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me <Col N="53" /> to enlarge on the necessity for and the urgency of this measure in its relation to the water supply of Dublin City. It is, I think, generally known that the present needs of the city are not being adequately met, and that the time is, in fact, overdue when action to supplement the present supply must be taken.  Perhaps a brief historical survey will help Deputies to understand the position.  The earliest public water supply brought into Dublin was taken from the River Dodder, somewhere in the vicinity of Templeogue, and conducted to the city through a channel which is still known as &ldquo;The City Watercourse.&rdquo;  That water was stored in what were known as basins or cisterns, and supplied at the street level.  For over two centuries the city was supplied in that manner.  The expansion of the city area and population caused the city councillors to seek further supplies, and about the year 1775 arrangements were made to take a supplementary supply from the Grand Canal.  Later on, a further supply was taken from the Royal Canal.  The water from the Grand Canal was stored at the Blessington Street Basin, which was specially constructed for that purpose.  It is still in existence although it is not now used for that purpose.  The supplies were all low pressure, and very intermittent.</P>
    <P>In 1861 the Corporation of Dublin obtained the statutory powers to extract water from the River Vartry and provide a high-pressure supply for the city.  The Act also empowered the corporation to provide a supply for certain areas outside the city, mainly neighbouring townships and portions of the adjoining rural areas along the line of distribution.  In 1930, when the urban districts of Rathmines and Rathgar were merged in the City of Dublin, the supply of water from the River Dodder at Bohernabreena, which was provided by the former urban district council to serve the inhabitants of the urban district, became a part of the Dublin water system.  The service reservoir at Bohernabreena has a capacity of 12,000,000 gallons.  Even under the combined system, the needs of the present city area are not being adequately met.  There has been a very rapid expansion of the city, both <Col N="54" /> in area and in population, and that has been accompanied by an even more than proportionate increase in the demand for water to meet the development in sanitary requirements.  In 1861 the population of Dublin and the adjoining urban areas of Rathmines and Pembroke was 306,000, and to-day the present city, which includes those areas, has a population of 468,000.  The corporation are also under an obligation to supply the extra municipal areas, which, as I have already indicated, embrace the adjoining rural areas, as well as the Bray Urban District, and portions of the rural areas along the line of distribution from Roundwood.  The area of supply is, therefore, very wide and it is imperative that the existing system should be supplemented as quickly as possible. The corporation has given close attention to the problem for some time past. The laying of an additional main from Roundwood was considered but, owing to the increased demand which has arisen and which is likely further to increase in the future, it was decided that such a course would not offer the same advantages as would be derived from an independent supply obtained from the River Liffey.</P>
    <P>While the Liffey proposals were under consideration by the corporation, the Electricity Supply Board had in mind the possibility of impounding at some future date the waters of the Liffey to supplement the Shannon scheme.  It will be gathered from what I have already said that such a supplementary scheme was not one of immediate urgency from the view-point of the Electricity Supply Board but, nevertheless, it was felt that it would prove of definite economic value eventually and that the best results could be achieved by the Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board uniting in carrying out a scheme which would meet both their purposes.  The agreement which is scheduled to the Bill, and which it is proposed to confirm by the Bill, is the outcome of the negotations between these two bodies. So far as the water supply scheme is concerned, the corporation have had expert advice in the matter and they are satisfied that the scheme when completed will, in conjunction with the Vartry scheme, provide an adequate <Col N="55" /> supply for all purposes not only in the area at present served from the Vartry, but also in adjoining areas over many years to come.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Board of Public Health is taking a keen interest in the present proposals.  When the new scheme is in operation, the corporation should be in the position to supply the board of health with sufficient quantities of water for any areas in the county requiring supplies.  The Bill makes full provision in this respect and also for supplies to the County of Kildare if required.  The distribution of the supply within the area of any of the sanitary authorities in Dublin or Kildare will be a matter for the sanitary authority concerned.  An adequate supply for the County Borough of Dublin and the areas outside the county borough that are entitled to be supplied by the Dublin Corporation must first be met but, subject to this condition, it will rest with the corporation and the sanitary authority seeking a supply to settle the terms upon which the supply is to be given. If there is any disagreement as to the terms of the supply, or as to the point of supply, the matter will be determined by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the reservoir and the Poulaphouca-Golden Falls works and the transmission lines is £760,000.  This expenditure may be broadly analysed as follows: dam and civil construction, £387,000; roads, bridges and the acquisition of lands, etc., £183,000; mechanical-electrical works and equipment, £190,000.  The Dublin Corporation, in consideration of its right to draw up to a maximum quantity of 20,000,000 gallons of water per day, will contribute a lump sum of £126,000 towards the cost of the works, thus reducing the expenditure to be met by the Electricity Supply Board to £634,000.  The withdrawal of water by the corporation will reduce the possible electrical output by about 10 per cent.  The works to be carried out by the Electricity Supply Board will provide employment for about 600 men for three years.  In addition to the expenditure to be incurred by the Electricity Supply Board, the capital expenditure to be met by the corporation <Col N="56" /> will amount to £820,000, including the contribution of £126,000 to the Electricity Supply Board.  The expenditure to be incurred by the Dublin Corporation on works which will be carried out by the corporation itself will, therefore, be £694,000; this will, it is estimated, provide wholetime employment for 1,200 men for three years.  It is anticipated that water from the Liffey scheme will be available to the corporation in the spring of 1940.</P>
    <P>The agreement entered into by the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board provides that the Electricity Supply Board shall carry out all construction works and acquire the lands necessary for the creation of a reservoir in the Liffey Valley immediately upstream of Poulaphouca.  The corporation, as I have said, will pay to the Electricity Supply Board a sum of £126,000 by way of contribution towards the cost and expenses incurred by the Board on these works and also by way of indemnification to the Supply Board for constructing this reservoir at a somewhat earlier date than would otherwise be required by the Board for the purpose of generating electricity.  The agreement also stipulates that: (1) The main dam and ancillary works are to be constructed to such an extent as will permit of the reservoir being filled to a level of 576 feet above Ordnance datum by the 1st January, 1940.  This development is referred to in the agreement as the partial development.  (2) The works are to be completed to give a top-water level of not less than 610 feet above Ordnance datum by the 31st March, 1950, and this development is referred to as the &ldquo;full development.&rdquo; The Board may, however, complete the full development at any time previous to the 31st March, 1950.  (3) The operation of the sluice gates in the dams regulating the flow of the river from the reservoir is under the control of the Board.  (4) The construction and operation of the intake from the reservoir to the pipe line supplying the City of Dublin is the responsibility of the corporation.  (5) While the reservoir is in the stage of partial development, the Electricity Supply Board cannot make use of any of the water <Col N="57" /> impounded for the purpose of generating electricity.  After the completion of the full development, electric power can be generated without restriction by means of the water stored in the reservoir until the level of the reservoir falls to 575 feet up to the 1st January, 1945; 578 feet from that to the 31st March, 1950; 580 feet from that to the 31st March, 1960; and 581 feet after the 31st March, 1960.  When the level of the reservoir falls to these limits, electrical power cannot be generated. Simultaneously with the drawing off of water by the Board for the purpose of generating electricity, the corporation have a right to draw off water at a rate not exceeding 20,000,000 gallons per day.  (6) During the construction of the reservoir the Board will carry out certain specified works, such as removal of houses, levelling of fences, cutting down of trees, and fencing of the reservoir within the limits of the reservoir required by the corporation for maintaining the purity of the water.  After the completion of the reservoir, the corporation will do such maintenance works as are solely required for ensuring the purity of the water.  The maintenance of the constructed work required to create the reservoir will, however, be the responsibility of the Board.</P>
    <P>There are various penalties set out in the clauses of the agreement which will come into operation in the event of either party drawing greater quantities of water from the reservoir than those stipulated in the agreement.</P>
    <P>I think that gives a fair picture of the main purposes of the Bill.  Its primary purpose can be briefly stated as confirming an agreement between the Dublin Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board, which is a Schedule to the Bill.  The agreement is obviously, I think, in the interests of both parties and it is one which should be approved of by the Dáil on that account and, therefore, I confidently recommend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his recovery from his recent serious illness.  I listened with great interest to the Minister in all he said in regard to this Bill and as he finally remarked, it is a Bill which <Col N="58" /> is going to confer great benefits on a large section of the people of this country.  Therefore all Parties in this House should join in passing this Bill. I must say that I regret very much that the Minister seems to have followed the lines of the three daily papers of Dublin.  He has drawn attention to all the great benefits which are going to be received by the vast majority of the people concerned. Enormous benefits are going to be conferred on the people of Dublin, not only on the people who live there at the present moment but on the people of Dublin in future generations.  But not one word has yet been said with regard to the unfortunate people who are going to lose their homes.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 26th October made one short reference.  That was the only daily paper that made any reference at all to these unfortunate people, and the reference they made was this:&mdash;&ldquo;The Board are empowered to have the work done by contract, and provision is made for adequate compensation to persons whose lands are affected temporarily or permanently under this scheme.&rdquo;  The <i>Irish Times</i> had a long leading article on the subject with every word of which I agree, but it made no allusion, as I said, to these unfortunate people who are going to lose their homes. Somewhere round about 50 to 60 people are affected and what are they?  They are a small minority who are going to confer great and vast benefits on Dublin and on the surrounding areas, and also with regard to the supply of electricity vast benefits are going to be conferred on the whole Saorstát. Not only are they conferring those benefits on people living to-day, but on generations yet to be born.  After all is said and done it is a very serious matter for any one to lose his home. It makes no difference whether it is a small home, a poor home, a large home or a rich home.  A home is a home and I do not think any one in this House would dispute that fact. The Minister mentioned the great benefit the water supply was going to confer on Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lately we have heard a great deal about Communists.  Surely the greatest <Col N="59" /> defence we have against Communists in this country is decent housing, good employment and good conditions of employment and the reduction of unemployment.  If we get these conditions, then I think we need not worry our heads about Communists, and this Bill goes very largely towards giving these things.  It is going to give a great deal of employment; it is going to help the housing schemes. We all know the urgent necessity there is for dealing with slums in the City of Dublin, but no serious inroad can be made on that problem until the present water supply is strengthened. Now, touching the question of employment, I should like to mention to the Minister that this particular scheme may cause the loss of employment to certain people in that district, namely, the areas affected by the Bill.  A man may be able to work under certain conditions.  He may be able to do certain work.  But the conditions of this scheme may prove that at a particular work he may not have the physical strength to do that work under this scheme.  That is one consideration. I would like every possible consideration to be given to any case that may accrue where a man may lose his present employment and may not have strength, even if he is competent, to hold his job under the present scheme.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had been a Private Bill the occupiers of the land which will be submerged would have been able to have legal advice and legal representation to make their cases.  Under this Bill they are debarred from anything of the kind.  On the other hand, a great deal of saving, I take it, will be made in the expense, and I think that ought to be borne in mind when the question of compensation arises. Compensation, of course, is one of the major matters which concern the people who are going to lose their homes.  The basis under which compensation will be given in this Bill is on the lines of the Act of 1919.  It seems to me that what really matters most is the original offer that is made to the occupier of the land.  The arbitrator is bound by certain rules and regulations laid down by the Act <Col N="60" /> of 1919 and one of these is that the value of the land should be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in an open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise.  There is a very important point involved in that.  At the present moment there is a dispute going on between this country and our neighbour across the water.  Is there any Minister or Deputy who will dare to get up and state that if that difficulty were settled that there would not be a rise in the value of land?  Of course there would be a rise in the value of land.  It is the most natural thing to happen.  Therefore, I put it before the Minister that if he should take the present value of land, it is not a fair value under these particular circumstances.  I would suggest that a fair value be arrived at by taking the average of the years 1928, 1929 and 1930, plus an increase of 50 per cent.  Somebody may think that that is a lot to ask for, but Deputies must remember on the other hand that certain people are giving up everything.</P>
    <P>They have no choice in the matter. I should like to quote the following:&mdash;&ldquo;I remember many years ago standing on the terrace of a beautiful villa near Florence.  It was a September evening and the valley below was transformed by the long horizontal rays of the setting sun.  Then I heard a bell&mdash;such a bell as never was on land or sea, a bell whose every vibration found an echo in my innermost heart.  I turned to my hostess and said: &lsquo;That is the most beautiful bell I ever heard.&rsquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;It is an English bell.&rsquo; And so it was. For generations its sound had gone out over English fields calling the hours of work and prayer to English folk from the top of an English Abbey. Then came the Reformation and a wise Italian bought the bell and sent it to the valley of the Arno.  Four centuries later it stirred the heart of a wandering Englishman and made him think of home.&rdquo;  These words are an extract from a speech made by the present Prime Minister of Great Britain.  The reason I have quoted them is that I have heard in this House and in the country speeches denouncing England as the great <Col N="61" /> enemy of this country.  I have heard speeches made from which you would think that there was no decency in any Englishman.  Yet, these words show that an Englishman is capable of feeling a great deal for his home. If an Englishman can feel so intensely for his home, what cannot an Irishman or an Irishwoman feel for their home? I should say that if you asked the average Irishman or Irishwoman what were the two big factors in their lives they would say their religion and their home.  I gather that at this particular place the parish will be divided because of this necessary work.  As I said, home to an Irishman means a great deal, particularly up there where families have been for many generations.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another point. There are certain people in that district who may have only a small bit of land.  Some people might regard it as merely a little bit of bog, but it is their home and not only their home but their main source of living.  It is not alone that they enjoy that little plot of land but they have the right of grazing on the mountains.  Unless they can get a similar home within reasonable distance of the mountains they will lose their main source of livelihood.  These are points which I should like the Minister to consider.  I should like him to give us a strong assurance that these people will receive really liberal treatment.  He can see to that, and when this great scheme is inaugurated let there be nobody to raise his voice in protest that he had been unfairly treated. The scheme is of national importance and it is our duty as a national assembly to see that these people receive proper treatment.  I was over there last Sunday at a meeting and it was really piteous to see the state of uncertainty in which these people were.  They did not know where they were.  After all is said and done, the Minister and the rest of us when we go to bed to-night will not have to worry as to whether or not we are going to lose our homes.  Every night these men when they go to bed wonder what is going to happen to them and what is going to be done for them, and whether they are going to get the <Col N="62" /> treatment they expect&mdash;fair treatment &mdash;from an Irish Government.  Personally I believe they will.  I believe the Minister will see that they will get decent and proper treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague who has just spoken, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his return to the House after his recent illness.  This is one of the most drastic and most necessary Bills ever introduced into this House.  It is drastic from the point of view of its effect on a large number of our constituents.  While the scheme will be a great boon to Dublin and to the unemployed, and while it may be a national necessity, we wish to point out to the Minister the serious consequences to our constituents.  As Deputy The O'Mahony has pointed out, Dublin is the favourite child.  Dublin has been in consultation with the E.S.B. but the local bodies are not to be considered although Dublin will not pay one penny for the upkeep of the road. The local body may have to bear big expense in connection with the maintenance of the road.  Under Section 8 (2) 50 families are to be deprived of their homes on a month's notice. Where they occupy dwellinghouses three months' notice is to be given. The Minister does not make any provision for alternative accommodation for these 50 families.  The matter will no doubt be solved, but no matter what compensation is given you will never compensate some of these people for the sentimental loss suffered by reason of the deprivation of their homes.  Does the Minister consider that one month is sufficient from the time the Bill becomes law to secure an alternative holding, or three months to secure an alternative dwelling? The Electricity Supply Board will after one month, have power to enter on the lands of these people and, after three months, will have power to take over possession of their dwellinghouses, while no provision is made for alternative accommodation.  The owner of the farm is promised compensation at four per cent. of whatever may be decided by the arbitrator.  Where is he to get the ready cash to purchase an alternative holding, if he desires to do so?  If 20 acres, say, are taken <Col N="63" /> from him, how will he purchase another farm of 20 acres?  Is it suggested that he will get a farm on the strength of a promise by the E.S.B. to pay him this compensation?  Very few farmers would sell their farms on the strength of such a promise.  After 12 months, perhaps, an award will be made by the arbitrator and, then, the farmer will have the necessary cash to make the purchase but, meantime, what can he do?  The question of rate charges will be a serious one if 5,000 acres are to be taken over in that area.  The other occupiers of land in that electoral area will have to pay an increased rate if 5,000 acres are taken over for the purpose of this scheme.  Those remaining occupiers will be liable for about £2,000, representing the amount which would have been paid in respect of these 5,000 acres.  Therefore, living on the land in that particular area is going to be more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy The O'Mahony referred to the question of the market value of the land.  I submit that there is a difference in the market value when land is taken compulsorily and when a man is willing to sell.  There is unquestionably a difference in the value where a man does not want to sell, and is quite content to remain where he is. Under the terms of this measure a man is given one month's notice, and the only compensation promised is four per cent. on the estimated value.  Section 13 will exempt the Electricity Supply Board from rates; that means that the Liffey works will be exempt from assessment for poor rate, and any other rate made by a local authority. Section 15 points out that if the Electricity Supply Board decide that a road must be maintained they are to consult with the Minister for Local Government; they are not asked to consult the local authority, the county council.  The road may be submerged in the first case and they may decide to have more elaborate and expensive roads than the county council might decide upon, but they are to consult with the Minister, and on his decision rests the responsibility of the local authority.  I think there should be <Col N="64" /> some consultation with a representative of the local body or the engineer.</P>
    <P>In some respects this measure is a bit drastic, particularly from the point of view of the people who may be deprived of their homes.  We have up to nine cottages belonging to the Board of Health in this area.  These will be submerged and this measure makes no provision for compensation for the the tenants.  The Board of Health, who are the landlords, may be entitled to compensation, but what of the unfortunate tenants?  Why should they not be entitled to some compensation?  They have improved their holdings, improved their cottages, and I submit that they should be compensated in some way.  There is no provision made for compensation for disturbance in the case of those families.  If we are able to provide them with alternative accommodation they will not be in such a bad position as the occupants of the 50 homes that will be wiped out of existence altogether. It might be well for the Minister to realise how drastic some of the provisions of the Bill are.  There is no provision for compensation for the tenants whatsoever, notwithstanding that some of them may be 20 or 25 years in the cottages.  Naturally, a number of them, where prize schemes have been developed, have improved their cottages and possibly made additions to them.  There is no provision for compensation to those men; any compensation to be given will be given to the local authority.</P>
    <P>There is another point upon which I would like to dwell.  There are large numbers of the farmers concerned who have practically bought out their holdings, and naturally they will be entitled to more compensation than the ordinary holder.  It was pointed out at a public meeting that a number of those will have their farms purchased out in a year or two.  While I regard the scheme as one of great national importance, I would urge on the Minister to see that the sacrifices on the part of the people concerned will be made as light as possible.  I am sure, now that those things have been pointed out to the Minister, he is not going to allow the Electricity Supply Board to <Col N="65" /> have the final say.  I hope he will see to it that the tenants of the cottages, the owners of other holdings and the owners of land, will be amply protected. If the Minister gives a promise in that connection it will go a long way towards allaying the discontent that is prevailing in the area.  I do not say it is wholesale, but at least 50 families and 150 holdings will be vitally affected. Of course, there are many unemployed men in that area, the sons of farmers who are quite willing to work, and they are very pleased and will be delighted to see the scheme started; but, on the other hand, we have to consider the other aspect.  We have to realise that even if the scheme is going to be of national importance it will bring disturbance to a number of people and we must see to it that they will be compensated as justly as possible.</P>
    <P>I think it is only necessary to point out these things to the Minister to ensure that on the Committee Stage suitable amendments will be introduced. The tenants have engaged lawyers, and they will draft suitable amendments.  The public boards, naturally, will have their lawyers&mdash;at the ratepayers' expense&mdash;to draft amendments to protect their interests. I ask the Minister not to rush this Bill, but to postpone it for a month at least, in order to enable the cottage tenants and the occupiers of land to prepare amendments and have them fully discussed here.  When those amendments have been considered I feel that many of the difficulties will be surmounted, and then the Bill can be passed as speedily as possible.  Do not give people an opportunity of saying that they have had no chance of submitting their views.  They are asking for a month so as to enable the lawyers to frame the amendments that will meet their wishes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill from the point of view of its national importance.  I earnestly trust that the poor people who will be dispossessed will get reasonable compensation.  There is no doubt that at least 50 or 60 parishioners will be disturbed.  There will, of course, be employment given to at least 1,000 men, and I may say that work is very badly needed in that portion <Col N="66" /> of the county.  I am sure the Deputies concerned will do everything they possibly can to have the Bill passed as soon as possible, with suitable amendments of the type I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt very fully with the whole position regarding additional electricity and water supplies. I do not think that the importance of this Bill can be over-estimated having regard to the position that has arisen in Dublin during the last few years.  For over three years the Corporation have been untiring in their efforts to supplement the existing water supply in the city.  Because of a protracted discussion between representatives of the Electricity Supply Board and the Minister's Department, the whole matter was held up but, now that agreement has been reached, I am glad to see that the Minister has lost no time in preparing this Bill.  There are many of the citizens who do not know how serious was the position for some years, particularly during the dry seasons which we have experienced, I may say now that the position was extremely serious at times.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go into the merits or demerits of the discussions that took place between the Electricity Supply Board and the Minister's Department. I will content myself with urging the Minister to lose no time in completing his side of the matter so that this work can be undertaken as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett and Deputy The O'Mahony have referred to the situation that will arise regarding the displacement of families on the site near Poulaphouca.  Everyone can appreciate the circumstances of those people in being removed from their homes, but serious as that is, it is far more serious to have a city that has been progressing as Dublin has for many years past, left without a sufficient water supply. That is what will result if this work is not gone on with with the greatest possible speed.  I want now to make some references to a couple of points to which my attention has been drawn. In Section 3, no provision is made for what I think is an essential&mdash;the taking of monthly levels.  The second refers to the scheduled agreement, and in sub-section (2) there are the words &ldquo;reducing <Col N="67" /> the height of such low water level below the height thereof stated.&rdquo;  It is very essential that provision should be made for the taking of monthly levels and particularly for the taking of these levels during summer weather.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the power of the Corporation to take possession of land before conveyance.  Suppose the Corporation desire to carry water mains or culverts over or under a railway, canal or river, there is no provision in the section whereby the Corporation would have any power at all to safeguard their interests.  With regard to Section 28, which deals with the protection of public roads and bridges as against the Corporation, most of the area is outside the Corporation area. Sub-section (a) sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>where the execution of the waterworks involves the closing of such road or bridge to traffic, the Corporation shall construct and shall maintain while such road or bridge is so closed to traffic a temporary road or bridge in the same or some other convenient situation sufficient to carry traffic of such quantity and character as normally uses such road or bridge;</P>
    <P>I suggest that the maintenance of a bridge or road under that provision should be subject to the Minister so directing, because it is quite possible that a situation could arise in which the Corporation might be compelled to maintain a bridge for the maintenance of which they would not otherwise be liable.  In conclusion, I ask the Minister to expedite the passing of the Bill. I expect that the Corporation has already submitted proposals to him for his consideration, and when they have heard his views on them, they will take the necessary steps to have them incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill upon general and not upon Dublin grounds.  I welcome it for the whole Bill and not merely for the particular detail in relation to Poulaphouca. The Shannon scheme was a great conception, and I personally have always been friendly to it when technical opinion was not, but it had fundamental defects which may be <Col N="68" /> roughly summed up in saying that it put all our eggs into one basket, and the road over which the eggs had to be carried when they were in that basket was too long and too difficult for security.  In addition to that, it had the technical difficulty and defect that while there is a large seasonal falling off in the current consumption and demand between your winter load and your summer load, the falling off in power due to the natural provision of water in our particular climate where it is provided by rain as distinct from other hydraulic power cases where it is supplied by melting snow from mountains and the like meant that there was a very much larger falling off in power between the winter and summer load.  For both those reasons, the putting of the whole supply of electricity in the Free State into one place, and into one place from which power could be derived from hydraulic power alone, was fundamentally insecure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, the Minister has said that the actual centres of consumption were entirely unbalanced in relation to the centre of supply.  The two outstandingly big consumers were the districts of Cork and Dublin&mdash;Dublin 130 miles away and Cork 70 miles away.  For that reason those of us who were interested in the national success of this scheme, which must be founded in the security of supply from that scheme under all conditions to all portions of the State, have always envisaged the necessity of building up, parallel to the hydraulic supply, in that case far away from the centres of consumption, auxiliary sources of supply in the places in which consumption would take place and derived from something other than hydraulic power; in other words, there had to be developed, if the scheme was to be sound and secure, in the Cork and Dublin districts, power supplies derived from steam or oil or some other non-hydraulic source.  To the extent to which the Bill does provide for the building up of those ancillary or parallel steam supplies in the areas in which they are required, it is technically sound and changes fundamentally the position of security of the State in electricity supply from this national system.  In addition, it is <Col N="69" /> sound in the sense that to the extent that it means the development of hydraulic as distinct from steam power in a different place, and, secondly, in the place in which it is most required.</P>
    <P>What you now have for the first time is a co-ordinated system of electricity supply both as between the methods of production and distribution and geographically. The whole position is sounder in every way.  The Shannon scheme in its first two or three years, and, I think, especially in its second year, ran into drought conditions of a character which certainly had not been envisaged, and, I think, very fortunately, because it showed the insecurity of that system of supply to deal even with the restricted small loads of the small development of electricity consumption of that time.</P>
    <P>For that reason it threw upon the Pigeon House a load which the Pigeon House was inadequate to take, and in throwing on the Pigeon House a load which it was inadequate to take but which, nevertheless, it would have to take, it raised the whole question of the co-ordination of the two systems. It is for that reason principally that I welcome the Bill.  I think all those who envisage the development of electricity consumption in the State, and who know that the essential quality of a sound system is security, will welcome this Bill because it does give that security upon which a large and widely developed system of electricity supply in the State can be soundly built.</P>

      <P>On Sunday week, I think, the <i>Independent</i> published from its political correspondent a statement that he hoped as a result of the coming general election, which he seemed to think was very near, that this body would be depleted of its old men.  He said that there were too many old men amongst its members, that these old men were in the habit when speaking, of becoming reminiscent, and that that was a sign of, at least, weakminded-ness or maybe of senile decay.  I happen to be an old man now myself but it seems to me only yesterday or a week ago at latest, that I felt quite young.  The Minister in introducing this Bill went very far back in the history of the city, and I could not <Col N="70" /> help thinking of the time, 35 years ago now, when the Dublin Corporation dared to bring in a measure for the purpose of promoting an extension of their then very limited electricity supply.  Instantly a great agitation sprang up, one paper especially making itself conspicuous by its criticisms of the Corporation and the attributes of its members just as to-day it is said that nothing good can come out of the Corporation.  We were told that that scheme was going to waste £250,000 of the citizens' money.  We were told that this was going to be a white elephant or an elephant of some other colour.  In fact, the whole Zoological Gardens were searched to see what it could be compared to. Every possible opposition was made to the Corporation's efforts.  New syndicates sprang up.  Brass plates appeared on hall-doors on the Monday morning that were not there on the previous Saturday evening.  The Tramway Company made a tremendous effort to get control of the scheme, but notwithstanding all the agitation and all the opposition, the Corporation were empowered to go ahead with their scheme and a loan of £250,000 was granted by the Board of Works 35 years ago.  All the prophecies were falsified as prophecies generally are. When the Shannon scheme was brought in here that asset of the city was worth at least £2,000,000.  The Corporation had made a brilliant success of the scheme.  We know that under the Shannon Bill that scheme was taken over by the then Government and not a postage stamp was given in compensation for it.  It was a good egg in that basket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Parliamentary Secretary overlooked that pigeon's egg when he was speaking of the basket of eggs.  That being so, the Corporation have now agreed with the Electricity Supply Board on the terms as stated by the Minister.  Not only have they agreed but they are to give another gift, this time of £126,000, towards the expenses of the Electricity Supply Board in the construction of the new dam.  I heard Deputy O'Mahony and Deputy Everett speak of the great hardships that will be <Col N="71" /> inflicted on people living in the district where this enterprise is about to be started.  Hardships will probably be inflicted upon them but I don't think there will be anything approaching the confiscation that seems to be implied in the remarks made this evening. All those people will be amply compensated for whatever losses they may have to suffer.  I cannot say that I can make the comparison complete, because I had not intended to speak here this evening, but I wonder if the same objections were not made 70 years ago when the Corporation embarked on the Vartry scheme?  Did the people then not object to their houses and their farms being submerged.  Of course they did.  Is Roundwood any better or worse for the Vartry scheme to-day?  Is it not very much better? Will not any amount of employment be given when this enterprise is in working order and will the whole surrounding district not benefit?  Certainly, a great scheme was envisaged for that area a short time ago.  Offices were taken in the Commercial Buildings and people were invited to see the great plan that had been drawn up for a new city all round that district. Surely Deputy Everett, Deputy O'Mahony and whatever other Deputy was present at the meeting last Sunday should have known about these things, that a new city, a garden city no less, is in contemplation in that area in some years to come.  Why, therefore, bemoan this enterprise which has been introduced by the Minister?  There is no substantial reason for opposing it. The Vartry scheme was opposed very bitterly and led to a good deal of recrimination.  I know that Sir John Gray got into serious trouble and that, in fact, an action was taken for libel and defamation of character by the then Town Clerk of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You have quite a number of remedies and your problem is to find the right one.  I do not think that the doleful tales which the Deputies from Wicklow have put before the House to-day are necessary.  I think they ought to make up their minds that the <Col N="72" /> people there will suffer very little and maybe not at all as the result of this scheme.  They will get ample compensation, sufficient to recompense them for even any sentimental values attached to their old homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this, I should like the Minister to try to get all the legal preliminaries that are necessary discharged, if I may use the word, as soon as possible, because one of the reasons, and the principal reason probably, that weighed with the members of the Corporation in discussing this project, for a considerable time now, with the Electricity Supply Board was the great labour content that would be involved in the expenditure, and that is a matter of very deep concern, I think, for the whole of this House.  In fact, when I think of Deputy Everett making some objection to the scheme, I wonder did he weight that factor well up.  There are, of course, a great deal of legal formalities to be gone through, such as the purchase of all the lands, the wiping out of various titles, and all that class of thing; but I think that the Minister&mdash;and I am glad to see him back; I know he is the most energetic man, probably, in the whole Executive Council, but I would suggest to him not to work too hard this time and to remember that the burden will rest for some time to come on other shoulders as well as his&mdash;I think the Minister should take counsel with his legal advisers with a view to getting rid of the legal preliminaries as soon as possible, because it must be remembered that the Corporation's portion of the work has to begin first and the citizens will have to foot a bill of between £800,000 and £1,000,000 for the work of bringing the water into the City from the proposed new reservoir, and naturally their work would begin long before that of the Electricity Supply Board. I would ask the Minister, therefore, to bear that fact in mind, particularly having regard to the large numbers of unemployed that exist in the City of Dublin by reason of the fact that the population has increased tremendously. By reason of that increase in population a very heavy extra burden has been placed upon the shoulders of the Corporation and the responsibilities <Col N="73" /> of the Corporation, consequently, are getting more onerous.</P>

      <P>We are not.  It is the other way about.  Of course, I do not want to erect gates outside Dublin to keep the country people out, but I do say that we have to take that fact into consideration.  After all, where are the people of rural Ireland to look to if not to their capital city?  The responsibilities of the Corporation, however, are very heavy in regard to that matter.  No doubt, the City Manager is the supreme authority, so to speak, but he can sit in his office or he can sit in his home and escape all the importunities that members of the Corporation have to suffer in connection with finding work, or trying to find work, for the large numbers of unemployed in Dublin.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will bear my statement in mind.  I regard the Bill with some satisfaction, although I must say that I had no enthusiasm for it.  I would have preferred that they would have gone on with the project of laying down a new pipe-line from the existing reservoir which, I think, would have been amply sufficient for a long time to come.  However, the Bill is there and I am sure it will receive the unanimous approval of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to praise this Bill because there is no doubt that the electricity needs and the needs for an increased supply of water having been co-ordinated and brought together in one scheme, I think we are all very pleased to see that a comprehensive scheme such as this should be brought forward.  There are some details, however, that one would have liked the Minister to give us in connection with the water supply.  I think that some time ago the Minister for Local Government and Public Health stated that the supply of the Roundwood reservoir in a normal period was somewhere around 2,000,000,000 gallons and that the daily consumption was somewhere around 20,000,000 gallons.  The Minister can correct me if those figures are not accurate.  I think the Minister <Col N="74" /> stated that in the new reservoir that is contemplated at Poulaphouca there would be 148,000,000 cubic metres of water.  Well, I suppose that, reduced to gallons&mdash;if my figures were correct for Roundwood&mdash;would make it a much bigger storage capacity than Roundwood.  Perhaps, when the Minister is replying, he would give us the exact figures in connection with that.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of this question, however, that no previous speaker has touched upon, with the exception of Deputy Kelly, and that is the matter of the pipe-lines.  We all want water, of course, but we want it here in Dublin, and I think the Minister stated that the Corporation's proportion of the reservoir was going to be £125,000, and I think he stated that somewhere about £675,000 was needed for, I take it, pipe-lines and other incidental works.  Now, we all know that for some years past there have been talks about water shortages.  We have had complaints in connection with recent fires that the water supply was not adequate, and I think we are all aware that in certain cases, especially in the borough in which I live, the pressure is not the same at night as it is in the daytime, and that you can get water in the bottom of a house but you cannot get it at the top of the house. That seems to point to the fact that the pressure is not maintained.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us if it is proposed to remodel the mains and give an adequate supply of water to the city at a proper pressure.  Some people have told us&mdash; I think Deputy Kelly was hinting at it &mdash;that if we had an additional pipe-line laid down from Roundwood the supply would be adequate except in very exceptional periods.  Now, of course, it is all the better to avail ourselves of an additional source of impounding water when one is now available, but one would like to be sure that at the earliest possible date the mains are going to be taken in hand and that an adequate pressure is going to be maintained through the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For industrial purposes a considerable pressure is required, and I take it that the Minister is perfectly well aware that there are industrial concerns whose insurance premiums are <Col N="75" /> regulated by the pressure of water that is available in the mains flowing past their premises.  In a great many cases that pressure is lamentably low and the occupiers have to pay increased premiums.  I suppose nobody would think of accusing the Minister for Industry and Commerce of being in favour of having to pay increased premiums to foreign insurance companies because there was not an adequate supply of Irish water running through the streets at the proper pressure.</P>
    <P>I merely mention that, as I would not think of accusing the Minister of being in favour of it.  I take it that, if the question of the mains is tackled at the same time as the reservoir, the scheme will be put on a perfectly sound basis.  We do not want to hear afterwards that while there is a splendid reservoir at Poulaphouca and, in its own way, a really good one at Roundwood, as all the money had been spent on the reservoirs no funds were available for getting the pipe lines into a proper state so as to provide adequate pressure for industrial purposes. I hope the Minister will deal with these points when replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather surprising to hear Deputy Kelly coming out so strongly on the side of big business; big corporations, big local authorities, and big financial authorities, these are now his friends.  He has the utmost confidence also in the official machine. Who could doubt, he says, the humanity of the official machine? Surely these people will be amply compensated? I would like to share the belief of him and others who say that ample compensation will be provided for the poor people who are to lose their homes, but Deputy Kelly cannot expect everyone to have the same confidence in the official machine that he has.  What he really meant was that the poor beggars would have to go; they would have to lose their economic independence and all the rest, but what about it?  Was it not in the interests of progress?  Are we not going to have a great electrical power works and a splendid reservoir, and would not these fully compensate for the destruction of 50 independent families? <Col N="76" /> Perhaps they will.  But while Deputy Kelly is fully entitled to favour the scheme he could well have been more sympathetic towards the people who have to be sacrificed.  No one is against this scheme.  Possibly very few of those most directly affected are against it, but many people are opposed to the terms provided for the unfortunate victims of progress.  It is not enough to tell a man &ldquo;You have got to go, but we are going to give you the market value of your land.  We are not going to compensate you for the loss of your independence&mdash;we cannot afford to take that into account, but we will compensate you for the land we are taking at a rate based on what a willing purchaser would pay if you put the holding up for auction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis is on the words &ldquo;willing purchaser.&rdquo;  There is nothing at all about willing seller or an unwilling seller.  Is Deputy Kelly aware that an official arbitrator not many months ago awarded people in this area from whom land was being taken for labourers' cottages the immense sum of £5 an acre?  Would the Deputy be satisfied to see a family that managed to endure on 20 acres of that land, having a better and certainly a more independent life than that led by proletarians, getting £100 for their property and being told that they would have to live on that amount for the rest of their lives?  I wonder if there is any necessity for such very callous proposals?  There may be the precedent of the Shannon Power Act, but as that Act was passed a long time ago we should have grown in wisdom and experience in the meantime. Since then we have had a Transport Act passed, under which compensation was given to certain people.  I think the Minister will agree that many of the unfortunate people who got compensation found themselves in the position of not knowing what to do with the compensation. They had to look out for another business or take the risk of starting a new business.  The position here is much more serious, because the other people at least had a certain general capability while the people who are to be the victims under this Bill, although they may be very capable <Col N="77" /> farmers, would not, generally speaking, be considered to be in that category if removed from the agricultural occupations in which they found a livelihood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Kelly was in this position, that he was the owner of a little farm of, say, 20 acres, out of which he managed to live, he would not consider that £100 would save him from being a victim under such a scheme.  I want to know if there is any necessity for such poor affected by the Bill.  Has the Land Commission been consulted about the scheme?  It affects County Kildare and West Wicklow, where there are immense tracts of very good grazing land that are at present hardly occupied.  Was the Land Commission asked if they have any land available to enable them to meet the position of people who are to be taken from their holdings because of this scheme?  Will the Land Commission help in the difficulty that has been occasioned?  Of the 50 families affected I am sure that some of them will take the cash.  The circumstances of every family differ but if the Minister is in a position to say to them &ldquo;we have got to take your land but we are prepared to offer instead of money compensation, which might not be of the utmost use to you, a certain amount of land as soon as possible, and perhaps to build a house for you,&rdquo; surely that would be the more humane way, and I think it would be quite consistent with the Land Commission policy when clearing congested areas.  I suggest that the Minister should consult with the Minister for Lands before he puts this scheme through and that he should ascertain if land is available to help in the circumstances of this measure. There is undoubtedly a certain amount of fear amongst the people who have not got that confidence in official arbitrators that Deputy Kelly has.  I confess I have not got that confidence.</P>

I often wonder how Deputies on the Labour Benches have such tremendous confidence in officials as being always likely to take the side of the poor man.  In my opinion that could not be characteristic of State officials.  I have nothing to say against officials any more than any other Deputy, but from the nature of their work I do not think it is possible for such feelings to become predominant. The scheme of compensation proposed for the people affected by these proposals could be improved upon, and I hope that before the Committee Stage the Minister will give that aspect of it further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a pity, when a Bill such as this is introduced, that the Minister did not take steps to deal with the question of compensation. From the point of view of the sum involved, it is very small.  We may expect to hear the Minister saying that it is much the same sort of compensation as was provided under the Shannon Power Act.  That is not true.  There is a difference between the years 1925 and 1936.  The Shannon scheme lands at that time had a value, which, if those appearing on behalf of the Electricity Supply Board and the Corporation wished, could be proved to be almost negligible.  In any case, as from the 18th June up to this moment, there was a considerable period of time available for the settling of some of those cases.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Moore, I may say that ample compensation was paid for the lands which were taken in connection with the Shannon scheme. Agreements could not be reached in three or four cases, but, generally speaking, a fairly good percentage over and above the market value of the land was paid.  I am sure that in this case, if a similar undertaking could be obtained, there would be no objection from the Deputies representing the County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find in one section of this Bill that, while the Corporation is entitled to do replacement work, there is no suggestion that the Electricity Supply Board should do it in the case of persons <Col N="79" /> whose habitations will be taken. If, say, 30 or 40 families are affected, it is possible that 30 or 40 houses will have to be dealt with.  I think that for those who remain in the neighbourhood provision for replacement ought to be made.</P>
    <P>It was rather amusing to listen to the Minister's description this evening of the development of electricity in this State, having regard to the many pronouncements, expert, political and otherwise, that we have heard in connection with the Shannon hydro-electric works, and the generation of electricity during the last eight, nine or eleven years.  One politician, who is now very prominent, could say in Cavan or Donegal that the Shannon scheme was of little use to the people there.  He could say in Kildare that he was dead against the Shannon scheme, and that in his opinion the Liffey ought to have been harnessed. Others could say in Donegal of what benefit was the £5,000,000 that had been spent on the Shannon scheme to the farmers in that part of the country and so on.  Apparently, there has been some development in the education of the Party of which that particular gentleman is the leader.  I say that in view of the statement we have heard here this evening.</P>
    <P>It was rather refreshing to hear one Deputy say this evening that the Electricity Supply Board had got a nest-egg from the Dublin Corporation &mdash;that it had got a property valued at about £2,000,000.  There may have been £2,000,000 put into the Electricity Department of the Dublin Corporation from its inception down to the present day.  I presume that, when a Deputy mentions a sum of that sort, he is including in it all the old, wornout machinery that was scrapped years and years ago.  In essence, what is the value of an electricity undertaking to any municipality, no matter what it may have cost and no matter what the value of it may be?  Its ultimate utility to the local authority, to the citizens, to the ratepayers and to the consumers of electricity in the area is the price that they pay for their electricity, and the citizens of Dublin have never paid less for it than they are <Col N="80" /> paying at present.  They have never paid less for it than they have paid since the Shannon hydro-electric works were undertaken.  So far as the citizens of Dublin are concerned, they have benefited by the confiscation, if I concede the use of that term for the sake of argument.</P>
    <P>The city has also benefited to this extent, that its municipal debt has been reduced in respect of the sum borrowed for that undertaking.  It was the merest nonsense to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance say that he conceded the point made on that to the Deputy who made it.  The Parliamentary Secretary must not have known the price per unit that was paid for electricity before the Shannon works were started, or, if he ever heard it, he must have forgotten it.  Just about the time that the Electricity Supply Board took over the municipal works in Dublin the commissioners in office reduced the price of electricity from what it had been to a much lower figure.  That is a matter of satisfaction to me.  I was a citizen of Dublin for many years, and I paid the higher price for electricity.  The citizens are now getting it at a very much lower price than they ever got it before, and if they have lost the electricity works perhaps they have lost a liability.</P>
    <P>The Minister might perhaps in his spare time find it opportune to commend the experts' report in connection with the hydro-electric works at the Shannon.  I think it will be within the recollection of many members of the House that the views of the experts and the views of the German electrical engineers were subjected here to a great deal of criticism.  I think that the experts' anticipations of the consumption of electricity in this country have proved to be as nearly correct as it was possible for them to be.  That certainly is very much to their credit. The agreement made between two public bodies is the subject really of this Bill.  I have one fault to find with it.  It is this: If and when certain things happen the Corporation is liable to pay so many pounds per day; if and when something else happens, the Electricity Supply Board is liable <Col N="81" /> to pay so many pounds per day.  If there is one fault to be found with public bodies in this country it is the disposition on their part to find fault one with another.  There is an element of suspicion running through this agreement which it would be very well indeed if it were not there&mdash;if it were completely out of it.  Presumably, the Electricity Supply Board will do all in their power to meet the Corporation, and the Corporation on their part will be equally anxious to meet the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>If that be the case, what is the necessity for the inclusion of the penalties laid down?  Perhaps it is another example of a disposition on the part of public bodies not to agree. The Corporation wanted a new reservoir; the Electricity Supply Board was not ready for it yet, and so they were scoring, one off the other.  That is not creditable to public bodies.  But in June last the matter was settled between the two.  This reservoir is necessary for the City of Dublin. Anyone who has studied the pronouncements of the borough surveyor for the City of Dublin, especially those made during periods when there was a shortage in the water supply, will, I think, be satisfied on that point. Personally, I do not think that a second line from the Roundwood reservoir would meet the case, because on certain occasions the level of water there has gone down to danger point.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister if the water from the Liffey at the particular place he referred to has been certified as being absolutely pure.  I know that since the big storm occurred some years ago, the Rathmines water supply has not been as pure as it used to be.  There is a slight taint in it.  The Dodder was not allowed into the reservoir at one time, and there were certain works undertaken to prevent its getting in.  By reason of this storm some of the masonry work was smashed up, causing the water of the Dodder to get into the reservoir. Since then there has been this taint. The water comes through a bog district, and I expect it has been examined to ensure that it is good wholesome water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Personally I find very great satisfaction in the introduction of this measure, and in the figures which have been given regarding the expansion of the use of electricity in this country, not because it has confounded the prophets, not because it has confounded some experts who criticised the work, but because of the wider use of a modern facility which is of benefit to the people, and is used not alone as an illuminant, but as a means of providing power.  It shows the foresight and evidences the genius of those who are responsible for the recommendation, for the inauguration, and for the finishing of the Shannon scheme.</P>
    <P>One resident in this district has drawn my attention to the fact that while a ten year period is given for the making of a claim in respect of fishing rights, only one year is given for claiming compensation for land in the event of seepage setting in, and I should like the Minister to look into that point.  If the Minister, as he undertook to the Deputies for the County Wicklow, would expedite the hearing of claims in respect of compensation for those whose lands are going to be taken, it would relieve the minds of a very large number of families.  I think the provision in the Bill in regard to interest at 4 per cent. is of very little use when one does not know what the 4 per cent. is going to be paid on; it is paid afterwards.  I think provision might be made in the Bill for persons who lose their employment in the area.  If, as Deputy Everett says, there are nine labourers' cottages there, it is quite possible that those men have found employment on some of those 5,000 acres of land which are now going to be submerged.  If that be so, they certainly have a right to some compensation or to alternative employment.  There are some other cases in which compensation of that sort might arise, and I think it would harmonise with the general support for the scheme if some consideration were given to the basis of the compensation in the first place, to expediting the hearing of the claims in the second place, and, if and when it be decided to give replacement houses to those merged, if the work of building those <Col N="83" /> houses could be undertaken so that no cause for complaint could arise when they get short notice to leave the premises.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us what is the present consumption of water in the City of Dublin? Does it amount to anything like this 20,000,000 gallons daily?  At one time I think the consumption was about 40 gallons per head, and I think it went up from that.  Does the inauguration of this scheme mean that there will be a sufficient water supply to cope with a considerable expansion in the city?</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the other Deputies who have expressed their gladness at seeing the Minister back in his place.  I am sure all the members of the House are glad to see him back.  I was glad to hear the Minister making his statement to-day, because it is the first detailed statement we have had in regard to the working of the Electricity Supply Board, and I must say that the figures which he gave us will go far to allay the fears which some of us had when that scheme was brought in.  The opposition which has been raised to this scheme is of the kind which is raised against every scheme for improvement in connection with the city or its surrounding suburbs.  We have been told about the families who will be deprived of their homes.  I am sure we are all sorry for that fact, but we cannot accomplish improvement without doing some injury to someone. Those of us who have been in this House for some time have heard that agricultural holdings are not of a very valuable character at the present time, nor have they been of a very valuable character for some time past.  I am sure that many of those whose holdings will be taken under this scheme will have some satisfaction in that they will be compensated&mdash;I hope liberally&mdash;for the loss of those holdings, which have not been too fruitful a source of income for some time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind the great outstanding feature of this scheme, apart from the improvement it will be to the city, is that it is put forward by two bodies, <Col N="84" /> each important in itself.  The Dublin Corporation we all recognise as a very important body; the E.S.B., in view of the work it has to do and the powers it has been given, is also an important body.  Those two bodies have amalgamated in putting forward this scheme.  Now that is to my mind a very strong feature in connection with this scheme&mdash;that two bodies of such importance should amalgamate in putting it forward.</P>
    <P>There were some points in connection with the Electricity Supply Board and its working that the Minister did not go into.  The Minister will remember that when the Bill was going through the House some of us had some misgivings about the loss that would be involved in transmission between Limerick and Dublin&mdash;a distance of 130 miles.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has figures before him, but I should like to know the amount of electricity which is sent to Dublin from Ardnacrusha, and the amount that is being lost in the transmission of that power to Dublin.  That was a defect that was inherent in the original scheme.  This scheme, to my mind, gives an opportunity for remedying that defect, because Dublin can be provided for from the Pigeon House&mdash; I was glad to hear that that scheme is being developed&mdash;and from Poulaphouca. The loss in transmission that we have complained of could be got over in that way, but I should like if the Minister would give us some information on that point.  Speaking from the industrial point of view, we are in competition with other countries, and electricity has come very largely to be used industrially in other countries. We have to compete against these countries.  It is necessary, therefore, that we should get current at a somewhat similar rate.  If the current that comes to Dublin has to bear losses, there will be a disposition certainly to make Dublin pay for those losses.</P>
    <P>Now, Dublin under this proposal has <i>a</i> chance of getting cheaper current for its industries, and that will enable those industries to extend and develop. That is a matter of some importance to the Dublin commercial community. I suggest that the output of Ardnacrusha might be used for places which <Col N="85" /> are much nearer, like Cork and other industrial centres in the South of Ireland. Let its output be used in those areas, and let those nearer schemes confine their operation to the supply of the Dublin market.  That is a matter that might usefully engage the attention of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points in the proposals we have before us about which I should like some further information. Section 13 mentions that the E.S.B. is not to be responsible for the loss of rates.  I do not know whether that section in its present form goes further than the section in the Act passed some years ago under which the E.S.B. functions.  I am rather inclined to think it does&mdash;that this takes the poor rate off the back of the E.S.B. Possibly the Minister will be able to advise us on that point.  Generally, the Bill has my hearty approval, and I hope it will be put into operation without any undue delay.</P>

      <P>I had not any intention of intervening in this debate but I am rather interested in the point raised by Deputy Good and will be very interested to hear the Minister's reply in connection with it.  Deputy Good seems to visualise that, with the development of the scheme and the consequent improvement in the transmission of current to the metropolitan area that will take place, a lessening of charges for electricity for the Dublin region ought to ensue.  If that is to be so, I suppose one from the country will be entitled to visualise an increase in the electricity costs in other parts of the country.  While we in Limerick have not been fortunate enough to secure any reduction in electricity costs because of the fact that we have no transmission losses from the power-house at Ardnacrusha to the city, one and a half or two miles away, Dublin has been favoured with lesser charges than we have been paying hitherto.  Ardnacrusha will, I hope or expect, still continue to supply current to places as remote as Donegal.  I shall be anxious to hear the Minister's reply to the very pertinent and relevant question put by Deputy Good as to whether there is going to be a further differentiation in favour of the metropolitan electricity consumer, with <Col N="86" /> a consequent increase in the cost to national consumers of the Ardnacrusha current, whether it be in Limerick, Cork or Donegal.  That will be a matter of very great interest to Deputies from other parts of the country and I think their attitude towards this Bill will, to a large extent, be influenced by the Minister's reply to the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem rather strange that a Deputy representing a constituency so remote from Dublin could contribute to this debate, but it is well that the House should know the feeling that exists in respect to these undertakings.  We in the country realise that centres of big population such as Dublin must have a proper water supply, and that it is well to have a proper scheme for light and power.  It is impossible, as we have heard from the Minister, to keep the matter of this Bill separate from the electricity supply scheme.  Perhaps, in our minds we connect the two.  As one who was very favourable towards the Shannon Scheme and advocated it in other places, I must say that we in the remote parts of the country are rather disappointed with it.  We were promised that most of the country by now would have the advantage of electric light and power at a reasonable cost.  In my part of the country, people are asking why the E.S.B. are not supplying current to towns such as Monaghan and what is the cause of the delay.  For the few places where it was proposed to give a supply it was at a prohibitive price.  While we, as ordinary citizens of the country, rejoice in the success of undertakings even in the capital and other cities, and, as somebody put it to-day, rejoice in the success of big business, still we must have our viewpoint.  We see that while this is going on, we are still confined either to putting in our own electricity undertakings or still using whatever other light we can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A friend of mine, who lives less than two miles from where the Shannon current runs, asked the E.S.B. for an estimate for putting it into his house. The reply he got had all the appearance of not wanting to do business. Even at that short distance from the <Col N="87" /> transmission lines, they asked him, first of all, for a sum of over £250 as an initial charge with a guarantee of £28 a year for 20 years, as well as paying for the current after that.  People are asking their representatives why should this be so; is there not some slackness about the matter; or, why are we in the country not getting the same benefits from this huge scheme?  Like other Deputies, I would favour and give whatever support I could to any scheme for the betterment of the city or the betterment of the country generally, but I should like the Minister to cause an inquiry to be made to see why we are not making better progress with the existing scheme, and why electricity is offered to us at such a prohibitive price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am induced to intervene in this debate because of what Deputy Haslett, who has just sat down, has said.  He mentioned the prohibitive sums which some people not living in towns and cities have been asked by the Electricity Supply Board to pay in order to have electricity installed in their homes.  I know of one particular case where the electric standards are within fifty yards of a man's house. That man was asked to pay £120 in order to have electricity brought to his house.  We hear a lot from time to time as to the benefits electricity has conferred on farmers and the agricultural community in other countries.  I am sorry to say that I see no sign of any such development in connection with electricity in rural Ireland.  I find that I can very well do without electricity.  At the same time I want to point out that it is very unjust that men in rural areas who are prepared to take advantage of this scheme should be asked to put down prohibitive sums of money before their houses are linked up with the scheme.  I want to emphasise in particular the case where a man whom I know was asked to pay £120 for having the electricity installed even though the standards are within fifty yards of his house.  If I have not made application myself it is because I knew that I would be asked to plank down a prohibitive sum of <Col N="88" /> money.  Now that is most unfair, because we country people have, as taxpayers, contributed to this scheme. I think more regard should be paid to the needs of people living in outside districts, people such as those represented by Deputy Haslett and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Deputies who made such kindly references to my return to duty. It is, I think, a matter for congratulation that in the discussion upon a Bill of this nature, the points made by Deputies related almost entirely to matters of detail associated with the projects which the Bill is designed to facilitate and it is also a matter for congratulation that nobody has questioned the wisdom of providing even the very large sum of £2,500,000 to the Electricity Supply Board for the purposes contemplated by this Bill and to enable the development of this scheme to be proceeded with.  These facts are, I think, evidence that the progress of the Board, like the progress of the country which has helped the Board, has been very satisfactory indeed.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies who addressed themselves to the question of compensating those whose lands and houses are likely to be submerged by the proposed reservoir at Poulaphouca that the members of the Government are just as deeply concerned as they are with the payment of compensation to these people.  We are anxious to ensure that no undue hardship will be occasioned to these people because of the inauguration of this scheme.  It is however inevitable that some such scheme as this should be adopted in order to provide additional electric power and additional water supply for Dublin and the surrounding areas. Whether that scheme be at Poulaphouca or somewhere else, the acquisition of land will be involved, and so will the dispossession of the present owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy T. Kelly rightly remarked, when the Roundwood reservoir was being constructed 70 years ago, precisely the same thing was said about the landholders in the district, though at the present time it can with truth be said that the building of that <Col N="89" /> reservoir was of immense benefit to that locality and it can with equal truth be said that the construction of this reservoir at Poulaphouca will also be of great benefit to all that area.  It is a fact that a certain number of families are to be taken out of their homes and their land is going to be acquired for the purpose of this work.  It is necessary, therefore, that we should make some provision for these families.  In this Bill we are proposing to ensure that they will be awarded compensation upon the same basis that compensation is awarded in other cases where land is compulsorily acquired for any public purpose.  I do not think it has ever been seriously contended that that basis is unfair.  In the majority of cases no doubt the amount of compensation to be paid will be determined by agreement.  It is only in a minority of cases that the arbitration clause of this Act of 1919 will come into operation and an award given in accordance with it.  It has been our experience in connection with the Shannon scheme that in more than 90 per cent. of the cases the amount of compensation was determined by agreement.  In only 10 per cent., or less than 10 per cent. were the services of the arbitrator called upon.  Possibly the same situation will arise in connection with these works.  I think it will.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that any steps that are possible will be taken to ensure that no undue delay will occur in the awarding of compensation.  Anything which other departments of the Government, such as the Land Commission, can do to facilitate these people will be done.  I do not think that it is fair to say that we are taking the houses and lands from these people and putting them into the ranks of the proletariat.  These people are going to get compensation on the basis of the value of their land, and if they wish to continue as agriculturists they will have no difficulty in acquiring other holdings of land elsewhere.  I do not think it is necessary, as one Deputy suggested, to take into account the variations that have arisen in recent years in the value of land.  The basis of compensation will be the present value of the holding.  It is on that basis that compensation will be fixed.  In <Col N="90" /> any event I should like to say that the detailed provisions of the Bill in relation to compensation can be more fully discussed in Committee.  These provisions are similar to those embodied in the original Shannon Acts, and it has been generally agreed that the actual awards made in the majority of cases under the Shannon scheme were not unfair.  Furthermore, the same system has been operated wherever lands are acquired for public purposes.  It has never been suggested that undue hardship in this connection had arisen where lands were acquired by the Government for any other purposes. The Act will provide for compensation not merely for the value of the property acquired but also for the disturbance involved in the removal.</P>
    <P>Certain questions were raised and certain remarks were made concerning the question of a water supply in Dublin.  In case anything which I or other Deputies said on this matter may cause misunderstanding, I should like to say that my information is that there is no immediate difficulty in the matter of the supply of water to Dublin.  The full requirements of Dublin's water supply will give no immediate difficulty.  Certain works were recently completed by the Corporation and these works will, in the opinion of their engineers and experts, enable the Corporation to ensure an adequate supply to meet the needs of Dublin and district until 1940.  It is contemplated that by 1940 water from Poulaphouca will be available.  The present requirements of Dublin are roughly about 32 gallons per head or 18,000,000 per day.  The agreement between the Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board provides for the Corporation taking from Poulaphouca reservoir up to 20,000,000 per day.  As the Corporation will have, in addition to that supply, the present Vartry water supply, it will be seen that the arrangement ensures more than an adequate supply for Dublin and district for many years ahead&mdash;at any rate, until, if ever, the population of Dublin is doubled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave stated that the inauguration of this Liffey hydro-electric scheme follows from the adoption of the Shannon scheme of 1925. <Col N="91" /> That is, undoubtedly, correct.  It is not quite fair for Deputy Cosgrave to try to draw me now on the question of the Shannon scheme, remembering the various controversies we had on that matter many years ago, because I am not quite free to say many things which, I think, could be said, not against the Shannon scheme but against the action of the Government responsible for its administration over a number of years.  Deputy Kelly referred to the taking over of the Dublin Corporation's electric station and its transfer to the Electricity Supply Board without compensation to the Corporation.  Many good arguments could, perhaps, be advanced in favour of that course but the argument advanced by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash; that the people are getting electricity more cheaply than they were in 1925&mdash; is not one I would advance.  Anybody could pick holes in that argument. There would, however, be no use in going back over these matters now. The position is that the increase in electricity consumption in this country has been very, very rapid, particularly in recent years, with the increase in industrial activities.  We have reached a stage where we must plan ahead upon the basis of a substantial increase in the demand for electricity each year&mdash;an increase which may necessitate the installation in some form or another in each year of generation capacity equivalent to one of these steam units at the Pigeon House or one of the hydro-electric units at Ardnacrusha.  It is on that basis that the plans of the Electricity Supply Board for the next few years must proceed.  Of the two steam units, one is to come into operation at once and one in 1938.  They will have a capacity of 20,000 kwts. each.  The Liffey power station of 30,000 kwts. capacity will be brought into operation after that&mdash; somewhere about the year 1941, assuming that the growth of the demand for current continues in the future as in the past.  Very soon after that, further generating capacity will, it is anticipated, be required.</P>
    <P>There has been not alone a very substantial increase in the demand for electric power for industrial purposes, <Col N="92" /> but there has been, as I indicated already, a very considerable increase in the number of electricity consumers and in the actual consumption of electricity per head.  Judging by the information at our disposal as to the extent to which electricity is being utilised in other countries, there is an almost unlimited field for expansion here.  Deputy Good raised a question as to the loss on the transmission of the current from Ardnacrusha to Dublin.  I cannot give the Deputy any figure for the loss in transmission from Ardnacrusha to Dublin alone but, in the appendix to the report of the Electricity Supply Board for 1935-36, he will find that the loss on the whole high tension system of the Board was 12.6 per cent. of the current generated. There is also in that table other information which the Deputy may find interesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a heavy loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the importance of our getting electricity as cheaply as other countries can get it.  I do not think that we can possibly hope to generate and distribute electricity as cheaply as it is done in some countries.  As Deputies are aware, I was in Canada in 1932, and I had an opportunity of investigating the circumstances attending the production and distribution of electricity there.  Owing to the natural advantages which the Canadians have, they are in a position to generate and distribute electricity at a price we could never hope to reach.  The same applies to Norway, Sweden and some other countries.  With us, the normal practice is to have regard to the lowest price at which electricity can be generated at a steam station, particularly a steam station so favourably situated as the Pigeon House is, in considering the advisability of any alternative methods of development. This Liffey hydro-electric scheme will be quite economic in comparison with the cost of producing electricity at the Pigeon House by steam when the Electricity Supply Board's total production is at 400,000,000 units per year. As consumption continues to increase, the cost of producing electricity at the Liffey station will tend to fall in relation <Col N="93" /> to the cost of producing electricity by steam-plant or coal.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Shannon works, there is no question that now that capital expenditure has been undertaken on these works, it is much cheaper to produce electricity from the Shannon than by any other method. The capital expenditure has been incurred.  The charges upon that capital must be met and, consequently, it is the policy of the Board to supply as much as possible of the total electricity requirements of the people from the Shannon and only to bring into operation the steam stand-by plant, which it controls, when occasion demands&mdash;which is, during the summer period, if abnormally dry weather reduces the productive capacity of the Shannon, and during the peak periods in the winter.  It is, of course, necessary to have that stand-by plant.  I indicated that the capacity of Ardnacrusha is about 80,000 kwts.  The steam plant will have a capacity of 84,000 kwts. The more certain the Board is that this stand-by plant is capable of meeting the demands upon it, the more use it can, in fact, make of the Shannon station by utilising the reserves of water which might otherwise have to be kept as an iron ration to meet all possible contingencies.  The same applies in the case of the Liffey scheme. The Liffey reservoir will have exceptional features, and some 50 per cent. of the total flow of the river will be impounded in the reservoir as against 5 per cent. in the case of the Shannon. That will enable the Liffey power station to be brought into operation, as occasion requires, on very short notice, so that it can be regarded as a reliable stand-by plant in the event of any temporary break-down in the supply of current on the Board's system.  The Liffey scheme, therefore, offers special advantages to the Board which some other scheme might not provide.</P>
      <P>One or two other points were raised by Deputies which might more usefully be discussed on the Committee Stage because they relate to points of detail rather than to questions of principle.  On that account, I should be disposed to leave them over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, in reply to Deputy Dockrell, that the Department <Col N="94" /> of Industry and Commerce, or the Government, have, of course, no direct responsibility in the matter of the provision of water to the City of Dublin. Any information the Deputy wants concerning the intentions of the Corporation, or the replacements of the mains from Roundwood, or the future utilisation of Roundwood, must be obtained from the Corporation.  So far as the Department are concerned, our purpose is to provide by legislation for the confirmation of the agreement which the Corporation made with the Electricity Supply Board, having satisfied ourselves that the circumstances are such that the powers required by the Corporation should be provided by a public statute rather than by a Private Bill.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to a number of queries which other Deputies put concerning investigations made into the suitability of the water that will be impounded at Poulaphouca for drinking purposes.  We understand the Corporation have got full and adequate reports upon this and other matters. We have not seen the reports, but I feel sure that they have fully satisfied themselves, not merely as to the suitability of the water, but as to the practicability of bringing it to Dublin in adequate quantities with no unreasonable or undue risk of an interruption of supply.  These are all matters which come within the direct province of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The joint enterprise is represented by the reservoir.  The reservoir is going to cost the Corporation, roughly, £120,000, and the reservoir plus the generating works will cost the Electricity Supply Board over £600,000.  In addition to these items of expenditure, the Corporation will necessarily expend another £600,000 or £700,000 upon its own works in order to bring the water from the reservoir to the City of Dublin and into the areas to which the Dublin Corporation supplies water. These works are the direct concern of the Corporation.  So far as the Government are concerned, they propose to provide them with the necessary statutory authority to do this work.  That is now being done here.</P>
    <P>As to the particular plans upon which the Corporation are working, and <Col N="95" /> how they are based and what expert advice they got, I can give no information; that must be sought from the Corporation itself.  All I need say is that we were satisfied that meeting the requirements of the Corporation for water supply purposes from the reservoir in the Liffey would not unduly interfere with the utilisation of the Liffey for power purposes and would, in fact, facilitate the Electricity Supply Board in having that done.  We welcomed the agreement and we are now bringing in this public measure to give the necessary statutory authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Local Government Bill, 1936, be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The Local Government Act of 1933 provided that where a person's service under a local authority was interrupted by absence on account of political activities during the period from July, 1922, to April, 1923, any remuneration withheld on account of such absence could be paid within six months after the passing of the Act.  In a few cases there was some delay, and the time limit expired before the necessary resolution was passed, or before payment was made.  There were also some cases in which application for payment was made too late.  This amending Bill provides that where it was decided to pay and payment was not made owing to the time limit having expired, to allow it to be made when the Bill becomes law.  It is also proposed to allow local authorities a period of 12 months to deal with any applications for withheld remuneration that could not be dealt with under the Act of 1933 owing to their not having been received in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1933 also dealt with pensionable service which was broken owing to an officer resigning or being dismissed for political reasons after <Col N="96" /> January, 1922.  But that part of the Act applied only to officers.  There are a few cases in which the services of pensionable wage earning employees were interrupted in the same circumstances as those of officers, and it is proposed to treat these employees in the same manner as officers have been treated, that is, to link the first period of employment with the second and allow service to be reckoned from the original date of employment.</P>
    <P>There are some local officers who left or were removed from the local service for political reasons and who could not get back their places in the local service. Some of these have since entered the Civil Service.  Had they remained in the local service they would, in due course, have become entitled to pensions. It is proposed now that a pension or gratuity, as the case may be, shall be fixed by the local authority. This pension will not be payable until the officer retires from the Civil Service. His service will be reckoned from the date of first appointment up to the date of entry to the Civil Service, and the Minister for Finance will, in certain cases in which the pensionable period exceeds ten years, make a contribution in respect of part of the pension. Normally the local authority will be responsible for the first ten years and for such portion of the pension in respect of the period in excess of ten years as may be determined.  In the case of officers whose local service was given outside the Saorstát, the Exchequer will be responsible for the whole of the local service pension.</P>
    <P>A few cases were brought to notice in which persons who had been in the local service and who had lost their employment for political reasons could not now be re-employed on account of their age or the state of their health. We propose to deal with these by a gratuity which will not exceed £150 in any case.  These gratuities will be borne by the Exchequer.  The first intention was to put the names into the Bill, but as there was some doubt whether the two or three cases of which we had particulars were the only persons that would come into this category it was decided to leave the matter to the discretion of the Minister, who will consider the claims as <Col N="97" /> they arise within the limit of 12 months, which the Bill fixes.</P>
    <P>I may say about the Bill generally that I do not anticipate that the numbers to be dealt with under any section will be large.  Except in Section 5 the Bill contains nothing that the Act of 1933 did not contemplate, and Section 5, so far as we can see, is not likely to involve a large charge.</P>

    <P>These three resolutions may, I think, be taken together.  They are all three designed to effect the one purpose, which is to amend the quota orders applying to brushes for the purpose of excluding quill brushes from the restriction upon imports.  The original quota orders, which apply to all classes of brushes, prohibited the importation into this country of the type of brushes which are known as quill brushes.  It subsequently became clear that these brushes were not being made, and were not likely to be made, here and, consequently, the quota orders were amended so as to permit of their importation again without restriction. That is the purpose of these three Orders.  One relates to household <Col N="98" /> brushes; another to toilet brushes; and the third to general classes of brushes not covered by the other two Orders, and the three are designed to effect the same purpose.</P>

      <P>There are quotas fixed under these Orders and a certain number of brushes are allowed to come in. It was originally contemplated, not merely in relation to these Orders, but in relation to all Orders, that the quota would be utilised by importers to bring in the classes of goods which are not procurable here and which have to be imported.  In fact, importers do not use these quotas for that purpose at all, and, consequently, various changes have to be made.  In this case, the obvious and easiest change was to exclude this class of brushes from the restriction altogether.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 31) Order, 1936, made on the 27th day of August, 1936, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>

    <P>This quota order relates to certain classes of electric filament lamps.  The description in the Orders is of a rather technical nature, but it means that the ordinary household lamp is made subject to quota restrictions, whereas other classes of electric lamps are not so restricted.  Electric lamps were subject to import duty at the rate of 75 per cent. previously, but for various reasons which I shall mention it was found that the existing import duty was not sufficient to secure that a reasonable proportion of the market here would be secured for the company manufacturing electric lamps here. One of the main reasons why the import duty was not entirely effective was that many of the principal firms engaged in the distribution of electric <Col N="99" /> lamps were either controlled by, or very closely associated with, the combination of foreign lamp manufacturers which previously supplied the market here, and Irish producers found very considerable difficulty in getting their products placed upon the market through existing distributors at all.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, large quantities of lamps were imported previous to the imposition of the duty and, in fact, following the imposition of the duty, and considerable stocks were obviously being held in the country, with the result that the output from the Saorstát factory was considerably below its capacity.  One of the results of the making of the quota order and the consequent provision to the company concerned of a secure market for their products was that the price of their product, which had previously been fixed at the same level as the price of the combine product, was reduced and, in fact, we look forward to and expect further reductions in the price of their lamps as their output increases.  We do not think that expectation will be disappointed.</P>
    <P>In 1935, approximately 1,250,000 lamps were imported.  The first quota period is from 5th October, 1936, to 31st December, 1936, and during that period the quota is 120,000 lamps.  That represents a reduction of approximately 50 per cent. on the imports during the corresponding period last year.  It is considered that such a reduction need cause no difficulty to any distributor in obtaining supplies, firstly, because of the fact that there are large stocks in the country and, secondly, that the Free State concern is, in any event, capable of supplying the full requirements of the country. That quota has not yet been utilised in full, and there is a proportion of it still available for distribution under Section 9 (3) of the Control of Imports Act, should occasion ever arise for it. I think I can say that the quality of the lamps being produced at Bray is as good as can be reasonably expected. These lamps were submitted to very severe tests by the Government purchasing department and other semiofficial organisations, and they stood <Col N="100" /> up to the tests very well.  We have received from these sources information that the quality of the lamps is good, and having regard to the fact that their price has been reduced and that further reductions can be anticipated with increased production, there appears to us no reason why this measure of protection should not be afforded to the industry.</P>

      <P>With reference to the Minister's statement about the Bray factory, I think it is admitted by purchasers of the electric bulbs made in Bray that there has been a tremendous improvement in recent months.  It is quite understandable that girls who had to be trained there in the initial stages were not able to turn out the article until that training was completed. I would suggest that the tests, to which the Minister has referred, by the Government purchasing department and the Electricity Supply Board ought to be rigidly imposed on the factory. Unquestionably, the tests have brought about an improvement in the work of the local workers and have had the effect of securing the production of a satisfactory lamp.  The reduction in price has been received, I am informed by the trade, with very great satisfaction. Previously, the lamp was inclined to blow rather easily, but now they have overcome that difficulty, and I think the Minister's statement here is quite true and will be borne out by those who have experience of these lamps.  I am sure the Bray factory will ultimately extend so far as to be able to supply the whole country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution imposes restrictions upon the importation of marble chippings. For some considerable time past we have been endeavouring to secure an increased production of marble within the country.  The position <Col N="101" /> at the moment is that there appears to be no reason why all the requirements of the country in coloured marble for all purposes cannot be supplied from Irish quarries.  In fact, no licences have been issued for the importation of marble other than white marble.  The importation of white marble is of considerable importance, and some 600 workers are employed in this country working Italian white marble for various purposes.  There is not yet available sufficient Irish white marble capable of supplying the requirements of that industry.  A white marble quarry is being developed in County Galway, but it is not yet in a position to supply anything like the requirements of the industry, and it is not yet clear that, in any event, that quarry is capable of producing blocks of the size which the industry might require.  There is a marble quarry at Dunlewey, in County Donegal, which is considered capable of producing white marble, both in sufficient quantity and in sufficient size of blocks, to meet all the requirements of the industry, but that quarry has not been developed as yet.  I believe we shall be able to interest people in its development at a later stage, but for the present we must continue to import white marble for statutory purposes.  There is no reason, however, why marble chippings for terrazzo work should be imported.  The Galway quarry is capable of producing all the white marble chippings required for that work, and, of course, adequate supplies of coloured marble chippings are available from that and other quarries.  The existing import duty on these chippings is of no avail, because the actual value of the marble is a small item in the cost of the terrazzo work in which it is used, and consequently this duty of 100 per cent.  <i>ad valorem</i> is of practically no effect.  It is considered necessary, therefore, to restrict the importation of these chippings under the Control of Imports Act.  We believe that by doing so, we shall facilitate the development of the marble quarries by providing a market for those engaged in the working of the quarries, a work which is not unimportant, and which is growing in importance, and thus encourage them to proceed to the fuller <Col N="102" /> development of these quarries in the production of marble for other purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion, as is apparent on the face of it, is directed in the first place towards securing some relief for the agricultural industry which is and must remain during the continuance of the economic war, the principal sufferer from that disastrous event.  It is directed, in the second place, towards the determination of that extraordinary and mutually destructive condition of affairs, by so far as possible, bringing to bear the utmost pressure which this Dáil, as the sovereign assembly of the Irish people, is capable of exercising.  When this very unfortunate condition of affairs was first precipitated while, in Government circles, regret was generally expressed, <Col N="103" /> that regret was tempered by the pious hope that it might eventually prove a blessing in disguise.  This hope again was based on apparently two beliefs&mdash; first of all, a belief that wholesale tariffs would be imposed on foreign manufactured commodities, particularly commodities manufactured in England, with the whole-hearted consent and the enthusiastic co-operation of the Irish people in whom, it was believed, something like a war frenzy could be aroused and that they could be induced to regard any attempt to criticise that tariff policy as treasonable conduct on the part of the critics. The Government believed that that weapon could be used at the same time to further their own political interests.  The second belief on which it was based was, that the British retaliatory tariff policy, being directed mainly against Irish live-stock industry would, on the one hand, assist the Government's own tillage policy and that on the other hand, so far as the adverse repercussions of the economic war were concerned, they would be restricted mainly to the larger farmers, the attacking of whom by such names as graziers, ranchers and grabbers could all be counted upon as good politics in Ireland.  If these larger farmers who should happen to have capital&mdash;a small minority&mdash;could be induced to spend that capital in sending good money after bad, in what in many cases was a futile attempt to hold on to their property, and if at the time those farmers who had no capital or very little capital&mdash;the great majority of the big farmers happen to have very little capital&mdash;could be induced or forced cut of their holdings, which could then be divided amongst the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, then the clouds of the economic war would not be without their silver lining.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present Government's industrial policy, which is partly a consequence of the economic war, I do not intend to go into it at any length as it does not arise directly out of this motion.  I shall content myself by remarking that two very great powers&mdash;one a nation illustrating the extreme expression of Capitalism, <Col N="104" /> the other of Communism&mdash;have agreed if, in nothing else, on the method of industrialising a purely agricultural country.  Both the United States and Soviet Russia have built up a great industrial arm by increasing their exports of agricultural produce and raw materials&mdash;such commodities as wheat, sugar, cotton, tobacco, etc. This is the only country I know, as far as I have read history, where an attempt has been made to build up new industries by curtailing the export trade of the country's greatest and most extensive industry, practically its sole industry&mdash;agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now, as regards the agricultural policy, I think that it will be generally admitted by all sides that whatever advantages there may be in the wheat-growing policy, it can be no substitute for the live-stock export trade.  I think that that is admitted by all sides. Even if we assume that the Government's present policy had reached the peak point of success and that we were now in a position to grow all our own wheat and all our own sugar, or at least all our own sugar and wheat that would be adequate for our own needs, the amount of arable land required for that purpose would be only a small fraction of the arable land in Ireland, and the question then immediately arises: What is to be done with the remainder?  Again, it is axiomatic that an increase in the area of tillage or of land under cultivation in the country is bound to lead to an increase in the live-stock population of the country, and if that is the case, what can that lead to eventually unless to a further slaughter of the innocents&mdash;more uneconomic calf schemes&mdash;if, at the same time, our mature live-stock trade is being curtailed?</P>
    <P>There is, economically speaking at all events, no real opposition between the tillage farmer and the live-stock farmer, and no opposition or no antagonism between the larger farmer and the smaller farmer or between any class of farmer and the farm labourer who, individually, receives very little attention from anybody.  They are all part and parcel of the same great industry, but just like so many different departments in, say, the Ford <Col N="105" /> factory, all these various sections must sink or swim together and you cannot take them separately; you cannot attack one section and think to destroy that without injuring the others also. I hear a lot of talk in this House and in other places about the rancher.  One would imagine that that sort of thing should be worn out long ago.  The land war was fought in this country, not in our time, but in the time of our fathers and our grandfathers.  In that day, undoubtedly, the rancher was a serious menace to this country and to the people of this nation.  To-day, however, the rancher, to all intents and purposes is a thing of the past.  I even still hear talk about the rancher, his herd and his dog, but so far as my experience goes, at the present time, the number of farm labourers and grooms and gardeners and various other types of employees employed by such men completely obscures the cases of the man with one herd and a dog.  In my experience, those people in most cases spend a great deal more on their land than they take out of it, because they generally had private means and they really subsidised agriculture out of their own private resources.  To-day, the Government is spending something like £8,000,000 a year in subsidising agriculture.  These people, however, probably subsidised agriculture to as big an extent out of their own pockets, and furthermore, not alone did they do that but they were also subsidising agriculture generally by paying higher prices for live stock than would be paid if the live stock were purchased only by means of the ordinary dealer.  In the same way they also helped by paying good prices for hay, oats and root crops generally and by giving employment to the sons of small farmers.  It must also be remembered that they were great contributors to rates and taxation generally.</P>
    <P>Now, I hold no brief for those people and, as I say, they are practically a thing of the past; but in dealing with a serious situation like the present, it is a very foolish thing to be carried away by purely political catch-cries and not to give due value to all the factors in the situation.  We should realise that the people who were engaged in <Col N="106" /> this country in farming in a big way were not altogether a loss, but in many cases an asset.  I should also like to make the point that it is not only those people who have suffered through the economic war.  In the beginning they were probably the biggest sufferers, but the blow has been passed on since then. As I say, the class of people to whom I am referring are practically a thing of the past, and their disappearance has been due even more to economic circumstances than to the very drastic land legislation which has been carried out in this country, and rightly carried out, during the last 50 years.  Before this century was ushered in, however, it was nothing unusual for a County Meath grazier to purchase three and four year old cattle in, say, County Galway, at, let us say, £7 or £8 a head and to sell them after a summer's season on the grass of Meath at £18 or £20. That was the case in those days, because in those days good land was valuable; but things have changed very much since then.  To-day, an acre of land in the poorest part of Connemara may well be worth a great deal more than an equal amount of the best land in Meath.  The Great War changed the whole position, and since then the value of cattle is regulated, not by what the wealthy or the large farmer is prepared to give, but by what the small farmer, who reared the calf, is prepared to take.  At the outset, as I say, it was the large farmer who suffered most, but that depression in agriculture in Ireland did not begin with the economic war; it began in 1921, at the time when the Treaty negotiations were going on.  At that time there was a cataclysmic fall in the price of live stock in the spring of that year, and the blow came only in the autumn, and many of those farmers lost as much as £10 and £15 a head on cattle they had purchased in the previous spring.  It must also be remembered in this connection, that many of those farmers were paying very high prices for their land which they had hired for grazing purposes on the eleven months' purchase system, and those farmers continued to lose money continuously in that way while still dealing in a falling market.  The small <Col N="107" /> farmer, however, escaped that shock because he had already sold his cattle, and even though in subsequent years he did not get as high a price, yet, because he raised his own cattle, or bought them very young and cheap, he was not hurt so much, whereas the larger farmer continued to feel the full force of that depression all along.</P>
    <P>The second crisis came when the economic war was started, and it was a decisive blow to a great many of the larger farmers, particularly those who had bought land and paid a high price for it.  When that came about the value of live stock was halved. They decided on different ways to meet the difficulty. Some of them tried to reduce the number of stock on their land, and some even went to the extent of not stocking their land at all.  That had a repercussion on smaller farmers, who saw no hope of selling any store cattle.  Others met the situation by selling their land to the Land Commission.  That made it still more difficult for the small farmers.  The third way the situation was met was by a change in the system of farming.  Because the Government was hostile to their methods large farmers adopted the same system as small farmers, by going into dairying, the growing of corn, and mixed farming, so that small farmers eventually were in a worse position than the large farmers.  After the beginning of the economic war it was impossible for farmers to sell their cattle.  They stood in the fairs all day, and it was practically only as a charity that they could be got rid of.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether agriculture is different to any other industry we have. The success of other industries is understood to depend on specialisation and on the provision of labour.  I do not know whether it will prove feasible in the case of agriculture to have the same system of farming adopted throughout the country from Buncrana in Donegal to Bantry Bay in Cork.  I would not be surprised if it was eventually found that the revolt against those who specialised in the production of beef and other types of farming had not the same result as the <Col N="108" /> revolt of the members against the belly in the world's oldest fable. However, this so-called economic war has demonstrated that if the larger farmer cannot make a profit on big cattle, the small farmer cannot make a profit on little cattle, and the tillage farmer, unless he receives doles from the Government, cannot make a profit out of his crops, and farm labourers cannot get employment.</P>
    <P>The economic war has certainly proved one point that I would like to drive home, that the larger farmer is in the same position as the smaller farmer, except to the extent to which tillage is subsidised by the Government. If that is the position of farmers, how can the lot of the unfortunate agricultural workers be bettered? There is a Bill before the Dáil at present to deal with the position of the agricultural labourers.  What can be done by legislation if the money is not there to give the labourers a decent living wage?  Before the position of the agricultural labourers can be improved, the agricultural industry as a whole must be improved.  The seriousness of our position is shown by the figures dealing with our economic position.  I admit that things are not as bad now as when this motion was put down.  At that time our adverse trade balance was actually £2,000,000 more than our total export trade.  It was an extraordinary state of affairs. There is still a sufficient margin between our exports and imports to make everybody who takes an interest in the affairs of this country look upon the position as extremely grave. We have also a very serious position from the point of view of unemployment. In the agricultural industry alone, the fact that production in recent years is down by a total of £25,000,000 is very serious, but, on top of that, we have to face the fact that taxation since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office has gone up by approximately £4 per head of the population.  These facts are certainly deplorable.</P>
    <P>There is certainly something ridiculous about the present situation.  If there was any justification for it, any great principle at stake, or any great prize to be won, the Irish people are <Col N="109" /> not a people that could be driven to surrender by any form of privation.  The question arises: what is it all about? I must say that the longer the economic war lasts the more puzzled I become. It is apparently a war on two fronts, the political front and the economic front.  It is certainly serious from our point of view, because there is intense suffering amongst the agricultural population, suffering that has been increased by the higher cost of living which has been passed on to the general public.  It is not a matter for joking.  It is serious, and the question is, what are we doing to bring this situation to an end?  On the economic front, apparently, we have not been able to do anything or to hit back.  The relief that was given by the coal-cattle pact was at a time when Great Britain was in rather a difficult position over sanctions, and when the Italians had cancelled orders for coal value for several millions.  At that time England was on the verge of a coal strike, but the orders from this country came to the rescue.  As regards the economic front, we do not appear to be waging this war with any effect or to make it likely that Great Britain will bow the knee or accept any proposals we make.  We have the same situation on the political front.  I remember that when the question of sanctions arose our representative in Geneva gave the British every assistance in his power. From the military point of view, this country is not of very much importance, but its moral position is extremely important.  Our influence, particularly in the United States, plays a very important part and if that country had adopted sanctions like other powers, the whole position would be changed. That moral support was thrown wholeheartedly behind England in the campaign. There is this position with regard to Spain, that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with Great Britain in whatever her policy happens to be.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising that attitude any more than to say that if we are at war then we should adopt a different attitude.  If we are not going to have a real war and to fight it seriously, then there is no reason why we should not make peace.  I regret that some attempt has not been made <Col N="110" /> to end this whole miserable matter. Can we segregate the two parts?  Can we segregate the economic end of it from the political end and settle that, or, better still, why not settle all our troubles together?  I am not necessarily talking of a final settlement.  It was well said during the Treaty debates&mdash;it is a saying that will probably ever remain fresh in the minds of the people&mdash;&ldquo;that this was no more a final settlement than that we are the final generation.&rdquo;  We here who are only temporary representatives in what may perhaps be only a temporary Assembly can no more bind the future than we can alter the past.  The time in which we have to work and sow and reap is the present, and it is on that that we will be judged.  I know that there are a great many people in this country, sincere people whose political convictions are as sacred to them as their religion.  I know there are a great many people in this country who would not be prepared to accept any settlement that any British Government could afford to make.  I know there are numbers of people in the country who, even if we got to-morrow the fullest measure of freedom that it is possible for any people to enjoy, call it republic or whatever name you like&mdash;even if the complete unity of the country were achieved&mdash;at the same time would still feel it their duty to resist by every means in their power the advance of any nation flying an Imperial flag.  Now there are such people, and Ireland is not the only country that has such people&mdash;genuine pacifists and genuine anti-Imperialists. There are such men in England probably more than there are here.  George Lansbury, when the question of sanctions against Italy was prominent in England and in spite of the overwhelming opposition of his own Party, did homage to what he believed to be the higher peace than that of Geneva, and deserves credit from everyone who is fair-minded in such matters.  Governments must govern according to the standards of their own time.  But no Government and no man has the right to proclaim a higher gospel than that of the Almighty Himself&mdash;to say: &ldquo;He may be prepared to permit and suffer evil, but not I; I must insist on stamping it out irrespective of what <Col N="111" /> the cost be to the people whose destinies I control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been in this Dáil ever since it was set up.  I have seen many occasions when an offer of co-operation, or the acceptance of an offer of co-operation by Deputies now on the Government Benches, would have altered very much for the better the course of our recent history.  I remember the occasion of the Treaty debates when Michael Collins asked to have a Joint Committee of Public Safety established so that peace and order could be preserved in the country during the interregnum between the departure of the British and the establishment of the first native Government in this country.  I have in mind also an occasion when a vitally important election was being held in Northern Ireland, an election which was to a great extent going to decide the fate of the boundary, and when an effort was made to face the situation in the North with a united front.  If we had got that, while I do not say that we would have no boundary, I think that at all events we would have a better situation than we have at present.  I also have in mind the time when the Ultimate Financial Settlement was being negotiated.  An appeal was made, if not for co-operation to get the best terms that we could, at least for the charity of silence.  On those occasions there was no co-operation.  I believe that the present is a situation when such co-operation could not be but helpful, and I believe that no Party as an individual Party could suffer by having it.  If we had it, I believe that Ireland as a whole would gain.</P>
    <P>In putting down this resolution I have made a slight alteration in the method by which the committee is to be selected if the resolution is accepted. I believe that the findings of such a committee would be much more influential than that of a committee formed in the ordinary way.  I think if at all possible the system I propose should be adopted, but if anybody sees an insurmountable obstacle in the way, then the alternative is there.  I have put down this resolution in all sincerity, in the interests of the people as a whole, <Col N="112" /> and particularly in the interests of the agricultural community&mdash;every section of it from the biggest farmer down to the poorest agricultural labourer.  I have put it down in the hope that some solution will be found, first of all to bring the economic war itself to a termination. If that cannot be done immediately, then there is no reason why such a committee could not hammer out some means whereby the present very onerous burdens of this conflict would be put on a broader basis than that on which they rest at present. As I have said, I have put down the resolution in all sincerity, and I believe that if the Dáil accepts it in that spirit it will lead to good results.</P>

      <P>I am glad to second this motion, because I am thoroughly in sympathy with the spirit of it, although I confess doubts as to whether the actual machinery proposed is well adapted to secure the ends which Deputy Bourke has in view. Before I go any further, I should like to take exception to one or two of his concluding observations that are not perhaps strictly relevant to this motion, but are too important to pass over in silence.  I cannot agree that the attitude of this country, either in regard to our obligations in Geneva and the several gross breaches of faith by Italy, which we felt called upon to join with the other nations in condemning, or in relation to the civil war in Spain, can be properly described as support of Great Britain.  In my view our attitude on those matters must have been what it was even if Great Britain had never existed.</P>

      <P>I have finished with them, in any case.  Deputy Bourke made some trenchant observations about the peculiar nature of what he describes as this economic war, but I should like to go a little bit further and to ask is there any sense in calling it an economic war at all?  On our side I am not aware of any hostilities whatever. So far as I know, we are carrying on no military operations against the so-called enemy.  On the other side, if <Col N="113" /> the British were indeed endeavouring to break this country&mdash;as I see alleged at Fianna Fáil Ard Fheiseanna and elsewhere&mdash;by brutal methods and the big stick, they could have done enormously more than they have actually done.  They would and must obviously have done enormously more.  They have, in fact, confined themselves to revenue-producing tariffs, and have aimed at getting from those tariffs the exact amount, as nearly as possible, that they claim to be due to them.  It seems to me that a procedure of that sort cannot, with any verbal correctness, be described as an economic war, and still less does it seem sensible to talk about an economic war when you bear in mind that our economic relations with the alleged enemy are far more intimate than our economic relations with any other country in the world; that, in spite of whatever damage has been done by the policy of the present Government, the volume of our trade with that country is immensely greater than the volume of our trade with any other country; and that, in spite of all the talk of alternative markets, and all the trade agreements that were accomplished with various other countries, it has to be admitted that the total value of all those agreements is insignificant compared with the value of the coal-cattle pact and the trade agreement of 1936 with Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fantastic to talk about an economic war when, in fact, subject to the collection by Great Britain of a certain fixed amount of revenue by tariffs, the two countries are doing everything they can think of to expand their trade with each other and to improve their economic relations with each other.  But, while I contend that there is no economic war, there is an exceedingly damaging financial dispute and there is a dislocation of our trade with Great Britain that ought to be put a stop to.  This motion will be of great value if it succeeds in extracting from the spokesmen of the Government some statement as to what the Government are now thinking and doing about this financial dispute.  We do not yet know whether they are making any attempt to settle it by way of compromise; <Col N="114" /> or whether, in order to bring the dispute to an end, a single offer has been made to Great Britain to pay less than we are at present paying, because in spite of every attempt to conceal it, it cannot be concealed that we are, in fact, paying to Great Britain the entire amount in dispute.  We have a right to ask the Government, and I do ask the Government, are they making any proposals at all, or have they, at any time, made proposals to Great Britain for compromise on the basis of paying Great Britain something less than we are actually paying them now, whether we like it or not?</P>
    <P>This matter of our agricultural exports was important enough already, but it has taken a new and an added importance from the emergence of the legislative proposals to provide a minimum wage for agricultural labourers. If those proposals are to do any good at all, they must be accompanied by such a settlement of the financial dispute with Great Britain as will put the farmers in a position to pay the increased wages that we wish to see paid.  Nobody is more conscious than I of the exceedingly unsatisfactory position of agricultural labourers, and of the very unsatisfactory wages they receive compared with workers in other industries, and nobody is more eager than I am to see that situation altered, but the Government's proposals for introducing a minimum wage will have no useful effect at all&mdash;and will probably have, on the whole, a bad effect rather than a good one&mdash;unless something is simultaneously done to put the farming industry in such a position that better wages can be paid.  I commend those considerations to the Government's attention.  I ask them to discard any jingoism that may be lingering in their minds; to look at the facts as they actually are; to tell us if they have done anything towards making a businesslike arrangement with Great Britain which need sacrifice no one's pride or dignity, which need sacrifice no principle of any sort, but which would simply embody a realisation of hard facts.  I think we have a right to expect them to be frank with us as to what they are doing and thinking about this matter, and I appeal to them not only to be frank, but to be sensible.</P>

      <P>It had been my intention merely to second Deputy Bourke's motion, as I felt quite sure that the House, having heard this discussion so often, would possibly desire that those speaking to this motion would not try to go outside the spirit in which the motion was introduced.  There is no doubt that the sincerity of the introducer of this notice of motion must have been felt by the few who are in the House.  It must have been recognised as an endeavour in all sincerity to raise the matter beyond the plane of Party politics.  I remember when the President was speaking on this question here in general terms he stated quite frankly and quite freely that the land annuities were being collected in the most harmful way possible, and in considering his own submission I tried to connect it up with the second part of this motion, namely, can there not be some attempt made to settle this dispute between the two countries?  It is a money dispute as we all know and, no matter whether we remove partition, or have new Constitution Bills or new External Affairs Bills, money talks all the time, and it is a question of seeing whether there can be a compromise at any time to cut or reduce the amount we have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the farming community have had a very bad harvest.  That is not the responsibility of any Government Department.  These are things we have to face up to and accept. Deputies who come from districts where grain is grown will admit that in spite of enhanced prices, the agricultural community have felt the blow of this year's harvest of their grain, whether it is wheat, barley, or oats. Everybody agrees that the prolific yield of the previous harvest failed to stay&mdash;nobody could have expected it. It was one of the greatest records in yield that statistical facts can show us in this country.  This year, not only has the yield been considerably less than last year, but I should think it was one of the worst within the last decade or more.  Despite the tremendous efforts made to enable the farmers to have a means of revenue by the introduction of a wheat policy, I think it will be agreed that the revenue <Col N="116" /> obtained by the farming community has been reduced considerably owing to the bad harvest this year.  I believe that there are about 57,000 acres less under oats than last year and about 9,000 acres less under barley, but that this has been more or less compensated for by an increase in the wheat acreage to 250,000 acres. Farmers whom I have met have informed me that, despite the enhanced prices, their payments for grain are not at all in keeping with what they got last year.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the question of why we cannot make these bad years more secure by having our agricultural activities on a normal basis.  We cannot have them on a normal basis while we are engaged in a dispute over money with a country which takes and can take everything that this country can produce.  I think that the time has arrived when some consideration might be given to a settlement, if a settlement is at all possible or will ever be possible, of this dispute.  First of all, it was a question of mere money. Then a quota was imposed on our live stock which led up to the Bill for the slaughtering of calves.  Nearly 500,000 calves were slaughtered, a sum of 10/-being given for each calf skin.  If there had been no quota imposed on us, and I do not believe there would have been a quota imposed if the relations between the two countries had not been inflamed by this dispute over the land annuities, we would have to-day 400,000 more cattle which would increase the revenue of every farmer no matter to what Party he belonged, and I am sure the independence of the country or the future of Ireland would be in no way interfered with. It is always the same in business matters.  You cannot get away from it by phrases or slogans or anything like that&mdash;the losses remain.  If we are stupid enough to carry on on the lines on which we have been carrying on, we must make up our minds definitely that we intend to bear the losses.  We have had bitter debates in the House in the past on this matter, but I hope this motion will be received by the Government in the spirit in which it is introduced; that there will not be an atmosphere of <Col N="117" /> trying to score over each other or hurl epithets of an unpleasant nature at each other, but that we shall see if the House can agree in some way to approach this matter in the way that the country expects.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot referred to the question of agricultural wages.  Unless we have a ready market for what this country can produce, and have no wrenches thrown into the machinery, the problem of the agricultural worker is an insoluble one, and he can never be brought up to a rate of wages which every member of the House would desire.  There is not one of us here but realises that the wage available to the agricultural worker after the farmer has discharged his liabilities is a low wage, an uneconomic wage, a demoralising and unfair wage.  Until we face up to that, as it is our duty to do, irrespective of Party, no legislation produced in this House will make one bit of difference.  We have now a tremendous campaign about the question of the slums.  I believe that the question of the agricultural wage-earner is just as big a one.  At the moment, he is not able to keep his house in any kind of comfort, and when he gets a new house he will naturally fail to keep it in the way it was given to him. As time goes on, deterioration sets in, not only in the man himself, but in the house he is trying to keep up.  To raise the standard is the essential thing for us, and we will never be able to do that for the agricultural labourers or the farmers as long as we are engaged in a dispute which is affecting the prosperity of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland to-day is a dull place. Everybody knows that.  It is dull by reason of economic facts, despite the tremendous efforts that are being made &mdash;I give credit where credit is due&mdash; to establish new industries and try to help the farming industry by artificial means.  Because life is dull in the rural areas, we have criticism of our dance halls and of our young people clearing out of the country or pouring into the towns.  Until we make rural life attractive and dignified, and until we make country life worth while, we will never cure these ills.  We will never stop the best of our rural community clearing <Col N="118" /> away into the towns or seeking a livelihood in some other country.  I am quite certain that is the truth.  I am satisfied that when the Agricultural Wages Bill is brought in here&mdash;a Bill under which higher wages are to be paid&mdash; what will happen will be, as happened in England, that the farmer will let one of his men go, and so one man less will be employed on that farm.  To-day the farmer is not able to pay a proper agricultural wage to his labourers. This is a case of putting the hypodermic needle into the sick man, but that will not cure him.  It will have the effect only of making him stagger. Under the present system you cannot have the agricultural industry healthy, and the sick man cannot be turned into a virile, sound man.  This dispute with Great Britain will have to be settled, and settled with dignity and honour to both countries.</P>

      <P>The Government are not accepting the proposals outlined by Deputy Bourke in his motion.  I do not think I need detain the House in going into the reasons.  It is noteworthy that none of the Deputies who have addressed themselves to the motion have dealt with the kernel of the matter, which is that a committee representing the Opposition as well as the Government Party in this House should be set up to make recommendations:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  as to how the land and agricultural interests of the nation can best be preserved and assisted during the economic war; and</P>
      <P>(2)  as to how the economic war can best and most expeditiously be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No argument whatever has been adduced to show that there would be any utility in setting up such a committee. I cannot agree that it would serve any useful purpose.  I sympathise with and appreciate the speeches made by some of the Deputies.  I appreciate their point of view, and I sympathise with their desire to co-operate with the Government in a certain measure, <Col N="119" /> but I suggest that this is not the way in which any co-operation can be brought about.  The Government have a certain policy which they are carrying into effect with the assistance of the majority of this House.  We have had an endless discussion during the last few years on this question of the economic war, and I think the position is fairly well understood by Deputies, and indeed by our people generally. In conclusion, I want to say that I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by the setting up of this committee, and I do not accept the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>While one must agree with what the Minister for Education has said&mdash;that none of the Deputies who have spoken has produced very much argument in support of the motion&mdash;still the House will understand my position.  I am not in the confidence of the proposers of the motion, but I think this might be taken as an opportunity of making in all seriousness an appeal for something to be done.  We have now had almost four and a half years of this financial dispute, and while Providence blessed us&mdash;and we humbly thank Him for it&mdash; with good seasons and good weather for the saving of our crops in recent years, we were this year reminded of what the weather can do.  Speaking as one coming from the heart of the country and as one engaged all his life in agriculture, I would add my appeal to the Government to do something in regard to this matter.  We are all, I think, sympathetic towards Government policy so far as the establishment of industries is concerned, but I would respectfully point out to them that the success of their industrial policy is bound up with the purchasing power of the consumer, and as our country is made up largely of people who make a livelihood out of agriculture, I suggest that it would be a sound economic proposition to improve the position of the agricultural community.  In that way you will have a natural subsidisation, if I might use the word, of industry. I do not know whether the Front Bench Members of the Government realise where we stand in the country to-day. <Col N="120" /> In my part of the country anyhow we have not the name of neglecting to save what Providence sends us.  But a great deal of our crops this year has been lost.  In addition to that at the present moment the price of the meal mixture that we use is far too high considering the price we get for our live stock. Some of the Government policy might be very well for people who are living in the neighbourhood of large cities where the farmer can turn his crops into cash.  Our situation does not lend itself to that.  We would far rather use the crops that we produce and keep the labour going on the farm all the year round than have seasonal work and doing with less labour in winter time.  In my part of the country we always strive to use what we grow and we produce the best.  I do not propose to reiterate the arguments that are used so often in this House, but I speak with all sincerity.  I have no axe to grind in this matter further than trying to help my fellow-farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education says that the majority in this House is with the Government.  He is perfectly right in that.  Still, with all respect, I would point out that this economic dispute is a thing that cannot go on for ever. The Government is exhausting every means in its power in the endeavour to compensate for the disturbance to our industries caused by that dispute. But, after all, no matter what bounties the farmer gets, the people themselves have in the end to bear the cost of these subsidies.  The motion asks for the termination of this economic dispute.  Perhaps it would be impertinent on my part to suggest to the Government how that could be done. But were the Government to address themselves to that question they would find it could be done and the evil could be cured.  The present procedure of collecting annuities is to my mind like employing a Rolls Royce motor car to collect the rents of labourers' cottages. These annuities are being collected in a most expensive way on both sides of the Border.  They are being collected with the maximum of trouble.  That sort of thing cannot go on without having its serious effects upon the country.  Some people tell us that the <Col N="121" /> farmer is being recouped for the British tax on his live stock and farm produce; still the fact remains that on a full-grown beast there is a duty of £4 5s., which the farmer has to pay.  That, surely, is not as it should be. Reference has been made even to-day to the fresh agreement made at the beginning of this year and the useful effect it has had on the country.  If the results were in the same ratio in respect of the ending of this dispute as in the case of the pact made at the beginning of the year, we might, as farming people, look forward to better times.  I do not know whether or not this resolution is the best type of resolution in its present form.  I speak to it for the purpose of appealing to the Government to address themselves afresh to this question and end the economic dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education blandly intervened in our discussion to-day and his contribution was to observe that the Government was carrying out a certain policy with the assistance of the majority of this House and that they did not propose to change.  He had not the hardihood to elaborate that statement.  I do not blame him.  What that policy is he does not know nor do his colleagues.  He would have got into deep water if he had tried to explain what the policy which is actuating the Government in regard to agriculture is.  The September number of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> contains some facts which may be relevant to the matters under discussion at present.  The Minister for Education had not seen them.  If he had seen them, he would not have understood them.  I shall try to explain some of them now.  I do not hope that my explanation will have any effect on the members who occupy the back benches on the opposite side.  I am a very ambitious man in many ways, but there are limits to what I hope to do.  Even if I were able to explain these very simple figures to the Deputies opposite, it would make very little difference because, when the whip cracked, they would respond with their usual alacrity.</P>

      <P>I am going to convince Deputy Victory, but I have not the slightest hope of converting him.  To convince him is one thing; to convert him is another.  To convince him, it is necessary that he should have some intelligence and that I should have some eloquence.  To convert him it is not only necessary that I should have some eloquence, but that he should have both intelligence and moral courage.  No member of the Fianna Fáil Party has yet developed moral courage.  I want to compare a few figures dealing with the output of agricultural products in this country in 1929-30 and 1934-35.  The value of cattle produced in 1929-30 was £14,960,000. The value of cattle produced in 1934-35 was £5,653,000&mdash;a reduction of over £9,000,000 in the value of cattle alone. The value of butter produced in 1929-30 was £11,326,000, and in 1934-35 it was £7,363,000&mdash;a reduction of £4,000,000 per annum.  The production of pigs in 1929-30 was valued at £8,990,000, and in 1934-35 the value of our output was £5,273,000&mdash;a reduction of about £3,700,000.  The production of eggs in 1929-30 was value for £7,113,000, and in 1934-35 the value was £4,273,000&mdash;a reduction of almost £3,000,000.  Sheep and lambs were valued at £3,207,000 in 1929-30, and at £1,600,000 in 1934-35&mdash; less than half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go down through every item of the produce of Irish agriculture of an economic character and demonstrate that the value of the production has been reduced by from half to two-thirds. I have no doubt that if the Minister for Education had not fled from the House he would have attempted to make some defence on the ground that while the folly of Fianna Fáil had destroyed cattle and live-stock production, it had, at least, given the farmers increased wheat, increased beet, and increased peat&mdash; wheat, beet and peat.  Let us examine these claims.  In 1929-30 there was raised in this country 3,567,000 tons of peat.  We then started a publicity campaign to make turf the second most valuable industry in the country.  In the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we were to make it second only to agriculture in its importance <Col N="123" /> to the economic life of this country.  Having spent hundreds of thousands of pounds, we succeeded in reducing the output of turf by 200,000 tons per annum.  In 1934-35 we produced 3,310,000 tons of turf, which is 200,000 tons less than was produced in 1929-30.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the Government's amazing achievements in regard to beet and wheat.  It is not to be denied that the output of wheat, as between 1929-30 and 1934-35, increased in value by £600,000, and the output of sugar beet by £460,000.  That represents a total increase of about £1,100,000. What does it cost the community to provide that additional value in agricultural output?  It costs £2,500,000. We are spending £2,500,000 per annum in order to increase the value of the output of wheat and beet by £1,100,000.  For every extra £1 put into the farmer's pocket in respect of wheat and beet, we are taking £2 10s. 0d. out of the consumer's pocket.  Is it any wonder that members of the Government responsible for &ldquo;codology&rdquo; of that kind fly the House when somebody gets up to expose them?  Not a single member of the bench of Ministers has the hard-faced audacity to sit here during this debate in the presence of the respected Deputy for Galway, whom we are happy to welcome into our midst to-day.  That is the kind of policy on which the Deputy got elected in County Galway.  Is it any surprise that Deputy Corry is paralysed with amazement and is unable to discover the reasons that secured the Deputy's success in Galway? Every Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches is amazed at the idea of the two Deputies from Galway and Wexford getting in here.  It is a source of astonishment to me that the Minister for Education is in a position to say that a policy such as I have outlined is being carried out with the consent of the majority of Deputies, and with the consent of the majority of electors in Wexford and Galway.  If Deputies will turn to page 135 of the September number of the <i>Irish Trade Journal,</i> they will discover that the exports of agricultural produce as <Col N="124" /> between 1929-30 and 1934-35 have fallen by £19,000,000.  There has been a reduction from £31,000,000 to £12,000,000, and the total productivity of agriculture has been reduced from £64,000,000 to £40,000,000.</P>
    <P>Whatever steps may be taken to end that situation, one fact is absolutely certain, and it is present to the mind of every Fianna Fáil Deputy here: that is, that if that situation continues, the whole economic fabric of this country will crumple up; all our social services, the standard of living of the people, and any industrial development we have will collapse if that situation is allowed to continue.  Fully 80 per cent. of the consumers are directly dependent on the prosperity of the agricultural industry.  Beggar them, and you ultimately beggar the whole community.  There is a slow and steady deterioration in the condition of the agricultural industry.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party have tried to shut their eyes to what was evident to everybody else.  They tried to persuade themselves that there was an increasing population on the land, until the census returns showed there was a substantial decrease in the population on the land.  They tried to persuade themselves that their crazy industrial policy and their crazy agricultural policy were providing employment for a large increase in the population, but the census figures showed that, far from there being an increase in the population, there was a substantial decrease. They found that all their activities in respect of both policies had been vain and futile, and, far from having assisted the community, they had materially injured the community since they came into office.</P>
    <P>Does that induce them to mend their hand or alter their course?  Not a bit of it.  They are going to devote our minds for the next six months to weaving spells in a new Constitution&mdash;as if it mattered two hoots to anybody in this country what form the metaphysics which President de Valera is going to expound for the next six months happen to take, what difference it will make in any Irish homestead, what difference it will make to any good <Col N="125" /> Irish nationalist; whether we are going to divide our internal relations from our external relations, horizontally or vertically, nobody in this country but President de Valera cares.  No individual in the Fianna Fáil Party or the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis understands what he is up to, except that, at a given signal from the chairman, they will all stand up and cheer.  And while all that balderdash is going on, and Deputy Moylan is exchanging compliments with President de Valera for the edification of the public at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While that kind of codology is going on, every studious person in this country can see the whole economic fabric of the State withering under the blight of a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;and Fianna Fáil Deputies must see it themselves, too. When will the members of the Fianna Fáil Party have the moral courage to prevail on their own leaders to tell the people the truth and to take such steps as are necessary to put an end to a situation which is leading our people into hopeless disaster?  When will the members of the Fianna Fáil Party honestly evaluate the achievement of having increased the output of wheat and beet by £1,100,000 per annum at a cost of £2,500,000?  When will they come to realise that they are throwing away the substance of our people's prosperity for the advertised folly of subsidised wheat and the inferior folly of subsidised beet sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the proposals that Deputy Bourke put forward will do anything to remedy the situation. I believe that Deputies on the far side of the House understand the situation just as well as we do.  I do not believe that a single one of them has the independence of mind or the moral courage to speak out what he honestly believes.  What has to be done is to persuade the leaders of the Party of the folly of their conduct, and I think it is beginning to dawn on some of <Col N="126" /> them already, but it will take time. They are learning.  They have learned a good deal and they are learning more.  Deputy Tom Kelly used to think that the campaigns of the <i>Irish Press</i> were all inspired by pure-souled honesty until they began to tear off Deputy Tom Kelly's hide and then he began to denounce the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Then they explained that they had to tear off his hide in order to swell their circulation and that he ought not to protest in such a noble cause.  Deputy Tom Kelly is learning, but it is a slow and laborious process to teach him.  Deputy Moylan is learning in another sphere.  I do not know whether he enjoys the experience as much as Deputy Kelly enjoys it.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have come to recognise some outstanding truths since they came in here, after their tempestuous republican ardour was tempered somewhat by the sordid atmosphere of this House.  They will learn that there are more ways of achieving a republic than declaring it, and that you can flirt with it almost indefinitely and get the reputation of being a true-blue republican without ever declaring a republic.  Some day the rest of the Deputies of that Party will realise that you cannot maintain the prosperity or the economic security of this country by flag-wagging or trying to persuade yourself to believe that something is true which is not true.  You cannot build up the prosperity of Irish agriculture on subsidised wheat or beet.  You can only build up the prosperity of Irish agriculture on those crops which can be economically produced and profitably disposed of.  If you cannot make Irish agriculture prosperous, you cannot build up Irish industry or maintain social services.</P>
    <P>Some day the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party will learn that lesson, and when they do it will be a much better thing for this country.  When they do, they will do what we want them to do, they will join with us in making an end of the most imbecile struggle ever started in any country.  They will end the economic war and will not be ashamed to maintain in public cordial relations with Great Britain, <Col N="127" /> which is the best market we have for agricultural produce&mdash;those cordial relations which are, in fact, being maintained every day between every Department of State here and every Department of State in England.  But they are being maintained in a covert, underhand way while we are told here that we are carrying on a war against Great Britain.  We know perfectly well that if we seriously engaged in an economic war with Great Britain for one fortnight this country would be destroyed.  If there was a real genuine cessation of all economic relations between here and Great Britain, a real boycott by us of Great Britain and a real boycott of us by Great Britain, this country would last about a month, if it lasted so long.</P>
    <P>There is no economic war; there never has been an economic war, but there has been an attempt to pay the land annuities which Deputy Haslett has likened to collecting labourers' cottages rents in a Rolls-Royce car.  We are doing that because President de Valera is too conceited to sit in the vehicle in which labourers' cottages rents ought to be collected.  He wants to continue to sit in the Rolls-Royce of his own conceit.  He wants to assert before the people of this country that he is right, and that what he said when he said he was going to withhold the land annuities was right, and will be for ever right, and let the Irish people pay for that indulgence.  He made a mistake when he embarked upon that business.  He has done this country immense injury by his campaign in regard to the land annuities.  He is doing it injury at the present time, and will eventually do it an injury from which it may take years to recover.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I hope the Fianna Fáil Party will come to their senses, will peruse the figures to which I have directed their attention in the current number of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, and then go to President de Valera and tell him it is time a sensible settlement should be made in this dispute with Great Britain, that a reasonable arrangement should be made for the repayment of the bondholders who lent their money for the <Col N="128" /> purchase of Irish land, and that whatever arrangement is arrived at, whatever exchange of money is required to be made between this country and Great Britain, it should be made by cheque and not by the elaborate, costly and cumbrous procedure of levying it by tariffs on the produce of Irish agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has changed the aspect of this debate on this motion which, by the way, he says he considers of no use whatever.  He has invited Deputies of Fianna Fáil to join with them in their policy.  He forgets that when he himself came in here he was not an advocate of that particular policy.  When we first saw Deputy Dillon a few years ago, he was sitting on the centre benches, and since then the policy carried out by Deputy Dillon and his associates on the opposite benches has been proved so foolish that Deputy Belton walked away from them.  He was followed by Deputy Dillon's colleague, Deputy MacDermot, who removed himself also, and then we find outside General O'Duffy removing himself, and lately Mr. Cronin removing himself from their midst.  We wonder if that policy from which those people are removing themselves in disgust can be so wise that we should all adopt it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put that policy to the hardheaded farmers down in County Galway and we had no need to open our lips in that constituency.  Deputy Dillon's speeches there enormously increased our votes, and, as a matter of fact, when the Party organisers went down there and discovered the effect of Deputy Dillon's speeches, he was moved out of the constituency immediately.  Deputy Dillon has quoted figures, but he has completely ignored the change in prices.  He ignored the fact, for instance, that taking the five years previous to 1930 and comparing the prices we got for agricultural produce then and the prices we got in 1930, we find that we got £12,000,000 less in 1930 than we got in 1925.  The then President of the Executive Council merrily handed over the £5,000,000 every year, and when he went over to England in an effort to make any kind <Col N="129" /> of a settlement just previous to the general election, when he went over to ask for a moratorium on a paltry £250,000 on the plea that his people were not able to pay, he was told to go back home and pay up.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot seems to treat this as a matter of bargaining.  This is not a matter of bargaining.  This is a matter of the Irish nation deciding that this money is not due.  The Irish nation reaffirmed that at two successive general elections and have reaffirmed it at two by-elections recently.  If Deputy Dillon and his associates want to have another trial of it, let them go down to the biggest stronghold they think they have, West Cork, let them move the writ for West Cork, and we will see what the hardheaded farmers of that constituency have to say to this policy of surrender. The Government have been elected to carry out their policy, to make whatever negotiations they consider necessary, and I think the people would not appreciate the Government handing that responsibility over to anybody else.  We will take the figures Deputy Dillon has given and examine them.  Let us take the price of butter which he mentioned and compare it with the statement about agricultural wages which Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Minch made.  I wonder what agricultural wages could be paid by the dairy farmers of the Free State for the past three years if they were selling their butter on the English market without any tariff at the price butter was on that market?  In plain language, they would be sending their milk to the creamery at 1½d. a gallon, which is the price the creameries could pay for it, were it not for the Stabilisation of Prices Bill.  If, instead of introducing that Bill, the Government had said to the Irish farmer: &ldquo;We will pay the full tariff on the butter going over,&rdquo; the price of milk at the Irish creameries would be 1½d. a gallon. Deputies know that and Deputy Bennett better than any other Deputy, because he broke away from the Party and voted for the Bill on that occasion.</P>

      <P>The average price of butter on the English market was 70/-a cwt. and any of you who likes can make that up.  Deputy Dillon also spoke of the bacon business.  What is the position in regard to the bacon trade?  I used the figures very frequently in the Galway by-election. What were they?  In the year 1935-36, the Irish farmers exported £2,000,000 worth of bacon more than they exported in 1932, and, in 1932, to feed the Irish people, we imported about £1,500,000 worth of Chinese bacon. That was good enough for the Irish people, according to Fine Gael policy, but at present we are not alone making £2,000,000 more out of our bacon, but we have the home market completely under our control, and the home market was there in its entirety for the Irish farmer because not £1 worth was imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we hear this famous argument about cattle.  If the farmers have not the production this year, we were able to increase prices, and I remember seven or eight years ago when the first slump in the cattle trade came there was very little good in looking for increased prices from Britain, because you could not get them.  You can get them at home&mdash;and if we are ever going to see in this country a fair wage paid to agricultural labour, it will have to be based, in the first instance, on produce for the home market.  It will have to be based on that.  It will have to be based on the farmer getting an economic price for his wheat, his beet, his butter, and everything that he produces and sells on the home market&mdash;not on what he exports.  There are agriculturists here who know that and know it very well. I hope to see, in the very near future, as soon as we bring in our Agricultural Wages Bill and as soon as the boards are set up, a decent wage paid to the agricultural labourer&mdash;a wage that will <Col N="131" /> compare favourably with the wage paid in factories and industrial concerns.  I think they are entitled to it and, as far as I can, I shall see that they will get it.</P>
    <P>This motion has been 12 months or more on the Order Paper, and Deputies seem to have changed their minds lately in regard to the advocacy of it. If we are to take the manner in which it is advocated here to-day, I think that Deputies opposite realise that the country is not with them in this matter. The country is not in favour of the kind of settlement that would be brought about either by Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacDermot.  The people of this country realise that this is not a matter that can be settled by two men sitting round a table and saying, &ldquo;Well, it is not due, but I shall pay you so much.&rdquo;  Why should we?  What is to prevent Britain saying the morning afterwards, &ldquo;Instead of taking £5,000,000 from you, we want £8,000,000 now, and if you don't pay we shall put on tariffs&rdquo;?  There is nothing in the wide world to prevent their doing that. It is my opinion that the so-called economic war would not have been in existence three months if Deputies in the Opposition Party were decently led.  We had cries over there month after month, and week after week, of: &ldquo;Stop it and pay up.&rdquo;  When negotiations were in progress, and when negotiations were spoken of, we had leaders on the Front Bench opposite standing up, one after another, saying, &ldquo;We think you ought to pay first and negotiate afterwards.&rdquo;  We had the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, getting up in this House on the very night that Deputy Norton had gone to see whether a settlement could be arrived at, and saying, &ldquo;Before there are any negotiations, the half-year's annuities now due should be handed over.&rdquo;  That was the kind of assistance you got towards negotiation and settlement.  These are the kind of people, I suppose, that are now going to act on this committee which it is proposed to set up by this motion.  What kind of assistance can you expect from them?  What kind of assistance can you expect from a <Col N="132" /> Deputy who would come into this House, with some sense of responsibility towards his own people, I suppose, and make a suggestion of that type?</P>
    <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all, because the people of this country have shown, on every occasion on which they got an opportunity, that the viewpoint expressed over there is not their viewpoint in regard to this matter, and that they do not believe in the policy of surrender on the part of any Government in this country.  We had the fulminations of Deputy Dillon and his invitation to Deputies over here to join in a policy from which every man who has any bit of sanity left has fled.  Deputy Belton flew away from it.  Deputy MacDermot followed him.  Poor O'Duffy threw off the blue shirt and said good-bye to them, and the other day Cronin left them.  I hope that the leaders of the Opposition will move the writ for West Cork.  I hope they will send Deputy Dillon down there to win that election for them.  If we get Deputy Dillon down there for one fortnight, we shall have such a majority that there will not be one of you will open your lips for 12 months afterwards. That is the position.  It is about time Deputies over there stopped this kind of thing.  After all, if we are going to get Deputies selected for this committee by the chief Opposition Party, and if these Deputies are going to be Deputies like Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in view of the statement Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney made in this House, what can we expect?</P>
    <P>The statements made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, and by ex-Deputy Blythe, were, in my opinion, apart from politics, responsible for preventing any settlement of the economic war.  If the farmers have suffered, these Deputies were responsible for the continuance of that suffering, and for the continuance of the economic war.  I say that no Deputy, with any sense of responsibility, would stand up at the very time that negotiations were being opened and make the statement that before there were any negotiations, half a year's annuities should be offered to Britain.  On the following day, Lord <Col N="133" /> Hailsham, parrot-like, repeated the statement made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before there are any negotiations, you should pay over the half year's annuities that are due.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That kind of balderdash, that kind of attempt to prevent negotiations, is of no use to anybody.  Still, this motion invites this House to set up a committee here that will be composed of Deputies of that type.  You could not expect us, or any sane man, to agree to it.</P>
    <P>Deputies over there, particularly Deputies from rural parts, ought to realise that it is time this thing stopped.  Every time there is any inspiration from the other side, something appearing in the papers to the effect that there are negotiations going on, you have Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacDermot saying: &ldquo;You should stop the economic war and pay up.&rdquo;  It is time that stopped.  The Irish people do not want it.  I say here openly, also, that the greatest blessing that ever came to this country was the economic war, because it made the farmers realise that they would have to turn to the home market and produce for the home market, if they were going to exist in this country, that instead of rearing bullocks they would have to use the plough.  The whole country was being turned into one ranch.  Deputy Bourke used the most extraordinary argument of the lot when he said that the ranchers were losing money, that they were putting more money into the land than they took out of it. Financially, it was out of their own pockets.  I never knew of a rancher to have a philanthropic institution set up, but the ranchers are finding now that the ranches are not paying. The ranches are being divided up and the people are settling down on the land, and if and when there is any settlement of this economic dispute the farmers of this country, I hold, will be ten and 20 times better off than they would be if this dispute had never come, because they are now realising the benefits.  I do not know &mdash;I suppose I am a sceptic&mdash;but I cannot see what this matter comes to when we see the farmers in England <Col N="134" /> producing beet far cheaper than the farmers here.  They are growing beet at 8/- and 9/- a ton less than we are. That is an extraordinary position but, still and all, it is the fact.  In my opinion, nothing whatsoever is going to be served by this motion, and I think that the Deputies who introduced it here would have done far more service to the country if they had wiped the motion off the Order Paper entirely.  So far as Deputy Dillon is concerned, I only hope that he is sent down to contest the vacant seat in West Cork.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Corry, I did not want to intervene in this debate, but as I have on several occasions in this House demanded that a commission of some kind should be set up to investigate the position of the farming industry in this country, I take this opportunity of saying a few words on this motion. One would imagine, from the bright picture painted by Deputy Corry, that everything was going on well in the country, but, on the President's Vote in this House, I put a question to the President and asked him whether he had made any investigations as to the number of young men and women who had left this country to seek work in England in the years that he has been in office.  The President said, at the time, that it would be useless to try to find out that information, that it would not be worth while, and that he would have to go into every townland and village in order to make those investigations. The President talked very lightly about the subject at that time, but now we have the latest census report, and we now find that, while the people on the Government Benches were telling the people of this country that provision had to be made for an increased population of 30,000 each year in this country, the population of this country actually is 6,000 less than it was ten years ago.  Is there not, therefore, some reason for demanding that some kind of an inquiry should be set up to deal with the question of what has become of those 30,000 people, if they were there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the <Col N="135" /> President that I come from the Gaeltacht. I come from the parish of Ballyvourney, and I can show that quite a number of people have left that area.  I should like to say now that I am going to make it my business immediately to find out the actual number of people who have left that parish in the last few years and then I think I might be able to show the President that there was some reason for my question.  I can assure the President that I know of one man who supported the present Government and who, three years ago, said in the presence of my wife at my counter that the country would be all right yet and that, even if we had to go through a little hardship for a year or two, it would all come out right in the end and that our children would get the benefit of the Government's policy; but what is the position now with regard to that man?  His daughter is over in London.  This man's father was able to settle his children comfortably at home as a result of rearing cattle.</P>
    <P>We have been told a lot about the growing of grain, but how is it being grown?  The grain is being grown at the expense of people poorer than those who are growing it.  I had 17 acres of oats myself.  I was able to cut three or four acres with a reaper; the remainder had to be cut with scythes.  It is a miracle that we were able to save any of it at all.  For years I have been engaged in that industry and I say, from my experience, that grain growing in this country is nothing but a gamble and a very poor gamble.  I suggest that the proper policy is the policy of the late Minister for Agriculture when he spoke of another cow, another sow, and another acre of corn.  That is the policy for which the former Minister for Agriculture stood and for which the present Government should stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry talked about the price in the home market being the ruling price, but the present Minister for Agriculture had to admit to me on one occasion in this House that the export price would have to be the ruling price in this country.  I challenge <Col N="136" /> the Government to put the facts before the people and, if they do so, the people will then be in a better position to judge.  I say that around my own area hundreds of people are leaving the country, and I say that if the Minister for Education were to inquire into the facts properly he might be able to solve the problem with regard to this supposed annual increase of 30,000 in our population. The Government, however, have been able to bluff the people.  I am sorry to say that, but I am not one of the people who want the present Government to go out of office.  I think, and I have said before, that it would be a great pity that the present Government should go out of office until the people have had the opportunity of finding out the disastrous results of their policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haslett has referred to the question of feeding stuffs.  That is a very important question, and I say that I stand for one principle in this country, and that is the principle of getting for the people of this country the open market that they had before the present Government came into office.  I say that every farmer should be enabled to live on his own land or else that he should get out of it.  I do not agree with the policy of subsidising the land in Kildare or Wicklow or Leix-Offaly, or any other of such districts, at the expense of the people in the poorer parts of the country, and I am going to stand before the people on that policy at the next election.</P>
    <P>The Government told the people of this country that there was no market for our cattle in England and that they would provide alternative markets. Where are the alternative markets which the Government promised? Then Dr. Ryan, on one occasion, said that anybody who said that the number of cattle should be reduced was either a fool or a knave, because they were wanted to consume our surplus grain. After that, however, he embarked on the slaughter of calves; and then again, within the last six months, he boasted that his Government had sent more cattle to England than had been sent during the régime of President Cosgrave.  That is the kind of hypocrisy <Col N="137" /> we have from the Government Benches, and, unfortunately, I must say, the people of this country are to some extent agreeable to follow out that policy.  However, the people of this country will wake up some day, and the people on the Government Benches will get a rude awakening. Deputy Corry talks about the economic war being a blessing in disguise.  It is a blessing in disguise to Deputy Corry, and probably to some more of us who have £30 a month coming in, but I challenge Deputy Corry to go and live on his own farm without that £30 a month and find out what would be his position.  The Deputy tries to bluff about the split that has occurred in our Party.  Well, at least I can say that we were not the first to have a split.  At least we are not &ldquo;yes men.&rdquo;  My policy is to stick up for what is best for the people of this country and not for what is best either for myself or for my Party.  To hear Deputy Corry and others talk, one would imagine that the members of the Government Party never had a split.  They would not touch this House and would not touch the Treaty 15 years ago.  They are here now, swallowing the Treaty and enjoying the plums of office.  That shows their mentality, and the people in their own time will find out the truth.  I can assure them that that time is coming fast.  Deputy Corry spoke about the land annuities, and tried to justify his Party in connection with the coal-cattle pact.  We heard a lot about secret agreements, but when I put this question to the President: &ldquo;Who signed the coal-cattle pact?&rdquo; he replied that no one had signed it. Fancy that reply coming from the President of the State.  He would not have the guts to stand over it.  It was the most shameful settlement made in any country.  Previous to that the people were told not to burn British coal; now they are compelled to burn British coal.  If the land annuities are not due why was that settlement made? Why did they agree to have so much paid as a levy on each of our cattle? Would it not have been better to have the manliness to say that the cattle would not be sent to Great Britain even if they eat the tails off one <Col N="138" /> another?  As Deputy Dillon said, the agreement was made and the people cannot be bluffed about it.  I do not suppose my words will have very much effect here, but as long as I represent the people of North Cork, or any other constituency, I am going to express my opinion in this House, even if I was the only member left on these benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. S.P. Kelly Mr. S.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the motion because I believe that we have no guarantee of unanimity amongst the members of the committee, or that any decision arrived at would be unanimous. While I would have great patience with arguments used in this House, I believe that the agricultural interests of the nation can best be served and assisted during the economic war by a continuance of the policy of the Government.  A continuance of that policy will bring the economic war to a successful conclusion most expeditiously.  I see no reason for a change in view of the arguments that have been advanced in support of the motion.  In fact, while very little was said about the motion, a great deal was said about matters outside its scope.  I do not say, even if the motion was accepted, that the Government would select Deputy Dillon as one of the representatives of the Opposition on the committee.  Supposing Deputy Dillon was selected, and put forward in committee the arguments he put for ward in the House this evening, how could we imagine any unanimous decision being arrived at?  The Deputy started his speech by reading statistics. During the recess I thought that his customary exaggeration would be toned down somewhat.  I was disillusioned. He quoted statistics, but merely portions that appeared to be favourable to his argument.  When he spoke of the reduction in the production of eggs he did not tell us that the people in this country were eating more eggs.  When he spoke of bacon he did not tell us that the people were consuming more bacon and that there were no imports of bacon.  When using statistics to prove one side of an argument it is advisable, at all times, to quote statistics affecting the other side, so as to be able to convince them.  The fact is <Col N="139" /> that we are consuming more of our own produce and importing less.  We had an acknowledgment from Deputy Dillon that there has been an increase representing £460,000 in the production of beet and of £600,000 in the production of wheat.  Yet he asks us to scrap both the wheat policy and the beet policy. As a result of the by-elections he appears to have changed his attitude. He went so far as to say how amazed he was at the result of the recent Galway and Wexford by-elections.  It is evident that Deputy Dillon was staggered by the result of these elections. Deputy Dillon must know that his Party were foolish when they relied upon onesided statistics.  They tried to prove to the electors of Galway and Wexford that their statistics were correct. Deputies on these benches went down to these constituencies and told the people what the Government policy was.  It was not necessary to quote statistics.  It was merely necessary to remind them of what had been done. We know the result.  Deputy Dillon would appear to have been out of Ireland during the by-elections or as if he had not heard the results.</P>

      <P>It might have been advisable if he went before the elections.  I noticed that the Deputy's quotations from various sources to-day were not as numerous as on previous occasions.  We had quotations about a decrease as revealed by the census figures in the population of the country.  Was it not reasonable to expect that there would be a decrease in the population when it is realised that the period covered included portion during which Cumann na nGaed-heal was in office?  We all know that the population was decreasing from 1926, and that it continued to decrease until 1932 when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office. Deputy Dillon may rest assured that when the next census returns are published there will be a changed situation, and that it will be found we have a much larger population, for which the present Government is providing. <Col N="140" /> So little was said about the motion by previous speakers that it is not easy to deal with it now.  The mover appeared to glorify the ranching system, and spoke as if he were anxious to see that system reintroduced, and to have a reversal of the present system.  He told us of the good old graziers and said that ranching should not be spoken of as being &ldquo;played out.&rdquo;  He told us what good ratepayers these ranchers were, and mentioned that they gave employment, not to one man and a dog as was generally understood, but to grooms, gardeners, coachmen, and chauffeurs. Well now, that may be so.  It is quite possible, but let me tell the mover of the motion that we, at any rate, are not satisfied with the amount of employment given on the land which these people hold.  If the ranchers and the graziers were such an important section of the community as the mover of the motion would seem to suggest, why had we the destitution that existed in the countryside; why had we so much unemployment, and why was the population of the country going down?</P>
      <P>The mover of the motion referred to the Meath grazier who used to go over to the West of Ireland and purchase three and four-year-old cattle at £7 and £8 a head, and afterwards sell them at £17 and £18 a head.  It was quite profitable for the grazier to do that, but it was most unprofitable for the people who were unhappy enough to have to try to eke out an existence in that part of the country where this grazing system was being carried on.  I happen to be one of the representatives of a county that was a grazing county.  We are trying to change the system that was in operation there.  We will change it, and I would be sorry to see any motion accepted by the Government that would interrupt the progress of its land settlement policy.  We have no intention of changing that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grazier did not lose as a result of the economic war.  He was clever enough to pass on his losses to the small farmers.  Not only did he do that, but he passed on part of his losses to the agricultural workers. Graziers who had a number of workers <Col N="141" /> employed dismissed half of them. More of them reduced the wages of their workmen.  When I hear members on the Opposition Benches lamenting the fact that workers' wages were low, I cannot help recalling that, when this Government came into power, the unfortunate workers had their wages slashed because they had the hardihood to vote for the Fianna Fáil Government.  In spite of that we find members on the Opposition Benches coming along and shedding crocodile tears about the workers' wages.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Bourke believes that there is no ranching in the country, I would ask him to come down and spend a week-end in my constituency.  If he does that I think I will be able to convince him that it would not be a wise policy to revert to the ranching system as we knew it.  We cannot tolerate a continuation of grazierdom, especially in the county that I represent. If we were to do so, Deputies can visualise what it would mean.  It would mean preventing the workman from getting grass for his cow and an adequate supply of milk for the children he is trying to rear.  It would also result in throwing more workers on the unemployment market.  In addition, farms would be left neglected. There would be no drainage work and none of the ordinary work of the tillage farm carried out.  The land would be simply growing weeds.  It is only by pursuing a system of mixed farming which will give us less store cattle and more fat cattle that we can bring about any improvement in our agricultural conditions.  The motion proposes the setting up of a committee to consider the question with which it deals.  We have in this House 153 Deputies sent here by the people.  I think that the Deputies sitting here constitute a much better committee than that outlined in the motion. Deputy Bourke was honest enough to admit that conditions are improving. Deputy Dillon, of course, would not admit that.  We, on these benches, are optimistic enough to believe that conditions through the country will continue to improve as they have been during the past couple of years.  That improvement has come about despite <Col N="142" /> the pessimism that prevails amongst members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on this motion I have observed that the Deputies opposite made no suggestion as to how to end the economic war. The only suggestion that they have ever made in that direction&mdash;it was not made this evening&mdash;was that we should surrender our position.  They said that we had set our heels in the ground and would not budge.  We know what the answer of the people has been to that charge.  The people have given us a mandate not to surrender our position.  We will not do so, and are prepared to go ahead. We made an offer of arbitration to England, but the people on the other side would not consent to the setting up of a court in which we might expect to get a fair hearing.  Deputy MacDermot, of course, is anxious that we should make a compromise and pay less.  We are not prepared to pay less because we are acting on the principle that the moneys involved are not due.  If we were to do as the Deputy suggests we would be unfaithful to the mandate that the people gave us to carry out.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government are not accepting this motion.  The only method at our disposal at the moment is to continue the policy that we have put into operation.  If the members of the Opposition would speak the truth and examine this matter as the mover of the motion has done&mdash;he was honest enough to say that conditions are improving&mdash;and if they would admit how conditions have improved since this Government came into office, I think it would help them to make up their minds to support the Government in carrying out their present policy until such time as we reach the stage when the economic war will not trouble us any more.</P>

      <P>After listening to some of the speeches made on this motion, I am convinced that no real effort is being made by the Government to bring about a settlement of the economic war.  We have been for more than four years waiting for a settlement of this dispute.  The farmers in the country have suffered a good deal during that period.  Some Deputies <Col N="143" /> expressed the view that a system of mixed farming is the most suitable one for the country.  Other members of the House expressed different opinions as to the method of farming that should be carried out during the economic dispute.  They seemed to favour the view that farmers should go in more for the growing of beet and wheat.  I agree with the growing of beet and wheat up to a point.  But there is a limit to the acreage of beet and wheat that can be usefully grown during the continuance of a dispute of this kind, or indeed at any other time.  The one point that is before the mind of every farmer and that is kept clearly before his mind is the destruction of the live-stock branch of his industry.</P>

      <P>The dispute has now been four years in existence.  During all that period we have heard nothing whatever from the Government Front Benches or any member of the Government indicating what they have done to bring about a settlement.  We have waited very patiently, but at no time was any statement made with regard to a settlement.  We expect a little more than that from the Government. What we have suffered during the last four or five years is not a matter that can be looked upon lightly.  We cannot continue to live under the conditions which have applied during the last four years.  According to Deputy Corry the economic dispute was a blessing for this country; it was a blessing for the farmers, and they will be very much better off after it.  I cannot see eye to eye with Deputy Corry in that regard.  I know plenty of farmers who were in a good financial position before this economic dispute, and I know them to be very poor people at the moment.  If the Government were really interested in the agricultural community of this country they have had, during the economic dispute, plenty of opportunities of giving relief to the farmers in other ways.  We have asked them for relief on several occasions.  Not <Col N="144" /> only is the British Government collecting the full amount of money which they say is due to them, but we have our own Government here collecting a further land annuity, with the result that we are called upon to pay twice as much, and more than twice as much, in respect of land annuities as we were paying in the past.  That is obviously unjust.</P>
      <P>We do not want to force the Government to make a bad settlement in this dispute, but we have never been asked to help in the making of a settlement, and neither have they told us what they have done in that regard.  Now, after four or five years, the matter is apparently in the same position as it was at the beginning, and it looks as if the dispute is going to go on indefinitely. If it is going to go on indefinitely, without any effort to bring about a settlement, then the sooner we are told that the better.  The subsidies given to the farmers are only a very small matter in comparison with the losses which they have incurred through this dispute.  To my mind a settlement will have to be made before there is any sort of prosperity amongst the farming community of this country. If the Government leaves the matter in its present position they are going to bring more poverty to the farmers, more hard work and poorer returns for what they do.  The longer the dispute, the poorer the farmers will become, and the sooner the Government makes an attempt to bring about a settlement the better for the country, the better for the Government, and the better for the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this motion because I think it is one of the most important motions brought before this House for a long time.  It embodies a spirit of co-operation, and it would be a very good thing if both sides of this House co-operated in an effort to bring about the general welfare of the country, not only on this but on many questions. It is not the first time I have voiced that view, not only here but in the country.  In regard to the first part of this motion, which refers to a continuation of &ldquo;the economic war,&rdquo; I do not know whether I can <Col N="145" /> support that point.  If there was any justification for calling it an economic war that justification passed at the time of the coal-cattle pact, or the coal-cattle surrender, or whatever you like to call it.  There is at the present time no justification for referring to this dispute as an economic war, because we are taking no measures against what are supposed to be the enemy.  It is no economic war; there is no pretence at an economic war.  It is time we got down to commonsense, and put an end to this dispute, before it ends the people engaged in agriculture, who are the backbone of this country.</P>
      <P>We have heard the same old argument over and over again from the speakers on the Fianna Fáil side. Deputy Corry told us, just as he told us a hundred times before&mdash;the one argument answers everything&mdash;that the people of Galway and Wexford decided this matter once and for all.  They returned two Fianna Fáil candidates, and Deputy Corry claims that that is a decision in favour of a continuation of the economic war.  Deputy Kelly also said that they had got a mandate to carry on the economic war.  I entirely disagree with him.  The mandate they got in those places was to make the good settlement which the President promised in Galway, and which the Vice-President talked about. That was the mandate they got.  In the 1933 Election they made a similar promise in a vague way.  If they were only returned what a fine settlement that would get! That fine settlement has not come to pass, but whenever a by-election turned up they went back to the people and told them: &ldquo;Now is the critical moment; negotiations are on; give us a chance, and a good settlement will be brought about.&rdquo;  That is the mandate that that Party got at the general election, at the Galway Election, and at the Wexford Election, so neither the Galway nor the Wexford nor the Dublin municipal election proves too much.  When all is considered, if any mandate was given it was to make the good settlement that was promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry also told us that so many members of this Party had left <Col N="146" /> because of the policy of this Party in regard to the economic war.  One of the Deputies who left us was the seconder of this motion, so there is no disagreement in regard to the question of policy on this matter.  More than once General O'Duffy has spoken in favour of this particular motion. Deputy Belton's name is down to this motion, so that there is no difference in policy, and the points made by Deputy Corry were really in favour of the motion rather than against it.  I do not think I need stress that any further.</P>
    <P>Then he told us about the position for the five years from 1925 to 1930, and said that the depression since 1930 has been only a continuation of the previous five years' depression. The depression has become progressively worse for the last five years. He forgot to tell us that during that time the agricultural conditions in every country in the world had improved.  Up to 1930-31 the depression was felt in Great Britain and all the Commonwealth countries, but there is a very noticeable and remarkable improvement in trade in all the countries, with the exception of the Free State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a good agricultural show you had in Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  We always have good agricultural shows in Cavan. The people of Cavan are industrious and make a success of their industry if they only get a chance.  The Fianna Fáil Party are making it impossible for them to get a living out of their industry.  I think there is no one will agree sooner than Deputy Donnelly that the people there are industrious and should get a chance to make an honest, decent living out of their industry because they are entitled to it.  Before I finish I shall give Deputy Donnelly some instances of the chance they are getting, so let him be patient. Deputy Corry also told us about the price of milk and the increase in the exports of bacon.  I can tell Deputy Corry and Deputy Donnelly a little more about these things than, perhaps, they know, or wish to acknowledge if they do know.  The price of milk in the Free State during the summer six <Col N="147" /> months, when the bulk of the milk is to be sold by the farmers, is on an average less than 4d. per gallon.  Deputy Donnelly knows that I live in a Border county and people in the other part of the parish in which I live, who are on the other side of the Border, are getting 5d. per gallon for their milk, and the consumers there can buy butter 6d. per lb. cheaper than in the Free State. That is one of the fruits of the economic war.  They are bitter fruits for the poor people who are paying 6d. per lb. more for butter than on the other side of the Border and for the farmers who are getting 1d. or 1½d. less per gallon for the milk.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry tells us that there is an increase of £2,000,000 in the export value of our bacon.  I do not know whether the figures are correct, but I am not going to question them.  I should like to ask any reasonable Deputy on that side of the House what are the conditions under which that bacon is being produced.  I say that the farmers are producing this extra bacon under slave conditions.  It is done out of sheer necessity.  They are actually working as slaves.  I will give you an instance.  In County Fermanagh they are getting 5/- more per cwt. for bacon pigs than we are getting in Cavan.  They are buying feeding stuffs at 13/6 per bag, whereas we are paying 18/-.  It cannot be said that the farmers in Cavan are big ranchers. On an average, they are only feeding from two to six pigs.  It will be admitted that they are industrious, small farmers who are entitled to get a chance to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly knows that they have to import a good deal of the feeding stuffs from other counties or somewhere else in order to augment their limited home supplies, because it is not a county where tillage is a paying proposition, or where tillage can be carried on on a large scale.  Therefore, they have to buy a good deal of their feeding stuffs and they have to pay the difference between 13/6 and 18/-, or 4/6 per bag.  They have to sell their bacon at 5/- per cwt. less <Col N="148" /> than in Northern Ireland and they have to buy their bacon at 2d. per lb. more.  I challenge contradiction of these statements.  That is what the Cavan farmers are getting from the milk and bacon policy that Fianna Fáil boasts of.  Their position as compared with the people on the other side of the Border is so much worse that it makes it impossible for them to carry on under anything like decent conditions. They are in the position of slaves.  They have to produce something and they have to produce it at a loss and try to live under conditions that are almost impossible.  The policy that Fianna Fáil boasts about is detrimental to the interests of these small farmers.  What is the position with regard to cattle?  I do not want to go into that, because it has been too often discussed and has been dealt with by other Deputies.  I only want merely to answer the points made by Fianna Fáil speakers.</P>
    <P>We were also told about the home market.  I think there is nobody in this House so devoid of intelligence as not to be aware that the home market is only capable of consuming about half or less than half of the agricultural produce produced here.  Nobody will question that statement.  They know, on the other hand, that the exportable surplus will rule the price of all that is consumed at home and abroad, except what is artificially raised in price, such as butter, by taxing the unfortunate poor people who have to buy butter, at 6d. per lb. extra, or something like that.  That is pretty hard, not only on the agricultural community, but on the labourers and others.  It may be contended that they are getting better wages in some industries.  The cost of living has so much increased that their wages are of very little use to them.  Therefore, all Parties, even the Fianna Fáil Party, are suffering as a result of this economic war, and there is no use in pretending otherwise.  Even the President has 100 times admitted that they are suffering.  What is the use of denying what the President has admitted? Everybody knows that all Parties in this country are suffering by this <Col N="149" /> foolish economic war.  Can anyone stand up in this House and justify the continuance of this economic war in face of the coal-cattle pact, which implies that there is no war, economic or military?  It is about time that the people should face up to reality, and take the hint that is now given. There is an opportunity to co-operate given to all Parties in this House by this motion to co-operate, and no blame will attach to any Party because of the settlement carried out if this motion is adopted. For that reason, from whatever point of view this motion is examined, it is one that would be a very good thing for the country if it were accepted.  It would bring all Parties together.  It would be a good stroke of work for the country; it would give confidence to the people who are disgusted at this Party squabble going on from year to year, a squabble that is reducing the country, and especially the farming community, to a deplorable condition. Deputy Kelly has made one point.  I understood him to say that he understood that a committee of the whole House should be preferable to the committee suggested in this motion.  I would be inclined to agree with him. Is that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Are they prepared to take the whole House into their confidence and not deal with this matter as a Party question, and to do what is best for the country as a whole?  It would be a good thing if this were done.  This economic war cannot continue as things are, and sooner or later it must be settled if it is not to go on for ever. If it is going to be settled, I do not see any better means of reaching that settlement than by getting all Parties to co-operate.  If it is not going to be settled, what was the meaning of the promise thrown out at Galway and Wexford?</P>

It helps them to redeem their promises, to restore themselves, and to give the people a continuance of the confidence they placed in them, because they are now on their last trial.</P>

      <P>I have been in a sort of maze for the last hour or two, wondering if I were at the Wailing Wall at Jerusalem or at a sitting of Dáil Eireann.  Judging by the lamentations we have heard for the last hour, I might be forgiven if I thought I was at the Wailing Wall at Jerusalem and not here in Dáil Eireann.  However, I shook myself together so as to deal with the very vague arguments that have been put up by the Opposition. This motion reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a committee consisting of 11 Deputies be set up to make recommendations...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then follow the recommendations that are to be made by them.  No one in the House has spoken to that motion or advocated it very strongly.  But they are taking advantage of it to make the usual attack by their wordy platitudes on the Government.  We had a rehearsal of the whole economic war over and over again.  There is no reality in this motion.  The proposer is an expert politician and he thought it necessary to put it forward.  How can one deal with a spongy thing like this which one cannot grasp?  It is impossible.  In the first place, how is any Government worthy of the name going to delegate its powers to any committee composed of the whole House?  We are here elected as a Government, and I think I reflect the feeling of the Government so far as the back benchers are concerned, when I say that this Government cannot do any such thing as is set out in the motion.  Allusions have been made to the recent elections in Galway and Wexford.  I do not propose to rub it in.  Results speak louder than words. In Wexford there was no promise given except a promise by the triumphant Deputy that the economic war would be won.  We went before the electors, put the issue before them clearly with nothing extenuated and nothing set down in malice.  There was nothing <Col N="151" /> vague about our majority in any way. I know that Deputy Dillon was present during that election, but Deputy Dillon was not able to mislead the Wexford electors.  As a matter of fact, I think that, as has already been said, Deputy Dillon was the greatest possible assistance to us on the few occasions on which he attempted to speak.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Holohan speaking this evening and he spoke in a very moderate way.  I rather felt for him and for the sentiments he expressed. But I was rather amazed to see that he believes in the policy of wheat and beet.  After all, the voice of some Deputies opposite is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau. I do not see how Deputy Holohan can approve of wheat and beet when his nominal leader&mdash;or shall we say one of them?, because the Party opposite change their leaders as often as they change their shirts&mdash;denounces the policy of beet and wheat on every possible occasion.  It is beyond me how Deputy Holohan can approve of that policy when his leader is foremost in denouncing it, or is there going to be another split, and is the Party again in a fissiparous state?  If that occurs may I be there to see.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGovern has animadverted loud and long as to the prices of live stock&mdash;of cattle and pigs.  I did not hear the Deputy advert to the time in the latter days of the Cosgrave régime when fat pigs were 26/- a cwt and when bonhams were sold at from 5/- to 3/6. I wonder was that a result of the economic war?  At the present time fat pigs are making 41/- to 42/- and bonhams from 20/- upwards.  After all, if the scales are to be loaded let them be loaded equally.  Deputies on the Opposition Benches can quote facts, but they are very careful to quote what suits their own book while, at the same time, omitting anything which would count in their opponents' favour.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything depressing about the present situation except the arguments of the Opposition Benches.  There has been a gloom over those benches in the last few hours which would not be equalled by the pea soup fog which envelops <Col N="152" /> London at times.  But the fact remains that there was not a quorum in the House to listen to them and the bell had to be rung to bring in the necessary number to form a quorum.  That is what happens amongst their own Deputies in this House when a remedy for the economic war is being promulgated from the Fine Gael back benches. Well so much for the economic war which is masked behind a proposal like this.  I am sure the proposer has good intentions.  I give him credit for his good intentions but at the same time I would remind him of the paving stones below.  With the best intentions in the world the Deputy has brought in this motion as a stick with which to beat the Government.  He did not bring it in with any idea that it would be accepted.  It is simply prostituting politics to bring in such a motion here.  We have heard about depression in the country.  No doubt there would have been depression in the country were it not for the determined attitude this Government took up four years ago.  They foresaw what was coming and they knew what would happen as a result of our efforts to break away from Britain economically, financially and otherwise.  I have spoken to farmers and all the farmers are not of one mentality.  They are not all wailing.  I have spoken to farmers who recognise that they have lost a little but they are facing the future with confidence, and, as they say, they are facing it in a good cause.  They have expressed themselves in no uncertain fashion.  The last two elections have shown that the people are behind this Government and that they are satisfied that this Government will do what is best for the country.  The Government are not prepared to delegate action on the economic war to a Committee of this House.  They are prepared to leave it in the hands of responsible leaders who may be relied upon to see it through to the bitter end.  The temperament of the Irishman is such that the merest hint of compulsion is sufficient to make him stiffen his back. If the English people thought that by the agitation which, I am sorry to say, has been initiated and carried on <Col N="153" /> by people who should know better&mdash; our own fellow-countrymen on the opposite benches&mdash;the confidence of the Irish people in their leaders would be weakened, the results have proven that they are very far wrong.  The speeches of some of those on the opposite benches &mdash; Deputy Holohan and others&mdash;have been thoughtful, if a shade pathetic.  For the speech of a gentleman like Deputy Dillon, no words could be too strong.  I do not propose to comment upon it save to say that he gave us a convincing example of how to be offensive without being convincing.  In that role he is a master hand.  He seems to speak as if he were at variance with his colleagues.  Sometimes they pull him by the coat-tail to prevent him from committing himself.  He is against beet, wheat and tobacco growing. Apparently, some of his colleagues are not against these forms of activity.  Whom are we to believe? It is difficult to deal with an Opposition which is neither coherent nor cohesive.</P>
    <P>Cattle are on the up-grade.  For sheep there is a fair price.  If there has been a drop in live stock, it has been made up by subsidies on wheat, beet and butter.  One would imagine, listening to our opponents, that this is the only country in the world in which subsidies are given.  The motherland across the seas, to which they look eagerly for succour and with whom they wish to be united for aye, indulges in subsidies.  They subsidise wheat and beet.  They have pig and bacon boards &mdash; sufficient boards to make a coffin for the mummified skeleton of Fine Gael.  Are we the only nation to subsidise our own products in order that our own people may live their own lives?  The thing is so nauseating that one literally reels at the prospect of answering these interminable arguments.  There is no reality behind this motion and I regret its introduction.  The brains which must exist in Fine Gael, despite every evidence to the contrary, would be better employed in dealing with something more substantial than a merely destructive motion like this which, I trust, will meet with the <Col N="154" /> ignominious reception which it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of this motion.  The last speaker said that the Government should not delegate the power of settling this dispute to any committee set up by this House.  I am sure the proposer and seconder of this motion would gladly leave the power of settling the economic war to the people responsible for it.  The Deputy also said that they never promised the people that they were going to settle the economic war.  If I remember aright they, before the last general election, promised the people that, if returned to power, they would bring the economic war to a successful conclusion.  They have failed to do that, as they have failed to keep many promises which they gave to the people on that occasion.  We all know that the economic war is the cause of all the misfortune and misery that exist in this country at present.  No matter how Deputies on the opposite side may talk about the prosperity of the country and assert that the farmers are well off, they know in their hearts that the farmers are not well off and that no section of the people for the past three years has been well off.  They know that the farmers were never in a worse position than they are at present&mdash;all due to the economic war.  That is the case despite the growing of wheat and beet, with which I agree.  I grow both of them.  The people whom I represent&mdash;the farmers of North Cork &mdash;are working, tillage farmers.  They have been growing wheat and beet since this Government started their campaign.  It is the supporters of this Party who are mainly responsible for keeping the factory in Mallow going.  That is well known to the members of the Government Party representing that area.  Despite the growing of wheat and beet and the money which, we are told, the farmers are making out of it, why is it that this year the amount of rates uncollected by the Cork County Council is greater than it was two, three or four years ago?  Why is it that the amount has increased every year for the past four years and that this year the <Col N="155" /> amount is greater still?  If the farmers are so well off in County Cork, why does that state of affairs with regard to the collection of rates obtain?</P>
      <P>Why is it the farmers are not able to pay?  It is not the farmers only who are hit by this economic war. There was a motion on the Order Paper by members of the Labour Party which sought to have an agricultural wages board set up.  The Government are now bringing in a Bill to regulate the wages of the agricultural workers.  That Bill was asked for by a Party who, for the past four years, have been supporting the Government responsible for the miserable position of the farmers and farm workers.  The people depending on agriculture&mdash;farmers and workers &mdash;were never in such a plight as they are at the present time.  The Government say they have subsidised the growing of wheat and the growing of beet and tobacco.  Who is paying the subsidy?  The unfortunate agricultural and other workers are paying more for their sugar and their flour. The Deputy who spoke last referred to the price of bacon.  He said that the price was 26/- a cwt. when Deputy Cosgrave was in power and that it was now 42/-.  That is so, but does the Deputy know how much the unfortunate workers of the country have to pay for this bacon across the counter?  When they go into a shop to buy a pound of bacon, how much do they pay?</P>

      <P>Yes, &ldquo;says you.&rdquo;  You spent too much of your time in the Holy Land while you were talking.  I hold that the miserable position of the farmers, the farm labourers, and all dependent on agriculture, is due to the economic war.  During the past two years we have seen young men and women leaving the country, train-loads of them, and going over to Great Britain, to John Bull, to earn a livelihood. We heard a lot of talk from the present Government Party about emigration when we on this side of the House were in office.  We heard about all the people going away to America. They went to America then, and they were able to make a living.  They are going to London now, and we can see from the reports of different Catholic organisations where young Irishmen go over in the hope of getting jobs.  There are no jobs to be got, and what is to become of them?  It is the same with the young girls.  I know of several cases, and it would be better for them if the boat went down.  All that is due to the policy of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be no occasion for young men or women to leave this country to go over to John Bull in order to earn a living if we had not to contend with this economic war.  In other days there was a living to be made on the land.  There was a good livelihood to be made there before ever we heard about beet and wheat.  The farmers and their sons and daughters made a living, and were able to marry into farms, but they are not able to do that now, despite the intensive tillage campaign. We are not opposed to the tillage campaign.  The people I represent always till their land.  Indeed, the people in my area who did not till their <Col N="157" /> land gave far more employment than the people who tilled it, and far better employment.  What do you call employment on the land?  I would like to see some of you in a beet field during the last fortnight.  You know nothing about it.  It is not employment; it is slavery.</P>

      <P>They say, &ldquo;The people told us not to surrender.&rdquo;  No one wants the Government to surrender, but when the Government started this war it is their duty to bring it to a conclusion, and not to have the people paying the piper.  They have paid the piper for almost five years, and there is no sign of this war coming to an end. We read about the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis for the past two years, but there was nothing there about the economic war.  We only heard about a new Constitution, something about the head of the State.  The farmers and workers are not much concerned about the head of the State; they are more concerned about their bread and butter. If this economic war is not soon brought to a conclusion, I do not know what will become of the farmers and workers.</P>

      <P>In view of the attitude taken up by the Minister, I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much in winding up the debate.  I am rather disappointed that the Minister did not see his way to accept this proposal or otherwise suggest some alternative, or give the House some inkling that he had in view some other method of settling this dispute.  I listened to most of the debate, and I must confess I did not hear any very constructive criticism from the Government Benches.  Deputy Kelly devoted much of his time to twisting my remarks and trying to give the impression that I was advocating a return to ranching.  I took some pains to point out that the Government, instead of succeeding in what was apparently their policy of carrying on this war at the expense of the larger farmers, ultimately passed the pressure from the larger farmers to the smaller farmers and to the farm labourers.  The Deputy admitted that afterwards in a <Col N="158" /> roundabout way.  I want to clear away the impression that he left on my mind, and, I expect, on the minds of other Deputies, that I was advocating a return to ranching.  I did mention the fact that many of those people gave good employment in the old days, and we must take into consideration the good those people did as well as the harm they did.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Government will not give us an assurance that something will be done to remedy existing conditions. Apparently the Government do not realise the very serious condition of the agricultural industry.  Deputy Daly gave us a very clear idea of what the position is.  He is a working farmer and the condition he describes apply to every class of farmer.  I am not opposed to wheat or beet growing.  I believe that, in moderation, it is quite a good policy.  At the same time I do not hold that it is a substitute for the rearing and the export of live stock. I believe that until we bring about a state of affairs when we will have our normal markets once more, there will be little chance of putting that industry on its feet.  The Government are about to enact legislation to improve the conditions of agricultural labourers.  They ought to realise how futile is the introduction of such a measure as long as the agricultural industry is in its present state.  Unless there is some improvement in the very near future, such a measure as that must inevitably lead to further unemployment instead of improving the condition of the labourers.  If conditions continue deteriorating, I am afraid it will be impossible soon to get anybody to work the land in Ireland.  I am sorry that this motion has not been accepted or has not got us further on the road, but at all events it has cleared the air somewhat.  We now realise that Fianna Fáil are not interested in the position of agriculture in spite of their promises, and that no effort is going to be made to settle the economic war.</P>

      <Col N="159" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that local authorities in towns and cities should be empowered by legislation to supplement their revenue by levying a rate upon moneys received by ground landlords in respect of ground rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the long time that this motion is on the Order Paper, it might be well to give a little explanation of it to the House.  On 3rd April last, I rose to wind up the debate on this motion and I had not concluded my reply when the House rose.  In the course of my reply on that occasion, I reiterated that in this motion there was no attempt or no suggestion made to confiscate the property of any ground landlord.  The Minister challenged that in a variety of ways when replying, I take it, on behalf of the Government.  I think I made it clear also to the Minister that I had not at that time, or up to that time, attended any of these meetings called under the aegis of leaseholders associations and was in no way associated with them.  My attitude in relation to these associations was governed by at least one guiding principle. I felt at that time that the organisation which was in existence was not proceeding on constitutional lines.  Since then, however, the National Leaseholders' Association has been established, which organisation does propose to proceed along constitutional lines to achieve its aims and objects.  Since that time I attended a meeting of this National Leaseholders' Association, and present at that meeting and approving of its objects was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, a T.D. representing East Cork, Deputy Corry, to wit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate here, Deputy Norton found himself in agreement to some extent with me, but he felt that &ldquo;the ultimate solution of the problem in respect to ground rents will be found in making the local authority the ground landlord so far as that is possible.&rdquo;  Further on in his remarks, he said he was in agreement with the motion so far as it would enable a local <Col N="160" /> authority to recover for the community the enhanced value of land which is due to the efforts of the community.  That is the essence of the argument I made in favour of levying a rate upon moneys received by ground landlords in respect of ground rents.  I think I have already met Deputy Belton's point in relation to ground rents owned by corporations or public bodies.  He mentioned particularly the case of the Dublin Corporation, pointing out that ground rents were a source of very great revenue to that body.  I think I pointed out on the last occasion, on the 3rd April last, that this motion would have no effect whatever on corporations of that character owning ground rents because I feel, as everybody else, including the Minister, must, that any revenues derived from ground rents by the Dublin Corporation or any other municipal body would filter through in the direction of improved social services, housing, etc.  However, the Minister for Finance, in a very carefully prepared statement, which, I presume, or rather understand, was prepared for him by the Revenue Commissioners, did not put up any reasonable or reasoned argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it.  The Minister in his speech never attempted for one moment to examine the problem in the light of present day affairs and events.  In reply to a question I put to him a couple of years ago, the Minister told me he was unable to estimate the amount of money paid in respect of ground-rents in this country. I accepted that, and we have had from the Minister himself, speaking at the Ard-Fheis yesterday, that this was a very complex question.  I even suggested that in my opening speech and because of the feeling that my motion was not quite comprehensive enough, I suggested to the Minister that it would ease the public mind and would give a good deal of satisfaction to a number of persons who are interested in this matter if an inquiry were made.  I even went so far as to say I agreed with the Minister when he said at the Ard-Fheis 12 months ago that a prolonged inquiry would be necessary and I was taken to task by Deputy Norton because I did go so far with the Minister. In fact, Deputy Norton in quite a good-humoured way said he was glad to see the Minister and I were becoming so closely associated in matters of that kind.  That was rather humorous and ironical on Deputy Norton's part because he knows it would be a case of the lion lying down with the lamb. I am not, of course, going to say who was the lion and who was the lamb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister concerned himself more with cheap jokes, flippancies and sneers at the persons who form the minority in this country&mdash;the ex-Unionists and others.  It is about time the Minister <Col N="162" /> seriously discussed matters of this character and reserved his cheap sneers for the hustings and the soapboxes at the general elections.  In volume 61, column 1030, the Minister was very complimentary about me.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy who admitted that he himself had given the subject no serious study&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;words I never used&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;made himself responsible for many wild and sweeping statements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thereupon asked &ldquo;Did the Deputy use those words?&rdquo; and the Minister replied</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Wild and sweeping statements calculated only to mislead the public, to increase unrest, and to dislocate, if he could, the whole economic sphere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask members of all Parties in this House carefully to examine the record of the gentleman who makes this statement.  The Minister and his Party are the people who swept into office because of, to use his own words again, wild and sweeping statements. Then we have the Minister rebuking Sin, telling us that we should not make wild and sweeping statements, and, when challenged about it, he was unable to name even one of them. Through the whole course of my speech, I never made any kind of wild assertion or statement.  In fact, I was quite moderate which, I suppose, the Minister will say was rather unusual for me.</P>
    <P>The Minister also asked, as reported in column 1031:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What would be the effect of this additional tax except to confiscate some portion of the value that is inherent in such property?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, as he asked me, to be honest with the House in matters of this kind.  I would ask him to amplify his assertion in that direction. I should like him to ask how he regards the effect of income-tax, not to mention other taxes, <Col N="163" /> such things as levies on cattle and other levies imposed by the Government on the agricultural industry. Does he regard these levies as confiscation of some portion of the value that is inherent in such property?  Was it confiscation on the Minister's part to make the owners of property liable for income-tax on five-fourths of their valuation?  Is not that tax confiscation of some portion of the value that is inherent in such property, again to use his own words?  Again, the Minister stated that the term &ldquo;ground-rent&rdquo; is not at present sufficiently understood. He went on to talk about head-rents and ground-rents, leading us to believe that there appears to be a good deal of confusion in the public mind as to what is and what is not a head-rent, or what is or is not a ground-rent; but the only thing the Minister succeeded in doing was to complicate matters still further&mdash; because everybody who knows anything about the subject, or who has given any serious thought, as the Minister is so fond of saying, to it, must know that the law will enforce payment of the head-rent or ground-rent and the majority of the people who are paying ground-rents or head-rents are very well aware that the law will enforce their collection.</P>
    <P>The Minister, quite unintentionally I am sure, made the very best case he could for this motion.  He must know that many members of his own organisation who have attended those meetings which I have mentioned have gone much further than I have in this motion.  They have advocated the abolition and the confiscation of these ground-rents.  I do not.  There is all the difference between this motion and the motions which have been proposed from time to time at the Ard-Fheis of the organisation of which the Minister is one of the principal members.  All that we ask for in this motion is that some of the value created by the community should find its way back to the community.  We all know that even a new railway service, a bus service, or some other such amenity will increase the value of land in the neighbourhood. We all know that if an enterprising <Col N="164" /> local authority gives the very best sewerage system or the very best lighting system that, it can possibly afford, such a service enhances the value of land in that particular neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>Again I would put it to the Minister, in the most friendly way possible and in the best interests of the country at the moment, that he might cause an inquiry to be made even though it may be a prolonged inquiry, and so satisfy himself and the people who at present cannot estimate accurately the amount of these ground-rents.  Let us take the statement made yesterday at the Ard-Fheis. There it was stated that £20,000,000 annually was not collected but was leaving the country.  My estimate was very conservative when I said that in or about £1,000,000 was leaving the country.  The Minister in reply to the speaker at the Ard-Fheis said he did not believe that one sixth of £20,000,000 was leaving the country.</P>

      <P>So, even a Minister can make a mistake.  In any case, I withdrew it unreservedly, and perhaps when the Minister gets a little more cultured he will reach that stage also. However, perhaps I cannot expect that much from the part of the country he comes from.  When the Minister talks about confiscation and also about ground-rents in relation to that which he is so fond of denying, can he deny <Col N="168" /> that it is confiscation in regard to ground-rents?  Is it not confiscation of some portion of the value that is inherent in such property?  I suggest, Sir, that the Minister, in his reply and in his summing up of the whole situation, faced the issue with a jaundiced mind and did not give a rap what kind of statement he made or however illogical it might be.  One would have to be a mathematician and to use an algebraical formula and to follow his argument from A B C down to X Y Z in order to see what he meant. Possibly, his object was to confuse not only some of the Deputies of this House, but to confuse the members of the public also.  Apparently, he has succeeded to some extent, but at any rate there is considerable doubt, and that doubt was expressed by yourself, Sir, no later than yesterday in reference to the one-sixtieth of the amount that was mentioned.  That may be wrong too.  In introducing that motion I stated that the figures I gave were a very conservative estimate, and I also pointed out that, in the agitation going on in the country, the figures mentioned were merely estimates and for that reason they could not be taken as absolutely accurate.  I read of responsible men in this country stating that upwards of £10,000,000 paid in by way of ground-rents was leaving the country.  I had no way, however, of substantiating that.  At any rate, I ask the Minister for Finance to cause some inquiry to be made into this matter so as to put an end to some of these wild and sweeping statements that have been made in connection with some of those campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, Sir, I only want to state that the whole tone of this debate from beginning to end, whilst there were some irrelevancies, most of which came from the Minister himself, helped at any rate to focus public attention on the whole question of ground-rents and also helped to allay certain fears in the minds of some people, because there was here and there, even in the Minister's own statement, a little bit of commonsense, and there was something in his statement which did tend to allay some of those fears in the country.  My only regret is for the Minister's bad <Col N="169" /> manners, which he cannot divorce from himself when engaging in controversy with other members of this House, when he spoke a moment ago about the minority in this country.  It is bad form and bad manners.  We are told that these people form a very small percentage of the country, and is it fair that this platform should be used to insult and sneer at that minority?</P>

      <P>With regard to the motion in the names of Deputies Bennett and Reidy&mdash;No. 21 on the Order Paper&mdash;I should like to point out that since that motion was put down on the Order Paper a Bill was introduced to amend the Land Act of 1933, and presumably the recommendations in the motion have either been included in the Land Act of 1936 by the action of the House or they have been rejected.  I think that is a question for decision by the Chair before discussing the motion.</P>
