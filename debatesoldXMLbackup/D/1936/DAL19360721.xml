      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (a) if the Cahir military barracks site has been selected for the new tuberculosis hospital for South Tipperary; and, if not, whether a site near the town of Cahir will be chosen, and when building operations will be commenced; and (b) if sanction has been given to the proposed housing scheme for Cahir; and, if so, if he can state the reasons for the delay in proceeding with the work.</P>

      <P>A site for the proposed new tuberculosis institution has not yet been selected. The Commissioner has been asked to have a survey made of the lands in the neighbourhood of Cahir within a reasonable distance of the water supply.  The report and the views of the Commissioner have not yet been received.  Consequently it is not yet possible to say when building operations will commence.</P>
      <P>A compulsory purchase Order, which included sites for 16 houses in the town of Cahir and seven houses near the town, was made in 1935 and confirmed on the 23rd March last.  The arbitrator appointed to fix the compensation payable sat during this month and is at present preparing his award.  As soon as the compensation has been paid there will be no further obstacle to the erection of the houses.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that owing to its being neglected for a number of years, the entrance to Balbriggan <Col N="1447" /> harbour is filling up with mud and sand; that in one week recently, of three boats which endeavoured to enter the harbour, one got stuck in the entrance for two days, the second was held up until the local merchants employed men to release the boat from the sand, and the third was held up outside the entrance to the harbour; whether he is aware that because of the unsatisfactory condition of the harbour and its approaches, shipowners are threatening to discontinue using it, and that if this view is persisted in more than 70 men will be affected, and whether, in the circumstances, he is prepared to take such steps as may be necessary, either by providing a loan or otherwise, to open the entrance to the harbour and to clean out the berths for discharging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the condition of Balbriggan harbour has become unsatisfactory for shipping as the revenue of the harbour from the dues at present charged does not permit of the necessary dredging being carried out.  The harbour is under the control and jurisdiction of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the question of an increase of the harbour dues with a view to providing funds for the dredging is under consideration. It appears that it is not open to the Port and Docks Board to use any part of their revenue from the Port of Dublin to maintain or improve Balbriggan harbour.  I have no funds at my disposal which could be used to provide a loan or otherwise to defray the cost of dredging harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>For works to which the rotational principle is considered applicable the precise amount of wages paid in a given time to each workman will depend not only on the number of his dependents (if any), but also on his place of residence, whether county borough, urban area or other locality, and on his means (if any).  All these factors are reflected in the scale of unemployment assistance, and the value of the beef vouchers to which the workman is entitled and the wages paid in a given period will in no circumstances be less than the combined value of the unemployment assistance scale and the beef vouchers to which he is entitled for the corresponding period. The rate of wages in each case will be the standard rate paid in the locality for work of an analogous kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that French fishing boats have been fishing within a short distance of the Island of Achill since last March; that they have cleared the coast of lobster and crayfish, <Col N="1450" /> and have taken away the local fishermen's gear, including nets and lobster pots, with the result that eight crews engaged fishing between Keel and Dooagh from March last were unable to make a livelihood and had to remove their boats and gear and go to England for a living, and if he will state what steps, if any, were taken by his Department in response to the appeals for protection made by the local fishermen during the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>No complaint as to illegal fishing by French boats off Achill reached my Department during the months of March and April.  In the month of May three reports were received from the Achill-Blacksod area, which seemed to refer to the presence of the same two vessels when observed off different points of that coastline during the first week of that month.  In June reports came to hand on two occasions as to alleged illegal fishing by two French vessels.  From the statistical returns received for the months of May and June I am satisfied that there are no grounds for the suggestion that the lobster and crayfish have been cleared off that part of our coast.  I have no information as to the gear of local fishermen having been taken by foreign boats.  I have no particulars to indicate that there has been abnormal migration from the Achill district since March last.  The fishery cruiser patrolled the Achill-Blacksod area during the first week in June, again in the last week in June, and again in the week ended 11th instant.  During the greater part of May the cruiser had been undergoing repairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously tell the House that he is not aware that that is general and that it is a cause of universal complaint amongst the entire fishing population of this country?  Does he not recollect that, when he was in opposition, he delivered tempestuous speeches all through the west of Ireland about what he would do when he got into office?  Would the Minister not tell the House, now that he is in office, what he is going to do to redeem the undertakings he gave to those fishermen when he was asking for their votes?</P>

The Minister is aware that the circumstances ruling that type of agriculture, which is operated to supply milk to urban centres such as Dublin and Cork, are peculiar and are not widely understood by persons coming from other parts of the country?  Does he not consider, in view of the fact that the interests of three separate classes of persons are involved&mdash;producers, distributors and consumers&mdash; that it would be of material assistance to this House in devising legislative remedies for the evils that exist to have the advice of an expert commission which has heard evidence?</P>

      <P>A commission (the Irish Folklore Commission) has been appointed by the Ard Chomhairle for the collection, collation, cataloguing, editing and publication of oral and written folklore.  This commission is acting in close co-operation with the Folklore Society of Ireland, which has been engaged in this work since 1930.  A Grant-in-Aid, not exceeding £3,250 per annum, in connection with the work of the commission, has been made available from public funds for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the national schools, a brochure which dealt fully with the question of the collection and preservation of folklore was prepared by my Department and issued to all national schools in 1934.  An appeal was made at the same time to the teachers to assist in the work of collecting and preserving the folklore of the nation&mdash; special note-books being supplied in which the teachers could record their collections.  Subsequently local committees of teachers were established by the teaching body to collect the folklore of their districts&mdash;the completed collections to be forwarded to the Folklore Institute.  I understand that at least 135 such committees were established.</P>
      <P>A special questionnaire was also issued later by my Department to national schools, seeking information in regard to holy wells, their location, and to the traditions and customs associated with them.  It is intended to have a complete survey made of these wells in due course from the information thus collected as well as from information available from other sources.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill finally passes, I should like to draw attention to a point that has not yet been raised as far as I know.  That is, that there are some dispensary districts in which there are two doctors with co-equal status.  These districts are situated generally in cities or county boroughs. The senior dispensary doctor in such a district is generally the registrar, and the junior dispensary doctor is the assistant registrar.  So far as I know, when either of them retires, I think I am quite right in saying, the remuneration received is taken into consideration for pension purposes.  At the present time the amount received from the office of registrar of births and deaths is divided equally amongst them.  This Bill seems to make a provision for a small increase simply for the registrar without any increase for the assistant registrar.  I should like to mention that fact so that at some future date that omission might be remedied, and so that the services of the assistant registrar who has an equal amount of work to do and who is equally recognised with the registrar by the Department, would be taken into consideration and the same amount awarded to him as is given to the registrar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>My intention was that the assistant registrars, where such exist&mdash;there are not many, so far as I know&mdash;would be paid an increase proportionate to that set out for registrars.  So far as I know, in practically all cases, where there are assistant registrars they merely do holiday duty.  That is the case with medical men who are acting as assistant registrars with the approval of the Minister.  They act usually only when the medical officer is on vacation or is absent for reasons of ill-health. They will be paid in future an increase proportionate to that paid to the registrar.</P>

      <P>I know that in a country town if you went in to a country doctor to register a birth, whilst he was otherwise engaged, you would probably be thrown through the dining-room window.  He would tell you: &ldquo;Go back to the assistant registrar to register the birth.&rdquo;  In fact, a busy doctor with numbers of patients waiting in his consulting room has not the time nor the opportunity to turn away from his patients to enter on the register that Patrick McNulty's son was born a week ago.  In fact, it is the assistant registrar does all the routine work. Anyone living in a country town will tell the Minister that.</P>

What the Minister thinks ought to happen would probably happen if all the births were registered in the Custom House.  I am telling him what happens when they are registered down the country and the assistant registrar does the work.  What happens in the city I do not know.  Let me assure the Minister that he is wrong in thinking that the assistant registrar only operates while the doctor is on holidays.  In 90 per cent. of cases the registration is done by the assistant registrar.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary when speaking a few moments ago on the Money Resolution, said that this Bill provided for all men engaged in the mutiny.  That is my recollection of what he said. The Bill does not do anything of the kind.  We are unable to move an amendment which would be accepted by you, Sir, to this particular section, an amendment which would be <Col N="1472" /> for the benefit of certain people. We would have moved an amendment to paragraph (c):&mdash;&ldquo;he was in consequence of so joining, sentenced by the General Court-martial to death, penal servitude or imprisonment for any term of not less than 12 months.&rdquo; If the Parliamentary Secretary looks up the matter he will find that there was a number of these men who were not imprisoned for 12 months.  Under the terms of this Bill they get no benefit.  It was to include these that we attempted to move amendments which would not be accepted.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter himself and try to devise some method which would give benefit to the men who, though they were in the mutiny, did not get 12 months' imprisonment.  There is really no principle in refusing benefits to one man because he was sentenced to a few months' imprisonment less than the man who got 12 months' imprisonment. I do not think there is in this House any precedent for such legislation.  When we venture to give monetary compensation to any people we should not put in a differentiation section of this kind, particularly in regard to men connected with the Connaught Rangers, as they are not on the whole a very numerous body and I think we ought not to insert this provision in Section 2.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Bennett urges would appear to me of no particular purpose, because no participant was sentenced to a lesser term than 12 months' imprisonment.  We do know that there were many members of the Connaught Rangers who were rounded up and put into internment who were not necessarily people who would have any sympathy at all with the mutiny.  We take it here that the fact that a man was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of not less than 12 months is a sign that he was a participant in the mutiny and we are not going outside of that.  We could not possibly do it.  We are not accepting the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

I cannot say that they did not suffer but they do not come within the scope regarded by me in the Bill as participants. It was a question of rounding up large numbers of persons who might have been in some way linked with individuals who were participants in the mutiny.

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that all the men who actually participated in the mutiny are included in the Bill?  If my recollection is correct there are numbers of men&mdash; I do not say the number is great&mdash;who suffered because of their participation in the mutiny and these would not be included in the category of having been imprisoned for 12 months.  If the Minister looks up the matter he will find that there are men who actually participated but who, because they were not leaders, are not coming within the scope of the Bill.  I refer to the under-dogs who suffered in this case. These men will get no compensation under this Bill. I think if the Parliamentary Secretary looks this matter up he will find that there are some who suffered severely through participating in the mutiny but yet were not arraigned before the courtmartial. These men certainly were penalised.</P>

      <P>Between this and this day week the Parliamentary Secretary might look into the question of whether he has a list of all the persons likely to apply.  If he has not that list will he consider extending the date?  There is less than six months to run from this to the 31st December, and the disposition to bring in amending Bills ought to be avoided as far as possible.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if he thinks he has the names of all possible claimants?</P>

We have secured these by various means, such as getting into contact with the people concerned, and, as far as we are aware, they are satisfied that we have the names of all the actual participants.  I should like to correct a statement I made to the Deputy a few moments ago in regard to the annual amount.  In the first year the amount will be £4,064, and I believe that will be reducible subsequently to £1,194.</P>

      <P>I will raise an objection to that to which I think the Minister will agree.  There is a proposal here that a levy shall be imposed on all milk sold where this Bill comes into operation.  That is very definitely an imposition of taxation&mdash;it is hidden taxation.  It is going to be utilised, not through Government machinery, but nevertheless through machinery set up by the Government.  It will impose a definite tax on the consumers of milk. The Bill is a very elaborate machinery measure, and I think the Financial Resolution is really intended for the definite purpose of discussing the financial effects of this levy.  I think it is a very important matter and should be discussed separately.  Then the Bill can be discussed as a machinery business.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to understand that there would not be objection to a discussion of the Financial Resolution and the Bill, as such, if in the Financial Resolution the proposed impositions were set out.  The objection is to the Dáil giving enabling powers to the Minister.  Enabling powers may, in certain circumstances, be excusable or pardonable, but there is a reservation with regard to the imposition of taxation. We could not undertake to countenance the matter being settled in any other way.  My own view for what it is worth is that it is unconstitutional, and could be upset in the courts of law, <Col N="1484" /> for the Minister, or Executive Council, or any authority, to impose taxation other than what is put before the Dáil and passed here.  That is the real objection I have to discussing the two matters together.</P>

      <P>I do not mind very much whether you discuss them separately or not, but it is in order to set out the reasons for this levy that I suggested it, as I will have to make almost a Second Reading speech.  It is for that reason that I thought it might be more convenient to explain the whole of the provisions of the Bill, and so give the reasons for this levy.  I do not mind in the least whether you take them separately or not.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that there were Bills in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland in connection with the price of milk in which was laid down what was aimed at&mdash;the exact price?  Neither in the Financial Resolution here, nor in the case of the machinery of this Bill, has that figure been arrived at.  I can quite understand that, to some extent, the circumstances are different, but that they are not entirely different.  But we hold there is a difference, and we think that, even if there are two different bodies of milk producers to be dealt with, it would be better if the prices were set out.  Whatever may be said in criticism of that, I hold that, in respect of the levy, the Dáil should be in possession of the exact amount of the imposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That there shall be charged and levied and paid to each milk board as on and from a date to be fixed in respect of such board under statutory authority a levy on milk sold in the functional area of such board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That the said levy payable to a milk board shall be paid by such vendors and purchasers of milk as shall be specified in that behalf by statute, <Col N="1485" /> and that such levy shall be applied in such ways as shall be directed or authorised by statute.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the said levy shall be charged, levied and paid at such several rates as shall be fixed by the Minister for Agriculture under statutory authority and provision shall be made by statute for collecting and enforcing payment thereof.</P>
    <P>(4)  That in this resolution the expression &ldquo;milk board&rdquo; means a board to be established by statute for the purposes of fulfilling (amongst other functions) certain functions in relation to the supply and price of milk.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, I would like to say that those levies, in the form of an Order, will be laid on the Table of the House.  I do not know if that satisfies the Deputy, but they will come before the Dáil in that form.  It is extremely difficult to foretell what the amount of the levy may be.  In my opinion it will not be more than a farthing per gallon, but I would not like to give that as a definite figure. The expenses with regard to the payment of the chairman's remuneration and to meet whatever staff he may require, as well as the expenses of the members of the board, will be small when measured as a levy per gallon on the large supply of milk coming into the City of Dublin, and it is in regard to that supply that I am speaking now.  There are, however, two other items and it is very hard to gauge the amount of the increase that they may be responsible for.  If we are to encourage the consumption of milk that may take the form of advertising, and the advertising, in turn, may take the form of supplying milk below cost to certain classes of the community.  I do not know, of course, what the board may do.  All this is in their hands, and I cannot anticipate what the board may do.  Another uncertain item is that relating to a surplus of milk.  If the board have to deal with a surplus of milk there will, inevitably, be a loss in connection with it, and, again, I cannot say what that may amount to.  As far as these two items and the expenses of the board are concerned, the Department <Col N="1486" /> estimate that the levy is not likely to be more than a farthing per gallon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution proposes to continue the policy that the Government have embarked on, namely, to impose hidden taxation on that large section of the community who find it so hard to purchase the bare necessaries of life.  When the Government came into office the Minister for Finance boasted, in his first Budget, that they had imposed additional taxation to the extent of £4,000,000.  Ministers went through the country explaining that that amount of additional taxation was going to come out of the pockets of the rich.  While that rate of taxation was continued, and even raised, we reached the point when Ministers had to face the Dáil and say: &ldquo;Why should not the poor man, why should not the working man rather, pay taxation?&rdquo; Experience has shown that the greater part of the burden of increased taxation has fallen on the working classes and that the taxation position in the country is such that, when recently a small relief in respect of children's education was proposed, the answer given by the Minister for Finance, in refusing to adopt it, was that the taxation that would be necessary to give effect to it would fall on the working classes.  Not only has this £4,000,000 in additional taxation been maintained, but very substantial amounts have been shed out of the revenue accounts in the way of hidden taxation, all of which, of course, has fallen on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is hidden taxation in respect of sugar.  It does not appear in the revenue accounts, apart from what appears in them in respect of customs and excise.  Hidden taxation is paid over the counter for bacon.  Increasing sums are being paid in respect of flour and bread.  Hidden taxation is being paid over the counter in respect of butter, and to the extent of £4,000,000, and perhaps more, additional taxation has been put on consumers of the necessaries of life by the present Government's policy. Apart altogether from the additional £4,000,000 that the Minister for Finance boasted so much of when <Col N="1487" /> he put that amount of extra taxation on the people in his first Budget, the consumers of the necessaries of life are being taxed over the counter for bread, bacon, butter and sugar, and they are now going to be taxed over the counter for milk.  The Minister says that to meet expenses the amount of the levy may be small. He said it may be a farthing a gallon, but added that he could not be sure.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to face what has happened in the City of Dublin since Sunday week last. Never in the history of the City of Dublin was there a greater supply of milk at its doors from the Counties of Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow and from the County Dublin itself.  The number of milch cows in these counties, as compared to 1931, has increased by one-fifth. The position is that there are now 16,000 additional milch cows outside the doors of the people of Dublin as compared with 1931.  People who were in consultation with the Minister early in this year complained of the glut of milk between April or May and August.  That is a point that has to be taken into account when dealing with the milk situation in Dublin: that the city is suffering from a glut of milk from what may be described as the Dublin home counties.  Before last Sunday, the big distributors in the City of Dublin had been paying the farmers in the Counties of Wicklow, Meath, Kildare and Louth&mdash;so the distributors themselves complain&mdash;something about 5d. per gallon.  I have seen myself a circular issued to the farmers in County Meath saying that their quota was so many gallons for which they would be paid 6d. a gallon, and that any surplus would be paid for at the rate of 3d. per gallon.  Statements have been made on behalf of some producers that they were receiving 4½d. per gallon from the large distributors. While that was so, ordinary retailers in the City of Dublin who serve ordinary areas in the city, not necessarily the poorer areas but areas close to the ordinary working class districts such as Camden Street, were paying 8d. and 9d. a gallon to <Col N="1488" /> individual farmers delivering milk in the city.  These retailers were able to sell that milk over the counter at 1½d. a pint.</P>
    <P>Whatever happened as a result of the discussions between the officials in the Minister's Department and the bigger distributors, an attempt was made to prevent these retailers getting their milk at 8d. a gallon.  In some cases they were forced to pay a shilling a gallon.  At any rate, they were forced to pay an increased price and forced to raise the price of milk sold over the counter by 2d. a pint.  What was it that brought about that situation?  The big distributors in the City of Dublin agreed to pay the producers in the neighbouring counties the same amount, and not more than the same amount, as the ordinary retailers had been paying the local farmers heretofore. They were paying 8d. and 9d. a gallon to farmers when the bigger distributors in the City of Dublin were paying, according to the producers themselves, 5d. a gallon. According to documents I saw myself they were paying 6d. for a limited quota and 3d. after that.  So far as I can understand anything about the suggestions or the circumstances that force up the price of milk over the counter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was not necessary to pay that ½d. when the ordinary retailers of milk in the city were paying the farmers what many farmers considered a reasonable price for milk in the circumstances, 8d. a gallon.  But we have the situation that when the bigger distributors agreed to raise the price that <Col N="1491" /> they were paying to farmers from 5d. to 8d. a gallon, they manipulated the situation in the city and raised the price on the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to a definite resolution, and this whole proposal, to my mind, is the giving of sanction by a general and loosely-worded resolution to the continuance of the charging of a ½d. a pint extra on milk sold over the counter in the city.  I say that this Resolution is entirely on a par with the extra money that people pay over the counter for bacon, the extra money people pay over the counter for flour and bread, and the extra money people pay over the counter for butter.  It would be more decent and honest if the Government would admit that that was so. We have a Bacon Board to look after the bacon business, and the bakers are doing all the necessary collecting and the millers all the necessary paying out of the additional money taken from the people in respect of bread and flour. It is being done in another way in respect of butter.  The whole thing arises out of the fact that the agricultural community has been prevented managing its business in its own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the producers who carried on the bulk of the negotiations with the Minister in respect of this, is a person who, by his political actions, has reduced the price of cattle from £16 a head to £7 10s. and £8 a head in respect of every head of cattle in his county.  He is, no doubt, persisting in that.  All the Ministers and all the back benchers belonging to the Government Party are persisting in that, and at the present time they have to go to <Col N="1492" /> the poor in the City of Dublin and collect a ½d. a pint to keep some of these farmers in a state of decent subsistence. Everyone must sympathise with the producer who wants to get his cost of production and something over that will enable him to keep his family, to look after their education and place them subsequently.  It is sheer lunacy, it is criminal, that men such as I speak of should, by their actions, have destroyed the whole economy of the farmers in respect of their cattle-rearing and live-stock products, and now, instead of looking after the real interest of their business, they endeavour to get another ½d. on the pint out of the poor people of the city.</P>
    <P>I object, Sir, to this further searching out of some of the necessaries of life to impose&mdash;and to impose in a hidden way &mdash;taxation on them, even to keep the farmers in some kind of a decent position.  The fact is that, bad as is the position of the producers of milk in the counties near to the City of Dublin, they are no worse off than the unfortunate people in the city who in the last week were being charged this increased price.  They have between them in the five counties I mentioned 16,000 additional milch cows.  They at least have milk.  Here to-day we are being asked to put on a levy which will fall on the poor people here at a time when, as a result of the negotiations that went on, there is milk being spilled down the shores in the City of Dublin because the bigger distributors, trying to stand up to their promises to the producers, are taking milk from the producers to-day that they are unable to use.  It is a nice comfort and it must be a nice outlook for the workers of the City of Dublin to see that the Minister is moving a Resolution here, which is going to have statutory effect through this House, to sanction the increased price of milk to-day, because, no matter what the Minister may say with regard to his intention in connection with this levy, the passing of this Resolution is going to give the seal of authority to the charge made to-day in Dublin of an extra ½d. a pint for milk sold over the counter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If one examines the various provisions of this measure it will be found that in order to get in that much money numerous accounts, returns, forms of accountancy, and so on, have to be undertaken by producers, by retailers, and by wholesalers. It is quite possible that the costs incidental to the provision of that sum would amount to something like 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of the sum.  It will not reduce the £10,000, but it will put extra costs on the individuals. The sum involved is relatively small, a sum which one might expect that the Ministry of Agriculture would include in its own list of expenses for the year.  The Minister knows the various steps that are taken in returns from wholesalers, in returns from retailers, and in returns from producers. The producer must be in a position to say what quantity of milk he sold to a wholesaler, or to a retailer, or to a person who is not one or the other, and while it is an equitable imposition in so far as one can learn the quantity of milk that will be handled by each individual, the expenses incidental, the penalties, inspections and so on, will add to the cost of administration, not only on the part of the Government, but of the board and of the individuals, and all for a sum of £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observe, in connection with the Bill which has been introduced in Great Britain and, I think, in Northern Ireland, that there is a limitation <Col N="1494" /> mentioned as to the sum that is available to what they call the equalisation fund&mdash;which does not arise in this case&mdash;and they also limit to a particular sum the taxation or levy which might be put upon the milk.  If, in this particular Resolution, we had even the information that it would be limited to ¼d. a gallon, it would not be so objectionable as it is at present. The Minister's statement to the effect that the Dáil will have to approve of it afterwards does not improve the situation. That system of imposition of taxation is bad.  Unless it were violently opposed to the measure, once the Ministry has been committed to action of this kind, the Dáil would not revoke or amend any such imposition. The Minister knows that if a tariff be put upon anything, and a measure is presented to the House months afterwards, a much stronger case would have to be made to amend or rescind that tariff than would be made in the normal circumstances if it were put down for consideration by the House.</P>
    <P>The machinery in connection with the administration of this measure appears to me to be expensive and extravagant.  Deputy Mulcahy has mentioned the costs in connection with the Pig Board.  Figures in respect of that institution appear in the Minister's Estimate of this year.  As well as I remember, the costs are £13,000, and the sums collected are £16,000. There is, I will admit at once, a worse case for putting the costs of that on the production of pigs than there is in respect of milk.  At any rate, there is a chance here for the milk producers getting a fair price.  Whether the system that is adopted by the Minister to secure that will effect its purpose is another question.  If the board be so manned that the producers are in the minority, then the Minister may be called upon to act.  In so far as the ordinary public is concerned&mdash; and presumably in some cases they have a right to consideration&mdash; they have the Minister's expensive machinery to meet in one respect; they have the milk producers in the second respect, and the further profits for either the retailers or wholesalers, or perhaps both, in the third place.  This system of putting <Col N="1495" /> upon each article of diet its own costs, in respect of whatever administration arises out of the improvements that the Minister introduces in price, is on the public perhaps the most expensive that could be devised.  It is quite true that the Minister has not got to face the costs in so far as the imposition of taxation flowing into the Exchequer is concerned, but other than that, what has been devised in respect of the production of sugar, wheat, tobacco and so on, could not possibly be more expensive on the people, nor could it have been less advantageous to the farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Money Resolution on the grounds I have stated.  Unless in exceptional circumstances, I object to giving authority to any Executive to impose taxation on the people without the authority of Parliament.  I object to it because there is no limit beyond which the Minister cannot go.  As it stands he could put on a levy of 6d. per gallon.  He tells us that is not his intention.  Once this Act passes, the Minister is just merely a tenant at will of his office.  His office might be occupied by Deputy Davin to-morrow, or by Deputy Everett or some other man who has, perhaps, more interest in the farmers than he has in the citizens of Dublin, or of Cork, or of Galway, or of some place else like that. He may consider that the board should go into very big expenditure under one head or other and justify whatever charges might arise in the course of the imposition of an extra levy.  I oppose the Money Resolution.</P>

I remember some questions being asked from time to time in connection with boards established in the last few years by the Minister, such as the Pigs Marketing Board and, so far as I remember, the Minister's reply in connection with these boards was that he had no further authority in connection with their establishment.  That, at least, so far as I remember, was his reply in connection with the Pigs Marketing Board. <Col N="1496" /> I am just wondering will the Minister adopt the same attitude with regard to the setting up of this milk board, and I am wondering whether or not the Minister will be responsible to this House in connection with questions that may be asked from time to time about the administration of the proposed milk board.  Then, with regard to the question of price, I should like to know from the Minister what exactly will his position be when this milk board is established, and what will be the board's powers and functions?</P>

      <P>With regard to this Money Resolution and the levy in particular, the position that I find myself in is that I am confused about the whole matter.  If I thought that the introduction of either the Money Resolution or the Bill was going to improve matters in some way I might be more satisfied, but the mere intervention of the Minister, in reply to Deputy Cosgrave, proves to us what a complicated and impossible matter the Minister has set himself to solve.  In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, the Minister said that the levy would amount to £30 a day.  Well, £30 a day, calculated on the basis that the Minister suggested, represents 36,480 gallons of milk per day.  We have the calculation of 16,000 cows alone, and 14,000 bad cows alone are going to supply the amount of milk that the Minister says he is going to get a levy on.  The Labour Party all know what a two-gallon cow is, but 14,000 two-gallon cows are going to supply the amount that the Minister is going to get a farthing a gallon on.  I think something like that figure represents the number of cows in the vicinity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, 14,000 bad cows are going to supply the amount, if the Minister's estimate is correct. Now, we all know that there are a lot more cows than that&mdash;treble the <Col N="1497" /> number, in fact&mdash;and unless, in the course of this discussion, we can get further facts, such as that the Minister has underestimated the amount and only made a shot at it, the problem will not be solved in that way, and, if it is not correct, he will have to state to the House that he does not see any chance of regulating the supply to the demand, and that it is a matter that is insoluble if the present rate of supply around the city continues.  As I said, I am confused about the whole matter. Even the little study that I have been able to give the Bill up to the moment confuses me, and I have not been able to study it very much because, naturally, Deputies around the City of Dublin are more interested in this particular Bill; but I see that it may be of interest to me also, in the future, and to the people of my neighbourhood.</P>

      <P>If the scheme works well I should be very glad to welcome it, but I cannot see how the subsidy and levy will get over the difficulty. Before the operation of this Bill is attempted, I should like to see some regular open inquiry set up, so that everybody would know the position we are all facing up to, but as it is, we are all confused at the moment when the Minister says that he expects to get £30 a day out of one farthing a gallon. If, as we know it, 14,000 cows can supply the amount of milk required around the City of Dublin, the question appears to be insoluble.  I think the House would need to have very much more information before we go much further in this Money Resolution or in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks, Sir, in connection with the attitude of the Opposition towards this Bill.  I have been listening here, and I have been unable to make up my mind whether or not the Opposition are in favour of the producer securing a reasonable livelihood.  We have heard them pointing out the necessity for a guaranteed price for the farmer.  In this case, the farmer or the producer, as a result of the <Col N="1498" /> farmers organising on trade union lines, has secured some redress.  We cannot consider for a moment that 4d. per gallon for milk purchased from the farmers was a price at which the farmers could reasonably supply milk to the consumers here in Dublin.  I am in favour of this Bill because it is necessary for the farmer to secure a fair price for his milk in order to be able to pay a living wage to the workers employed by him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the producer will be able to pay a living wage now in return for the price he receives as a result of this agreement.  Now, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, there were a few cases here in Dublin&mdash;I suppose about 10 per cent.&mdash;of the producers that supplied milk to the shops direct.  The other 90 per cent. supplied the milk wholesale, but in return had to pay trade union rates of wages and to observe trade union conditions here in Dublin.  Only about 10 per cent. were paid at the rate of 8d. per gallon, and 90 per cent. of the milk used was purchased at 4d. per gallon, or 5d. a gallon in some cases.  Now, that 10 per cent. are paying 1/- because the milk is delivered by the producer to a few shopkeepers, but we have no evidence as to what those shopkeepers are paying to the young girls up from the country working from 6 o'clock in the morning till ten o'clock at night. We have actual knowledge of girls from the country working in these so-called dairies in Dublin and receiving only a few shillings a week for working almost 15 hours a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the things that I hope to see remedied as a result of this Bill.  I agree, however, with Deputy Cosgrave that the industry should not be asked to pay a levy and that it should be a matter for general taxation.  Why should the producer at the present time be expected to pay ¼d. a gallon levy to the Government in connection with this scheme?  It should come out of general taxation, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out.  He pointed out, in his address to the Minister, that he was in favour of general taxation in connection with this matter and that it should not be <Col N="1499" /> levied on the producer.  While we are prepared to give the farmers every support in their efforts to get a guaranteed price for their produce, I would say to Deputy Mulcahy and to others that they should take a different view of this matter because, if they tried to produce under the conditions under which the producer has had to work during the last couple of years, they would realise that even the 8d. a gallon which he is receiving at present does not bring him in a big profit.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister in connection with this new board that the consumer should have representation along with the producer and the wholesale merchant.  As the consumer will be a very interested party, it is only fair to the trade union movement that representation should be given, along with the producer and the wholesale merchant on this board to regulate prices.  I support this motion, and I support the Bill.  I only hope the Minister is in earnest.  The House will give every assistance so that a long-felt want in the farming industry will be supplied.  The Opposition will have an opportunity to prove the statements made on various occasions that they have sympathy with the farming community and are prepared to do everything possible to see that they will get a guaranteed price for their produce.  I believe this is the beginning of a scheme to give the milk producers of Wicklow and Kildare a guaranteed price so as to provide them with a better livelihood than they have at present, and also to enable them to pay a living wage to their workmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question to-day as to whether the Minister would not consider the desirability of setting up a committee or commission to inquire into this problem of the milk supply for urban centres.  The fact of it is that no Deputy in this House is qualified to legislate on this question because no Deputy in this House knows the intricacies of the question with which we have to deal.  Many farmers, such as myself, coming from rural Ireland, listened with amazement to the price of 8d. per gallon for milk.  I never got more than 3½d. a gallon for milk, <Col N="1500" /> and when I got 4d.  I thought it was a comparatively good price during the last three years, but when one comes up against that situation one recognises immediately that the circumstances surrounding the production of milk for the supply of a city are entirely different from the circumstances surrounding the supply of milk to a rural creamery.  I have discussed it with one or two persons who have been engaged in this business for some time, and all the information I extracted from those discussions was a realisation of how little I knew of the peculiar conditions operating in the milk production industry where milk was being produced for the supply of an urban centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to warn the House of this: the farmers of this country want an opportunity of earning a decent livelihood, but the farmers of this country have never wanted to be quartered on the poor.  The farmers of this country were able to make a decent livelihood without asking sacrifices from the poor at any time up to this, and what with the price of bread, the price of milk and the price of other necessities for the poor of this city being increased during the last 12 months, a situation will shortly arise in which the farmers will be held out as a body of men who are battening on the necessities of the poorest section of the community.  That situation is one which should not be allowed to develop, and one which, I believe, is highly undesirable.  Deputy Everett knows, and I know, that there is not a single child in the tenement houses of this city who is getting enough milk.  Every one of them ought to get about twice as much as he is consuming at present, and the reason they are not getting sufficient milk is that their parents cannot afford to pay for it.  Is that not admitted on all sides?  I know that 90 per cent. of the Deputies in this House would wish them to get that milk, but our contribution to facilitating them in getting the milk is to introduce a Bill which puts a tax of a farthing on milk, and which sets up a machinery which may in the long run operate substantially to increase the price of milk to the poor in the City of Dublin.  Whatever the necessities of the producers may be, <Col N="1501" /> and I freely admit that they may be very great, will anyone justify in existing circumstances increasing the price of milk to the poor of this city by ½d. a pint?  Is that not what is actually happening?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Deputy Everett gets up and says that he commends the Financial Resolution to the House.  He recommends the Bill to the favourable consideration of Deputies and I put him this simple question: Does he stand for increasing the price of milk by ½d. a pint to the poor of the City of Dublin?  I do not, and I say that if we cannot reconcile the interests of the producer with the supply of milk to the poor of this city at a price which the poor can pay for it, the Exchequer must step in and breach the gap.</P>
      <P>I know, of course, that what has happened here is that the Minister&mdash; and I think the Minister deserves to be indicated for this&mdash;allowed things to stagger along until a row started and a number of perfectly respectable men were arrested and the country was threatened with a period of great perturbation, whereupon, I have no doubt, Deputy O'Reilly and a few more Deputies from his neighbourhood galloped round to Government Buildings and said: &ldquo;For God's sake, do something; these are all respectable men&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The expenses to be levied under the Financial Resolution are the expenses in which the Minister will be involved in connection with the setting up of a milk board.  The Minister fattened fatuously and futilely for the last six months in the presence of this milk problem.  Deputy O'Reilly then went in and put a pistol to his head and the Minister rushed off, <Col N="1502" /> grabbed the British Milk Board Act and told his officers: &ldquo;Put that into operation here.&rdquo;  This levy is part of that scheme, with this difference, that the British scheme set a limit to the amount which the Minister could levy. The Minister here has not got the information to say what limit he ought to set himself.  He does not know, but he is afraid of Deputy O'Reilly and a few more Deputies.  He must do something, and so he comes in here with this Bill which he does not understand himself, and the implications of which he has not considered, and throws it before us at the end of a long parliamentary session in order to deal with a frightful emergency.  This emergency has existed for the past nine months and nothing has been done about it.</P>

I think the Minister is gravely to be condemned and indicted for reacting to the situation in the way he has, particularly as that situation is largely of his own creation.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw that there was going to be a wriggle about this matter. I want to make my position clear. No consideration whatever, in my opinion, will justify an increase in the price of milk to the poor in this city by ½d. a pint.  There is no reservation or qualification in that statement, good, bad or indifferent, and I want Deputies in the Labour Party to speak what is in their mind equally frankly. If a Deputy representing suppliers in this city says that the farmers are to go without an economic price in order to provide milk at 1½d. a pint, my answer is that there is no use asking anyone in this country to continue to produce anything at an uneconomic price, because, if you do, the end will be that there will be no production.  I have argued that with the Labour Party for the last four years because it applies also to beef and to other agricultural produce which we can discuss <Col N="1504" /> at another date.  The rule is general. I freely admit that the matter is one of great complexity, because you have the interests of the producers to consider and the interests of the distributors. That might be discussed at this stage, though Deputy Everett takes it upon himself to slander every milk distributor in this city by describing them as sweaters, rogues and vagabonds. That is not true.  Deputy Everett knows little or nothing about conditions in the city or the conditions under which these distributors work.  If the Deputy had to earn his livelihood as a distributor of milk he might not talk so loosely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett cannot keep order.  He does not like this. There are also the interests of consumers to be considered.  I am prepared to sit down with the Minister for Agriculture and to co-operate with him in any way in order to elucidate all the relevant facts in regard to this problem, and to agree with him on a measure which would be an agreed measure in this House as far as the Opposition and the Government are concerned. I want to deal with the situation and put it on a satisfactory basis, but I emphatically object to panic legislation of this kind, the result of which may be very material hardship and may not overcome the difficulties we are called upon to confront.  We are asked to try to wade through the provisions of a Milk Bill before the Recess.  I am not qualified to debate this Milk Bill because I do not know anything about the problem, and I assert that not a single Deputy, including the Minister for Agriculture, is qualified to discuss it, because neither he nor other Deputies understand all its implications.  Some of us will respond to the reactions of consumers in the city; others to the plight in which producers find themselves, while others may understand the difficulties of distributors, but I say that we cannot legislate intelligently or dispose of the evils in connection <Col N="1505" /> with the problem until we know all sides of the question.  Deputy Everett said that there was no evidence before him in regard to a number of points that arose.  How are we to get evidence except by some kind of commission of inquiry?  Unless some body is set up to which all and sundry interested are invited to give information, if they have any to give, how can we hereafter say that we legislated with the best information that we could get?  Are we always to be open to the rebuke that there were legitimately interested parties who were anxious to put their point of view if a tribunal was prepared to hear them?  Farmers or no farmers, if this Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill goes through, and if the poor in this city are to pay 2d. where heretofore they paid 1½d. a pint for milk, I will vote against this motion.  I invite any conscientious member of the Labour Party to stand up and defend a proposal to increase the price of milk on the people of this city.  I do not understand the details of the problem with which we have to deal, but I am prepared to make a general suggestion that if the production of milk is wholly uneconomic owing to a series of circumstances too complex to go into at the present stage, and that have been given rise to as a result of the Government's general policy, if the supply of milk to the city has become an uneconomic proposition, then I say a far better line to start thinking upon would be to examine the possibility of extending the free milk supplies to necessitous children, thereby assisting in taking away the temporary surplus of milk that may be on the market and restoring milk production as an economic proposition.  Sooner or later I believe this House will encourage the responsible Minister to provide some kind of meal for necessitous school children in national schools.  If that social service is ever decided upon, I can imagine no food stuff more eminently suited for the purpose than milk.  I believe that Deputies representing farming communities and city Deputies would always feel happier if they could say to themselves that the poor of this city and of every other city were getting all the milk that their health <Col N="1506" /> demanded.  We have had reports from distinguished dieticians in England pointing out that large sections of the community are really dying from a type of starvation known as under-nourishment, and surely we would be better employed devising ways and means of remedying that situation by supplying children with milk, than starting to force up the price of milk on people who are hard set already to get enough milk for their tea much less to give to children in the quantities they should get it.</P>

That is a simple suggestion, and I think the Minister ought to meet me there.  As one who wants to face the task, whatever the solution, we will accept no solution which will result in people getting less milk than before. We have common ground there, I imagine.  I believe that in accepting that common ground a solution of this problem will be found if we have adequate information at our disposal.  I want that information, and I say that the Minister stands as much in need of that information as I do.  I say that <Col N="1507" /> this is panic legislation brought in without adequate consideration and on the face of it, contemplating its earliest defect&mdash;an increased price to the poor&mdash;it seems to me to be bad legislation.  Certainly I could not vote for it with the information at my disposal at the present time, but if the Minister is prepared to set up an inquiry to consider the whole matter, and to utilise the few months of peace which have been secured by the recent settlement between distributors and producers for that purpose, he will, I am sure, be able to overcome all the difficulties with which we are now faced and to produce an agreed measure on our return after the Recess.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made the suggestion that certain people had held a revolver to the Minister's head. This question of legislation first cropped up, as many members will remember, on the occasion when a Bill was introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to achieve something that was very necessary&mdash;to ensure a supply of clean milk for the people of the city.  That Act is not now entirely in operation, but, at any rate, it imposed on the suppliers of milk to the City of Dublin a rather heavy expenditure in so far as they were compelled to put their cowsheds and other appurtenances in order.  That is going to cost them a good deal of money.  The only statement I made on that occasion was to request the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to ask the Minister for Agriculture what steps he intended to take to ensure that the purchasers were going to get a better price for their milk in order to meet the increased costs which would naturally ensue from the operation of the Bill then going through the House.  This legislation, as far as I am aware, is not at all panicky.  It has been under <Col N="1508" /> consideration for some time, and of course it is absolutely essential.  Deputy Mulcahy, I am sure, knows that perfectly well.  He must have been down in County Meath, and I am sure he heard many whispers there.  He ought to be satisfied that it is absolutely essential.  The Deputy dwells on what he describes as an unhappy situation because, he says, there has been an increase of ½d. per pint.  I am not so sure that this Bill means that such increases will occur because the consumers' interests will be protected just as much as the interests of the producers and the distributors.</P>

      <P>For instance, I was not quite sure whether he was discussing the levy or the Bill.  The levy is essential and has been introduced, I understand, for the purpose of enabling producers to dispose of the surplus milk.  There must be a surplus of milk and it can be used for many purposes. Possibly at a later stage it can be used for the purpose of enabling poor people to get milk at a cheaper price.  The whole object of the levy is to enable us to dispose of the surplus.  I admit that this Bill should have been introduced before now, but it was not because there was a strike of producers that the Bill was introduced.  The Bill was under consideration long before there was any question of a strike.  The strike occurred because the prices that were being paid were much less than those which had been formerly paid. That was quite a natural thing owing to the lack of organisation in the system by which milk was supplied to the City of Dublin.  That lack of organisation existed for a number of years.  It existed during the time that Deputy Mulcahy was in office as Minister.  Overstocked cows were being milked at the markets in the City of Dublin, and the milk was being <Col N="1509" /> carried round in buckets and sold at any price which could be got for it. Yet Deputy Mulcahy, when he was Minister, did not offer the slightest objection to that.  Cans of milk were being sent by rail to the City of Dublin from time to time.  That milk was carried around in buckets and sold under most undesirable conditions. We could not stand for that condition of affairs.  It would be highly undesirable that it should be allowed to go unchecked.  Some steps had to be taken to remedy it.  The Minister for Local Government took the first step, and the Minister for Agriculture is now taking the second step.  I suppose if the price goes too high the Minister for Industry and Commerce will regulate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going on still. This Board may help to stop it.  I believe that that calamity, and it is nothing less than a calamity, can be stopped.  Milk from over-stocked cows in the markets is hawked round Dublin without anybody having any control over it.  Nobody can tell what amount of milk comes into Dublin on any given day or on any given week.  It comes in by motor car, by train and by road, and nobody has the slightest control over what is the most important food of the whole community.  I think that anything that can be done to remedy that situation should not be objected to.  Deputy Mulcahy may have heard some whispers going round about these matters but he did not bother about them.  It is the duty of the Government to take action of this kind and to go further on the question &mdash;to guarantee to the City of Dublin or to any district in which the inhabitants cannot procure an adequate <Col N="1510" /> supply of milk in the immediate neighbourhood, that the milk which is supplied from outside areas is produced under circumstances which will carry a warranty of its purity.  The result of the old situation was that we were only consuming as much milk as we required for tea, less than one half glass per head of the population.  That is a desperate state of affairs, but it is largely due to the fact that Deputy Mulcahy, when he was Minister for Local Government, made no attempt to deal with the question.  The farmers have here a market if it can be developed, and this levy is going to be used to develop that market by inducing people to consume more milk, which they will do when they know that that milk is pure and can be drunk without the slightest risk.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, which is most unusual for him, confessed that he knows nothing about the matter that we have been discussing for some time past, and he put forward the suggestion that he should receive his education in this matter from a long-winded commission set up by the Minister.  He did not pluck up sufficient courage to go so far as to suggest the personnel of that commission. I should like to hear from any subsequent speaker from the same benches what the personnel of that commission should be.  Is it to consist of representatives of producers, distributors, consumers and of the Minister, or is it a matter to be inquired into by the Tariff Commission or by some body of civil servants to be set up by the Minister?  I have no faith whatever in a long-winded investigation to be carried out by a commission of the type which Deputy Dillon foreshadowed.  Deputy Dillon overlooked the fact, consciously or unconsciously, that the agreement recently arrived at will expire in the next month or six weeks.  Are we to assume that he would like to see the same chaotic conditions after that period as we had prior to the recent agreement between producers and distributors in the City of Dublin?  I am very definitely of opinion, and so are my colleagues, that there is no justification whatever for an increase in the <Col N="1511" /> price of milk to the consumers in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I could quote the Minister for Agriculture, on the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, as being opposed to this whole idea of a levy on the people directly concerned.  The Minister, in inviting this House to give him permission to repeal certain sections of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, stated that the levy system was going to disappear, and pointed out that its administration was uneconomic. The policy of the Government in future, he said, would be to devote all the money at their disposal to supplying cheap beef without any unnecessary administrative costs.  The administration of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, so far as the collecting of levies was concerned, was <Col N="1514" /> uneconomic.  It was a failure, and that was why the Minister came here to ask permission to repeal that section of the Act.  I am of opinion that the people directly concerned should not be levied with the cost of setting up a board for the administration of this Bill.  I think that the necessary expenditure should be defrayed out of general taxation.  I do not think that anybody will say that the levy system in regard to the stabilisation of prices in respect of butter has been a success.  As the amount involved in this case is so small, I suggest that the administrative coats of the board should be borne out of general taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly said that the levy was essential.  He did not develop that contention or explain in a convincing way how it is essential.  If the money comes out of general taxation, what difference will it make?  Why should not that be done instead of setting up machinery in the Department and pressing people for money they are not willing to pay at the time it becomes due?  If the Deputy has a private conversation with the Minister for Agriculture or some of his officials responsible for administering the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, he will probably change his mind in regard to the collection of levies.  The Government should make provision for the payment of these expenses out of general taxation.  I take my hat off to the people of Dublin, Wicklow and other milk-producing areas who had, at last, the good sense to organise themselves for the purpose of getting a fair price for their milk from the city distributors.  I see no other way of implementing an agreement of that kind in a proper way except through the establishment of a board of this kind and through machinery such as is provided in this Bill.</P>

      <P>No useful purpose is to be served by the proposal put forward by Deputy Mulcahy's leader.  The setting up of a long-winded commission which would carry on its investigations for 12 or 16 months and then allow an interval of six months for <Col N="1515" /> consideration of these recommendations would serve no useful purpose. After about two years, a measure would probably be brought in having no bearing whatever on the recommendations of the commission. Deputy Mulcahy, who has been a Minister, knows how recommendations were brought in by commissions and how these recommendations were ignored, and put up a plausible case in support of that particular line of action. Is the Government to meet these farmers by setting up a commission and then ignoring the recommendations of the commission when it brings in its report?  I am afraid that unless some of us warn the Minister for Agriculture, there will be a disposition on the part of the present Government to follow the bad example that Deputy Mulcahy and his Government gave.  Why does not the Deputy come along with a more effective proposal? If the Deputy cannot accept the machinery in this Bill then let him suggest a more practical proposal. But if the Deputy wants to give us a practical proposal it is not the proposal suggested by Deputy Dillon&mdash;the setting up of a long-winded commission and allowing this thing to go on for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, absolutely, and in a very few words I will prove the truth of that statement to the House and to the country.  Previous to the economic war I never sold my milk at less than 9d. a gallon wholesale.  Since the <Col N="1516" /> economic war started the prices have fallen, as my figures will show.  In 1930, I got 9d. a gallon for my milk.  In 1931 I got 9½d. a gallon.  In 1932, the first year of the Fianna Fáil administration, the price came down to 8d.  In 1933 I got 9d. from the shops for my milk and 6d. from the distributor for surplus milk.  In 1934 I got 9d. from the shops and 5d. from the distributor for surplus.  In 1935 I got 8d. from the shops and 5d. a gallon for my surplus milk from the distributors.  In the present year I am getting 8d. from the shops in Dublin for my milk.  Were it not for those people who are trying to intimidate me from bringing milk to Dublin I would be getting 9d. in the shops for my milk.  These people went into the shops and tried to cut the ground from under me by offering the milk at a lower price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no conversation with Deputy Dillon about this matter of the milk.  I have the courage to put the facts before the House, and if Deputy Davin had the courage to speak to the facts and to put this question fairly before the country it would be better for the milk consumers, for the milk producers, and for the country to-day.  They would be all in a much better position than they are in if the Deputy and others like him faced up to the position and gave the facts. What is really the position?  It is that the Minister for Agriculture has himself created this problem.  Would the Minister set up a commission to inquire into how many people in Dublin and adjoining counties have gone into milk production since the economic war started?  How many people in the more remote parts of the country have turned to sending milk to Dublin as a result of the 4d. or 5d. a lb. levy that the Minister has placed on butter which the farmers were themselves making in the country?  When the Minister put this levy on butter he drove these people into the milk market in competition with me and people like me.  I am prepared to deliver milk in Dublin at 9d. a gallon for half the year and at 1/- a gallon <Col N="1517" /> for the other half.  I am not going to be a party, as the Farmers' Organisation has been, to fixing the price of milk to the shops in the summer at 1/- a gallon and to the distributors at 8d. per gallon.  Just fancy a distributor going into Westland Row Station, taking milk there at the station at 8d. a gallon, and handing it over to a shop across the road at 1/- a gallon, as a result of which the poor would have to pay ½d. a pint extra for their milk. Then Deputies here tell us there is no necessity to set up a Commission to inquire into that sort of thing.</P>

      <P>The Prices Commission have not interfered with the price of milk, and Deputy Davin knows as well as I do that the Prices Commission is a complete failure.  I have no sympathy with the milk distributors in Dublin.  I could supply my milk direct to the distributors in Dublin, but when the economic war started I was forced to go to the shops to get prices which would enable me to carry on and pay a decent rate of wages to my workers.  I have a communication in my pocket from a distributor; it will show you the position in which, by their action, the Government have placed people like me.  At the Show last year (1935) a certain distributor in Dublin approached me in connection with the distribution of my milk.  If I had not been in politics I could have opened shops in Dublin, but I suppose some people are made for the wrong job, and I have not opened the shops. This distributor approached me last year and said: &ldquo;Unless you supply me with the whole of your milk, I am not going to take your surplus.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am not going to give you the whole of my milk.  I will stick to the shops and the shops will stick to me through thick and thin.&rdquo;  This distributor and myself were very pally and we put in the day together at the Show.  He went with me to the Customs House, where I had to call about an old age pension, and he sat in the motor car at the Customs House. I thought I was after softening him. I went down to Cork the following <Col N="1518" /> week, and a few days after my son sent me this post card.  I will not mention the name of the distributor. The post card reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. O'Leary &mdash; As your supply of milk is now around 50 gallons, and we find it impossible to clear buttermilk, and cannot even sell it for pig-feeding, your milk would not be worth more than Sherrin's price for carriage.  Consequently I must ask you to discontinue supplies forthwith, as it would be a serious loss to carry on with you.  I explained our position to you last week.  I am sorry to have to dispense with your supply, but I cannot avoid it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sincerely yours,</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did one ever hear such a statement coming from the lips of a man who claims he has a creamery and says the milk is only worth the carrier's&mdash;Sherrin's price&mdash;that was 1d. a gallon? Anybody knows that milk for manufacturing butter is worth about 4d. a gallon.  That is the position.  I say that if any scheme is going to be brought in here that there should be intelligence enough in the Department to frame such a scheme as would enable the suppliers to send their milk direct to the shops, and, at the same time, put the people in the shops in the position of selling their milk to the consumer at 1½d. a pint in the summer and 2d. in the winter.  I put up a scheme to these farmers, and I am not going to be driven into the policy they are putting forward.  I suggested previously that we should set up some kind of a depôt in Dublin that would take during this period the surplus milk off the market, so that these farmers who were not getting a fair price would be in a better position to secure more reasonable prices for their milk.  I tell the Minister that so long as the economic war lasts, this milk business will present a problem to the farmers of Dublin. Deputy Davin referred to the beef problem.  Is it not a well-known fact that the Minister for Agriculture was not able to put the Beef Act into operation?  Is it not a well-known fact that the farmers, the dealers and <Col N="1519" /> the butchers made a bargain beforehand behind his back, and the farmers took any reasonable price they could get for their beef?  Is it not a fact that the same thing will happen with regard to milk?  After all, there is a very good argument in favour of the proposal that a commission of some kind should be set up to inquire into this matter of the milk supply of Dublin.</P>

I do not think that it would be necessary to appoint a long-winded commission. Why should it be long-winded? If it is an urgent matter, why should it not be dealt with urgently?  Let us deal with it in a practical way and not make Party capital or any other kind of capital out of it.  Deputy O'Leary has certainly put the practical side of it and told Deputy Davin where he is getting off and where the Minister is getting off with regard to the economic war and the effect it had.

It appeared from the discussion as it went on that they did not want to offend the farmers of Wicklow and Kildare by voting against the Bill, but they did not like to offend the consumers by voting for it; therefore they wanted to have two separate divisions.  They want to please both the consumers and the farmers.  They are carrying out the Cumann na nGaedheal policy of trying to please everybody, and, like the man with the ass, they will not please anybody. They always try to please everybody.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have any controversy in the Fine Gael Party over this.  I do not want to have Deputy O'Leary contradicting Deputy Mulcahy.  We will come to the price the farmers get in a minute.  They talk about the levy as hidden taxation. The position, as every Deputy knows, is that if the farmers could organise and co-operate amongst themselves they would do it, and they would do the very <Col N="1523" /> thing we are legislating for&mdash;they would agree amongst themselves to charge a fair price and, if there was a surplus, they would agree to dispose of that surplus.</P>
      <P>They would have some sort of an organisation.  The salaries of the officials would not be very much.  It would amount to practically nothing when it comes to a levy on the gallon of milk.  We all know that if the farmers could organise the same as other traders they would organise and charge a fair price, and if they had to pay certain expenses in connection with that organisation, for instance, for disposing of the surplus milk, they would naturally collect a small levy in order to do that.</P>
      <P>In the same way as we are bringing in legislation here, legislation was brought in, for instance, giving certain rights to co-operative societies with regard to the running of creameries. It would be just as reasonable for any Deputy to say that these creameries in paying their own manager and paying for advertising were imposing a hidden tax as to say that this levy is a hidden tax.  The levy is for the purpose of managing the supply of milk to Dublin and paying for advertising, if necessary, in order to increase the consumption of milk and to dispose of any surplus which may be left over.  You could call anything a hidden tax if you call that a hidden tax, as it is just trying to regulate the trade and to give the producers an opportunity of getting a fair price for their milk and disposing of a certain surplus, because you cannot manage the milk trade of the City of Dublin or anywhere else and gauge the supply to the gallon each day.  If you want to make certain that nobody is short you must have a fair surplus every day and that surplus must be disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that Deputy Mulcahy has raised about the 5d., 8d., 11d. and 1/- is the greatest nonsense.  Farmers were selling their milk for 4½d. or 5d. a gallon, and the distributors have now agreed to give them 8d.  The distributors who, before now were selling milk to retailers at a certain price, certainly must have made some profit <Col N="1524" /> over the transaction.  They believe now that they must get more than 8d. if they sell it to a retailer.  If a farmer, in turn, sells milk to a retailer rather than to a distributor, he has more trouble with it.  The milk must be better cooled and so on, and, therefore, a farmer must get a better price for supplying milk to a retailer than he would get if he were to supply it to a wholesaler or a distributor.  That is why there must be a different price when selling to a retailer and selling to a wholesaler.  What the margin is between these prices I do not know.  I do not know whether the margin is justified or not, but at any rate, under the Bill that is to come before the Dáil, power is being taken to fix the price if it is believed that the margin between the wholesaler and the retailer and the margin between the retailer and the consumer is not justified. That is one thing that can be done.  Deputy Mulcahy talked about the extra price of bacon, flour, bread and butter, although he knows as well as I do, because I am aware that he looks up the figures, that the cost-of-living figure is not higher now, or as high as it was during the term of office of the Government of which he was a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not say that butter is not dearer now than it was in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of the poor woman going out to buy food for the week.  I say that she was paying as much in 1931 for that food as she is paying now, if getting the same amount of commodities, because the index cost of living for food is not higher now than it was in 1931.  To give Deputies an example of the reckless exaggeration that Deputy Mulcahy indulges in in this House, the Deputy talked about a bullock in the County Wicklow being worth £16 and said it was now worth only £8 because of the action of this Government.  Now, at the worst, the tariff on that beast going into Great Britain is all that the economic war can be responsible for, and that tariff amounts to £4 5s., but Deputy Mulcahy, in order to get a good round figure, makes it £8 on that bullock.  He said a bullock that should be worth <Col N="1525" /> £16 was now worth only £7 10s. or £8 because of the policy adopted by the Government.  Supposing that we were to bring in a Bill, and suppose that under it we were to raise the price of that bullock from £8 to £16, think of the way in which Deputy Mulcahy would be getting up here and talking about the poor consumer in Dublin.  I suppose he would approve of such a Bill from the point of view of getting votes from farmers.  He would approve highly of raising the price of cattle from the point of view of getting farmers' votes, but from the point of view of getting consumers' votes in the City of Dublin, he would disapprove of raising the price of meat. In other words, Deputy Mulcahy and his Party want to get better prices all round for farmers and at the same time they want to bring down the cost of food in the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy may try to evade the issue as well as he can, but I say the attitude he has adopted on this financial resolution is similar to that which he has adopted on every other measure that has come before the House.  His attitude is this: &ldquo;You must give the farmer more for his stuff, but you must not increase the price on the consumer.&rdquo;  In other words, the Deputy wants to be able to go down the country and say to farmers: &ldquo;We made the Government bring in that Bill to give you a better price for your milk,&rdquo; and then to go up to James's Street in Dublin and tell the people there that his Party and himself had got the Government to bring down the price of milk.  That is the attitude of the Deputy and his Party.  They think they can have it both ways, but experience has shown that they are not having it either way.  They talk a lot about the poor of Dublin.  When they were here as a Government they did not show much regard for the poor widow in Dublin, the poor orphan, or the old age pensioner.  When they wanted to get some extra funds for the <Col N="1526" /> Exchequer they took 1/- off the old age pensioner.  They did not show very much sympathy for the unemployed or anybody else, but now they are all sympathy for the poor of Dublin.  Deputy Cosgrave said that this levy should be borne by the Department.  I do not, know how the Deputy could make that suggestion except as leader of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking Deputy Cosgrave first.  We are asking the distributors of milk to contribute a small amount of money in order to dispose of the surplus.  That will be for the general good.  If we were to contribute that money from the Exchequer, and suppose we had to ask the Dáil to vote £10,000 or £20,000 to set up a board. The board would be helpless, because if it formulated a good scheme for using up the surplus it would know that there was no use going on with it unless the Government voted the necessary money.  It is much better, I think, to give the board an opportunity of framing a scheme that will benefit the producers all-round.  Even if the board were to take 1d. a gallon off farmers, in order to take the milk of the 100,000 cows that Deputy Bennett spoke of, and to give a fair price, would it not be better to do that rather than not deal with the problem at all? It surely would be better to do that than only take some of the milk and have the rest thrown down the sewers, as some Deputies said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the Pigs Marketing Board is an altogether different thing. The money voted by the Dáil in that case is for the inspection of bacon&mdash; an altogether different matter.  Under the Clean Milk Bill brought in by the Minister for Local Government, the cost of the inspection of dairies, etc., under that measure is paid for out of funds voted by the Dáil.  In the same way the inspection of bacon is paid for out of funds voted by the Dáil, because in that case we must have veterinary inspectors under direct Government control in order to see that the duties laid down are properly carried out. But here we are dealing with a trading <Col N="1527" /> matter and nothing else, a matter that concerns the disposal of surplus milk, and it is clearly one in which the levy should be taken from the industry itself.</P>
    <P>It would be better, I suppose, if the farmers themselves would organise and do this business without any legislation, but as we all know farmers are very helpless in these matters.  It is very hard to get farmers into an organisation. Some of the Deputies opposite often tried their hands at that and did not succeed very well.  It is very difficult to get 100 per cent. organisation amongst farmers.  Some will fall away and do injury to the whole business. Deputy Bennett talked about the 14,000 cows that are supplying the City of Dublin, although there are 100,000 cows there.  I did not hear any suggestion from the Deputy as to how we should deal with the matter.  He did not say that, if we dropped the levy, things would be any better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that 14,000 cows could do it.  It was the Minister who suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps nobody knows, but we will know very soon under, the Bill.  It is thought that about 30,000 gallons of milk come into the City of Dublin each day.  Deputy Bennett thinks that 14,000 or 15,000 cows could provide that supply.  He gave us that information but there was no suggestion from him as to what we could do to mend matters.  Certainly to drop the levy will not mend matters.  The Deputy referred to difficulties which we are already aware of, but he did not tell us how to remedy them.  Deputy Everett suggested that there should be a consumer on the board.  I do not know that the Deputy could make a very strong case for that.  This board will be very much like a trade board. We have trade boards, for instance, in the case of boots and shoes, but so far as I know there has never been any suggestion that the consumer&mdash;the farmer&mdash;should have representation on these trade boards.  The representation on them is confined to manufacturers and workers and they try to fix up matters as best they can.  In <Col N="1528" /> the same way, this board will be very much like a trade board.  You will have on it representatives of the producers and of the people who sell milk. I do not think a very strong case could be made for putting a producer on it. It would be very difficult to see what function a consumer could discharge on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, went out after making his usual impertinent and futile speech.  If he stood his ground here after these speeches we might be able to teach him a little, but evidently he has not the courage to stand his ground.  It took him half-an-hour to tell us he knew nothing about the matter.  Any other Deputy who does not know anything about a subject does not get up to talk and that is a much better system than that adopted by Deputy Dillon, who takes a half-an-hour to tell us that he knows nothing about it.  Deputy Dillon's principal plea was &ldquo;Certainly let the producer get a good price for his milk and let the consumer get his milk cheaply.&rdquo;  That is the Cumann na nGaedheal attitude.  &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; the Deputy goes on, &ldquo;if there is anything required to bridge the gap, let the Exchequer come into it.&rdquo;  Is not that a subsidy for the farmer?  I wonder could it be described as anything else except a subsidy for the farmer? Would any Deputy care to go back over Deputy Dillon's voluminous speeches to find out how often he has denounced subsidies to the farmers? His plea always has been no subsidies and no doles for the farmers.  He has emphasised on the public platform, and here too, that the farmer should stand on his own feet and could do so.  In this particular case, however, he wants the farmer to get a good price for his milk and he also wants Deputy Mulcahy to retain the votes he has in the City of Dublin and, therefore, in this particular case a subsidy is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon paid me a very high compliment, only he did not mean to do so.  He said that as soon as this strike had arisen I rushed and got this Bill ready; I copied it from the British Act.  I did not copy the British Act.  I am not familiar with the British Act, but the whole thing <Col N="1529" /> reminds me of an old Irish proverb, &ldquo;Sás a dhéanta do chuimhneochadh air.&rdquo;  Whenever you hear a Deputy saying anything like that, it is always a sign that it is the very thing he would do himself.  And Deputy Dillon is the one who would do that.  If he were in a hurry, naturally he would copy the British Act, because the British cannot err in his eyes.  Suppose I did do what Deputy Dillon says I did, and suppose I prepared the Bill, my goodness! It would be a monument to my memory to prepare a Bill like that in a few days and do it as perfectly as it is done.  I could not have got a higher compliment, although I am sure the Deputy did not mean to pay it to me.</P>
    <P>He talked about the rapid preparation of this Bill.  I can assure the House that I am not in a hurry with this measure; there is not the slightest hurry.  I think, however, that this measure should go through before the Dáil adjourns.  At the same time, I am quite prepared to allow all the discussion that Deputies want and leave as long a period as possible between the stages.  I would advise Deputies however, to put it through before the adjournment.  I expect that if I were to suggest that we should adjourn this Bill until after the Recess, there would be a chorus of disapproval and I would be asked &ldquo;What about the farmers in Wicklow and Kildare?&rdquo; Deputies opposite would immediately think about the farmers and the consumers would be forgotten.  It is just a matter of politics all the time.  Those Deputies who, like Deputy Dillon, suggested a subsidy to the farmers in order to keep in with both sides, the farmers and consumers, have not indicated where the subsidy should come from.  Naturally we would have to put on an extra tax on something.  I would like to hear the Opposition suggesting something that we might tax, taking responsibility for that before the country.  I would love to see them taking the risk of losing half a dozen or a dozen votes.</P>

      <P>We are doing it every day.  We had 123 in the last Budget. We are not a bit afraid to put those things across.  After all, courage is the best thing in the long run.  Deputy Dillon wound up by saying that if we cannot please both the farmer and the consumer, then we must bridge the gap by a subsidy from Government funds. It is a great thing to hear Deputy Dillon advocating subsidies for the farmers.  It would be better still if he would advocate something from which we would get the subsidy&mdash;some form of taxation.  Deputy Brennan returned after Deputy O'Leary had spoken, and he said that here again one saw the necessity for a commission.  A commission is another way out of the dilemma. I can understand the Deputies opposite being in a dilemma.  A vote for the Bill is a vote against the consumer, and a vote against the Bill is against the farmer.  I suppose they will compromise by voting for the Resolution and against the Bill.  A commission would be a nice idea.  It would delay matters.  They could get their views better explained before a commission, and they could try to make out that the whole thing was due to mishandling on the part of the Government, and they might not have to be put to this severe test.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that it was admitted in the debate that when the farmers were selling recently and getting 8d. for their milk, it would be sold to the consumer at 1½d. a pint? There is no provision in the settlement or in the Bill that will give the farmers more, but there is a provision that will take more from the consumers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very innocent, almost as innocent as Deputy Mulcahy in his efforts to try to explain why he is going to vote against the Financial Resolution.  Deputy O'Leary, in his apologia, put the blame on Deputy Davin and his Party <Col N="1531" /> for the position in the country.  He also suggested a commission, a brilliant idea.  Deputy Bennett ought to go for a commission, too.  Deputy O'Leary said very plainly that he could sell milk for 9d. in the summer and 1/- in the winter.  Deputy O'Leary will sell milk to the wholesaler or retailer at 1/-, but Deputy Mulcahy wants that sold to the consumer at 1½d. and he wants the retailer to work for nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So Deputy Mulcahy is not getting unanimous support for 1½d. a pint.  Deputy Mulcahy's point is that the retailer must get it at 9d. and, if the retailer has to get it through a wholesaler, what is the farmer to get for it?  Nothing like 8d., so far as we can see.  As well as fixing the price that the farmer will get from the wholesaler, there is also power to fix the price at which the wholesaler sells to the retailer and the price at which the retailer sells to the consumers.  If the Deputies opposite had any genuine fears about those matters they would, of course, agree to the Bill, but whether their fears are genuine or not I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Some time ago representations were made to the Department that the milk producers in Counties Dublin, Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow supplying milk to distributors for resale in the City of Dublin were not getting a satisfactory price&mdash;a price that would be commensurate with the cost of production in those areas&mdash;and also that they were not in a position to make satisfactory arrangements of a permanent nature in regard to prices in the absence of legislation.  As the House is aware, for the last four or five years attempts have been made at fixing prices which would be fair to the producer, and it was found impossible during that time, and notwithstanding these negotiations it was found impossible to have agreements observed.  The prices paid for milk coming into the Dublin market have declined very much during the last few years.  During the winter of 1931-32 the average price paid for contract milk was 1/1 per gallon.  That was the contract price made with the wholesaler and the farmer for milk sold to the consumer.  In the summer of 1932 the price was 9¼d.; in the following winter, 10¾d.  In the summer of 1933 it was 8½d.; in the following winter, 10d.  In the summer of 1934 the price was 6¾d., and in the following winter, 9½d.  In the summer of 1935 prices ranged from 9d. to 5d. per gallon.  Last winter the prices were from 9d. to 7d., and during the present summer, until the recent agreement was reached, the price was in many cases as low as 5½d. and 6d., and even below that, delivered in Dublin.  That would be 4½d. collected at the farm in some places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of conferences were held between the farmers and distributors during the past few weeks with a view to improving the prices paid to farmers.  The distributors, owing to the lack of organisation in the business, felt that they could not pay increased prices unless the farmers were prepared to give a guarantee that no farmer would break the price. <Col N="1534" /> Eventually the producers were in a position to give that guarantee, and the agreement was made.  The distributors agreed, on their side, to observe the agreement that had been made, and, as long as the farmers or producers have a compact organisation such as they have now, it is possible that the agreement may be kept.  It is feared, however, that these arrangements are at best only temporary&mdash;in fact, the agreement is made only until the end of September, and it is possible that these prices may be broken through unless there is some legislation in order to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>As pointed out here already, the difficulty is that there is more milk available for the Dublin market than it can absorb, but that is no reason why farmers, for the amount of milk they sell at any rate, should not get an economic price.  Under this Bill an attempt will be made, as far as possible, to take some surplus milk from the farmers and dispose of it as best the board can.  It will be possible under this Bill to regulate the price of milk on the Dublin market, and, of course, in any other area to which the Bill may apply, since the Bill is a general one.</P>
    <P>The scheme of legislation is that the Minister shall have power to declare, by Order, any particular area specified to be a sale district or any particular area to be a production district, both of which will together form a joint (sale and supply) district. Whenever a milk (joint district) Order is made the board shall be established for the joint district consisting of as many representatives of milk producers and wholesalers and retailers, in respect of each joint district as the Minister may determine, and the chairman of each board will be appointed in all cases by the Minister. The first members of the board will be nominated by the Minister and, as soon as possible, when the registers are built up, these boards will be elected; that is, that the farmers who are on the register of suppliers will have a vote for their own nominees, and distributors and retailers likewise, as soon as the registers have been completed.  When that is done, the elected boards will hold office for <Col N="1535" /> three years.  Practically all the functions of this Bill will be performed by the board when it is formed.  The board will keep registers of producers, wholesalers and retailers of milk, and only producers whose premises are situate in the production district specified for any particular sale district will be eligible for registration as producers, and only producers who are registered and whose premises are registered will be permitted by law to supply milk to the city or towns concerned, as the Bill may apply.</P>
    <P>In the same way, registered wholesalers and registered retailers only will be permitted to take milk and they will be permitted to take milk only from a registered producer. The expression &ldquo;producer&rdquo; includes creamery proprietors, registered under the Dairy Produce Act, 1934.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, if a board is set up in Dublin they could not register a producer unless he had already got a licence under the Milk and Dairies Act.  That is a <i>sine qua non.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be illegal otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It will be unlawful, after an appointed day, for a registered producer to sell milk to a registered wholesaler or retailer or for a registered wholesaler or retailer to purchase milk from a registered producer, except in accordance with a contract for the purpose made between the parties and approved by the board.  The contract must state the price, which will be at least the minimum price&mdash;although it may be more&mdash;and the contract will <Col N="1536" /> also specify the quantity of milk to be supplied daily.  Existing contracts, when the appointed day comes, may become void, and new contracts may have to be entered into.  It might be the case that in an emergency such as sometimes occurs, where, for instance, there might be a big influx of visitors into Dublin, or for some other reason such as, say, a heavy snowfall in the winter time, it would not be possible to get sufficient milk from the ordinary producers, and there is a provision in the Bill which enables the board to give a special permit to a person to bring in milk from outside the registered producers, but that permit, naturally, would only be given in extreme cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A levy at a rate to be prescribed by the Minister may be collected by the board on all sales of milk to which the Act applies.  We discussed the levy very fully already and the things for which it would be raised, such as the expenses of the board. remuneration of the chairman, salaries of staff, office accommodation, purchase of surplus milk for manufacturing purposes, cost of any scheme for promotion of the increased consumption of milk where the board would turn their attention to popularising milk in schools, and so on, or any object of that kind. It will be costly, at least, in the beginning, and a certain amount will be required to finance it.  The Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may prescribe maximum retail prices to be charged for different kinds of milk sold under different conditions.  If an Order is made in relation to a specified kind of milk sold under specified conditions, it will be unlawful for any person to charge more than the appropriate prescribed price for such kind of milk sold under such conditions. Amongst the matters raised in the discussion already is that the wholesaler is perhaps charging too much to the retailer.  If the board consider that the wholesaler is charging too much to the retailer, and if they recommend to the Minister that action should be taken, the Minister may then prescribe a minimum <Col N="1537" /> price at which milk can be sold retail, whether over the counter or delivered to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Milk is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;whole milk which is sold for consumption as whole milk, or is used in the manufacture of butter, cheese, cream or ice cream,&rdquo; and consequently milk used in the manufacture of condensed or powdered milk is not included in the scope of the Bill.  That means that manufacturers who are making sweets or toffee, or confectioners who are making confectionery, cakes, and so on, which require condensed or powdered milk, will not be compelled to pay the fixed price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that good milk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  In the first place, it gives an opportunity to the board to dispose of a surplus at a price somewhat below the price at which it is sold to the ordinary consumer, and, in the second place, it gives an opportunity to those people to carry on their business, and to take the milk from the source from which they are taking it at present if they wish.  Some of them are taking that milk from the manufacturers of dried milk or condensed milk in the country, while others are condensing milk themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not, I believe, difficult to follow, because, for one thing, there is no reference to previous legislation, and, therefore, reading through it is only a matter of studying the meaning of the Bill without referring to previous Acts.  Part I contains the usual preliminary and general clauses dealing with Orders, definitions, and so on.  Under Part II, power is taken to set up a board for each joint sale and supply district which may be established under the Bill; to register producers and distributors of milk in each joint district; to restrict the sale of milk in each district to registered persons; to collect levy on such milk for the expenses of the board, and to fix minimum prices below which milk may not be sold in such district.  Under Section 6, the Minister may, whenever the need for so doing arises, prescribe joint districts to which the Act will apply, and such districts will each comprise a sale district, in which milk may not be sold <Col N="1538" /> except in conformity with the provisions of the Act, and an associated supply district.  We must define a sale district as a district within which milk must not be sold at less than the minimum price by suppliers, and must also fix a supply district, a district from which wholesalers or retailers, as the case may be, are permitted to draw their supplies.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 29 relate to the constitution, powers, duties and finances of boards set up for joint districts. Boards will be corporate bodies, consisting of a chairman and as many producer members, retailer members, and wholesaler members as may be decided upon, having regard to the local conditions in the district for which the board is established.  It was considered advisable to leave that matter open, because in the City of Dublin, for instance, we may find it necessary to give a certain representation to a rather large supplying district.</P>
    <P>There will also be the consideration of giving a certain representation to both retailers and wholesalers, and, to get a balance between these numbers, it may be necessary to have a larger board there than you would have in a smaller town where there might be no wholesalers, and perhaps in such a district a smaller board would be sufficient.  As I have said already, the chairman of each board will be nominated by the Minister, and he will have much the same powers as the chairman of the Pigs Board has in the fixation of prices, that is, if there is disagreement, the chairman will decide.  It is quite easy to imagine, I think, that the producers of milk would be looking for a higher price than the wholesaler or retailer would be prepared to pay, and there would be a deadlock unless the chairman had this power of deciding between them.</P>
    <P>The other points arising here are matters dealing with the filling of casual vacancies on the boards.  The method by which the boards are to be constituted as soon as the registers are set up is much the same as in other legislation, particularly legislation dealing with the Pigs Board, and it requires no explanation, at this stage, at any rate.  The board will have power to <Col N="1539" /> employ staff, secretary and inspectors, and so on, on conditions prescribed by the Minister.  The Minister will lay down conditions with regard to remuneration, service, and so on, and the board will then make the appointments. The boards will have to establish registers of producers, retailers and wholesalers, and to keep those registers, and, as soon as those registers have been made up, regular elections to the boards will be held, and, so far as that is concerned, matters should be in order after a short time.  There is the usual power with regard to the cancelling of registration.  If a person procures his registration through fraud or misrepresentation, asks to have his name withdrawn, is adjudged bankrupt or is convicted of an offence under the Act&mdash;all these matters are set out as being reasons for which the board may take a person's name off the register. A person will get the usual notice, and will have an opportunity of making representations if he thinks he has been unfairly dealt with.</P>
    <P>The big question which the board has to deal with is the question of price, and the method by which the price will be fixed is set out in Sections 42 and 43. In the first instance, when the board is set up, they will decide on the price. That decision will be communicated to the Minister, who will then fix the price payable.  In respect of subsequent changes, it will be a matter of recommendation to the Minister.  If they recommend a change of price, the Minister will consider it and make such change in the original price, or not make such change, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There is an appointed day as soon as the board think they have everything in order, registers built up and so on, after which no milk can be supplied except under contract which states the price and quantity.  Under Sections 49 and 50 the board may buy at less than the statutory minimum price from registered wholesalers and sell or use it for manufacturing purposes. It would be absolutely impossible for a wholesaler or retailer to buy the exact quantity of milk required.  If he wants to make certain that all consumers will get the amount of milk they require he will obviously <Col N="1540" /> have a surplus, practically every day, because he must overshoot the mark a little in order that everyone gets enough.  That surplus will have to be dealt with.  The board will have power to take the surplus and to decide what quantity they will take. They have power to deal with the surplus and to decide whether to have it made into butter or sold for manufacturing purposes.  There is a use for milk for purposes besides consumption as liquid milk.  They will have to decide whether they will sell it at a cheap rate so as to popularise the use of milk in certain industries.  Some part of the proceeds of the levy will be used for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to leave that discretion to the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We must give them power to buy milk from wholesalers at less than the fixed price.  If a wholesaler felt that he could sell whatever surplus he had at the fixed price, he would not exercise the necessary discretion, knowing that he would be paid.  Perhaps he would buy more than he required, thinking that if a rush came he would have plenty, and that if a rush did not come he would not lose anything.  In that case it would be necessary for the board to pay a wholesaler something less than the wholesale price in order to make him cautious about the quantity he would buy.  The board may contribute out of the funds to be placed at their disposal towards advertising to popularise the use of milk.  The final section provides that the Minister may, after a consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, fix the maximum price at which milk of a specified kind may be sold.  That power is put into the Bill because, on previous occasions in the case of bacon and cattle, Deputies were rather anxious that when legislation of this kind was introduced the Minister should take power to fix retail prices. Power is being taken here, but I am not sure whether it will be possible to reduce retail prices in the city. Naturally we will have to get some advice from the board before fixing <Col N="1541" /> prices.  Although the Minister is not bound under the Bill to follow the advice of the board he would naturally try to get advice before fixing retail prices.</P>
      <P>It was stated that wholesalers were buying milk at 8d. and selling to the retailers at 1/- a gallon.  I do not think that is true.  It is hard to know what are the circumstances, but I think they were selling to retailers at 11d. Supposing it was 11d., it is very hard for me, or for officers of my Department to know whether they are justified in charging that margin or not. After some experience of the working of the Act, and after consultation with the wholesalers and the retailers, it may be possible to come to a reasonable understanding with these people, and to get the margin down to a proper level.  Perhaps that may be done without making an Order at all, as it is very often the case, with some legislation, when the power is there, it is not necessary to use it.  In any event it may be well to have the power.  That is an outline of the Bill and it is the first of this kind that has been introduced.  The board is somewhat on the lines of the Pigs Marketing Board, as we are getting producers, distributors or retailers to come together jointly to try to fix prices and to regulate the industry. The big difficulty, as we realise, is that there is more milk in the vicinity of Dublin than the city can consume.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does anybody in this House seriously believe that there is more milk coming to the City of Dublin than the city is able to consume? It is perfectly true that there is more milk in Dublin than the people can afford to buy, but there is a very wide difference between these two statements.  I want Deputies to make up their minds about this: Do they desire to fix the price of milk in the <Col N="1542" /> City of Dublin at such a figure that a large section of the people will not be able to buy milk?  If they are going to do that they ought to do it with their eyes open.  Deputy Belton spends a great deal of his time dealing with the poor and the destitute in the City and the County of Dublin, and he knows what an immense difference it makes in a poor household with a large number of children, if there is an abundant supply of milk there.  It is the difference in that household between starvation and reasonable nourishment, and I do not think any interest, farmers or otherwise, wants to withhold abundant supplies of milk from poor children.  I cannot imagine any rational man subscribing to the statement that there is more milk coming to this city than the city can absorb.  There is not half enough milk coming to the City of Dublin.  That is not peculiar to the City of Dublin. It is peculiar to almost every industrial city in Great Britain and Ireland, and has recently been the subject of an elaborate report by experts in Great Britain, who pointed out that there should be a vast increase in the quantity of milk consumed.  Professor Drew, of University College, recently delivered a speech at the Albert Agricultural College, under the patronage of the Minister for Agriculture, in which he pointed out that there was plenty of room for doubling the consumption of milk in the city without giving any one more than the minimum quantity they ought to consume.</P>

    <P>The Minister introduced this Bill to-day and explained that since 1931-32 the winter price of milk had fallen from 1/1 to an average of 8d. and the summer price from 9½d. to 9¼d. Perhaps this is the beginning of some of the repercussions of the economic war.  When you make one branch of agriculture wholly unprofitable, and when other farmers get into that branch, and throw their output on a market that is unorganised and unable to absorb it, most undesirable consequences ensue.  The problem is not going to arise only in connection with milk.  It is going to arise in connection with every other branch.  If you make the production of live stock hopelessly unprofitable, and subsidise the <Col N="1543" /> production of grain, everybody will go into grain, and when there is a surplus of grain, no matter what steps you can take you will not be able to fit grain production into the stomachs of the people even though you fill everyone's stomach.</P>
    <P>That situation arises because of an inept and incompetent Government interfering with the agricultural industry.  It has resulted in an excessive number of persons getting into the milk business, before the Dublin market was organised for the reception of increased quantities of milk, and an artificial glut on the market which has given rise to the present difficulties.  What happened?  Instead of trying to get to the root of the difficulty and to increase the market for milk in the City of Dublin&mdash;and all Parties agree that it could be increased with great benefit to public health&mdash;a Bill of 55 sections is introduced at the end of a long Parliamentary session, at a few weeks' notice, after studiously refraining from taking any steps that would remedy a situation that has been developing for the last six years, until a group of farmers came along to start a riot in a railway station.  That was the only way to extract reforms from the Fianna Fáil Government, to start a riot, but if that impression gets abroad it will not be good for the country or for any section of the community.  I do not know if Deputies are acquainted with the report of the Commission dealing with the reorganisation of milk supplies in Great Britain.  They had this problem of milk distribution there and they invited a committee to sit down to consider it.  Having done so the committee produced a report extending to about 220 pages dealing with the milk problem there.  Founded on that report a Bill was drafted and enacted into law in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We are presented with a Bill of 52 sections, and I repeat that nobody in this House, not excepting the Minister for Agriculture, has the faintest notion of all the implications involved in the situation.  The Minister has a couple of sheets of paper which have been prepared for him and which are <Col N="1544" /> of a very sketchy character.  He says that this Bill is very much like the Bacon Bill in its machinery.  He tells us nothing as to what effect he anticipates this Bill is going to have on the price of milk in the city.  He takes power to regulate the price of milk. Can he tell us now what he thinks the price of milk will be in the City of Dublin?  He says that at present he does not know anything, but that he hopes that when the milk board is established they will be able to tell him what to do.  Would it not be better to find out what he ought to do before he introduces legislation and then legislate in accordance with what he believes he ought to do?  Why does the Minister, in assumed futility, delegate all his functions to a milk marketing board of this kind?  Surely he ought to know what he wants the board to do?  Surely he ought to have some idea which he could communicate to the House of the price which he thinks the people of the city ought to pay for milk?  Surely he ought to be able to tell us whether he has made any calculations as to what the costs of production of milk are?  Does he know or has he inquired?  I do not think he has.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the machinery of this board is going to be similar to the machinery of the Bacon Marketing Board.  If that is so, God help the consumers of this country.  The Bacon Marketing Board was set up and delivered from the authority of this House.  It has consistently gouged and plundered the bacon producers of the country ever since it was established, and every attempt that was made in this House to raise the question of the activities of the Bacon Marketing Board has been opposed by the Minister on the ground that he has no authority over it.  At the present moment the Bacon Marketing Board have illegally fixed prices for bacon, which have resulted in the consuming public of this country paying, through the price of bacon, a large part of the export bounties that used to be charged on the Exchequer.  That illegal activity is being carried on with the connivance and encouragement of the Minister for Agriculture.  The producers are being plundered by the Pigs Marketing Board.  They are being <Col N="1545" /> plundered with the connivance and the assistance of the two gentlemen put on the Board by the Minister to represent the producers of pigs in this country. No Deputy can raise the issues that arise in connection with the Pigs Marketing Board in this House, because the Minister protests that he has divested himself of all responsibility in that regard.  If this milk board is going to function in the same way as the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board, the net result may well be that the consumers of this country, the consumers in the cities, will be made to carry a burden out of all proportion to what they ought to be asked to carry.</P>
    <P>I believe that an economic price must be got for milk, not because I love the farmers' lovely blue eyes but because my experience is that if you make the production of any particular thing uneconomic, the end of it will be that everybody will get out of production.  We have got to have milk, and, in order to get milk, we have got to pay an economic price to the people who produce it.  If the futility, the ineptitude and incompetence of the Government create a situation in which the normal markets for milk are dislocated, then the damages which have to be paid for the incompetence of the Government ought to be charged upon the Exchequer.  You have no right, simply because you have got an incompetent as Minister for Agriculture, to levy a tax on the consumers of milk in order to pay for his futility.  The net result of this legislation is going to be that an artificial price will have to be fixed for milk coming into the city which will be financed by increasing the prices of milk in the city by ½d. per pint.  That means that the entire burden of the cost of remedying the existing difficulty is going to be borne by the milk consumers. You cannot take blood out of a turnip or water out of a stone and if a tenement dweller in this city has got a certain amount of money for milk, she has got to be satisfied with the quantity of milk that that money will buy.  If the money will not allow her to purchase another <Col N="1546" /> pint of milk, she has simply got to do without it.  I say it is an outrageous proposal that whatever reforms should be necessary in order to remedy the defects that exist in the supply of milk to the City of Dublin at present, should be financed out of the pockets of the poor consumers of milk in the city.</P>
    <P>While I know that the farmers who are supplying milk want an economic price and feel that they are agitating vigorously for it, I do not believe that any farmer in Kildare, Meath, Wicklow or elsewhere wants to put the burden of the increase on the consumers of milk because the farmer knows the circumstances of the vast majority of the people who buy milk. I again suggest to the Minister that instead of rushing this Bill through and delegating the duties, which this House has, of regulating the milk supply of the city to a milk board, he should set up a commission to inquire into the situation obtaining, just as a commission was set up in Great Britain.  After that a Bill can be introduced which would provide for the interests of the parties concerned&mdash;milk producers, distributors and consumers.  If needs be, that Bill could authorise the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to inaugurate schemes for the consumption of any temporary surplus of milk that may be on the market by the children of the poor in the primary schools of the city.  I venture to say that if a scheme of that kind were put in hand it would be very quickly found that instead of more milk coming into the city than the city was able to consume, we would have to go further afield for further supplies of milk.  Money spent in that way would be much more profitably spent than on unemployment assistance or cheap beef.</P>
    <P>Let me say this word in conclusion, that in circumstances such as surround this milk problem, when nobody knows all the facts, it is only too easy to start a campaign of vilification and slander against those persons who are engaged in the milk distributing business.  I would much prefer to have this matter dispassionately examined and have every detail of this problem investigated <Col N="1547" /> by a competent committee when, if there was any blame attaching to the distributors, it could be fairly fixed upon them.  But in the absence of conclusive proof that the distributors of milk in this city are behaving unjustly to the consumers or producers, I think Deputies should be chary about denouncing them in the unmeasured terms that some of them have seen fit to employ.  From what I hear, the life of a milk distributor in this city is no bed of roses.  Milk distribution is hard, arduous work.  There has to be a lot of give and take about it and, whatever is to be made in the business, I do not see any millionaires conducting dairies.</P>
    <P>I feel at a considerable loss in dealing with this matter because I am painfully aware of my own lack of information in regard to it and I am painfully aware that no Deputy in this House knows this industry in all its aspects and is really competent to deal with the problem as it ought to be dealt with.  If any sense of responsibility obtained here, some kind of commission of inquiry would be instituted, so that this matter might be satisfactorily and permanently disposed of.  Until that is done, I am not prepared to support any measure of this kind, because I believe it may result in very serious injustice to the people least able to bear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that it is quite easy to follow this Bill.  That may be.  At the same time, there are some points in it that are not quite clear to the ordinary reader.  For instance, in Part 1, sub-section (2) of Section 2, it is laid down that, for the purposes of Part 3 of the Bill, milk dealt with at premises registered under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, shall be deemed to have been produced at such premises.  What is the purpose of dealing with creameries in this way, because I take it that, if the Minister makes an Order fixing a retail price, they will be bound by it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several other matters also call for <Col N="1548" /> consideration.  There are registered producers, registered retailers and registered wholesalers, and each section can be registered in its proper place.  Can a person be registered as a producer and as a retailer as well? There are large numbers of dairymen in the County Dublin who distribute the milk produced by their own cows. So far as I can see, that practice is not expressly forbidden, but I should like the Minister to say if a person can be registered both as a producer and as a retailer.  Presumably, a person producing and selling milk in this way would pay a levy on each gallon of milk so consumed.  The Minister suggested that a levy of ¼d. per gallon would probably enable the board to carry out all the work it would be required to do.  I should be pleased to hear that that was the maximum figure.  If, however, the board was not very careful, it might easily find that ¼d. per gallon would be totally inadequate to cover the cost of advertising milk, and the cost that would be incurred if the board were to engage in a manufacture that would require milk as its raw material.  The Minister will say that he would be very careful before allowing the board to embark on schemes of manufacture and on advertising schemes with a view to increasing the consumption of milk. Other Deputies have said&mdash;I entirely agree with them&mdash;that the best way to increase the consumption of milk would be to supply clean, first-class, high-grade milk at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to foresee all the ramifications of this board.  The prices are to be regulated, and, evidently, the Minister is rather doubtful as to whether or not he will start by fixing the retail price.  Apparently, he will leave that to come about in its own way.  He is concerned that the producers should get an economic price.  It is perfectly evident that there would not be the glut of milk in this market that there is if the production of butter were an economic proposition.  As Deputy Dillon has said, the farmer, having been driven out of production of butter, has invaded the milk market.  The Minister may say that he is a realist and that he is facing facts.  In so far as he is doing that, we have to sympathise <Col N="1549" /> with him and consider his problems. If he does not start with the retail price, and work backwards from that, what will be the position?  The board will have to fix the price the producers are to get on their farms in the country.  They will, then, have to fix the price for producers on their farms in County Dublin.  Then they will have to fix a price for producers delivering milk in Dublin.  Then there comes the question of the wholesalers, where they intervene between the producers and retailers.  What price are wholesalers to pay for milk delivered at their headquarters?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he is not very careful something like this will happen.  He will start by saying: &ldquo;I will fix the producers' price at, say, 8d. a gallon.&rdquo; I am merely suggesting that figure for the purpose of argument.  I do not say that it represents the correct price, in my opinion. I do not pose as an expert in the price of milk.  Now, the retailer will probably say that he will have to get the milk at a certain price above that figure.  The wholesaler will probably have to come in at something between that, and the next question then is that having fixed that all along the line, it looks as if the consumer in the long run will pay for everything.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that if he is going in for regulating prices, he will find it a very difficult thing if he does not control prices right along the line.  For instance, during the late European war they found in England that if they did not fix a price for everything right along the line, there was a difficulty right from the outset.  I am afraid the Minister will find it exactly the same in this matter.  He will either have to control it all or none of it.  I would remind the Minister of the case of the disappearing rabbit throughout the country.  An uneconomic price was fixed for rabbits, and it was found that there were no rabbits.  The Minister has got a very difficult task to fulfil in the settling of these differences on the various boards.  He has certainly armed himself with plenty of power.  It seems to be an extraordinary position in which the chairman <Col N="1550" /> is a quorum and on the question of prices can listen to everybody and then say: &ldquo;I disagree with the whole lot of you and so I will fix the price myself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We would be sorry to see that state of affairs translated into the political arena.  Imagine, for instance, a place like a county council where you would endow the chairman with the power of saying: &ldquo;I disagree with the entire county council and I am going to pass a resolution myself and make all the orders necessary.&rdquo; I think the Minister should give us some indication how far he intends to embark on trading in these boards.  I say that because, as I have said previously, if he is not very careful he may find that he has merely handed over considerable sums of the consumers' money to make experiments in increasing the consumption of milk, when the obvious way of increasing the consumption of milk lies in quite another direction.  I wish to conclude with these few observations and I hope the Minister, in his reply, will deal fully with the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is an extraordinary production to meet a very serious situation.  I do not think anybody realises that more than the Minister himself.  The whole framework of this Bill is nearly a year old, and the Minister has hesitated, and rightly hesitated, about putting it into operation.  The desperate position which the farmers found themselves reduced to a couple of weeks ago drove them into the action they took.  The proverbial worm turned.  When they see all that the Minister has been able to give them I think they will definitely turn.  The Minister realises and admitted throughout his introductory speech that the whole trouble is the surplus of milk.  The farmers' trouble was an uneconomic price.  Naturally, when there is a surplus of anything the price will be low.  It was not looking for a market the farmers were when <Col N="1551" /> they took action a few days ago, but looking for an economic price for their milk.  I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;he carefully evaded it in his introductory speech&mdash;whether this Bill proposes to give them an economic price for their milk, which is alleged to be a glut in the Dublin market.  He has, I suppose under advice, adopted the principle in this joint board which all up-to-date dairymen in Dublin have adopted from experience for many years.  He is giving this joint board power to work off surplus milk.  Every prudent dairyman had pretty well every day of his life to work off surplus milk.</P>
      <P>There is nothing original in the conception of this Bill.  The Minister is trying to establish a kind of super-dairyman for handling the milk trade, and in that he proposes to destroy all private enterprise and initiative.  On whose advice is he doing that?  I challenge him to produce the advice of any successful dairyman or farmer.  I know there have been a number of job-hunters, broken-down creamery managers, promoting organisations of this kind for the last year and a half. Have any successful dairymen, who knuckled down and built up their own business, advised the Minister on these lines?  The Minister realises that it is a problem of finding a market for a very perishable commodity that has a surplus.  Driven to the wall, as he was a couple of weeks ago, he had to fix maximum prices.  In introducing the Bill, he said that these could not be sustained.  He had to go on, and, driven to fix prices, he has gone on and produced this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that, instead of the Minister and the Government generally facing up to the outstanding facts of the economic situation which confronts this country at present, due entirely to the policy pursued by the Government, they bring in a Bill.  A year ago we spent a long time passing a Milk and Dairy Bill through all its stages in this House until it became an Act.  Was there any necessity for that Act?  Why is it not in operation now? It was hung up as soon as it was passed and it has never been put into <Col N="1552" /> operation.  Here is a Bill which proposes to cut right across the fundamentals of that Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell, in referring to the way to increase milk consumption, said that if a good, clean article is produced at a reasonable price the consumption will go up.  Is the Minister proposing to do that?  Section 2 of this Bill says:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;milk&rdquo; means whole milk which is sold for consumption as whole milk or is used in the manufacture of butter, cheese, cream or ice-cream.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that such milk is prohibited by law from sale in Northern Ireland and Great Britain as unfit for human consumption as liquid milk.  I do not think the Minister will contradict that statement.  If he does, I have the Order made by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  That Order grades milk into four grades.  Grades A, B and C can be sold for human consumption as liquid milk.  A licence is not required for the production or sale of grade D milk, but such milk may not be sold for human consumption as whole milk.  Grade D milk is milk produced under these conditions&mdash;milk not sold under a grade A, B or C licence.  Grade D milk cannot be sold for consumption as liquid milk and must be disposed of on the farm or sold for manufacturing purposes.  That will usually mean sale to a creamery. That milk is not subject to any inspection at its source and the milk the Minister proposes to have dumped into the City of Dublin is milk that is not subject to any inspection whatever at the source of production.</P>
    <P>While I agree that this matter requires investigation at the moment, I at the same time agree with the view put forward by Deputy Dillon that the Minister should go slowly and get sound advice.  The members of the County Dublin Board of Health, at their meeting to-day, asked themselves these questions: &ldquo;What are we paying a veterinary organisation for in the County Dublin?  What are we paying a medical officer of health and the organisation of his department for in the County Dublin?&rdquo; If a single <Col N="1553" /> farmer in County Dublin sold, in the City of Dublin, the milk certified by the Minister in this Bill he would be prosecuted, and, mind you, prosecuted not under any bye-law made by the Dublin County Council or by the County Dublin Board of Health, but under an Act passed by this House. Why should the people of the County Dublin be taxed to provide machinery to make the cost of the production of milk greater in their case than it is elsewhere?  The people in the County Dublin are obliged to do that by an Act of this House under the Milk and Dairies Order and under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order.  This Bill is now before the House while we have on the Statute Book an Act, passed last year, the object of which was to provide a cleaner and better milk supply to the people of this country, that has never been put into operation.  We are asked by the Minister to give a Second Reading to a Bill the object of which is to provide us with milk that, according to experts and to the report of the Milk Commission that sat in Great Britain, and according to the best opinion that we have at the present time, is unfit for human consumption. I do not know whether it is unfit for human consumption or not, but what I do know is that under an Act passed by the Oireachtas the obligation has been imposed on farmers in the County Dublin not to produce that milk.</P>
    <P>In the County Dublin we have been obliged to set up machinery under the Department of Agriculture and under the Department of Local Government and Public Health, but in view of the introduction of this Bill we have decided to call a meeting for Tuesday next to decide as to whether we are going to scrap the organisation that we have in the County Dublin.  If other counties can produce cheaper milk and sell it in the market at our doors, then we are going to produce milk and to scrap the machinery that we have been compelled to provide.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks that, by juggling with an organisation, he is going to get a better price for the milk. We all know that you can only put into a gallon measure a gallon of stuff. It has been said that about 20,000 <Col N="1554" /> gallons of milk per day are required to supply the needs of the City of Dublin, and that after meeting that demand there is still a surplus available. How does the Minister propose to find a market for that surplus in the city?  He is proposing to introduce a series of registrations, the object in view being to attempt to get an economic price for the milk and to have a market for all the milk that is offered.  Joint boards are to be set up, prices are to be fixed and machinery provided whereby both wholesalers and retailers can buy more milk than they require.  A dump will be provided for that, because that is really what it amounts to, by the board which apparently will manufacture all the surplus milk that goes into the dump into butter.  I presume that butter will be sold at a lower price than the prevailing price for creamery butter. Obviously, butter made from milk that is carted about to many destinations and that finally cannot get a market as liquid milk, and is then brought to this dump, will hardly be up to the same standard of quality as butter made from fresh milk.  There will be a loss on that milk.</P>
    <P>When people know that there is a dump they may not be so anxious about the amount of milk they buy. They may be inclined to buy too much knowing that they have the dump to put it into.  But where, in all the organisation of this Bill, is there any further outlet for milk?  At the present time every dairyman in Dublin is producing more milk than he requires for his contracts or for his customers.  He knows that he must always have a little extra milk.  Following a cold night, the quantity of milk that he gets from his own cows may be reduced by 10 per cent., so that the prudent dairyman who wants to hold his customers and to obviate the necessity of buying milk from other people, the quality of which he cannot guarantee, always aims at producing a surplus which he churns into butter. Now, instead of one person doing that, the Minister proposes in this Bill to jumble all these little surpluses into a dump.  All that milk is to be churned into butter, but so far as I can see the Minister is not making any other <Col N="1555" /> attempt to provide a further outlet for the milk.</P>
    <P>The board will be confronted with two problems.  One will be not to admit into the city, or into a sale area, any more milk than is required for use as liquid milk.  It will either have to limit the supply of milk or allow milk in <i>ad lib</i> and then turn the surplus into the dump to make inferior butter.  But does that remedy the situation with which the Minister has been called upon to deal, and it was to remedy that situation, apparently, that he introduced this Bill?  I do not see that it brings him one inch further.</P>
    <P>There may be a nominal minimum price fixed, higher than the prices that have been obtainable in the last couple of years, but the levies will have to go up, because the joint board will sustain a loss.  That loss will increase as the amount of milk allowed into the sale area exceeds the amount of consumption in that area.  That loss will have to be made up by a levy on the whole of the milk, so that the net result will be that the price of milk will go down, or the supply must be curtailed.  What is going to be done with the land which is producing that milk?  First of all, what is going to be done with that milk if it is not admitted into the towns but is turned back into the country?  By creating an artificial shortage you can keep up the price.  You can fix a minimum price for a certain number of gallons, but the whole problem is not that price but what is to be done with the extra amount of milk.  I certainly cannot see in this Bill&mdash;and the Minister has not elaborated the point&mdash;any indication as to what will be done with that milk.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, and to a lesser extent Deputy Dockrell, touched upon the main point.  The trouble with the market to-day is that there are people producing milk in the last couple of years who never before produced milk for sale.  Why are they producing it? Because they had nothing on their land which they could turn into cash. Instead of dry stock, which proved a failure on their hands, they went in <Col N="1556" /> for cows.  They sent milk to the local towns; they sent milk up to the City of Dublin.  The result is that there is a superabundant supply of milk, and, of course, down goes the price. Does the Minister not realise that it is not at milk he should start in order to relieve the milk situation in Dublin? Is it not clear to him that that situation is a manifestation of the failure of the Government policy in regard to agriculture?  The people would not be producing milk and sending it to Dublin at 5½d. per gallon unless that was the best profit they could get out of their land.  If those people could make a better profit by tilling their land, by growing any of the ordinary agricultural crops, by grazing dry stock, by raising sheep, by growing corn or wheat or the famous beet, they would not be sending milk to Dublin at that price.  One does not require any expert knowledge of agriculture or any other business in order to realise that.  If there is any grumbling about the price of an article produced in a workshop or a field where other articles are capable of being produced, and the price of that article which is being produced at the moment is not an economic one, the fact that the people still continue to produce it at that uneconomic price is in itself proof that, although it is not an economic price, it is more nearly an economic price than that which can be secured for any other article capable of production in the same workshop or the same field.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the general agricultural policy, but the Minister should realise that the uneconomic price of 5½d. a gallon for milk, and the fact that the people have no line of retreat from the production of milk but are forced to go on producing it at that price, are proof of the fact&mdash;and he ought to sit up and take notice of it&mdash; that that is the best which can be made out of land under his administration. The situation generally is very serious, and it must come to a head sooner or later.  Perhaps we are nearer to its coming to a head now than we realise.  My opinion is that this Bill, perhaps unknown to the Minister, puts him and his Government in the dock. The uneconomic price of 5½d. a gallon <Col N="1557" /> for milk is the best that can be made out of the best land in Ireland within five miles of this city.  The Minister proposes in this Bill to fix an artificial price for that article sold in the limited market, and by a series of registration fees and levies he tries to deceive himself into the belief that he is raising the price.</P>
    <P>He is going to set up a new department somewhat similar to the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board.  If it is to be similar&mdash; I am quoting his own words&mdash;then if the price is to be kept up it will have to limit production as in the case of the Bacon Marketing Board.  That new department is going to cost something. The chairman is going to be a civil servant, though perhaps he may not be so styled.  The Chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board and the Chairman of the Bacon Marketing Board have not, I think, been so styled.  A question put to the Minister about pigs or bacon is very neatly side-tracked by him. He says: &ldquo;The Pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board is dealing with that.  I have no control over them.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture has no control over pigs and bacon? I suppose he will be telling us in the near future that he has no control over milk either.  If he keeps on legislating in this way he will legislate himself out of existence.  It will be a race between the Minister and the farmer as to which of them will go out of existence first.  There are many points in the Bill that require attention, but this is hardly the appropriate Stage at which to go into them in detail. They will be more properly dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister, when replying, would deal with the all-important question which prompted this legislation, and that is the low price for milk and the limited market for liquid milk.  I should like him to tell us how he proposes in this Bill to raise that price of milk without keeping back the surplus&mdash;without letting in anything but what is required or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>If those are the lines he proposes to pursue, in order to get what he styles an economic price for the milk producers, <Col N="1558" /> will he tell us what is going to happen to the milk that is being produced, of which there is now a surplus here, that is pulling down the price below the economic level?  If it is to be thrown back on the people's hands, they will stop the production of so much milk, and what is going to be done with the land then and how is the Minister going to face up to that problem?  It will not be solved by any sleight-of-hand tricks such as levies and apparently inflated prices &mdash; prices the effect of which is taken back again by a levy per gallon on the amount of milk sold in order to pay for the loss that will be on the dump, for there will be a big loss there, and superimposed on the expenses of marketing milk in the future.  If this Bill goes through you will have the cost of this machinery of the milk marketing board, as one might call it, and you will have the cost of the big staff that will be required, the expenses of the board, and so on.  All that is coming out of the price of milk, because it will be financed out of levies which the milk marketing board will collect from the producers of milk.  So that the Minister's proposition really boils down to this: He has an article for which he wants to get a better price.  There is a small price because there is a surplus of it put on the market.  He now proposes to set up machinery to sell that article in the same market in which it has been sold heretofore.  The market is no larger and the number of articles put on that market will be the same or perhaps greater, as turned out to be the case with pigs when the machinery was set up to deal with that problem.  There was a surplus of pigs produced and they were put on the market.  As I say, the Minister adds to the expenses of marketing by whatever will be the cost of the marketing board or of the general organisation he will set up under this Bill, and all that has to come out of the price.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister increases the cost of marketing.  In other words, he increases the cost of production, and the market remains the same.  How is he going to increase the price?  These are some of the general matters which I certainly should like to hear answered on the Second Stage.  The <Col N="1559" /> more detailed matters relating to sections and sub-sections, and the details of organisation, can best be dealt with in Committee, but I should be very interested to hear the Minister tell us how we will get a better price for milk, in the limited market we have, in the future than we have been receiving in the past, and at the same time provide as big a market in the future as we have had in the past.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister has had time during the last couple of years to see the measure that was introduced and passed into law in connection with the supply of milk in Northern Ireland.  We had a Milk and Dairies Act passed into law here in June of 1935, and now we have another Bill dealing with the matter and following, to some extent, the line of what has been done in Northern Ireland.  It is not with any sense of satisfaction that I venture to say that the Northern Ireland Act appears to me to be a more business-like Milk Act than either of the two measures we have had here.  I will admit at once that the Bill we passed here was, first of all, an earlier measure than the Northern Ireland Bill, but it was more or less a procedure measure.  In that case, we took steps to see how far it was possible to exclude from human consumption milk from animals that were affected by disease&mdash;to see that the milk was bacteriologically sound and so on.  In the measure that was passed in Northern Ireland they took the line of separating the different classes of milk into grades&mdash;grades A. B, and C, as Deputy Belton pointed out&mdash;and, only these three types of milk, which are very lucidly described in the Act, can be supplied for consumption by the public.  In the case of either of the measures that we have had, while steps are taken under one, and under a particular Minister, to exclude any milk that is not of proper quality&mdash; milk that is not free from disease and so on&mdash;there is nothing in this measure to ensure that, when people are getting a better price for their milk than they have been receiving for some time, the quality of the milk they will supply will be up to the standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> The prices that have been mentioned by the Minister in the course of the second part of his speech indicate that there is something wrong with agriculture in this country.  We have been telling the Minister that for a long time, and this surplus of milk that is now becoming evident in the City of Dublin gives further proof of that situation.  Whatever the situation is, however, if by reason of this measure the citizens of Dublin, or of other places that the Minister may schedule by Order, are going to be compelled to pay a higher price, they are at any rate entitled to get the quality of milk that their money is worth.  As far as this measure is concerned, it does not provide any machinery or regulation for dealing with that.</P>
    <P>Now, it might be possible to improve even upon the Northern Ireland Bill. For example, that measure deals principally with the elimination of disease from milk.  The Minister, for instance, might have included in the measure now before us a standard of fats, for the sale of milk.  If the price is going to go up by a few pence per gallon or, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out from 1½d. to 2d. a pint since this new arrangement took place, obviously the people are entitled to get the quality for which they are paying.  That is not unreasonable to expect, but there are no means under this Bill or under the other Bill of ensuring that.  The earlier measure that was taken seeks, along with other steps that the Minister is taking, to eliminate animal disease, but there is no absolute effort made to secure for the people the quality that they ought to get and that it is the Minister's duty to see that they do get.</P>
    <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to what appears to be a slight complication between this Bill and the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935?  In Section 51 it states that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may by Order fix the maximum price at which milk of a specified kind, defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister shall think proper, may be sold or offered for sale.  Now, the Minister has to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce under <Col N="1561" /> that section about milk of a specified kind.  In, I think, Section 36, or 37 or 38 of the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935, the Minister who makes the designation as regards the quality of milk is the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is not mentioned in this Act, but rather the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in consultation. In a later section, I think, of the Milk and Dairies Act, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health must have some consultation with the Minister for Agriculture. Now, with regard to milk of a special designation, the Minister and his Department is the body that should be responsible for that.  His jurisdiction might not conflict and need not conflict with that of the Ministry for Local Government and Public Health, but it should be his Department alone that would have the authority and the duty of having a special designation in respect of milk.  The designation here is more or less permissive.  It says &ldquo;The Minister may,&rdquo; and I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider whether it should not be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in that case.  There ought to be available for purchase by citizens milk which they can be positively certain is free from bacteriological infection, from disease of any sort or kind and has a certain specified percentage of fats.  It may not be possible always to get a certain percentage of fats.  For example, there may be a very wet night or the cows may not have been milked regularly, and in that case there may be some reduction in the percentage of fats, but, in the normal course, one could settle a difficulty of that sort by having an average of a number of days milkings.  However, the Minister ought to consider whether he would not put in some clause which would secure quality for the people, now that he is taking steps to ensure that the producers will get a price.</P>
    <P>The other point which I put to the Minister this evening I again stress. This measure is, to my mind, expensive, and expensive in many directions. There are registers of retailers, wholesalers <Col N="1562" /> and producers; there are joint districts and boards and everything else; and there is going to be enormous expense, not alone on the Minister's Department, but in respect of the boards in getting the levy, which would be met by a Vote of £10,000 or £15,000. That sum of money could scarcely be better spent in the Minister's Department than by a Vote, and it would be much more inexpensively raised and dealt with than by providing all this complicated machinery.  In addition, you have the usual result of an Act like this&mdash;prosecutions and people brought to court in respect of mistakes made in the compiling of returns and so on.</P>
    <P>There is also an objectionable feature in connection with this measure which has crept into other Bills introduced here.  If an official of the Minister's Department or any member of the Gárda Síochána enters the premises of any person and puts a question to any person on the premises and is not immediately attended to, the owner of the premises is liable to prosecution.  One can imagine a question being put to an office boy or messenger in respect of any matter or thing.  For one reason or another, the boy may not have the information, and the owner of the premises is liable to prosecution in that case.  Further, in respect of these interminable inspections and calls by either officials or members of the Gárda Síochána, whether or not they are meant to be intrusive, an officious person may make it very difficult for the owner or a person in charge of a business place to carry on if he comes at an inconvenient time.  It amounts to this, that once any member of the Gárda Síochána or any official of the Minister presents himself, work should stop until the necessary number of questions are put and the official or member of the Gárda answered to his satisfaction.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon started off by asking whether any Deputy would state definitely that there was too much milk coming into Dublin.  We would all like to see more milk coming into Dublin, and we would all like to see everybody in this city, particularly the poor people, drinking more <Col N="1563" /> milk, but asking that question and leaving it to be solved is not going to help the farmers.  If the farmers are getting a poor price for their milk&mdash;5d. a gallon or whatever it is at present&mdash; are we to leave the farmers with that price of 5d. per gallon in order that the poor may get as much milk as possible? Surely the question should be solved in another way.  I did not say that there was too much milk coming in; I said that too much milk was produced in the area to command an economic price.  Perhaps there is a little too much coming in to command that price, but that is the trouble. There is about three or four times as much milk produced in the area that could supply Dublin as is actually coming in.  We are up against that position and this legislation is introduced in order to give the farmers a better price.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of talk here about Great Britain, but Great Britain's problem is very much different from the problem facing us.  Great Britain has not enough milk products to supply her own needs, and, if we were in that position, we could deal with the matter easily.  For instance, we have no great difficulty here in fixing the price of wheat because we know very well that, for some years to come, at any rate, we will not get too much wheat produced in the country and, therefore, we can pay what we consider an economic price to the farmer; but where we have a big surplus of any product for export, we are in quite a different position.  Milk is one of our surplus products and we have to export a certain amount of milk products, the export price of which naturally has a very big influence on the price all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Dillon if I would state what I think the price in the city ought to be.  If I were to bring in a Bill here laying down that the price should be so-and-so and that distributors, retailers and producers should do such-and-such a thing, I am sure Deputy Dillon and Deputies opposite would say &ldquo;The thing is becoming all bureaucratic control; the Minister is interfering in matters he knows <Col N="1564" /> nothing about,&rdquo; and so on.  There might be a certain amount of justification for that.  I have brought in a Bill enabling producers, retailers and wholesalers to fix this matter for themselves and giving them the necessary powers.  I do not think I am called on to say what I think the price of milk should be in Dublin.  It is not my business at all; it is the business of that board to fix it as best it can.  We are giving legislative sanction to an organisation of farmers because we know that the farmers could not maintain that organisation themselves. Deputies opposite know better than I do that it is impossible to organise farmers, either politically or in any other way.  It has to be done by legislation. Deputy Dillon asked why I had not found out what should be done before introducing legislation.  In other words, to have a commission and to put into the Bill what the price should be, who should be supplied, and everything else.  We had the example of Great Britain quoted.  A commission was set up there and Deputy Dillon stated that it produced something like 220 pages.  What did the commission do after sitting for a long time?  They recommended that retailers and producers should regulate the industry.  That was the natural thing to do before any commission sat at all.  We want this industry to be self-supporting and to get away as far as possible from interference by the Government.  I know that Deputies opposite will agree with that.  Deputy Dillon, unfortunately, has left the House now, after making his speech. It is a habit of his.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that the Bacon Board was acting illegally. If it is, he has a remedy.  He accused members of the board of being <Col N="1565" /> parties to a plot to defraud the producers. The Deputy has a remedy by saying that outside and proving it.  He will not do so.  The whole thing about this Bill is that we want farmers to get an economic price.  Deputy Dillon said he wanted that, too, and wants poor people to get milk more cheaply.  I am not going to go back on the political manæuvring of the Party opposite to try to get the votes of the producers and the consumers, but I want to say that inevitably, if Deputy Dillon wants to do that, it leads to a subsidy to farmers, a thing that he has condemned all over the country during the last two or three years.  We read typical speeches by Deputy Dillon, who seems to speak very often in the country, in which he says that farmers do not want subsidies, but want to be allowed to carry on in their own way.  Is not that so?  Deputy Dillon now wants them to get subsidies so that poor people may get milk more cheaply.</P>

      <P>That is all right.  Deputies opposite want to make out that the position is due to the economic war. They know quite well that Great Britain had to take action and that Northern Ireland had to take action and to bring in legislation establishing Milk Boards, although the economic war has not hit them in that particular <Col N="1566" /> way.

      <P>Deputy Dockrell wanted to know if a person could be registered as a producer and a retailer.  He can. With regard to Section 2 (2) a creamery supplying milk to Dublin would be in a peculiar position if that sub-section was not in the Bill, because the producer must be registered and the premises must be registered.  The effect of that sub-section is to make a creamery &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and in that way makes the position easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked if ¼d. a gallon would be sufficient.  Probably it will not if the board goes into business.  At the beginning it will be sufficient to pay staffs and for premises, and perhaps will do a little in the way of dealing with a surplus.  If they have to finance a scheme to any great extent for dealing with surplus milk, ¼d. a gallon would not be sufficient.  That is a matter for the board.  I think we should wait to see if they are able to deal with that problem effectively.  We were told that farmers were driven from butter making into the milk business, and that that was responsible for so many going into milk.  If Deputies opposite honestly want to solve this problem, I think they should take an interest in trying to get farmers better prices. Why should they be looking for reasons to hit this Government rather than for the true reasons?  After all, we are considering this question apart from politics.  The economic war is not responsible for the position.  If it was, what was the urgency of introducing such legislation in England and Northern Ireland?  The economic war was not responsible there.  Is it because people were driven from butter making into liquid milk production?  I do not think there is any foundation for that statement.  In England, Northern Ireland and in Scotland, the system was changed by transport conditions. Deputies opposite do not suggest the Government should be blamed for that. I suppose Deputy Cosgrave is interested in the farmers and would like to <Col N="1567" /> see this problem solved.  If Deputies opposite want to have this question dealt with they should look at it in a fair way to see what is the cause, and having found the true cause, see if it can be solved.  From my knowledge, it appears to me that the whole reason for the change over in the case of these farmers is that lorries are passing their houses, and that it is now possible to send milk to Dublin which was turned into butter before.  That is a big reason why there is a surplus of milk in the City of Dublin at present.  If that is the case, it may be a very difficult problem to solve.  We are putting the onus on the board to do the best it can.  Deputy Belton asked how the surplus was to be dealt with.  Even if the board is driven to taking the surplus for manufacture into butter at the ordinary economic price at which they can take milk for butter making, say 4d. or 4½d., would it not be better for the farmers, even under these circumstances, to sell the surplus or whatever the city will take at an economic price, rather than sell the whole lot at the butter price as they have been doing recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The board would have power, if not directly, indirectly, by getting a fair amount of agreement between distributors, retailers and producers. As far as I can see that is the only way it can be dealt with.  I have been asked why I had no definite proposals about setting up a commission. I do not think we would get nearer a solution if a commission were sitting for 12 months.  The nearest way was to get the board set up and producers registered, and in a short time we will know the amount of milk that is coming to Dublin daily.  I cannot see any other way of getting that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, and perhaps the Deputy will tell me what is on his mind.  Deputy Belton said the farmers were not looking for a market; they were looking for a price.  If that is the case Deputy Belton thinks there is no surplus. I do not know if that is what he meant.  The Deputy said there was nothing original in the Bill; that it was a kind of super-dairy Bill.  It is not necessarily original.  If we can solve this problem without being original, it is all right.  It is not necessary to be original at all. The Deputy asked if I had been advised by successful farmers.  I think so.  I met a number of farmers representing suppliers at many meetings and I think they are successful farmers; men who, having an interest in their business, try to do their best as far as farming goes.  I do not think there is a bit of use in Deputy Belton saying that I met no one but ex-politicians, dismissed creamery managers and so on and that these were the people at the head of this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of grades of milk, I do not see any reason whatever for dealing in this Bill with the grade of milk that is to be supplied. There is clean milk legislation already in existence.  Part of it has not yet been put into operation, but that clean milk legislation will regulate the quality of milk to be supplied to the city.  There will be certain grades specified and people will be compelled to keep their dairies clean, and to see that the milk is produced under hygienic conditions.  After the Minister for Local Government has put this part of the Act into operation, as I believe he intends to do very shortly, then I can, under this section, fix a price for the various grades after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think it is recognised that it is the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to fix prices generally.  Deputy Cosgrave will realise that, under the Ministers and <Col N="1569" /> Secretaries Act, the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be consulted before anybody fixes a price for any consumable product.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is consulted before a Price Fixing Order is issued.  After that is done, the Minister for Agriculture can fix prices for the various grades in order to encourage the production of the best and the cleanest milk for consumption.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that it was not with milk we should start.  I have heard that statement, on every Bill I brought in, from the Opposition.  I was told that I should not start with wheat, that I should not start with beet, that I should not start with flax, that I should not start with tobacco, and now I am told that I should not start with milk.  Deputy Belton said that I had no control over the Pigs Board and that therefore I had no control over pigs or bacon.  He said that I will have no control over the milk board.  If I say that I have no control over the milk board, it does not follow that I have no control over milk.  I say now before the Bill goes any further that if it is passed and if the milk board in the city here does something that does not require my sanction&mdash;for instance, if it removes a name from the register &mdash;and if I am asked a question in the Dáil I shall say that it has nothing to do with me because it was not intended that my sanction should be sought in reference to matters of that kind. There are, however, certain things which the board will do which will require my sanction, and in such cases I shall have to take responsibility for answering questions in reference to them.  I am sorry Deputy Belton has left the House, because he said that sleight-of-hand tricks in this Bill would be of no use.  I was very glad to have the Deputy's assurance on that though there is no use in complimenting him on his being an authority, when he is not here.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Cosgrave was present when I was dealing with the motion in regard to the Financial Resolution. I think this is a case where the levy ought to come out of the price of milk.  As I explained before, in the <Col N="1570" /> case of the Bacon Act, the money voted by the House goes for the expenses of inspection, to see that it is produced under hygienic conditions, and so on. The corresponding legislation in relation to milk is the clean milk legislation. On the other hand, the levies imposed by the Pigs Board for the equalisation of price comes out of the industry.  They go to build up a fund for the equalisation of prices, and naturally that levy must come from the factory or the producer.  In this case also, where it is a trading matter&mdash;and it is absolutely a trading matter, and has nothing to do with hygiene or matters of that kind&mdash;the levy goes altogether in the interests of the trade, in the pushing of further sales of milk, or the disposal of surplus milk, as the case may be.  All that expense is connected with the sale of milk, and not with the quality of milk at all.  If we were dealing with the inspection of milk, or the quality of milk, this House should vote the moneys, but in this particular case I think it is better that the board should have full control over that levy.  If they want to go into trade in a large way, they may prepare their scheme, and they may estimate that they will require a bigger levy, perhaps, than ½d., ¾d. or 1d. per gallon. Having prepared their scheme and estimated that it will take that levy to finance the scheme, they will put the whole proposal before me.  I can then either approve or disapprove of it, and as soon as I have done that I must make an Order with regard to the amount of the levy and the Order must be laid on the Table of the House. The House would then have an opportunity of discussing it if they think it desirable.  I do not think it will be expensive to work this levy because every contract will be brought before the board, every contract made between the supplier and receiver, whether he is a retailer or distributor here in Dublin.  That contract will state the quantity of milk.  I feel that there will be a check in that way, a check on the amount of milk received by the retailer from the distributor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract will not show the amount of milk in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a check on <Col N="1571" /> the amount of milk when we know the amount of business a person is doing. At any rate, I do not think it will be an expensive levy.  I shall be surprised if the examination of the books in this business will take more than one inspector.  I do not think it will take any more than one.  We all recognise that this is a difficult problem to deal with.  We have the city here only capable of taking a certain amount of milk at an economic price.  Certainly, the City of Dublin cannot take all the milk that is produced in the area which supplies it.  There is therefore a big problem in front of the board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton and others might have offered the criticism that this Bill is not going to solve it, but I, at least, can say that I have got no help in the way of a better suggestion from Deputies opposite.  I can truthfully say that if a better suggestion is put forward either by way of amendment on the Committee Stage, or by way of a suggested policy for the Board, I shall be very glad to adopt that suggestion because I know the difficulties of the situation.</P>

The clean milk legislation is coming into full operation very shortly.  That means that every producer bringing milk into the city will state the grade of milk he is supplying, whether it is grade A, grade B, tubercle free milk or whatever the quality may be.  As far as I am concerned I would encourage suppliers, by the prices fixed, to send in the best grades of milk.  We would give every inducement and encouragement with regard to price to suppliers to produce the very best type of milk.</P>

      <P>I do not want that. If a particular sample is taken in unfavourable circumstances, it may be found to be deficient in fats but a sample might be taken under circumstances which would do no injustice to any one.  I made the point that if the people are to be compelled to pay a certain price, they have the right to ask for quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Second Reading speech, I gave the purport of the financial provisions of the Bill.  In Part VIII of the Bill, it is proposed to set up a company and also, if necessary, subsidiary companies, and the Minister <Col N="1573" /> for Finance is authorised to take the necessary steps to procure the establishment of such company or companies. The Minister for Finance is also empowered, under this part of the Bill, to provide moneys for the working of the company.  For example, the share capital which, under Section 38, is to be not more in nominal value than £1,000,000, may be acquired by the Minister for Finance by subscription. Other powers are provided under this part of the Act, such as the power of underwriting, by the Minister for Finance, the issue of shares.  The Minister for Finance is to have certain powers as a shareholder.  With regard to debentures, the Minister for Finance may, if he thinks fit, guarantee, in such form or manner as he may think proper, the due payment by the company, in accordance with the terms of such debentures, of the principal moneys and interest secured by such debentures.  Section 73 provides that the moneys which shall be made available by the Minister for Finance shall be taken from the Central Fund.  In an amendment which I hope to move on the Committee Stage, a slight alteration will be made in the phraseology at the bottom of page 31 of the Bill, by which the expression &ldquo;advanced from&rdquo; will be substituted for &ldquo;charged on and paid out of the Central Fund.&rdquo;  The moneys required by the Minister for Finance to provide the capital of the company will be advanced from the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided that, from time to time, the Minister for Finance may authorise the payment of subsidies, but as I explained on Second Reading, each proposal for a subsidy must be specifically brought before the Dáil and must be either confirmed or annulled by resolution of the Dáil. Furthermore, I explained that the aggregate amount which may be authorised to be paid to the company by way of subsidy by means of such orders shall not exceed £500,000 and that the period during which such subsidies may be paid shall not be outside five years from the date of the passing of the Act.  The only other point seems to be that moneys paid out of the Central Fund, or the growing produce <Col N="1574" /> thereof, under Section 73 (1) (b), in respect of any guarantee given by the Minister for Finance under the Act in respect of moneys secured by debentures issued by the company, shall be repaid to the Central Fund, with interest thereon at such rates as the Minister for Finance shall appoint, by the company in such amounts and at such times as the said Minister shall appoint.  That is a summary of the financial provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The policy in general is to set up a national company, to centralise the administration of all future aerial development in or through the Irish Free State, in so far as we can control it, in the hands of this national company and, if necessary, to establish subsidiary companies ancillary thereto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister misunderstood me or perhaps I did not make myself clear.  I know the provisions of the Bill in respect of the formation of the company, the capital of £1,000,000 and the expenses in connection with the formation of the company. Outside these matters, what has to be provided for?  Could the Minister give us an estimate of what the Bill is likely to cost?  It is not likely that a company will be started with a capital of £1,000,000.  I should like the Minister to give us some information as to our estimated commitments in respect of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear I shall be unable to give the details to the Deputy.  I had hoped to be in a position, on this stage, to give the House a more detailed statement.  I regret very much that I am not in a position to do so. The expenditure in contemplation is on account of a policy which has not been finally worked out, and which has not been finally planned.  It is estimated that, at least, £1,000,000 will be required for the share capital of this national company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>At least.  That £1,000,000 or some of it may have to go to the subsidiary companies such as the Aer Lingus Teoranta.  But the greater portion of it will probably be expended <Col N="1575" /> by the central company itself.  I cannot give further details than to say that the £1,000,000 will be required, but it will not be required, I think, immediately. The £1,000,000 will only be called up as and when required.  The services which will be maintained by the establishment of this central company may be of a preliminary or experimental character.  The whole question of these services at present is under consideration.  The Department of Industry and Commerce and the other Departments are at present considering the matter, and are taking advice and having conferences with other interests concerned.  For some time to come I do not expect to be able to make a complete statement as to the main features of the policy which the Government has envisaged, but I think I am safe in saying that the £1,000,000 which will be required may not be all called up in the immediate future.  The position is that the services which are in contemplation are somewhat novel in character.  A great deal of preliminary work has to be done.  A great deal of exploration and consultation has to go on, and the Government feel that they ought to be armed as soon as possible with the sanction of the Dáil, and armed with powers to go ahead to expend these moneys.  We feel that it is absolutely essential at this stage, as I explained on the Second Reading, that we should utilise any advantages which we have, and that we should utilise any opportunities we have to the very fullest in developing our geographical position and putting this country on the map as a really international centre to which different countries would send their ships, and that we should establish the enterprise in such a way that this country would be well recognised on the Continent of Europe as one which has definitely taken up an air attitude and which is anxious to develop its potentialities to the full.  It is in order that we will not be cramped or in any way restricted in the policy we have in view that the Government are looking for what is admitted to be a very large sum of money.  When the full facts, which I am not in a position to disclose at present, are made known to <Col N="1576" /> the Dáil and country, I think it will be recognised that the amounts mentioned in the Bill are not by any means out of proportion, having regard to the nature of the services which are envisaged.</P>

      <P>Under Section 68 of the Bill I see that the Minister for Finance may from time to time take up by subscription any class or classes of shares in the company.  The total amount of shares so taken up shall not <Col N="1577" /> exceed in nominal value the sum of £1,000,000.  Does the Minister think there is going to be any money other than the money put up by the Minister for Finance in what is contemplated here?  Will there be any other subscriptions, or will anyone else take shares?  Will there be at least £1,000,000 of State money, and will there be any other money?</P>

      <P>I am not speaking of that.  The situation at the present moment is that the lighthouse authority is an authority not paid by and not under the control of this House.  We are establishing a new service, and, in the Bill establishing the service, we are making a general rule that no regulation made under the Bill can in any way affect the general lighthouse authority.  Surely my summing-up is correct&mdash;that we are now saying to this House: &ldquo;In passing this Bill you cannot affect the authority of the Lighthouse Board, which is outside the authority of this House and not subservient to it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister does not pretend to be as innocent as that.  That Act cannot be read alone. It must be read with the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  As so read, it means that nothing in the Act shall allow interference with the Irish lighthouse authority, if and when established.  This Act is only an emendation.  This Bill says that we are not to prejudice or affect the rights, powers or privileges of any general or local lighthouse authority, and when there is an Irish lighthouse authority, it will have the effect that the Minister read.  But, at the moment, the situation is that the House is asked to say &ldquo;You can pass all the Acts you like but one of the prohibitions you are to ordain for yourselves is that you cannot interfere with Irish Lights and Irish Lights are at present controlled by a British body.</P>

      <P>There is no question of getting the Minister to refer himself to a few court decisions.  Under the Adaptation of Enactments Act every Act passed by the British having a reference to matters inside the Free State had to be construed as if the words &ldquo;Free State&rdquo; were written in.  The difficulty here is that this particular measure is taken away from the shelter of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  This is plain and straightforward.  The general lighthouse <Col N="1584" /> authority in relation to this country is a British authority.  That might have come to an end sooner if it had not been for the nonsense of the economic war.

    <P>Somebody, apparently, thought there might be a conflict.  Somebody had imagination enough to arrive at that conclusion, at the possibility that there might be a conflict between the regulations made under this Act and some of the powers or privileges of the general lighthouse authority.  Under Section 6 the Minister is taking power to make regulations in relation to a variety of things.  I am asking the Minister to decide this for me: If the Minister <Col N="1586" /> makes a regulation which affects or prejudices the privileges of the general lighthouse authority, a British board, will the regulation win or will the general lighthouse authority win?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The convention, as Deputy Briscoe has pointed out, was the first ever to secure international agreement and uniform treatment on the question of aerial transport. Some of the matters dealt with I will summarise.  The general principles of the International Convention laid it down that every Power has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air space above its territory; that each contracting State undertakes in time of peace to accord free passage above its territory to the aircraft of other contracting States; that each contracting State may prohibit flight by aircraft over certain areas of its territory, and that each contracting State may conclude special conventions, not contradictory to the general principles of the International Convention, with non-contracting States.  It went on further to deal with the registration of aircraft, the certification as airworthy of aircraft, and the provision of the personnel of aircraft with certificates of competency and licences to be granted in conformity with the conditions laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 15 deals with the conditions under which aircraft of a contracting State may cross the air space of another State and provides that each contracting State may make conditional on its prior authorisation the establishment of international airways and the creation and operation of regular international air navigation lines with or without landing on its territory.  The convention also deals with the documents to be carried by aircraft engaged in international navigation, prohibits the <Col N="1593" /> carriage of explosives and of arms and munitions of war and entitles each contracting State generally to apply restrictions as to carriage of articles including photographic apparatus.  It defines State aircraft and prohibits the flight of military aircraft across the territory of contracting States without special authorisation. One of the most important provisions is the setting up of the International Commission for Air Navigation which is a permanent commission placed under the direction of the League of Nations.  The Saorstát is a member of the International Commission.  I think these are the main features of the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything in it about it being open to a Government to make it a condition of passage from and to its coast that the company should be State-owned or should be under monopolistic control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it on continuous voyage?  The whole tendency of the last part of this Act is to give monopoly control to a particular company.  I understand that certain people who wanted to inaugurate air services in the country were refused permits by the Minister.  The Minister, at any rate, pretended that he had power under the Paris Convention to make it a condition precedent to any passage out of this country and back to it that there should be a licence, and that he <Col N="1594" /> could, therefore, make it a condition of the licence that there should be State supervision, State control, and even monopolistic State control.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister can attach such conditions to the licence as he may think proper, and as the company is largely monopolistic, I take it that he can embody monopolistic conditions in the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did say to various people who wanted to establish services in this country that they would not be allowed to do it, and could not do it without a permit from him; that when he was challenged about that permit point he referred to some International Air Navigation Convention.  Is it the Paris Convention, and if so what is the paragraph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made an Order as the Deputy knows&mdash;the Air Navigation (International Lines) Order &mdash;under which the authority of the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be sought and obtained before a service can be established, an international service or a service to or from the Saorstát by either a Saorstát or a foreign company.  I think I explained on the Second Reading that it is proposed to exercise those restrictive powers contained in the Bill, and a regulation under this Order was made by the Minister in 1935 in favour of the national company.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (c) surely goes beyond anything that this country has yet seen.  The whole of the section, as a matter of fact will have to be considered.  It says: &ldquo;If any aircraft flies or attempts to fly over any area appointed as a prohibited area under or by virtue of an order made under this Part of this Act&rdquo;&mdash;that is, an area that is scheduled as a prohibited area under the general powers of previous sections &mdash;&ldquo;or enters or attempts to enter Saorstát Eireann in contravention of any such order, the following provisions shall have effect.&rdquo;  Among the provisions set out are that it shall be lawful for any officer designated for the purpose by such order to cause such signal as may be prescribed by such order to be given, and if, after such signal has been given, the aircraft fails to respond to the signal by complying with the provisions of such order prescribing the action to be taken on such signal being given, it shall be lawful for such officer to fire at or into such aircraft and to use any and every other means at his disposal to compel compliance. The next provision, paragraph (c), goes on to say that no action or other legal proceedings whatsoever, whether civil or criminal, shall be instituted in any court in Saorstát Eireann in respect of the doing of anything authorised to be done by any such officer under this section, whether such thing is done personally or by a person acting in aid of or under the direction of such officer.</P>
      <P>There have been any number of very sacred decisions taken by courts from time to time on the power of the military, even in times of veiled riot, to act, and there have been many cases in the courts which have laid down what is the duty of the soldier acting on orders and whether or not he can shelter himself entirely behind the authority or order of an officer, or whether or not he is bound to use any discretion in such cases.  This section makes it clear that nobody need use any discretion, and, whether the order is to be justified or not, no proceedings lie in the courts.</P>

      <P>This is already in the 1920 Act also.  The Deputy has read certain sub-sections but he has failed to point out to the House that it shall be lawful for an officer specially designated for the purpose, causing such signals as may be prescribed to be given to these aircraft, to fire at such aircraft if, after the signal has been given, the aircraft fails to respond to the signal.  Obviously, the circumstances will determine whether the officer should fire at the aircraft or not.  At any rate, I think it is obvious that it is essential in connection with aircraft that there should be rather stringent powers for dealing with aircraft which refuse to comply with signals.  In any case, the provision is already in the 1920 Act.</P>

After all, there is such a thing as the rights of the ordinary civilian population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the ordinary people on the ground, there is the right also of the person in the air who may be a member of the civilian population.  This is not aimed against military aircraft but against every type of aircraft.  Suppose there is something of a barrage put up against hostile aircraft, or so-called hostile aircraft, or something designated for the purpose to be hostile aircraft, and that people on the ground&mdash; not in the air at all&mdash;are hurt, the Minister precludes anybody inquiring in a court of law as to whether the <Col N="1600" /> orders to fire were properly given or whether the persons to whom the orders were given found themselves in such circumstances that they were bound to obey the orders.  My point is that this cuts across the whole of the ordinary law as it has been carried over in this country and as it has been practised on behalf of the people of this country.  If it is desired to have these provisions in, I suggest that it should be limited to, say, a time of war or threatened war or civil commotion. The idea, however, of somebody, simply because the Minister says he is an officer designated for the purpose, giving an order and that order resulting in somebody either firing at or using some other lethal weapon to prevent aircraft entering the Saorstát, as a result of which damage is done to people in the Saorstát&mdash;not in the air at all, but on the ground&mdash;and that that procedure cannot be questioned, is absurd.  Surely it would be right for the courts to follow the ordinary procedure in matters like this.  Of course, I am not very alert at turning this type of case against people in authority. I think it will be found, generally, that courts acting in a responsible fashion and carrying out the law in the usual way will get the help of the ordinary people; but here, according to this, proceedings may not be instituted even to question whether or not such an order was properly given or whether the person who carried out the order in such circumstances was bound to obey it.  This, if it is carried into effect, will mean in the future that nobody will ever think of disobeying an order because there is no question of the matter ever being considered in court and they can be sure that their conduct will never be questioned. I say that it is a very grave power to take for no reason given.</P>

The Deputy, in any event, Sir, is wasting his eloquence, because this Bill simply re-enacts in very large measure <Col N="1601" /> the provisions of the 1920 Act as adapted to this country, and also provides that certain action will be taken by the Government in regard to international conventions.  There are then certain financial provisions in the Bill. The Deputy has already wasted a large portion of the time of the House telling us of the terrible things we are bringing into this Bill, although this is the second occasion on which I have shown the Deputy and the House that we are simply re-enacting measures that the Deputy himself introduced when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Deputy has not told the House that this provision with regard to firing at aircraft is confined to prohibited areas and that there is only one such area at present in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is?  The Bill says that orders may be made under <Col N="1603" /> this part of this Act under Sections 10, 11 and 12.  Section 10 is in regard to such orders as appear necessary for carrying out the Paris Convention. Does the Paris Convention relate only to prohibited areas?  If not, orders made under this part of this Act may go beyond prohibited areas.  Section 11 sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Executive Council may from time to time direct that the provisions of the Paris Convention ... shall apply to or in relation to any aircraft in or over Saorstát Eireann....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unless the Paris Convention is confined to prohibited areas, that again is extensive.  Look at the series of things in Section 12.  We get down to the letter (n) a series of special powers about which orders may be made, and, in relation to any of these if there is any of them which have an effect on an entry into Saorstát Eireann, there may be an entry, or attempted entry, contrary to the provisions of an order made under this part of the Act.  For that, an officer designated may cause whatever signals are prescribed to be given, and if the aircraft fails to respond to the signals, it may be fired on.  Not merely may it be fired on but the officer may use any other means at his disposal to compel compliance. If any such firing is attempted, or any other method of enforcing the authority of the officer is brought about, no proceedings may be instituted to question it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1920 Act, if I may return to it, was a piece of carry-over legislation. The House never thought about it and the Executive Council hardly thought about it.  It was a piece of legislation designed as a temporary expedient and, under it, certain regulations were made.  These regulations&mdash;and one knows the fate of these regulations&mdash; were laid on the Table of the House. They were not intended to meet a permanent situation.  They were made, like the Minister's 1935 Order, to meet an emergency as an emergency arose. They were, in fact, made in order to comply with the navigation code to which we had become a consenting <Col N="1604" /> party, and about which trouble was being raised, because certain regulations implementing the code had not been brought in.  So far as operating the regulations was concerned, I was never guilty of operating any part of them&mdash;certainly not any part about firing on people&mdash;and I never would have thought of proposing them to this House as permanent legislation.  There may be a necessity, and quite certainly is in regard to specialised areas, to forbid the aircraft of a foreign place, or even our own aircraft, from flying over them, but to say that if and when an officer uses force by firing to get an aircraft to comply with his signals, his conduct should not be challengeable in the courts, is going too far.</P>
    <P>Remember that that legislation is founded almost entirely on the Continental situation in the post-war period and about the time when although people were pretending to turn their thoughts towards disarmament, it was seen that the clear way out of disarmament was the provision of the equivalent of a mercantile marine&mdash;a civil aviation service, easily changed into military aircraft more or less at a moment's notice.  It also was recognised that the easiest method on the Continent, with its fortified areas, of getting spying done as to the latest development of the fortification of large areas was through the medium of aircraft flying overhead, and by the special progress that had been made in certain photographic methods.  There was what amounted to a panic on the Continent amongst all the warring powers as to these matters.  There is a tradition with regard to espionage in respect of the fortified areas on the Continent which this country knows nothing about, and does not require to know anything about, and against which it certainly does not require regulations to the same extent.  In those circumstances that code was passed. Why should we now attempt to set up such a piece of legislation for permanent lodgment on the Statute Book? Why should we copy what has been done in a panic way on the Continent under circumstances which do not hold here at all?</P>
    <P>We are definitely breaking down one <Col N="1605" /> of the best known standards.  One of the most rigid regulations which the people trusted to serve the community under arms have to obey is that which ordains that if they seem to outstep the bounds of their duty, from the officer giving the commands to the men obeying them, they can be brought before a court and have their conduct inquired into.  It is a safeguard not merely to the community, but to the serving-soldier. For instance, I am sure the House would be horror-stricken if a regulation of that type were brought in with regard to the Army generally&mdash; that, no matter what the command of an officer was, so long as he was an officer designated, that is to say, an officer properly in the service, it must be obeyed and, no matter what the result of it, his conduct could not be inquired into.  The House should not be asked by any Government to pass any such clause in a Bill.  Why say it with regard to aviation?  And certainly not until a case has been made for it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if you allow the ordinary law to prevail, if you wipe out that clause, you have a situation which is as much a safeguard to the serving man, the man in the ranks, as it is to the community, because it at any rate puts him up against this position that, from time to time, he has to use his mind and his humanity in deciding whether a command given by an open maniac of an officer ought to be obeyed or not.  That was the safeguard which certain people tried to shelter behind in a very definite tragedy that occurred in this country. You do strengthen the soldier in his attempt to be humane towards the ordinary population if that type of thing is not there.  Once that particular regulation is there, no soldier for the future will ever think of questioning anything except one thing: Is this man an officer and is he designated for this purpose?  If he is, anything he says goes; it cannot be questioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not explained to the House why he found it necessary to embody this provision in these regulations made in 1930.  I cannot find his explanation that the panicky condition of the Continental Powers, the war condition, has lasted <Col N="1606" /> until 1930, and was so effective that it compelled the Minister of that day to put this provision into his regulations.  At first, when the Deputy criticised this provision, he was anxious to safeguard the civil population, the gentlemen who refused to obey the signals given; now he wants to protect the soldier.  Surely we can rely on the Government to have regard to the general circumstances of aircraft when they are making orders designating these signals and laying down the circumstances under which officers may fire upon such aircraft. I cannot call to mind a particular circumstance in which it would be dangerous for aircraft to refuse to obey signals.  I know that we have had examples recently of aircraft flying over prohibited areas in defiance of international regulations.  Are we to take it that, under regulations properly laid down, it would be improper for officers properly designated, and knowing their duty, to fire upon such aircraft if they considered it necessary to do so?  The Deputy assumes that officers designated in the section are mere robots, and will fire at every aircraft that comes along.  I think we can assume that officers of the Army are reasonable and sensible individuals and that they will have full regard to all the circumstances, and consider such a serious action as firing on aircraft before they do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to deal with the last argument, which means that the Ministry can justify the bringing of a clause into the Army Act, under which an officer can give a signal to a man to halt, and if he afterwards orders anyone to fire, anything arising out of that is precluded from inquiry by the courts.  The same argument will hold, that you can rely upon the officer being a good fellow; that he will not do it.  Why have other countries decided, as far as ordinary defence and land forces are concerned, that it is proper to allow the courts to inquire into the activities of officers and men serving under them when it seems to the courts that there is reason for such inquiry?  If other countries had the same view as to the giving of orders to men, as the Minister pretends <Col N="1607" /> to have to justify this clause, there would be no necessity for any such intervention by the courts.  We are to pass this and to rely on the intelligence, humanity and good nature of the officer and the men under him.  The Minister can say if he likes that countries that have even the human viewpoint that I spoke of in regard to land forces generally are not in the majority in that view as regards aircraft. Will the majority of them have it?  Are we so definitely stabilised in our institutions with regard to defence that we think it proper to protect an officer, no matter what type of order he gives, as long as it is something permitted by the paragraph, from any inquiry by the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will put men serving under him in such a position that they know that an officer's order once given cannot be questioned in the courts, and to that extent there is greater persuasion on them to obey.  I think that an outrageous situation to bring about by way of permanent legislation.  What is the fear?  If we were entirely dependent on some huge arsenal for our entire defence, and if it was easily located and was in such a dangerous place that we could only guard it by having very stringent regulations about people flying over it, and if there was imminence of some attack by aircraft going to destroy it, then, in regard to that type of prohibited area, it might be possible to have officers and other people protected from judicial inquiry. This may have relation to any order issued by the Executive Council under this part of the Act, when some aircraft fails to comply with signals in relation to any matter.  As to general matters detailed in Sections 10, 11 and 12, we say that we are not going to have the conduct of the officer who gives the order inquired into.  There has been no case made for a breach in the old situation that prevailed as between the civilian community and the serving forces.  The Minister appears to regard that as important. We should think of the danger to the civilian community.  Surely the Minister's memory has not failed him, and he will remember that quite an amount <Col N="1608" /> of the anti-aircraft machinery used during the Great War had an effect, not upon the people at whom it was aimed, but on the unfortunate civil population, upon whom the stuff rained down, inflicting more casualties amongst them than those defending the country against offensive aircraft.  It does not need any flight of imagination to see such a situation as that being brought about if orders are so general. I suggest to the Minister that he should think seriously before he makes this very considerable breach in the old system of the courts, a system that has allowed proper action, with the judges always moulding themselves to help the Executive, recognising that the Government must be assisted.  Notwithstanding that, the Government appears to be against action being taken before an inquiry into the conduct of officers and men.  I think it is a safeguard to the community and to the men and prevents officers getting out of hand, which I think is not likely to happen here.</P>

      <P>The first Convention lays it down that for military reasons or military safety the Government shall be empowered to specify certain areas as prohibited areas.  In spite of what the Deputy argued, that this section deals with other than prohibited areas, I state definitely that it applies only to prohibited areas specified by order. When aircraft are challenged and refuse to obey signals, then the Government is quite justified in enabling officers to fire on such aircraft.  I do not see why, if officers carry out their duty and try to prevent aircraft from disobeying signals in prohibited areas, the Deputy should be so terribly anxious that these officers should be hauled up in court.  They will carry out their duties in this matter, presumably as they carry out their other duties, according to the law of the State and according to lawful orders given by superiors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate with the desire that neither Fascism nor the Reds should prevail in this land.  I feel that the Minister does not understand the terrible powers being given to any <Col N="1609" /> officer controlling even what he alleges is a special area.  Supposing the courts decided that the area in which something happened was not an area as prescribed by the Minister, a person aggrieved has not even the right of appeal to the courts.  The legislation of this country has tended towards the removal of the old theory that the King can do no wrong, and the Road Traffic Act allowed the ordinary civilian to take action against a Minister or a soldier.  Previously a civilian, if injured, could not proceed for damages.  I thought we had got so far away from that that, at least, the Government would take a wider and a more democratic view or, if you like, would be republican in their outlook, rather than saying that they could do no wrong and that no one could question what they did.  That is the position this section sets up.  No one can question what they do, even the courts that have been set up in this country. The Minister would be well advised to consider this section, because it goes beyond all the notions we hold concerning the rights of the individual. When I was an officer in the Army, if someone was knocked down while I was being driven by someone else, there was no action against me.  An Act of the Oireachtas changed that position.  The Minister relied a good deal on the Act of 1920.  I wonder does he remember that that Act was really a &ldquo;take-over&rdquo; of regulations that were set up during war time?  Deputy McGilligan said that it was due to the post-war terror in Europe.  I believe, in fact I know, that it was due to what they called D.O.R.A.  Some of the provisions of that Act still exist.  I had the pleasure of being imprisoned under some of them.  I am prepared to give the Minister and the Executive Council all necessary power, but if the House accepts the principle that any officer or anybody with authority can fire at any aeroplane passing, mind you, not over a prohibited area&mdash; because I do not agree with the Minister that any spot in this country is prohibited&mdash;I feel we are giving a power to such officers that the people of this country do not desire to give to any officer or soldier.  I am not <Col N="1610" /> suggesting that the Executive Council should not have sufficient powers to deal with occasions of danger, if such danger existed.  I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the section, especially paragraph (c), and have it withdrawn.</P>

      <P>If the Government of the country decide that for the safety of the community it is necessary that aircraft should be prevented from flying over certain areas, and if as a result of failure to obey these regulations&mdash;if this provision were not the law of the country&mdash;any aircraft flying over such territory caused such damage as would entail loss of life and property, what answer would Deputies on the opposite side make to people who suffered?  What alternative safeguard do they consider the community should have against aircraft which flagrantly defy the laws and regulations of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is very simple.  Nobody wants to prevent the Government of this country taking power or having power to prevent hostile aircraft flying over part, or the whole, of this country if necessary, but we think that coincident with that power there should be power given to the courts to prevent officers running amok, to prevent officers losing their heads, to prevent them acting under the influence of drink.  These things happen.  I am not saying that they happen in the Free State Army but they could happen.  Are we going to prevent a man losing his head by having him conscious that he may be hauled before the court to answer for his conduct, if aircraft have failed to respond to a signal in a particular way, or is he more likely to lose his head if he feels that no matter how irresponsibly he acts he will not be brought before any court?  It is futile to think that an answer has been given to the matters discussed here by pretending that if we take away paragraph (c) the Government would be left powerless either to prevent aircraft entering the country or passing over a prohibited area.  Everybody will agree that the Government should have that power if they want to make any part of the country a prohibited area, but <Col N="1611" /> that must be done regularly.  The prohibition must be effected with some degree of reason.  Is there not a greater likelihood of unreason prevailing if an officer knows that he must only put himself in either of these positions to escape liability in the courts: (1) he must be an officer designated for the purpose, (2) he must give a signal and (3) the aircraft getting the signal must fail to respond to such signal by not complying with the provisions of the order prescribing the action to be taken on such signal being given.  Once these three things happen, that man can fire at oncoming aircraft and no matter how irresponsible his action is, nobody can question it.</P>
      <P>I say that if his action is irresponsible it should be open to question. When I say that that irresponsible action should be open to question, I am not suggesting that the Government should not have full powers to prevent hostile aircraft from passing over the country.  There is a great difference, however, between saying that you must have power to prevent hostile aircraft passing over the country and telling a man who runs amok that his action cannot be challenged in the courts.  By all means give these men all the protection they require but if they are irresponsible and if the courts find that they have acted irresponsibly then they should be liable to punishment, and there is no punishment laid down here.  You preclude any proceedings of a civil or a criminal type against a man who has caused loss of life through irresponsibly giving an order on the nonobservance of some small point of the provisions for replying to a signal.  In addition to that you prevent this. Some officer may lose his head on a certain occasion and decide to fire upon aircraft.  A civilian member of the public, miles away from the scene, is injured, yet that person cannot take a civil action for damages if this section is passed in its present form.  Surely we ought not to be asked to agree to that.</P>

      <P>Army officers are subject to Army discipline and to the Army Act, which, I hope, will soon be <Col N="1612" /> in operation.  The Deputy desires that provision should be made in this Bill to drag military officers, who do certain things in the execution of their duty, before the civil courts when as everybody knows they are subject to military regulations and military discipline if they do anything irregular.  I think the Deputy ought to assume that officers who have laid upon them the duty of signalling aircraft, to prevent their flying over areas which are prohibited for national reasons or for the safety of the community, will carry out their duties lawfully according to the orders which are given to them, and that any cases in which they may act illegally will be dealt with in the same way as any other wrongful act for which an Army officer may be called upon to account.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it proper to produce a Bill to prevent the courts from dealing with such an officer or does the Minister think that that should have application only in regard to aircraft?  If that is intended it should be dealt with in a certain way.  The Minister evidently will allow a man to be irresponsible in the discharge of his duty in regard to aircraft but will not allow him to be irresponsible in regard to any other of the activities of the Defence Forces of the Saorstát. That is rubbish.  The Minister obviously does not know what the situation here is with regard to the interaction of the civil code on the Army code.  We are passing this as permanent legislation&mdash;as permanent as statutes can be&mdash;and the Minister is blindly following what the Continental people did round about the time when espionage from the air and attack from the air were present to the minds of the people, as it is not present to our minds.  If it is present to our minds, we have failed to make any provision against it.  In this Bill we are telling officers to do as they please and that they will not be hauled before the courts no matter what they do.  This is not a defence provision; it is a lunacy provision and it is breaking across the ordinary law.  Owing to the Minister's view as to what the provisions of the ordinary law are in connection with military affairs, I suggest that he should take this provision back and have it considered.  It is quite clear that it is not being brought forward by anybody who understands what the real position is.</P>

In the ordinary course he would get damages which would maintain him in something like the same standard of comfort he enjoyed before.

      <P>The analogy is perfect. There is no special reason why these people should be put on a special footing.  In the case of the ordinary member of the defence forces, if he does what the courts think is murder, even though he has done it in compliance with a military order, the courts will inquire into the matter.  They will inquire into the order given, and, even if the man was subject to penal discipline if he did not obey, they will consider whether he was justified under the civil code in obeying the order, in the circumstances.  Again, I point out that this matter of orders is not confined to prohibited areas.  It is no answer to say that the Paris Convention has some reference to prohibited areas.  A variety of orders can be made under Sections 10, 11 and 12.  If aircraft operates under these circumstances, all an officer has to be satisfied about is that he is an officer, that he gives a signal, and that the aircraft fails to respond in respect of one matter.  Then he can fire and nobody can inquire into his action no matter how irresponsible it be.  We should not be asked to pass such a provision. The answer may be that you can rely on your officers.  If that be so, why not introduce this principle into the ordinary law?  It would be an outrageous provision to introduce into a Defence Forces Act.  This House&mdash;even with the mechanically propelled legislation to which we are becoming accustomed <Col N="1616" />&mdash;would never consent to that.  It is absurd to ask the House to agree to it in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not realise the significance of this provision.  The Executive Council found it necessary to suppress a certain ceremony at Bodenstown a few weeks ago.  Suppose some people from London, Liverpool or Manchester chartered an aeroplane and came along to Bodenstown.  If an officer fired on that aeroplane, he could not be brought into court for injury done to the occupants of the aeroplane or to citizens on the ground.  That is going against all the notions of liberty of the individual and democracy and I am sorry that it is a Republican Government makes the proposal.  I instanced that case of Bodenstown because the Minister knows of the habeas corpus case in regard to Wolfe Tone.  It would indeed be an extraordinary tragedy or perhaps you could describe it as a comedy&mdash;it would be a comedy in 1936-'37&mdash;if a person or persons going to the Wolfe Tone anniversary were wrongly fired at and that the officer responsible could not be questioned before a court.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Importation of Spices and Peppers.</Title>
    <Col N="1621" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the duty which he had imposed on peppers and spices had a protective purpose, and he said it had.  I asked him, therefore, why he had issued licences for the importation of these commodities, free of duty, while there were abundant sources of supply of ground peppers and spices in Saorstát Eireann.  He said he had only issued licences in the early stage for a short period.  The Minister as reported in column 1302, volume 63 (4) of the Official Reports stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For a short period after the imposition of the duty recommendations for licences for the importation of ground spices, free of duty, were made for strictly limited quantities, in order to facilitate importers during the transition period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I now desire to submit to the House that the facts of the case are these: that licences were issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce to users of ground spices and peppers for the purpose of facilitating these parties in continuing to deal with foreign firms until such time as there was established in this country a new firm in the pepper and spices grinding business to replace a firm which was already in existence here.  I charge the Department of Industry and Commerce with having issued licences to the customers of an existing firm, which is manufacturing ground spices and peppers, to import these commodities free of duty, and that these licences were issued long after the Department of Industry and Commerce had been fixed with notice that there was a firm operating in this country capable of supplying the country's requirements in these ground spices and peppers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to note that the firm in question was established here years before there was any suggestion that a tariff should be put on.  It was established here in the face of open competition and was doing pretty well. The House might be interested to know that the proprietor of this firm has been <Col N="1622" /> a faithful supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking on the Finance Bill here, explaining the tariffs, he said that this tariff on ground spices and peppers was designed to establish a new industry, to wit, the grinding of these spices and peppers.  That statement was made on the 21st May.  The proprietor of the firm, which was already established here, wrote to the Minister on the 26th May and drew attention to the fact that on page 280 of the Official Trade Directory of the Department of Industry and Commerce the name of his firm was shown as a firm which was then grinding spices and peppers, and he asked the Minister to correct the impression which the Minister had created in the public mind by what he stated in the Dáil on 21st May, when he said the object of the duty was to create a new industry.  Subsequently the Minister for Industry did state in this House that he had created a false impression.</P>
    <P>But I now allege that ten days after May 26th, when the Minister received the letter directing his attention to the fact that there was a firm grinding spices and peppers in this country, the Minister wrote to another firm and then informed them, as late as the first week in June, that there was no one grinding spices and peppers in this country, but that he hoped there would soon be somebody.  The Minister then apparently adverted to the fact that there was a firm here and stated in the Dáil that he had been mistaken, that there was a firm grinding spices and peppers here in the past and that they were still grinding them. The proprietor of this firm made repeated representations to the Minister that there was no justification whatever for issuing licences to his customers to import spices and peppers free of duty as he was able to supply the demand.  He pointed out that he never asked for a duty, that he was quite prepared to carry on in existing circumstances as he had been carrying on in the past, but that if a duty was put on he strenuously objected to that duty being used for the purpose of driving him out of business in order to let somebody else set up in his place <Col N="1623" /> to carry on the trade that he had made a success of without any duty. He calls in evidence the fact that, after the Minister had been repeatedly notified that he was prepared to fill any orders that came from anybody for ground spices and peppers, as late as 20th of June the Minister was still issuing licences to his customers to import from Great Britain spices and peppers.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to note that the Minister stated here that he had been approached by a group of persons to put on this duty and that this group of persons said they wanted the duty on in order to establish themselves in the business of spices and pepper grinding.  The Minister admitted in the course of the debate that when the duty was put on there would not be room for any more than one firm in the spices and pepper grinding business. Therefore, we are forced to the conclusion that the Minister's intention was to put on a duty for the purpose of setting up a new firm in the business and, seeing that there was only room for one firm in the business when all the business was being done here, the assumption must be that the new firm was to be the only firm and that the old firm was to be put out of business.</P>
    <P>This unfortunate man, who built up this business, has had a similar experience in the past, because he was engaged in another business, the manufacture of rusk meal, which is part of the raw material of the sausage-making business.  After he had built up a little business in that, the Government put a tariff on and brought in a British firm to wipe him out of existence, to put him out of business. Being a stalwart supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, he said: &ldquo;After all, you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs,&rdquo; and he supposed he was one of the casualties in the general campaign for industrial revival.  He threw off his coat and built up another business in spices and pepper grinding and he had not got under way in that fully until he is fixed with notice that the Government are going to put him out of business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> There must be limits to the injustice that may be perpetrated against individuals.  This man's business admittedly is a small one.  Admittedly, it is not fit to do much more than maintain him and his family.  But he built it up himself; he asked for no help or tariff; he asked for no protection of any kind.  He has already been put out of one business and his years of work and little capital dissipated by a tariff that brought in a big British combine to manufacture rusk meal in this country.  He has now built up another little business.  I want to ask the Minister by what criterion of justice he can defend smashing him again.  Therefore I ask the Minister to give the man an unqualified undertaking, (1) that no further licences will be issued; if he is going to put on a tariff at all, let it operate in the ordinary way, and that is, that no licences will be issued when Saorstát sources of supply are available; (2) that the Government will provide no facilities for any firm to come in here from Great Britain and smash the little business that an Irish national has built up for himself without protection or assistance of any kind.</P>
    <P>I believe in free competition and a fair field for everyone, but I strenuously object to our Government facilitating outsiders coming in to smash individual citizens of this State who have set up their own little business without asking help from anybody.  I have no objection to the Government assisting in the development of Irish industry or in helping on in any way they can a deserving industry that may be of some use to the community as a whole, but I most vehemently object to the enterprise of individual citizens being shattered and wasted as a result of the imprudence and folly of any Minister of State.  I think the Minister should have no difficulty in giving me the undertakings I ask for, and if he does the matter can be disposed of. I do not want the House to think that this matter has been raised here by a man who was desirous of embarrassing the Government.  He was not.  He is a strong supporter of the Government, and he went, not once but five times, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to remonstrate with him in <Col N="1625" /> private in his office.  He wrote to him on the 26th May and went to see him about the 5th June.  He wrote personally to the Minister on the 12th June to say that he could not believe that the Minister could have personal knowledge of what was happening and that if he had he would not stand for it.  In answer to that letter he got a formal acknowledgment on the 15th June.  He wrote again on the 23rd June to the Minister and to the Secretary of the Department as well.  He approached the Minister himself privately and confidentially at least five or six times.  He had no desire to bring the business into public, and eventually he only called on members of this House to ventilate his case when he seriously made up his mind that the only alternative to calling on the public to protect him was to be wiped out of business.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a man who has built up one little business and has had it destroyed already.  He has now built up another little business, and the fact is that if this business is smashed he has not got either the youth or the capital on his side to face the task of building up a third enterprise. If he is smashed now he is smashed for good, and I confidently ask the House to insist that this man will be given a fair chance to carry on. He asks for no protection, he asks for no Government interference of any kind, but he does say this: that when a tariff has been imposed that tariff must not be used to induce his customers to give up dealing with him until such time as another firm can come from Great Britain to set up here and take away from him the sole means of livelihood that he and his family have got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that, in connection with the extensive protection policy that the Government is carrying out, difficult circumstances for individual firms must arise.  Here is a firm which has been carrying on business in a small way.  The total value of our imports of manufactured spices in 1935 was over £17,000.  My information is that the annual turnover of the firm that Deputy Dillon <Col N="1626" /> has in mind did not exceed £1,000. With regard to the second firm, they were not prepared to go into the business extensively.  A third firm was set up here which the Deputy has described as a British combine.  May I inform him that three of its directors are nationals of Saorstát Eireann? The fourth is not; and this firm proposes to supply the entire market. Has the Deputy an objection to another firm getting the protection which is usually accorded to new enterprises? Has he an objection, during the transition period that must elapse until the new firm is properly established and is able to cater for the entire requirements of our market, to the issue of licences, and, if he has, how would that work out as regards all the other articles of commerce in which the Deputy is interested? Surely during the period that a firm undertakes to establish a business, and the point at which it is definitely established, provision has to be made by the Government to enable traders to carry on.  Where are traders to get their supplies?  The Deputy has stated that they can get their supplies from the firm he refers to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;seems definitely to indicate that our merchants were not being supplied.  Furthermore, while for a period of a month and, possibly, some little time longer, licences were granted fairly freely, it became the rule in the Department not to grant licences after a certain stage which has now passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time about the 26th June.  Since that date, if a firm applies for a licence to import spices it has to prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it cannot secure <Col N="1627" /> supplies here.  I have a letter before me from one firm&mdash;not, presumably, the firm that the Deputy is interested in &mdash; thanking the Department for directing would-be importers to seek supplies from a home firm.  Obviously, if the firm in which the Deputy is interested is able to supply, and is recommended by the Department as a source which may be able to supply, there will be no reason for importers to seek licences if the supplies are as adequate as the Deputy maintains they are.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of licences, the position is that licences will only be granted, and have only been granted, from the date I have mentioned on receipt of evidence that Saorstát firms cannot supply.  We all have sympathy with business people, particularly if the circumstances are as described by the Deputy.  I have no information to show that this is the second venture which this particular firm has embarked on that has met with unfortunate circumstances, but what I do know is that nothing was heard from the firm in question until after the imposition of the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  I must categorically contradict the Minister's statement.  This particular firm has been registered for the past 12 months in the official guide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations were made to the Department until after the duty was imposed, and in a letter received from, presumably, the firm which the Deputy has in mind, dated 26th May, it was definitely stated that in the short period of three years it was impossible to eliminate the competition of cross-Channel firms.  Therefore, although the firm had been in operation for at least three years and had been carrying on business, it found it impossible to eliminate foreign competitors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department was quite justified in putting on a tariff in view of the fact that a new company was coming into the industry, and because it felt satisfied that, with a <Col N="1628" /> new company, all the State's requirements would be provided from companies operating here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to read the next paragraph in the letter to which he refers, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before giving any concessions to rival firms I should be glad to be afforded an opportunity of placing a proposal before the Minister, as my firm is now in a position to supply the whole of the Free State market immediately.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have said already, this man has invested every penny that he has earned during the last five or six years in providing the best machinery for grinding spices and pepper.  He has nothing else in the world except what he has put into this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say, not having personal acquaintance with the circumstances, whether the firm in question was the most efficient. What I do know is that a decision was reached that another firm were the only firm who would be capable, in the view of the Department, of supplying the Free State markets, and it was in view of the proposition made by that particular firm that the tariff was put on.  The firm in which the Deputy is interested take up the attitude that because their particular business, although they are not able to supply the home market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is going to suffer, the Department have no right to give any assistance to another firm.  I think that is most preposterous.  It is as preposterous as the idea that during a transition stage the Department of Industry and Commerce are not fully justified in permitting traders, if it be necessary, to import supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the firm on whose behalf I speak, and the identity of which the Minister knows, is now in a position to supply the requirements of the State.  Let the Minister go out and see this firm, inspect it, and if what I am now saying is not true, I am prepared to withdraw every word I have said.  It is a monstrous thing that an unfortunate individual with a wife <Col N="1629" /> and family is to be swept out of existence by a combine coming here from Great Britain.  Undoubtedly there are three Irish directors, because the Control of Manufactures Act has to be complied with, but the firm is governed and controlled by an English spice house, and everybody in the trade knows that.  It is going to be run for the purpose of establishing a monopoly for a London spice house in order to control the whole trade of this country. To drive an unfortunate man into penury and beggary so as to satisfy the desires of this group of men is nothing less than a monstrous and cruel injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister, in face of the letter to which reference has been made, can have the effrontery to tell this House that he is doing something desirable in bringing in another firm, avowedly to destroy this man.  How public money can be used for this purpose it beats me to understand.  If the man was a cantankerous critic of the Government, I could understand that he might have approached them in an irritating and offensive way and perhaps not put his case properly; but he is not.  On the contrary, he is an enthusiastic admirer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He went to the Department believing that the Minister was misled and anxious to cover up the Minister's tracks and save him from making a mistake.  What reception does he get?  He gets the answer that he is going to be wiped out.  I do not care what Government is in power, whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government, a Fine Gael Government or an I.R.A. Government, when a man is trying to build up a little business it is a brutal and a savage injustice to wipe him out as if he were a mere cipher on a blackboard.  That man is a human being, just as the Minister and I, and the Minister has no right to wipe him out.  It is a <Col N="1630" /> cruel and a wicked injustice and the Minister ought, even at the eleventh hour, to look into this matter and effect some remedy.  I ask him to inspect the premises of William Blake, Limited, at Phibsboro' and if what I have said is not true, I shall be prepared to withdraw every word of it.  It is simply cruel, if the Minister has not examined the case personally, to allow an injustice of this kind to be perpetrated against this man.</P>

      <P>No complaint has been received from the county medical officer of health or the district medical officer of health regarding the sewerage of Emly and as there are other more urgent sanitary works to be undertaken in the county there would not appear to be any necessity to deal with the sewerage of Emly at present.</P>
