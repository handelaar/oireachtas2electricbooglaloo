    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that persons employed for two, three or four days on relief schemes administered out of grants made to county councils are required to wait for a fortnight before receiving payment, and whether having regard to the fact that those so employed are entirely dependent on such wages, he will instruct county councils to make provision for the payment of wages weekly in such cases, or devise other arrangements as will ensure weekly payment to the workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is the general practice for county councils to pay their road workers fortnightly and that the councils propose to follow the same procedure in the case of road workers employed on a rotational basis.  I am not <Col N="974" /> empowered to instruct county councils in this matter which is one within their discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the hardships inflicted upon unemployed men who are taken on such relief schemes for a period of two, three or four days?  In the week in which they actually work, they receive no wages whatever, nor do they receive unemployment assistance during that week.  In fact, very often they receive no unemployment assistance the following week, even if they are not employed.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, whether he would not consider using such powers as he has to instruct county councils to pay this particular section of their staff each week, so that these men will at least have some income, either from wages or unemployment assistance, for the week in which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask whether, if the Minister has no powers in the matter, he will make representations? Is the Minister aware that the men employed by the North Tipperary County Council on these schemes receive no wages for a month?  Is the Minister also aware that they are deprived of unemployment assistance during that period if they are employed for two or three days per week and that their position is that they have no money from any source whatever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In having these representations made to me, I bear in mind that both the Labour Party and Deputy Morrissey are well-known democrats who stand all the time for local authorities' autonomy in local affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they ask me now to direct them.  When I do send down directions, as I have to as Minister from time to time, I can imagine the Deputies' followers in these local authorities saying &ldquo;The idea of the Minister interfering in this matter.  We have our own rights.&rdquo; I hope that as a result of the matter being raised here the attention of the local authorities will be called to the <Col N="975" /> hardships that do exist, I believe, and that the local authorities will take note of them, but Deputies know that it is very difficult for a Minister to send a direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry the Minister has taken up this attitude but would he consider making representations? It need not be a direction. I am sure that if it were conveyed to a county council that it was the Minister's wish that a month should not elapse before these men received some payment, some arrangement would be made by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply does not deal with the point at issue at all.  Nobody will complain of any instructions issued by the Minister to ensure that persons are paid weekly for the work they perform each week. If the Minister does not intervene in this matter, I am satisfied from the objections which would be put up by the finance committees of county councils and by county surveyors that these men will not be paid weekly.  The Minister is, therefore, proposing to do nothing in a situation where relief workers work a week before Christmas, receive no wages that week and receive no unemployment assistance for that week.  Surely a hardship of that kind should induce the Minister to issue an instruction in a matter of this kind?  Instructions have been issued by the Minister in much less meritorious cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister ever issued instructions in less meritorious cases than this. Deputies have their representatives on these local authorities and if they raise the matter there, I certainly would not object in any way if an arrangement were made.  I, as Minister, will not object to any arrangement arrived at to see that these people are paid, but it is a matter for the local authorities.  I dislike interfering with the economy of local authorities unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister, by virtue of his position as <Col N="976" /> Minister, would write to county councils and inform them that this matter has been brought to his notice through the Legislature, that he personally has sympathy with the claim which has been put up and urge local authorities to consider the desirability of paying wages weekly?  Surely that will not be dictation to the county councils, even though such dictation might be justified in this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if a county council or its finance committee make representations to him with a view to having an impress account prepared to enable workers to be paid each week, will he give the necessary sanction to that arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have any difficulty in giving sanction if the local councils make the necessary representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will take steps to reduce the price of a game licence to 10/- in the case of persons visiting Ireland for a period not exceeding a <Col N="977" /> fortnight, and whether he can arrange for such licences to be issued with less delay than has hitherto been customary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of granting short-term firearm certificates at reduced rates to visitors to the Saorstát has already received careful consideration, but I am not satisfied that it would be desirable to make any such alteration in the existing law.  I have caused inquiries to be made into the allegation that there is delay in connection with the issue of these certificates, and I am not satisfied that there is any foundation for the allegation.  Applications for firearm certificates received in my Department from visitors are dealt with promptly, usually on the day of receipt.  If, however, the Deputy will furnish any instances in which delay is alleged to have occurred, I will have them investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the average delay is ten days or a fortnight.  I would ask the Minister to consider, if he has not considered it already, whether it would not contribute to a considerable increase in sporting tourist traffic if a reduction were made in the price of game licences.  I have heard various cases of people who were put off coming to Ireland for a sporting holiday by the act that it was necessary to pay £2 for such a short holiday.</P>

      <P>The difference in the figure eferred to arises from the fact that value of unemployment insurance mps sold includes the actual <Col N="978" /> receipts by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from such sales in the specified period, whereas the income derived from the sale of unemployment insurance stamps includes the amounts actually transferred by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs within the same period to the credit of the Unemployment Fund, on account of such sales.

      <P>Packages of goods onnportation are not opened for customs examination until the entry is presented and the proper duty is paid.  In this instance the London, Midland and Scottish Railway's representative, who was acting for the importer was informed by a Customs official on the <Col N="981" /> 28th October, 1936, that duty would be assessed on the value shown on the invoice with an addition of 15 per cent. This duty was not forthcoming until the 23rd November, 1936, when the Customs entry was presented and accepted at the Custom House.  The calculation of the proper duty payable is a matter, in the first instance, for the importer or his agent and the Revenue Commissioners cannot accept responsibility for an error, if any, made by the railway company in making such a calculation.</P>

      <P>No estate of William Russell can be traced in the records of the General Valuation Office as situate in the electoral division of Ballymore.  Possibly the Deputy may refer to an estate of the Reps. of William Russell, lands of Labaun, 185 acres, and Tullybane, ten acres, which the Land Commission had recently under consideration and decided to take no action for acquisition as the lands are not suitable for their purposes.  These lands are in the electoral division of Mount Temple.</P>

      <P>A question has arisen as to the time to be allowed for the Adjournment Debate.  The Government have been asked to allow four hours for the Adjournment Debate. That would mean that the whole time to-morrow would be taken up by that debate and there has been some sort <Col N="983" /> of suggestion that there might be cooperation from all sides of the House to finish the business on the Order Paper so as to allow the motions for Private Members' time standing in the names of Deputy Norton and Deputy Hogan to be concluded to-night.  It would be very desirable that the House should have some kind of common understanding in the matter, if that arrangement were to be observed, so that the whole of to-morrow would be available for the Adjournment Debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter at all is because of the fact that on previous occasions when arrangements were made between the two big Parties in the House they seemed to forget that there are other Members here, who are Independent, and that we may claim the right to speak on those matters.  I was told on at least one of the occasions that an arrangement had been entered into.  I wanted to make it quite clear that I do intend to speak on at least two motions, one being the motion put down by Deputy Norton and his colleagues, and the other by Deputy Hogan.  There is also, according to Press reports, a motion put down in the name of Deputy Cosgrave, and another by Deputy Norton dealing with unemployment.  I think it would certainly take longer than to-morrow to dispose of those matters, so I want to have my position made quite clear now in order that there will be no suggestion that I raised the matter at the last moment.</P>

      <P>I sympathise entirely with Deputy Anthony's view, as I am sure does the Vice-President.  Deputies should be given an abundant opportunity of expressing their views. To-morrow is designed by the Government to be the concluding day of the Session, if it can be so arranged. Could not everybody have an opportunity of saying what they want to say, <Col N="985" /> on all the matters before the House, if we arranged to sit to-morrow until the business was concluded; to abstain from rising at two o'clock, and to go on sitting through the day until business was concluded?  I think if we did that, we might not find it necessary to sit far beyond two o'clock, but everybody would feel that they had plenty of time if they wanted to go on in session, and we could wind up the session's business without returning here next week.  Might I make that suggestion to the Vice-President?  That would acquit both of the principal Parties in the House of any desire whatever to restrict discussion on the part of anybody else.</P>

      <P>Could we have the arrangement suggested by Deputy Norton, that my motion be taken before Deputy Norton's motion?  It will not take more than an hour.  It will not take me more than 20 minutes to make my case.  I do not know how long it will take a member of the Government to reply, but it will not take me more than 20 minutes to reply to that, and the division will not occupy very long.  I would suggest that we should reach a decision which would give the motion a chance of being disposed of, because time is of the very essence of that motion.</P>

      <P>There are just a few remarks I should like to make. During the Second Reading of this Bill there were certain remarks made, one of them, I think, by Deputy Kelly.  Anyhow there seemed to be some idea that as I raised the question of compensation and what was going to happen to people residing in the area which is to be submerged, I was against the Bill.  I think there was the same criticism of Deputy Everett for the same reason.  This is a scheme of very great importance, and one which is going to give very great benefits to a large majority of the people, but there are some people who are going to suffer a certain amount anyhow, because they will lose their homes, and after all that is a very serious matter for a comparatively small minority.  I put down a certain number of amendments in the hope that something more definite might ensue with regard to safeguarding all those people who are going to lose their homes.</P>

    <P>I suppose that one of the most important matters of all, in this connection, is really the question of compensation. We had one amendment on the Report Stage, and that was the only amendment on the Report Stage at all, but I should like to point out to the Minister that there is a very big difference between this particular Bill, the Liffey Reservoir Bill, and the Bill which inaugurated the Shannon scheme.  After all is said and done, the people who lost land or dwelling-houses in connection with the acquisition of property for the Shannon scheme had to deal with the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In the particular Bill with which we are dealing now, however, the Minister can hand over all the interests of these people to the Electricity Supply Board.  Now, I know myself that if I happened to be one of those people who are going to lose all or a <Col N="992" /> portion of their farms or a dwelling-house, I would very much rather have to deal with the Minister and his Department than to have to deal with the Electricity Supply Board.  I state that definitely, and although I had nothing concrete to suggest as to what compensation I was going to get or anything else, I still would rather have the matter placed in the hands of the Minister and his Department than in the hands of the Electricity Supply Board.  After all is said and done, the Electricity Supply Board have a duty to perform, and their duty is to try to bring about the production of this electricity, and so on, as cheaply as possible.  Naturally, they are going to be out to try to acquire these lands and premises as cheaply as possible, and I do not see myself how the Minister can interfere.  Then we had, during the Committee Stage, the question of the basis of compensation, and, as the Minister knows, I was not satisfied on that at all, and on that particular matter I divided the House.  My anxiety, however, is entirely for the people around that particular area.  There is nothing political whatsoever in the point I am making.  I would have just as much interest in this matter if the people for whom I am concerned were people who differed entirely from me in politics, and I can only conclude by saying that if, as the Minister said, he realised that everything should be done to avoid hardship, I hope he will do everything possible to see that there is no unnecessary hardship imposed on anyone.</P>

      <P>On the question of compensation, I should like to say a word or two to the House here in connection with the water rights which will naturally be interfered with as a result of this scheme.  In certain areas in the constituency of Kildare there are several mill owners who have free water rights which will be interfered with.  In following up Deputy The O'Mahony's remarks on the question of compensation, I am hoping that the matter to which I have referred will be earnestly considered.  It is an important matter, and one that would require earnest consideration in <Col N="993" /> fairness to the people concerned, whose rights will be interfered with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, under this Bill, the county council are going to be deprived of over £2,000 in rates and the agricultural grant will still be the same.  I think it is only right for the Minister to know that the agricultural grant is £40,000 and the rates are 3/-in the £, while there is a county rate charge of 1/6 in the £.  If you are to exempt the people in one particular area in the county from any rates, it will mean that the remaining farmers in the county will have to make up the loss.  I think that the Minister should make some provision for a grant in respect of any particular area that is freed from rates&mdash;at least, in view of the loss that the county council will suffer in connection with this.  The Electricity Supply Board will not be liable.  If any claim is made against them, they will always be able to find a loophole in connection with the Act to avoid the payment of rates.  I feel quite certain that the Minister will deal sympathetically with this question and that he will try to understand the needs of the people in the area concerned.  I am not concerned so much with the people in the other portion of the county, because that portion will be liable to meet the special rate of 1/6 in the £ and, naturally, the farmers there will have to bear their full share.  Unless something is done, however, the agricultural grant will be of no benefit in the area concerned, and I can see that, instead of £40,000 being withheld from County Wicklow, the Minister will have to take over the rates because the county council will not be able to carry out the services.  They find great difficulty at the present time <Col N="994" /> owing to the failure, whether due to unwillingness or inability, of the people to pay the land annuities, but we are mulcted to meet whatever deficiency has occurred.  I appeal to the Minister to come to the assistance of these people by giving a substantial grant in respect of that particular area owing to what the county council will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy The O'Mahony's point, I do not think it will make any difference to the persons whose property is acquired, in respect of the amount of compensation they receive, whether the compensation is granted by the Department of Industry and Commerce or by the Electricity Supply Board.  The Bill sets out the basis on which compensation is to be assessed, and if the persons concerned are unable to arrange a settlement with the Electricity Supply Board by agreement, then the arbitrator, under the Land Clauses Act, comes into the picture, and they can appeal to him.  He will award compensation, and it would be the same arbitrator who would award compensation in either case.  I think there is quite a prospect that in doubtful cases the Electricity Supply Board will settle quicker than the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;which, in such matters, is bound to take into consultation the Department of Finance &mdash;was able to settle such cases in connection with the Shannon scheme.  I think that the only difficulty and the only real cause of grievance that arose in connection with compensation paid for land acquired under the Shannon scheme was that delay occurred where there was difficulty over title or where there was some other cause of dispute, and that delay is much less likely to occur when the Electricity Supply Board is acting than when the Department of Industry and Commerce is acting, because the Electricity Supply Board is an autonomous body and can act on its own responsibility, whereas in a Government Department, the Department concerned has to get in contact with the Department of Finance, and the making of that contact is a fruitful source of delay, as Deputies know, I am sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> With regard to the point raised by Deputy Minch, I want to say that the persons who have water rights upon the Liffey will be entitled to compensation if these water rights are interfered with.  It is quite possible, in fact probable, that there will be no interference with the water rights upon the Liffey below Poulaphouca.  The Liffey scheme is different from the Shannon scheme in this respect that all the water used for the purpose of generating electricity goes back into the river and there will be no diminution in the flow of water on that account.  There will be no canal and tail-race such as there is at Ardna-crusha. It is true that a quantity of water will be taken off for supply purposes to the city but that quantity of water in relation to the total capacity of the reservoir at Poulaphouca will be so small that there will be no diminution in the river at all.  If there is any diminution or interference with the water rights or if loss of any kind is suffered in the case of persons living lower down the river, these persons are entitled to compensation, or, alternatively, the Electricity Supply Board or the corporation can construct such works as may be agreed by the persons concerned&mdash;works which will provide them with an alternative supply.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Everett pointed out, the whole generating and distributing system of the Electricity Supply Board is freed from local rates.  The considerations which prompted the enactment of legislation of that nature are well known to the Deputy.  It is a national undertaking.  The Electricity Supply Board locates its generating station and erects its transmission or distributing systems having regard to the supply of electricity on a national scale, and it is purely an accident whether a particular generating station is located in Wicklow, Wexford, Kildare or Dublin.  It would be anomalous to require that a comparatively small part of the board's system, such as the generating station in Wicklow, should be liable to local rates when the rest of the generating system is free of that charge.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no similarity <Col N="996" /> between the reservoir it is proposed to construct at Poulaphouca and the Roundwood reservoir which was constructed to supply water to the City of Dublin.  The reservoir at Poulaphouca, while used for water supply purposes, is different in this respect&mdash; that its primary purpose is the generation of electricity.  Whatever the immediate changes will be, the effect in the long run on the local authorities will be that they will not lose in the matter of rates by the construction of the reservoir, for the construction of the reservoir in that area will, no doubt, lead to the construction of other rateable property there.  Whatever immediate loss the local authority may suffer by the submerging of lands and buildings, will be offset in due course.</P>
    <P>These are the most important points raised.  I do not know if there is any other point which it would be necessary for me to deal with at this stage except the point raised by Deputy Everett on the Committee Stage.  That was the question of the Blessington sewerage scheme.  I have been informed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, with whom I took up the matter, that the proposals of the board of health have been held up pending the consideration of the Liffey project.  Nothing has yet been decided upon and it may be necessary to divert the outflow.  It does not follow that the cost of the scheme on that account will be increased, but should any increase be involved Deputy Everett may rely on the matter receiving the sympathetic consideration of the Local Government Department.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to delete certain lines which appear to be unnecessary.  Section 4 of the Bill as it stands was based largely on the appropriate sections in the 1930 Act.

      <P>I am quite in agreement with the omission of these two lines and I take it that their omission will clear up a great deal of difficulties.  The omission of these two lines means that a lot of misconception will be cleared away.  Section 26 of the original Act lays down that this is not a committee of the county council. I still hold that the section as originally drafted did create a doubt and the omission now of these words removes that doubt.  If the Minister is satisfied that there is no chance of the particular class that I refer to being excluded&mdash;that is, that no person shall be excluded from membership of a vocational committee on account of any contractual relationship he has with the county council or the corporation under which the vocational committee functions, but of which apparently it is not a committee&mdash;I am satisfied. I think that clears up most of the difficulties I had.  The amendment now moved by the Minister clarifies that section.  As it stood originally it did imply that such persons did occupy the position which the Minister suggested they did occupy normally&mdash;that the committees on which they sat were committees of the local bodies.  I think we are now in full agreement that that is not so.  If the Minister is satisfied that that is the law most of my objection vanishes.</P>

      <P>The amendment is introduced in order to make it clear that disqualification will not apply to existing members.  The disqualification provision passed in the original Act might have entailed disqualification upon them.  I should explain to Deputy O'Sullivan that we are quite satisfied that vocational education committees are not in the subsidiary position with regard to county councils that I felt they were in legally.  We are in fact satisfied that they are independent and not subsidiary bodies.  An important consideration which I have not adverted to is that eight members of the county council become members of the vocational education committee. There are members of the county council who are members of the vocational education committee, and there are added members.  If under the statutory enactment of Article 12 of the Schedule of the Local Government Act a county councillor becomes disqualified as a county councillor, <i>ipso facto</i> he becomes disqualified as a member of the vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>On this amendment I want to remind the House that ambiguity still exists in respect of persons who are directors or officers of a limited liability company, when the limited liability company is in contractual relations with the public body or with a director or officer of it.  It is not the business of the Minister for Education to undertake a reform of the local government code but here is a committee, closely analogous to a local government body, that, as he has pointed out, is by no means identical and is not subsidiary, and he is applying procedure in regard to disqualification from these committees similar to that applied to local bodies.  I want him to improve his system by removing an ambiguity that remains in the local government code, and I want him to say that not only the persons, such as are described in the amendment, will be spared from disqualification, but that also directors or officers of a limited liability company will be spared disqualification, if the only contractual relationship existing is one between the committee and the company. As the law stands, that is highly doubtful.  Let me be perfectly clear about this.  Take my own case. Ordinarily I would be, and I propose that I should be, a member of the committee administering the local vocational schools.  I do not know what my position is in law, because it is highly likely that a teacher might walk into the establishment of which I happen to be a director, and buy a handful of pencils.  I fully understand if that position did arise no heavy penalty would be exacted, because everyone would understand that it was an ambiguity.  But I do not want to be made the subject of a law action. I want to conform to the law but I cannot conform if I do not know what the law is.  As things are, neither I, nor the Minister for Education, nor the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1000" /> nor the sergeant of the Gárda Síochána really know what the law is.  I do not want to have it tried on the dog when I am the dog.  The simple way is to settle the thing here one way or the other, and then, when we all know the law, we can comply with it.</P>

The Deputy is referring to a case that was argued in the English courts which might be applicable to our position here, and arising from it a recommendation was made to the Legislature in Great Britain to make an amendment to the law.  It is really not quite appropriate to this particular Bill but is a matter for the Minister for Local Government in the first instance as to whether he will amend the law in that connection.</P>

      <P>The truth is that the Minister for Local Government says it is a matter for someone else, and the Minister for Education says it is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  The fact is that the legal departments do not want to undertake the task.  Why I cannot imagine.  The thing is perfectly simple, and the House does not give a hoot which department does it. I may remind the House that the law of bailment was settled as a result of a suit in respect of a barrel of wine worth £1 5s., but the suit cost £235,000 before it was settled. I do not want to saddle our education committees in Saorstát Eireann with anything of that sort when it could be done in five minutes if one of the Ministers would introduce an explanatory section settling the law.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any order made by the board fixing minimum rates of wages in respect of any wages district shall also fix for that district a minimum fair rate of wages and a minimum economic rate of wages.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 hang together and are designed to remove what appears to me to be a fatal flaw in the Bill introduced under existing circumstances.  I freely admit that, if we were living in normal times, the amendment which I put forward here might not be necessary.  I do not think that in any circumstances it could be harmful but it may not be necessary. I have submitted that no legislation of this Oireachtas can extract water from a stone or blood from a turnip.  To adopt the words of the Bishop of Ross, although wages for agricultural labourers at present in many parts of the country are wretched, wretched as they are, the farmers cannot afford to pay them much less increase them.  I entirely adopt that view of the situation all over the country.  I am solicitous to ensure that, when the machinery of this Bill begins to operate, we shall fix for the agricultural labourers a wage which will compare favourably with that obtained by the agricultural labourers in other countries, and the first comparison that is going to be made is with the agricultural wages that are fixed in Great Britain.  We ought to have the same market as the British farmer and we ought to have on our land as good a standard of living as the British farmer has.  If these facts obtain, we ought to be able to get for our agricultural labourers as good a wage as is being paid in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of our agricultural labourers are either themselves temporary emigrants, or else they are familiar with neighbours and friends who go to England from time to time, and they will expect to get a wage which approximates, in any case, to the <Col N="1007" /> wages that are being paid under similar conditions in Great Britain. On the Second Stage, I read out certain figures for agricultural wages paid at present in Great Britain. They vary in different parts of the country from about 29/- to 32/-.  It has to be borne in mind that these wages are, in some cases, for an eight-hour day and are subject to substantial increase if the agricultural labourer is doing specialised work.</P>
    <P>In Hereford, the minimum wage is 11d.  In Warwick, it is 31/- for a 50 hour week, and 8½d. or 9d. per hour for overtime.  These are two typical cases.  I think that the rate is a little lower in Norfolk and some of the eastern counties, but in every case the wage is for a 50 or 52 hour week, and time over and above that has to be paid for.  It is merely sticking our heads in the sand to imagine that the farmers of this country can pay wages like those or anything near them, and I think it will be a deplorable thing if we start our system by fixing wages about 10/- a week lower for agricultural labourers in this country than the rate that obtains in Great Britain. The present average wage in this country is about 21/6 per week.  Certain Deputies have said that that rate of wages is going to be raised by these boards and that the process of raising them is going to be financed by the Government's fixing higher prices for the agricultural produce of the farmers.  Any such fallacy is folly, because the Government cannot finance increased agricultural wages by fixing higher prices for agricultural produce. The Government is not in a position to fix prices for 50 per cent. of the produce of the land.  If you look at the statistics of agricultural output, published in the September number of the &ldquo;Trade Journal,&rdquo; you will find that, of the total produce of the agricultural industry in 1929-30&mdash;one of the last normal years we had&mdash;50 per cent. was exported.  The value of the total produce was £64,850,000.  Of that, the agricultural community themselves consumed £21,000,000 worth, and they sold to industrial workers and provided individuals other than those living on the land with £11,790,000 worth of <Col N="1008" /> stuff.  The only agricultural produce the price of which can be artificially raised by the Government is that represented by the sum of £11,790,000. There would be no use in raising the price of the stuff which the farmer himself eats.  They cannot raise the price of the stuff that is being exported to Great Britain.  The best they can do is to maintain it by giving bounties to meet the tariffs on it.  But they can, by fixing the price of certain products substantially higher than the economic price, affect the value of £11,790,000 worth of produce out of a total of £64,000,000 worth.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies on the opposite side will say that things have changed greatly since then, that a great deal more stuff is being consumed in Saorstát Eireann by the industrial worker now than was consumed in 1929.  What are the facts?  In 1934-35 the consumption of agricultural produce by persons other than farmers or farm labourers had dropped from £11,790,000 to £10,060,000.  When Deputy Corry says that the right solution for this dilemma is to fix the price of agricultural produce at a higher level and compel the farmer to pay a higher wage, does he realise that in 1934-5, out of a total output of £40,000,000 worth, the Government could only raise the price of £10,000,000 worth, or a quarter of the entire output?  No matter what price you raise agricultural products in this country to, it is going to do nothing to help the farmer substantially to increase the wages of his labourer, however willing he may be to do so, because it is not going substantially to alter the amount of profit he makes on his enterprise.  Deputies will say that that is incredible, that beet and wheat at the prices at which they at present stand&mdash;27/6 in the case of wheat and 37/6 in the case of beet&mdash;must give the farmer a fair profit.  I do not think that either of them does.  Assuming for the moment that they do, let us take the case of Wexford.  Wexford is a county in which you had an increase of 17,112 acres of cereal crops between the years 1931 and 1935.  In that county, the average of the agricultural labourer's wages fell by 3/6 over that period.  The Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1009" /> knows Wexford well.  Does he allege that his own neighbours from Wexford are sweaters?  Does Deputy Corish allege that all the farmers of Wexford are sweating their men, grinding them down and withholding from them the wages to which they are entitled?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry contends that those farmers who have increased their cereal production by 17,000 acres in these years must be making money. He says that these prices are fixed on a remunerative level, that he can make plenty of money by growing wheat and beet and, presumably, the farmers of Wexford can do so, too.  Yet, their wages have dropped by 3/6 per week. Take the case of Kildare, which was held up to public odium as the home of the ranchers.  Kildare fell in with the new policy.  Kildare increased its output of cereals by about 30 per cent. In Kildare the wages have fallen by 6/-per week.  Take any county in which the output of cereal crops has materially increased and, in each one of them, you will find that agricultural wages have fallen heavily over the very period during which the increase in cereal production was going on.  You cannot escape from this dilemma: either the farmers are grinding down their labourers and are sweating their employees, or else they are doing the best they can under very difficult circumstances, and cannot afford to pay more.</P>
      <P>You have reduced, during the last five years, the exports of agricultural produce from £28,000,000 to £12,000,000. You have reduced the sales of agricultural produce as a whole, if you include the produce which is consumed by the agricultural community itself, from £64,000,000 to £40,000,000, but in order to get a true perspective of that situation we ought to make a fair allowance for the fall in world prices of agricultural goods over that same period if we are going to get a fair picture of what the Government of this country has done to the farmer over and above what world trends have done to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's last statement was an effort to show in perspective what the Government has done to the farmers here.  To do that certain figures, going back presumably some years, should be gone into.  I suggest that that is not relevant to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  It is necessary, in justice, to see what the true reduction is in this country as compared with Great Britain.  I have quoted certain figures.  They are subject to correction.  In any case, another occasion for the elaboration of them will arise, but the net result of the situation is that the farmers had £64,000,000 out of which to feed themselves and to get a profit to pay their labourers five years ago.  Now, they have got £40,000,000.  You have got to ask yourselves, how you are going to deal with that element in the situation. You have got to bear in mind at the same time, that the cost of living, taking all the items which go to make up that cost of living, has declined, but, if you extract from that figure the foodstuffs only, you will find that the cost of living in regard to foodstuffs only has declined much more steeply.  That means that the cost of clothing and of the other items which the farmer has to buy, and which are included in the general cost of living index figure, has not declined at all, but has gone up.  Therefore, the farmer with £20,000,000 less than he had has to pay much more proportionately for his clothes, boots and so forth, and at the same time we are now going to legislate requiring him by law to pay more to his labourer.  It cannot be done, and it cannot be done because he has not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to recapitulate the figures that the Minister gave us, but he showed that the average income of the individual farmer in this country was reduced from approximately £96 to £55, or £65 if you accept his calculation, so that even on that basis the individual farmer's income is down by £30 per annum.  Now, if we cannot get <Col N="1011" /> out of the farmer's pocket what appears to us to be a reasonable wage for his agricultural labourer, what alternative is left to us but to step in between the two parties and make up the difference?  My amendment cannot propose that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>And I think the Deputy was allowed to debate that fully on the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the opportunity to debate that proposal fully on the Money Resolution.  Here is the machinery by which that proposal can be carried into effect.  I ask that when the board goes to fix a wage for any district that they would first fix a fair rate of wages and an economic rate of wages.  I define the expression &ldquo;minimum fair rate of wages for any district&rdquo; as &ldquo;that rate of wages for agricultural wages in that district which in the opinion of the board is a living wage, taking into account the current cost of living for agricultural workers obtaining in that district for the time being.&rdquo;  I submit that no statutory board in this country can fix a wage for agricultural labourers lower than the figure stipulated in that part of my amendment.  No statutory board in this country can fix a rate of wages which they have got to go out and say is not a living wage.  You cannot, by law, condemn the entire community of agricultural labourers in this country to semi-starvation, and that is what it means if you deny them a living wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have got in this age accurate figures from scientists like Sir John Orr in England on what a living wage is. When I speak of a living wage I do not mean a luxurious wage.  When you fix such things by statute you fix a minimum on the clear understanding that, in prosperous times, it should be the duty of every employer to give as much over that minimum as he can afford.  When you fix a minimum by statute it has to be fixed at the lowest figure, and in defining a living minimum wage, fixed on the lowest figure, it has to be such that it will keep a man, his wife and family in a normal state of health.  I say that you cannot fix any rate of wages for agricultural <Col N="1012" /> labourers by statute if you are not in a position to say that it is a living wage. Therefore, there can be no objection to that part of my amendment.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the second part, it is nothing but the greatest hypocrisy if we fix a minimum living wage for labourers by statute for any district if we know that the result of doing that is to put half the labourers in the area on the dole.  Suppose we fix 30/- as the minimum living wage for agricultural labourers in the County Wexford, and that there is a farmer there who employs three labourers.  At the present time the average wage that is being paid to agricultural labourers in the County Wexford is 19/- a week.  The County Wexford farmer who is employing three labourers at the present time is paying out in wages £2 17s. 0d. a week. We come in and tell him that, from this day forth, he must pay to these three labourers a total of £4 10s. 0d. a week.  The farmer replies that his entire weekly income is £3 16s. 0d. He says there is 19/- for each of the three labourers and 19/ for himself. He says that all he has got is £3 16s. 0d., and that we are asking him by this legislation to pay out £4 10s. a week.  He says it cannot be done, and the only result of this legislation is that he has to let one of the men go.  I say that, far from conferring a boon on agricultural labourers by this legislation, we are doing them a material injury.  I say, further, that unless we face that possibility we are hypocritically closing our eyes to the facts.  We are deliberately legislating in the knowledge that we are not facing the facts: that we are trying to assuage public opinion and, at the same time, consciously knocking men out of a job.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputy Allen and to the Minister for Agriculture, both of whom are Wexford men, that the figure I have quoted is the average wage paid to agricultural labourers by farmers in County Wexford.  Will Deputy Allen get up and say that, to his own knowledge, his neighbours in the County Wexford are sweating their men, or does he think that his neighbours are paying their men as much as they can afford?  He ought <Col N="1013" /> to be able to tell us.  The Minister ought to be able to tell us.  If, as I believe, these farmers are paying their men as much as they can afford to pay them, what is going to happen if we fix wages at 30/-?  It can have only one result.  There is no use in Deputies saying: &ldquo;You are telling men to put their employees out of work.&rdquo;  Let us be clear on this.  Let no farmer put a man out of work in order to induce any Government in this country to abandon the principle of this Bill, a Fianna Fáil Government, a Fine Gael Government or a Labour Government; the Bill is going to be the law of this land, and no matter what happens, the wages of agricultural labourers are, from this time forward, going to be fixed by machinery analogous to that set out in the Bill, no matter what Government is in office, and it is not going to alter that fact in the slightest degree no matter what an individual farmer may do in Wexford, Cork, Cavan or Mayo.  I venture to say that all Deputies will join in administering that caution. Who, a Deputy might think, would be induced to victimise a labourer in order to prove the impossibility of working this Bill?  This Bill is going to be worked, no matter what the difficulties are.  I want the Minister to tell us how they are going to make the Bill work if their general policy is going to be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or else let him explain how the Bill will work in existing circumstances without my amendment. There is my amendment and I say that the case I make renders it absolutely essential that an economic wage be fixed by these boards in order that the country may know, firstly, what the labourer ought to get and, secondly, what the farmers are in a position to pay.  It is hypocrisy for any Deputy to say that you can fix a wage without reference to what the farmer is in a position to pay, because if you do you will be simply putting men out of a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I ask is that, when the wage is fixed for the area, it should be a wage on which the labourer can live, and it <Col N="1014" /> should be a wage that the farmer can afford to pay.  I also ask that the chairman or the board should give the public the reason for arriving at their conclusions.  Unless that is done, this Bill cannot work properly, or if it is worked it will result in grave suffering for the people or else in a grave injury to the good name of this country through the world.  The rates the farmers can afford at the present time are a public scandal.  In the words of the Bishop of Ross, they are wretched in the extreme.  The rates to which the workers are entitled should be as good as those they are able to get in Great Britain.  Bridge the gap between those two.  You have to do it before this Bill will work satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is inclined to pre-judge the work of the wages board and the committees. When putting down this amendment he is acting on the assumption that the board will not exercise the functions which it has a right to exercise and that it would not use its common-sense or good judgment.  Listening to the Deputy, a person would be inclined to come to the conclusion that the committees would not take into consideration existing local conditions when they would be arriving at the minimum rate of wages to be struck for any particular area.  Of course, we have different rates of wages in different counties.  We will have different rates-in different areas.</P>
      <P>I think an outstanding example would be County Dublin.  We will have a higher rate in County Dublin than in County Wexford, and the board will take notice of the existing conditions in Dublin when striking the minimum rate there.  In County Dublin the farmer gets a higher price for his agricultural produce as compared with County Wexford.  In County Dublin the rate must, of necessity, be higher because the cost of living in Dublin is higher than in Wexford.  Here I might state that the purchasing power of the lower rate of wage paid in the other county will be equal to the purchasing power of the higher rate in County Dublin.  That is quite evident.  I am quite confident that the committees will take all these things into consideration.</P>

They did not go during the last year or so by reason of the fact that they were unable to obtain an economic wage pulling beet there.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you have it in your statistics there.  I merely mention that so that Deputy Dillon can investigate all those matters when he is making a case in favour of his amendment.  I think the amendment would not be advantageous at this stage.  I believe it would lead to endless confusion and might also lead to bitterness between employers and <Col N="1017" /> employees, because if the employees at any time thought they were not getting a living wage, the employers would be blamed, and, consequently, we would have the peculiar position in which employers and employees were set against each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem as if Deputy Kelly did not grasp the points Deputy Dillon was endeavouring to make, and which, I think, he made quite clearly.  Certainly the amendment as set out does not at all mean the things which Deputy Kelly thinks it means, and there is no reason whatever to imagine that if it were adopted it would interfere with the rates of pay in one area as against another.  The farmer's prosperous year or lean year has nothing whatever to do with it.  As a matter of fact, the meaning of the amendment is that Deputy Dillon wants to get a true picture of the situation in the country. He simply asks that when the board goes around to fix a wage they will determine what wage the labourer ought to get in order to have a decent living for himself and his family, and, as against that, they should find out what wage the farmers are able to pay in their existing circumstances.  How Deputy Kelly can interpret that as he has interpreted it, I do not know, but those are the facts and that is the meaning of the amendment.  I am sure that Deputy Kelly, the Minister and everybody else, if they are in earnest about this Bill, want to get a true picture of what is happening in the country to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has made the case with regard to the drop in agricultural produce, and, notwithstanding the fact that there have been certain increases in wheat and beet, which are infinitesimal so far as the main agricultural output is concerned, Deputy Kelly and everybody else knows that the value of agricultural output, in other words, the farmers' income, has been considerably depressed and if Deputy Kelly thinks that that is the time for a board to fix a wage as a fair wage, being the amount which the farmer can pay to-day, it will provide a national exhibition of poverty which will not be any help to this country.  The <Col N="1018" /> amendment, I think, is very fair.  It is not going to tax the capacity of the board beyond what it is their business to do&mdash;to find the facts of the situation. We are convinced on this side and, no doubt, Fianna Fáil is as convinced as we are, that farmers, at the moment, are not able to pay the wages that a labourer ought to get in order to have a decent living.  We want that illustrated by the board and that is all we ask.  I think that is very fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's amendment means something altogether different.  It is brought in here for the very same purpose and with the very same object as the proposals issued by Deputy Dillon's organisation, when it was the Centre Party, after the General Election in Cork&mdash;to reduce the workers wages and make the beggars pay for putting out Cumann na nGaedheal.  Deputy Dillon's instructions to the board, if this amendment is carried, are: &ldquo;You can fix it as high as you like, gentlemen, and you can say that the labourers in my district are entitled to £2 10s. a week,&rdquo; and then come along afterwards and say: &ldquo;That is a fair wage, but that is all we poor farmers can give.&rdquo;  He talks of wages in England, and Deputy Kelly alluded to labourers in Meath pulling beet.  I wonder what fair wage would the English farmer pay for pulling beet at 35/- a ton, which is the price in England at present, with no pulp, and what that wage would be compared with the wage the Irish farmer pays for pulling beet at 42/- a ton, which is the price here.  I think that is a fair comparison for Deputy Dillon to make before he goes any further.  That is the difference in price in England and here.  In England it is 35/- a ton, and here 37/6, with free pulp.  Let Deputy Dillon make that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made inquiries as to where these figures of wages for the different counties came from and as to who made them up, because I was rather surprised. I admit that there are farmers here and there who would take advantage, and did take advantage, of low wages, and, in my parish to-day, there are men who, immediately after the instructions issued by the Party <Col N="1019" /> opposite, reduced their labourers' wages by 5/- or 6/- a week; who, where they had three men employed, put two off, and who were glad six months afterwards to take back those men at the old rate, and in a great many cases were unable to get them at that rate.  I am rather surprised at the attitude of Deputies opposite.  Three shillings a week is the difference, according to these famous figures, which figures I do not frankly believe. I have been assured that these wages figures are made up by Civic Guards in the different districts, and anybody who has any knowledge of the way in which they make up returns of all descriptions knows what that means. I frankly do not believe one iota of those figures.  I know that wages generally in my district at present are 14/ and board for agricultural labourers, and it is hard to get them at that rate in view of the other opportunities they have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural labourer is a man very anxiously sought after by builders.  He is a good hard worker and a man who will do better work than a city reared man.  He is eagerly sought after by builders in towns at present as a builders' labourer and we find it rather difficult to keep our men on that account.  What I am amazed at is that, seeing the woeful position of the agricultural labourers when they had only 3/- a week more in the days of prosperity&mdash;if you want to call it that&mdash;when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office, some Minister for Agriculture of that Party did not dream of setting up a wages board and seeing that the labourers got the benefit of the land flowing with milk and honey under the Cumann na nGaedheal régime.  The argument of Deputy Dillon is that wages were reduced by 3/6 per week.  Is that the difference between prosperity and hunger in agricultural labour?  If not, and if the farmers were so prosperous in the days before this terrible Government came in, it is rather surprising that some good-natured Deputy opposite, with the welfare of the ordinary poor agricultural <Col N="1020" /> labourer at heart, did not bring in an Agricultural Wages Bill and make the farmers pay something better out of their wealth in those days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am giving the reasons for it.  Deputy Dillon says that there were 17,000 acres of increased tillage in Wexford.  I know that there are several thousand acres of increased tillage in Cork.  That means that the labourers, who in other days were walking around the roads looking over the fences at the green grass growing and bullocks fattening, are getting some employment at any rate.  The men that were idle in those days are being employed now.  In fact some neighbours of mine in East Cork, who in the days of the Fine Gael régime were employing only two or three men, are now employing nine and ten, and cannot get enough of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Deputy Dillon has succeeded in turning himself into a common nuisance in this House.  He will always be a nuisance while he is here and I am afraid we shall have to wait for the general election to rid us of the nuisance.  That is the definite object of Deputy Dillon's amendment &mdash;to show a way out to the farmer members of the board, to show them a loophole by which they can say &ldquo;Oh, agricultural wages should be so and so; the real living wage on which an <Col N="1021" /> agricultural labourer can live is 50/-or 55/- a week but unfortunately our poor farmers can only afford to give them so much.  Let us see if we can bring them up to that.&rdquo;  That is the object of Deputy Dillon's amendment. Deputy Dillon is camouflaging it in a very nice way, but Deputy Dillon's camouflage is so well known that it will not be accepted anywhere.  Deputy Dillon talks about the Wexford farmers and about how poverty stricken they are.  Deputy Dillon seems to have forgotten one fact and that is that within the past three months he went down to Wexford and told all this to the farmers and labourers of County Wexford, and a lot more I am sure, when he had full liberty on the public platform.  The farmers and labourers of County Wexford, who, as Deputy Dillon has told us very often, only want to be left alone to do what they think right themselves, told him by the ballot box what they considered was right and sent Deputy Allen to represent them in this House.  Deputy Dillon had great hopes when he was removed from the unfortunate mess he was making in County Galway and went down to Wexford.  He had great hopes that the particular type of stuff he was going to give out would take better there but I think Deputy Allen should be forever grateful to Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down may be accused of many things but he certainly cannot be accused of being consistent.  The Deputy is against the amendment.  The Deputy is against showing the workers of this country the wages they should get and the wages they can get. Deputy Kelly showed the true mind of the Party opposite when he let the cat out of the bag.  He was afraid <Col N="1022" /> that if the agricultural workers of this country were shown the wages which they should be in receipt of, but which they cannot receive, even according to his own words, because of present conditions, it might set the labourer against the farmer.</P>

      <P>That is what the Deputy said when he was concluding. Deputy Corry is against any suggestion that the gap between the wage which the farmers can afford to pay and the actual wage should be made up, but Deputy Corry boasts of the fact that he himself is making money on the very same principle.  How much wheat would the Deputy have grown in the last three or four years if the gap were not bridged by the State?</P>

He is going to be shown that while he is prepared to support a principle that puts something into his own pocket, he will not support that principle when it is going to put something into the pockets of the agricultural labourers.  How much would the Deputy grow if the gap were not bridged by the State?  The principle is all right when applied to the Deputy and his colleagues, but it is all wrong when it is applied to the agricultural labourers.  The Deputy cannot get away from the fact that that is what is in this amendment and nothing else. The Deputy, not that it matters very much, talked of instructions having been issued by the members of this Party to farmers to reduce the wages of the labourers.</P>

      <P>He talked about lies, damned lies and statistics, but I need not go so far as statistics to characterise that statement of the Deputy.  It was quite clear, of course, that Deputy Kelly had no idea at all of what the amendment aimed at.  I can only conclude that the Deputy did not read the amendment, because if he read the amendment I cannot believe that he would have so misunderstood it.  We had it from Deputy Corry that the Irish farmers are now making so much profit out of beet-growing that they can afford to pay a much higher wage than the English farmers can afford to pay to their labourers.  We had the Deputy, however, denouncing the price paid for beet as being inadequate at a time when the price was much higher than it is now.  I said before in this House that Deputy Corry had one voice here and another voice as a member of the Beet Growers' Association. I remember the Deputy on one occasion using a very apt phrase to describe the increase in the price of beet which the Minister offered.</P>

However, I want to assure you, Sir, that I have no intention whatever of trying to follow the Deputy any further.  I do say to Deputy Corry that if the principle, which gave him an economic price for his wheat and beet, was good enough then for the Deputy and other members of his Party, it ought to be good enough for them now when it is proposed to apply it to the agricultural labourers of this country.  Deputy Corry should not take up the attitude here that he is prepared to stand for a <Col N="1024" /> principle if it is going to put money into his own pocket but that he is against the same principle if it is going to put money into the pockets of the worst paid workers in the country.</P>

I know I could not be exactly sure how the Deputy voted on that particular matter, but I know that his Party on one occasion voted here that 1½d. a gallon was enough for the farmer to get for his milk.  Wheat is not a subsidised crop; neither is beet a subsidised crop.</P>

      <P>With regard to this amendment, Deputy Dillon seeks to have three rates of wages fixed by this board&mdash;a minimum rate of wages, a minimum fair rate of wages, and a minimum economic rate of wages.  As we know, under the machinery of this Bill in coming to a decision on the fixing of the rate of wages we try, in the first place, to get unanimity amongst the members of the board, especially amongst the representatives of the farmers and the representatives of the agricultural labourers.  If we can get unanimity between those parties, then the chairman need not intervene except as it were to make it a rule of court.  If they do not agree, then the chairman has to decide.  It is very difficult to imagine that the board would agree to a minimum fair rate, except, of course, as Deputy Corry says, that the people knowing the greater amount would eventually come out of the Exchequer, it would not be anybody's business, as it were, to argue against a high rate.  You might get a certain amount of agreement. In the same way, when we talk about an economic rate, the farmer's representatives would naturally be inclined to put that rate as low as possible, because that is all he would have to <Col N="1026" /> pay, presumably, under Deputy Dillon's arrangement.  There again it would not be to anybody's interest, as it were, to argue against the farmer, and again, therefore, he would possibly get away with a rather low rate.</P>
      <P>The position we would have if we were to agree to Deputy Dillon's amendment would be something like this: The agricultural labourer would get a very high wage, the farmer would pay a very low wage, probably much lower than at present, and the State would pay the remainder.  I think that would be the inevitable result.  We are not setting up that sort of board.  We are setting up an arbitration board for one purpose.  If we were setting up a board for the purpose of trying to fix the proper economic rate that the farmer could pay, or to fix the proper rate that the labourer should get in order to live, then we would probably have a very different type of board&mdash; a board that would be qualified to judge those particular questions, and to come to an intelligent conclusion on them.  However, I am not going to argue against Deputy Dillon on that, because he would naturally say to me that if he carried his amendment he would perhaps also amend the constitution of the board so as to get those things right.  Leaving that aside, I do not see what the practical gain is to be.  If the board is compelled to say: &ldquo;Here is the economic rate; here is the fair wages rate, and here is the minimum rate we think the farmers should pay,&rdquo; and all that is published, it only gives rise to a further inevitable controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult for a trained scientist to make out what should be the proper standard of living for an agricultural labourer, or what is the wage that the farmer can afford to pay.  I am sure it is one of the most difficult things for a trained economist to attempt, but it is the easiest thing in the world for the untrained person to criticise, and we will have everybody in the country criticising the figure when it is once published. I am sure you will have all the farmers saying that the board has put the economic rate too high.  You will have all the labourers and their sympathisers saying that they put the fair-living <Col N="1027" /> wage too low.  The only result we would have is an interminable controversy over those figures, that is, of course, as the amendment stands, if the figures are just published, in order, as Deputy Brennan, Deputy Morrissey and others have said, to show the labourer what he should get, even though he is not going to get it, and to show the farmer what he should pay, even though he is paying more, under this Bill.  There is not very much to be gained by doing that.  If we decide that the Government cannot bridge the gap, there is absolutely no use in going on with this amendment and having those figures published for the sake of some theoretical figure which Deputy Dillon, Deputy Morrissey and others have in mind as the amount that the labourer should get or the farmer should pay.  I do not want to go further into that question.  I could give other reasons which I gave here yesterday, but I do not want to go into them again.  I am assuming, for the sake of argument, that Deputy Dillon is honest in this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps a very wide assumption, but I am going to assume it, anyway.  I myself believe that when we are setting up a board like this we want them to maintain confidence. I want Deputies opposite to take a sane view of this matter, and to try to make the board a success.  If they do want to make this board a success, let us give them a position in which they can maintain the confidence both of the farmers and of the agricultural labourers.  They cannot possibly maintain that confidence if they are compelled to say: &ldquo;This is what the farmer should pay; this is what the labourer should get; we are taking a middle course, and we say that this is going to be the wage.&rdquo;  There you have three targets to be attacked.  Let us make it one target&mdash;the minimum wage&mdash;and let them be attacked on that if anybody wants to attack them, but let it be that alone, and do not leave them open to attack on other counts.  Before I leave that point, I think it is rather an old saying that <Col N="1028" /> the wise judge gives his verdict but he does not give his reasons.  If the board we set up is going to be a wise board they will give their verdict, but as far as possible they should not be asked to give their reasons for determining what they consider a living wage, an economic wage, and all that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that we can only influence, in the way of increasing prices here at home, about 25 per cent. of our output.  In discussing this Bill, I have not claimed at any time that we were going to increase prices.  If we do improve the lot of the farmer, then all to the good, but whether we do improve his lot or not we think that this Bill is necessary.  As a matter of fact, I stated on the Second Reading that for the last two or three years we had improved the lot of the farmer by about £10,000,000 a year, and I further said that we were optimistic enough to think that that improvement was going to go on and that, if it were to go on, we wished to give the lowly-paid agricultural labourer a share in the farmer's prosperity.</P>

      <P>Yes, his increasing prosperity. As I was saying, Deputy Dillon talked about 25 per cent., but if he wanted to give the Dáil and the country a proper picture, he might have mentioned that our total exports are not much more than 25 per cent. They are 31 per cent.  After all, there is not much difference between 25 per cent. and 31 per cent., but one would imagine that our exports were enormous compared with what we were selling to our own towns and villages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would permit me to interrupt for a moment.  Is it not a fact that in 1926-7 the amount consumed by others than the agricultural community here was over £11,000,000&mdash;that is, consumed at home in our towns and villages; that in 1929-30, it was over £11,000,000, and that our exports were £31,000,000 &mdash;nearly three times as much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1929-30 the food consumed in towns and villages was <Col N="1029" /> £11,790,000, and what was exported was £31,830,000, whereas now the position is that we consume the same amount at home and only export £10,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to make the Deputy understand.  I have to go back to fundamentals with the Deputy.  If he knew a little about these things, we might be able to instruct him, but I am afraid he does not.  In former years we were importing a great deal of goods such as, for instance, wheat and sugar and other commodities, which everybody knows we are now growing or producing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that, on his own figures, the community here consumed £33,000,000 worth of stuff in 1929, and in 1934 it consumed only £27,000,000&mdash;£6,000,000 less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in value, but that is the reverse of what the Minister was saying a few moments ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I shall have to be patient with the Deputy.  &ldquo;In value,&rdquo; as the Deputy said, very decently, but I think it must be admitted that we should take general world conditions into account in such matters as this and that this Government should not be blamed for all the catastrophes.  One must remember the way in which general world prices went down and the way in which internal prices went down also, and if the quantities are taken into account, which the Deputy can ascertain by looking at the other page, I think he will find that we did consume as much, if not more, of all these commodities such as sugar, bread and so on; very <Col N="1030" /> much more meat and butter and eggs and other such items, but the value may have been less on account of the world fall in prices.  I say that we were consuming more here, therefore, as far as the ordinary person is concerned and that our standard of living was better because we were consuming more.  On the other hand, in value, what we consumed was less in 1934 than in 1931, but taking that compared with exports, what we consumed was better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of producing for our own consumption here, and cutting down our imports to that extent.  Take one item of which I am very proud.  We imported about £1,300,000 worth of bacon in 1931&mdash;rotten bacon&mdash;from other countries, and for that we substituted our own good bacon, produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And wiped out practically the entire pig population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the pig population is higher than it was, and we are giving our people good bacon now, and not that stuff that came across from other countries.  Now, another thing that is unfair about the speeches from the benches opposite is what has been said rather definitely by some of the members opposite, and that is that if this economic war were to disappear, the farmers would pay good wages always and there would be no difficulty at all.  I have said, over and over again here, that before the economic war started in 1931 there were many farmers who would not pay more than 17/- a week in wages, and some of them were paying less.  These are the men we want to get at and to see that they pay more.  I do not know if <Col N="1031" /> Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Dillon, who are so much in favour of subsidies in this case, would argue that if we were back to the 1931 conditions we should subsidise the man that was paying less than 17/- a week and enable him, by means of that subsidy, to pay more.  I think that that is a ridiculous proposition and that no Deputy would stand for it for a moment except in order to get out of a political dilemma.  Many farmers are paying more than 25/-, and the majority are paying over 21/-, but even so there are some farmers paying less than 17/-.  Is it the contention of the Deputies opposite that the farmer who has been paying all the time, say, 27/- should get a subsidy, and that the farmer who is only paying 17/- should get a subsidy of 10/- to make up the difference between 17/- and 27/-?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let us take one county, for example, or let us take a parish, if the Deputy likes, and make a flat rate for one parish.  In many parishes you will have the position of one farmer paying 27/- and another farmer paying 17/-.  The Deputies opposite want to say to the man who is paying 27/-: &ldquo;We know that you cannot pay that and we will give you a subsidy to help you out&rdquo;; and to say to the man who is only paying 17/- that they will give him another 10/- in order to make him pay more.</P>

      <P>The Minister is rambling now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I cannot follow the Deputy's ramblings. However, I shall do my best to follow his plan.  Deputy Dillon says that this board, inevitably, will have to condemn agricultural labourers to starvation on the present basis of agriculture&mdash;that it will have to condemn them to a starvation wage. Again, I want to know what would be the Deputy's position in 1931, when there was no economic war, or in two or three years' time, if conditions are changed?  Would there still be a starvation wage?  When the Deputy asks us do we believe that the farmers <Col N="1032" /> are paying sweated wages, I say: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;certain farmers are paying sweated wages and have always paid sweated wages.  After all, when you had a position, such as you had in 1931, of some farmers paying 25/- and others paying only 17/-, there must have been sweating there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that the 19/- average in Wexford represents, generally, sweating by the farmers in Wexford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who are bringing down that average are certainly sweating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, 19/- is the average there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some who are trying to bring down the average, but the majority are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, they are paying sweated wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if so, I suppose they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear Deputy Allen on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another thing the Deputy says is that if we fix this wage at a higher level than the average at present paid, it will inevitably lead to unemployment, and he says that that is hypocrisy.  These are the Deputy's own words.  He says that if we put up a Bill of this kind to improve the lot of the agricultural wage earner, and as a result we cause unemployment amongst the agricultural wage earners that that is hypocrisy.  The Deputy's contention is this, that if we increase the price of the agricultural wage by 50 per cent. all round, we will have a decrease of 33 and one-third per cent. in employment.  The very same arguments could be used in the case of industrial employment, because I am absolutely sure we could go to some given industry and we could say to that industrialist: &ldquo;If you reduce the wages of your employees by 50 per cent. you could do a big export business and employ more people.&rdquo;  If doing the one thing is hypocrisy the Deputy would not admit that doing the other was hypocrisy.  If the Minister for <Col N="1033" /> Industry and Commerce brought in a Bill here reducing the wages of our woollen mill workers&mdash;I say compulsorily reducing them by 50 per cent. in order to build up a big export business and employ twice as many people, the Deputy would say that is hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hypocrisy in the one case but not in the other.  What we are doing in this case is to employ the same means as are employed in industry. In industry the labourers are organised and they have a wage.  It is because the agricultural labourers are unorganised that they are paid the present low wage.</P>

Naturally, these things should be taken into account, if the board here is endeavouring to put our agricultural labourers in as good a position as the agricultural labourers in England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That it is camouflage and nothing else.  That is my objection.  I say that there is no gap.  The point made by Deputy Morrissey as an argument for a subsidy, that we have already given a subsidy for beet and wheat, is in fact more an argument against it.  It is an argument against why there cannot be a gap here because by these subsidies to beet and wheat we are improving the condition of the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say it does.  But I say that the farmers growing beet and wheat should be able to bridge this gap themselves.  Beet and wheat are claimed to be subsidised crops, as <Col N="1035" /> in fact is everything else.  You could not produce anything in this country at the moment in open competition with the world, because some country or other would beat us in some commodity or other, whether it was wheat or bacon or butter.  Everything has to be subsidised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the amendment is that the Deputy knows quite clearly on the Money Resolution before the Committee Stage that the money is not forthcoming to do this thing.  Then it is argued by Deputy Morrissey that the farmers and labourers could ascertain what the one is able to pay and what the other is to get.  What I say is this, that if this Bill is to work smoothly and if it is to be a success let them fix the wage that the farmer has to pay and that the labourer will accept.  It will be a fair wage, at any rate.  This thing is not going to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just said in two successive breaths that there is no gap between the economic wage and the fair wage, and in the next breath he says that the gap between these two is going to cost £4,000,000.  Now, which of them is it to be?  Is there a gap, and will it take £4,000,000 to fill that gap or is there no gap?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister spoke at great length but it is with his last two sentences that I am concerned. The Minister could speak, I am sure, for an hour and a half more to explain away and to reconcile these two sentences and he would fail to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is this: the Minister appoints his own chairman&mdash; the man he is going to appoint.  This chairman is going down the country. There are three independent members <Col N="1036" /> of the board and there are the labourers' representatives and the farmers' representatives.  The three independent members are going to enter into a conspiracy with the farmer representatives and labour representatives, in order to completely upset the Minister's system of scheme.  Unless the three independent members enter into a conspiracy to create this false and fraudulent gap, the fixation of the wages rates falls into the hands of the Minister's nominee, the chairman of the board; and the Minister, in face of that, comes to this House and says: &ldquo;My chairman who is going to hold office at my pleasure, the man I am going to put into this position, is going down the country to create an artificial gap, the existence of which I do not admit, and the creation of that gap is to cost the State £4,000,000 a year.&rdquo; He will be the queerest appointee ever made in this country, and that is saying a lot.  That cock will not fight, and the Minister knows it.  Of course there will be a gap, under present circumstances, between the living wage and the economic wage.  The Minister knows that it will be no artificial gap. It is ludicrous folly to waste the time of the House making absurd contentions of that kind.  Another contribution from the Minister, in the course of the discussion, was that there is no use telling people the reason for any decisions when the situation is that labourers are not going to get what they ought to get, and that farmers will be made pay more than they ought pay. These are the Minister's own words, that there is no use giving the labourers reasons as to what they should get, when they are not going to get it, or giving reasons to farmers as to what they should pay, if they have to pay more than they can.  The Minister plainly tells us that he believes the boards have to give the labourers less than they are entitled to get and, at the same time to make the employers pay more than they are able to afford.</P>

      <P>The Minister said there was no use telling the farmers the reasons why they are being made pay more than they should pay.  If the <Col N="1037" /> Minister's test is going to deprive the agricultural labourers of a fair wage and, at the same time, bankrupt the industry, the real service that is going to be done by this Bill is very difficult to evaluate.  Of course, the ideal way would be to put the industry on such a basis that when you fix the economic wage and the living wage, you would get the same figure.  What I would like to see, and what I believe could be achieved in this country, would be that after you had reached the stage when the figure would be the same, the economic wage would begin to creep above the living wage and we could fix the economic wage higher than the bare living minimum for agriculture.  Why not?  If we can make agriculture prosperous as a whole, why should not the agricultural labourer be entitled to as wide a margin over a bare living wage as the industrial worker is getting? Out of that industry everything in this country is paid for.  It would not be relevant to go into that now.  Far from saying that I anticipate that there would be a gap between the economic and the living wage, I look forward to the day when the economic wage will be higher than the living wage.  I do not think we should rest content until we have that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore, for whose judgment I have a perennial and ever-growing respect, should remember that the Minister says that there is going to be a gap, and that it will take £4,000,000 sterling to bridge it. That is a long way from the day when the economic wage will be higher than the living wage.  I wonder would Deputy Moore spend the rest of the afternoon asking himself what has reduced agricultural labourers to such a level, that they are £4,000,000 per annum below the ideal that we ought to have set for ourselves.  Lastly, the Minister said that there was no analogy between agriculture and industry. There is the futility of the present Government Party.  They do not realise that we are all living out of the land; that it is all we have got. You can build a factory or you can abstain from building it, or you can embark on an industrial venture, or <Col N="1038" /> put your capital into something else, but the land is there always.  It is all we have got, and unless we can devise ways and means of working it profitably we will all go to the wall.  There is no use talking about or comparing the condition of the agricultural workers and industrial workers.  We have not the option of closing up the land.  If we come to the conclusion that an industry cannot pay its way without imposing slave conditions of labour, we can close it down, cut the loss, and put the men working at some other business.  We cannot get out of the land.  It is all we have got, and if we cannot make a living out of it we have all to cut our standard of living to what the land will allow.  The peasants of Central Europe did that after trying a variety of crops and they are now going around in sheep skins and pampooties.  Do you imagine that they would wear sheep skin hats if they were in a position to buy hats in Bond Street?  They wear them because they cannot afford anything else, and they are glad to have them. I would be long sorry to see Deputy Moore driving through the streets of Bray in a sheep skin.</P>

      <P>The £5,000,000 was very useful for making speeches about, and similarly the low wages of agricultural labourers are useful for making speeches about.  I do not believe the amendment was ever seriously intended; Deputy Dillon is the last man who would propose seriously to entrust a wages board with the task of finding out what is an economic wage.  Can the Deputy quote any country in which there has been an inquiry as to what is an economic wage in any industry?  How much more difficult would it be to find out what would be an economic wage in agriculture, or what would be a fair living wage?  What standard is to be taken?  Who is to fix the standard&mdash; the labourers themselves or some other class?  Would we have the curious anomaly of a class other than the labourers themselves imposing a standard on the labouring class?  That would be hardly consistent with the anxiety for democratic liberty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the committees that are to be appointed to investigate this matter will try to come to some arrangement with regard to a fair wage for working men.  They will have a problem to decide.  What you might call a fair living wage for agricultural workers is fixed at a certain figure by this board, having taken everything into consideration.  The same thing will apply on the other side when they come to consider the employers' side and come to a decision as to what is considered to be a wage that the farmer can afford to pay.  The Minister seemed to think that it will be easy to bridge the difference between the two.  I do not think it will.  I think it will be a big problem because, to my mind, it is a big difference. The Minister stated some farmers were paying about 17/- a week.  That may be so in a few cases, but I do not believe it occurs in many cases, because I know the farmers are prepared to pay the best wages they can afford to their workers.  The people who might, perhaps, try to get sweated labour are very few in the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is sure to be a difference between the people who will represent the farmers and those who represent the workers, and how that difference is going to be bridged I do not know. The Minister says he is not going to take the responsibility by giving any help or assistance to bridge that difference. The wages board is not going to improve the position of agricultural workers if the farmer has not sufficient to meet what is considered a fair wage, and I think that they are practically as well-off at the moment, with the exception of some people whom the <Col N="1041" /> Minister referred to with 17/- or 18/-per week, as they will be after the board do their best to settle this matter. Any wage that will be fixed by the board will have to be fixed on the basis of what the farmer can afford as a wage that he can make out of his industry.  On the other side, there is the question of what will be a fair living wage for the worker.  As it stands at the moment, there is a difference there.  The average wage of 21/-per week is not a fair one for agricultural workers if it were possible to give them a higher wage.  As I say, the people who might take advantage of being able to employ labour at 17/- are very few.</P>
    <P>Here is a problem that they will have to consider also.  What difference would there be in the work that labourers do every week, one man compared with another?  How is that problem going to be solved or got over?  You have a number of good workers who are prepared to do a fair day's work every day, who are capable and good, and they are entitled to a decent wage as far as we can afford to pay it.  On the other hand, you have a class of people&mdash;perhaps they are in the minority&mdash;who are careless and do not care how they put in their day, or whether they give a good return or not.  Some of the Labour members may resent that statement, but I do not make it to ridicule or run down the labourers in any way.  They know it is a fact.  There is a big difference between the class of workers we have to deal with.  Some are good and some are only very middling.  It you put all these people into one category and fix one wage for them, to my mind it will lead to a certain amount of unemployment.  If the wage is fixed at a higher rate than farmers can afford to pay, that will also lead to unemployment.  I should like to pay my men a better wage if I could afford it.  How you are to bridge that difference I cannot understand.  If the Minister is not prepared to help in the matter, I do not think the board, no matter how energetically it may work, can do any good.</P>

      <P>As to the £4,000,000 which was mentioned, I made an <Col N="1042" /> appeal to Deputies opposite to treat this thing in the best possible way so that we might have a workable scheme. I suppose I was foolish in making that appeal and, as it were, putting all my cards on the table, and that I should have played the political game they are playing.  It is ridiculous to say that I stated it would take £4,000,000 to bridge the gap.  I said that some farmers were paying 17/- per week, and that to bring that up to 30/- would take £4,000,000.  No one would accuse me, if they want to be fair, of saying that the economic wage is 17/- and the living wage is 30/-.  I gave that as an example of what it would cost.</P>

      <P>All through the various stages of the Bill Deputy Dillon has left us in the position that we really do not know whether he is for or against the Bill.  We propose to vote against this amendment and I want to explain why.  As far as I can see, this amendment enables Deputy Dillon to face both ways.  The Minister told him yesterday during the discussion on the Money Resolution that that is what he has been doing during the progress of the Bill through the House.  I think this is evidence of that fact.  If this amendment were passed it would appear to me that it would be prompting the wages board to fix a certain wage, the idea at the back of their minds being that the Minister is going to make up some difference or another. I suggest that it is a very wrong principle to put an amendment of that kind into a Bill to prompt people to fix a certain wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon tells us that he is in favour of the agricultural labourer getting a living wage.  It strikes me that the only reason he says that is because he thinks, deep down in his mind, that the farmer is unable to pay a living wage.  He says that when this Bill is put into operation, if the wages board decide upon a certain wage <Col N="1043" /> which the farmer thinks he is unable to pay, the farmer who has three labourers will probably turn away one in order to enable him to pay the other two.  I think everybody will admit that there is no farmer keeping a labourer for the sake of keeping him or for love of him, but because he wants a labourer to do certain work and because he cannot do without him. We also know that there is no employer in this country, farmer or industrialist, paying the maximum amount he would be able to pay to any worker.  We all know the difficulties that trade unions have in endeavouring to secure a living wage in any industry in this country, agricultural or industrial.  For the reason I have already stated, that we believe this amendment would prompt a certain action on the part of the wages board, and prejudice the position of the board, and the labourer and the State, we are going to vote against it.  We believe it would be injudicious to put an amendment of this kind into the Bill.  As Deputy Kelly already stated, it would prejudge the case.</P>

It is for the Minister to bridge the gap, if there is a gap, and I say there is.  There can be no valid objection to letting the public see what the amount of a living wage is and what the wage is that the farmer can afford to pay, assuming that he is paying less than the Minister's nominee thinks it possible to extract from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to say a few words in reply to Deputy Dillon's gyrations in connection with this whole Agricultural Wages Bill.  The Deputy pretends that this amendment is designed to improve the Bill and assist the agricultural worker, and the agricultural employer.  Anybody who has any recollection of the antics of the Fine Gael Party in respect of agricultural wages knows that this amendment by Deputy Dillon has one purpose and one purpose only&mdash;to deprive the Bill of certain advantages at present contained in it.  We submitted a motion a short time ago calling <Col N="1045" /> on the Government to establish a board to regulate wages in the agricultural industry.  Members of Deputy Dillon's Party submitted an amendment to that motion.  The amendment was not to have an agricultural wages board set up with greater speed than we desired.  It was not to make the board more effective than we desired.  Instead, the whole purpose of the amendment was to set up a commission to enable Deputy Dillon and his followers to carry on the same old cant and humbug about the economic war.  The mentality of the Party opposite regarding agricultural wages was revealed when they submitted an amendment having for its object the shelving of our motion and the concentration of the attention of this House on that old war horse&mdash;the economic war.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's Party has in the past ranted around the country about high rates, and the farmer's inability to pay the rates.  When that proved to be a damp squib, the Party chased the question of land annuities and the inability of the farmers to pay the annuities. Then they thought that votes might be gained by inviting the farmers not to pay their annuities.  Some members of the Party opposite advised them not to pay.  The rates racket is dead.  There are no more political tricks in that for the Fine Gael Party.  There are very few political tricks left in the land annuities.  Now, Deputy Dillon wants to have this fair rate of wages and this economic rate of wages introduced.  If the Minister were to accept this amendment I would lay a bet with any other Deputy that within a week of this date Deputy Dillon would be found parading the country talking about the bridging of the difference between the fair rate and the economic rate.  The Deputy merely wants another stunt with which he can perambulate the country.  That is the whole object of the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, as drawn, the Minister is making as reasonable an effort as possible to regulate wages in the agricultural industry.  No matter how low the wages are, they should be regulated. The position that exists in agriculture in regard to unregulated wages existed at one time in industry generally.  In <Col N="1046" /> industry generally, there was a time when employers paid any rate of wages they liked.  Industrial conditions and trade union organisation have changed that mentality very considerably and very effectively, and now we have the Conditions of Employment Act, which makes the unorganised industrial employer pay the same rate of wages as the organised and fair-minded industrial employer.  Why should we not have the same state of affairs in respect of agriculture?  It will not be easy to get it.  It may be a long and difficult process.  We shall probably have to overcome the same obstacles which had to be overcome before wages in industry generally were regulated.  I believe that, with a Bill creating regulatory machinery of this kind, we can ultimately get to the point at which wages in agriculture can be regulated in a manner comparable with wages in industry.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Holohan's point of view, as expressed in this House.  I think that there is a thousand times more sincerity in Deputy Holohan's point of view than in the point of view expressed by Deputy Dillon.  I think that Deputy Holohan will admit that there would be very little use in fixing a rate of wages which would be considered to be a fair rate and fixing an economic rate which would, apparently, be much lower than the theoretical fair rate.  Every farmer who wants to extend to his worker the best possible conditions is concerned only with the fixation of one wage&mdash; the wage it is possible for him to pay, as judged by a fair-minded tribunal set up to adjudicate in disputes between the agricultural employer, on the one hand, and the agricultural employee, on the other.</P>

      <P>I shall do very much better when I see this amendment defeated.  Deputy Holohan says there is no use in fixing a rate of wages the farmer cannot pay.  Nobody wants to fix a rate of wages the farming industry cannot pay.  If that problem arises, what must be done is: endeavour to put the farmer in a position in which it will be possible for him to pay a rate of wages which every fair-minded person in the country and the agricultural wages board consider a just rate.  I think steps have already been taken to enable the farmer to organise his economy on that basis. Deputy Dillon would tell us that the most prosperous years this country ever experienced were the ten years from 1922 to 1932&mdash;that the only people who have ever seen prosperity were the population living here under the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration. Even in the prosperous days from 1922 to 1932, the Deputy's Party did nothing whatever to fix agricultural wages or to establish an agricultural wages board.</P>

    <P>They had no intention whatever of establishing an agricultural wages board, even in those so-called prosperous years, to regulate the wages of agricultural workers.  If Deputy Dillon cares to look up the statistics published by the last Government, by the Party of which he is now a member, he will find that during those years of so-called prosperity the rate of wages <Col N="1048" /> for agricultural workers, as officially returned by the Department of Industry and Commerce, was extremely low, having regard to the so-called prosperity which the Fine Gael Party says existed from 1922 to 1932.  If Deputy Dillon takes the trouble to look up the official statistics he will find that from 1922 to 1932 the rate of wages in the agricultural industry was falling, notwithstanding all the prosperity of which the Deputy now talks.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if it is not already obvious to every intelligent Deputy, that this amendment by Deputy Dillon is just a little scheme by him to enable him to have something to rant about in the country during the next few months.  That is the whole purpose of the amendment.  There is no intention whatever in the amendment to assist the agricultural worker.  All that the Deputy wants to do is to try to find something else to talk about, now that the other efforts to raise scares on various issues have fallen, politically, dead, so far as the Party opposite is concerned.  I think that so far as the farmers in the country are concerned, and particularly the farmers who want to pay a decent rate of wages so far as it is possible for them to pay it, the kind of agricultural wages board which they want is one which will consist of fair-minded, independent men, living in a world of reality, who, knowing the position of both the agricultural worker and the agricultural employer, will say, having regard to this set of circumstances, that a certain rate of wages ought to be fixed and observed in the entire industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all wish, of course, that our agricultural industry was more prosperous than it is, but the agricultural industry in every country in the world is passing through a period of unparalleled <Col N="1049" /> depression.  Here, some effort has been made to overcome that depression by the regulation of prices, but I think that further efforts will have to be made in the way of regulating prices, even by the fixation of higher prices, because it is quite impossible to imagine that you can have prosperity in the agricultural industry, or in any other industry, when people are producing commodities and are not able to get for them a price which pays them for their expenditure of capital and of energy.  So far as we are concerned, we have always advocated the fixation of fair prices for agricultural produce.  I think that a combination of the fixation of fair prices for agricultural produce and the establishment of a fair-minded arbitration board would help, in a large measure, to bring contentment to the agricultural industry and more prosperity for the two elements&mdash;labourer and employer &mdash;engaged in it.  Deputy Dillon's amendment is not designed to achieve that objective.  It is a wrecking amendment.  It is part and parcel of the mentality which the Deputy displayed recently when opposing the establishment of an agricultural wages board.  For that reason I think the House ought to reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that Deputy Norton and the Labour Party have allowed themselves to be mesmerised by a very extraordinary interest in the mental state of Deputy Dillon.  Really what we are concerned with is not the mental state of Deputy Dillon or his motives.  What we are concerned with is the effect of his amendment and not the purpose of it. Now, I supported this Bill from the outset, and I would support the Labour resolution with regard to agricultural wages as against the Fine Gael amendment to it if we had come to a discussion of that resolution.  I support this Bill.  I would oppose this amendment if I regarded it as an amendment which would have the effect of wrecking the Bill, but I cannot see for the life of me that it would have that effect.  The amendment does not provide for any subsidy, large or small, from the Government.  It provides just for getting additional information which it seems to me would be of value. For that reason, I intend to support the amendment, although I am entirely in good faith in my support of this Bill, and would support the Bill if this amendment had not been introduced.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) provides that any minimum rates of wages fixed by the board in respect of a wages district may be so fixed as to apply universally to such district or to any special class of agricultural workers, or to any special area in such district. Has the Minister's attention been directed to the situation which has arisen in Kildare, for instance, where, although there has been a very substantial increase in the cultivation of the subsidised crops for which he is responsible, wages have fallen by 6/-? Is it proposed to make a special area of that kind within the general area, or has the Minister any observation to make which would explain the extraordinary fall in wages in the constituency represented by Deputy Norton?</P>

They could fix different wages for South Kildare and North Kildare, if they so wished.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any person, employed or desiring to be employed as an agricultural worker on time work or otherwise to which a minimum rate fixed under the Act is applicable, makes application to the board for exemption from the provisions of the Act, the board shall grant such exemption, and it shall not be obligatory on the applicant <Col N="1054" /> to give any reason to the board.</P>
    <P>With the Minister's object in Section 18, I am in entire agreement, but I do not believe that that section will achieve his object, for the simple reason that anybody knowing the nature of the Irish worker knows very well that if they are suffering from any defects, mental, physical, moral or otherwise, no matter what inducement is held out to them, they will not be tempted to proclaim that they are suffering from these defects.  The section lays down the particular types of individuals to whom it will apply.  I do not believe that 1 per cent. of the people suffering from any affliction will apply for exemption, and the result will be that they will hold themselves out to be people qualified to receive the minimum rates.  The consequences will be that they will be registered as unemployed, and will draw the unemployment dole.</P>
    <P>I think that must have occurred to the Minister, who, I am sure, can find a more suitable wording than that in the Bill.  I think the amendment I suggest would meet the object the Minister has in view.  There is no reason why unfortunate people who, through no fault of their own, happen to suffer from some affliction or some defect of one sort or another, should be asked to do this, and, so far as I know, there is no precedent for anything of the sort, unless we go back a couple of thousand years to the time when the lepers proclaimed themselves unclean. That is not a principle which would commend itself to anybody in 1936, especially in Ireland, and to a class of people so sensitive as Irish workers.  I think the Minister will agree that the section needs to be amended, and I think my amendment should meet the Minister's object and make the section workable.  There is no use in putting something into a section which is not going to work, and I believe this section will not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the object which Deputy McGovern has in view, which is, clearly, to spare the feelings of persons who find themselves so circumstanced that they have to make application for <Col N="1055" /> exemption under the terms of Section 18.  I think every Deputy will share Deputy McGovern's feelings in that regard, and I see that the circumstances envisaged create a somewhat difficult situation, because occasions will arise when it will be the cause of embarrassment and distress to individuals, who have to make this application, to come before a board and reveal the intimate personal circumstances which induced them to seek exemption.  I am quite satisfied, however, that the terms of Deputy McGovern's and Deputy O'Donovan's amendment would be very much too wide, because it would permit of any man who was competent to get employment entering into a conspiracy with an unscrupulous employer to get himself exempted from the terms of the Act, and to accept work at a rate of wages lower than that fixed as the minimum for that particular district or area.  If that were permitted, the whole Bill would collapse and would not work at all.</P>
      <P>I strongly commend to the Minister the matter which Deputy McGovern has mentioned, and if any scheme could be devised whereby these exemption certificates could be provided for disabled persons without publicity, such as requiring them to come and state to a board the nature of their disablement, I should be very glad to know of it.  Personally, I have not been able to think of a plan, but if the presentation of a general certificate from a qualified physician that a labourer was disabled generally, without specifying the nature of his disablement, would meet the situation, I think the Minister might consider it. Perhaps the Minister could think of a plan himself to meet the very legitimate point Deputy McGovern has raised.  I think Deputy McGovern will agree that his amendment, in the form in which it appears on the Paper, is much too wide and would be open to abuse which he certainly would not care to sponsor, and which, I am quite satisfied, he will agree with me should be provided against.</P>

      <P>I wonder what Deputy McGovern and Deputy O'Donovan had <Col N="1056" /> at the back of their minds in putting forward this amendment.  If there was anything calculated to wipe out the Bill it is this amendment.  I could imagine some of the advertisements that would appear in the public Press if the amendment were carried.  They would run something like this: &ldquo;Wanted, a general farm labourer; must be prepared to rise early and work late; and must be prepared to apply for exemption under the McGovern clause of the Agricultural Wages Act.&rdquo;  I think that would be the position if the amendment were carried.  I would not agree with the suggestion as to a certificate from a medical doctor.  I do not know whether the Minister can meet the matter in any other way, but I cannot see any great objection to any labourer coming before the wages board and stating his reasons for exemption.  If you meet it in any way outside the section, it will undoubtedly be open to abuse.  Deputy McGovern's amendment is, on the face of it, ridiculous. It would only mean advertisements of the type I have suggested.  As I say, I do not see what objection any labourer would have.  I can understand the necessity for exemption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that the case of a man who found himself, by reason of infirmity, old age or any other cause, unable to cope with the ordinary agricultural labourer's work, and who would want to get a smaller job on a farm, would be met very fairly by the wages board.  After all, the wages board is going to be a body of hardheaded, fair-minded men, who will understand agricultural conditions, and who will be prepared, I am sure, to meet such a situation fairly.  I am afraid that any other way of meeting the situation is going to leave the Bill open to abuse and that is what we must avoid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that Deputy McGovern was actuated by the motives to which he gave expression in moving his amendment on behalf of a certain section of agricultural workers who, because of some <Col N="1057" /> disability, would be unable to qualify for, and be entitled to earn the minimum wages fixed, but he evidently failed to visualise, as pointed out by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corry, the danger of the amendment.  I believe that the passing of the amendment would mean the absolute wrecking of the Act.  The majority of the agricultural workers of the country do not suffer from any great physical disabilities that prevent them following their ordinary avocation.  The number of people so affected will, I think, be a very small proportion of the entire agricultural workers.  It is suggested in this amendment that they are to apply to the board for exemption without stating the reasons, but the reasons are already obvious because the worker makes the application by reason of the fact that, owing to a particular disability, he is unable to earn the minimum wage.  What is to prevent such a man, in common with the rest of his fellows, availing of the provisions of Section 18?  If there happens to be a man who works for a farmer and who through some physical infirmity is not able to do quite as much as other workers, it will be found in practice, I believe, that the employer, because of associations with the worker which have lasted over a long time, will be satisfied to pay him just as much as he would pay to other workers.  I do not think there will be many cases of this sort coming before the board for adjudication.  Beyond the fact, as suggested by Deputy McGovern, that a person would not have to go before the board to disclose his complaint, the amendment would confer no real advantage and certainly would not compensate for wrecking the Bill completely.  You would have all kinds of conspiracies if the amendment were adopted, such as has been suggested by Deputy Dillon, to wreck the minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that even in trades in which the workers are much better organised than agricultural workers, there is a tendency amongst some workers to accept a lower wage than that generally recognised and unscrupulous employers have been able to utilise that weakness and human frailty to take into their employment men who <Col N="1058" /> are physically capable of earning just as much as their fellows.  If that happens amongst organised workers, I can visualise what will happen amongst a comparatively disorganised body such as agricultural labourers.  I would suggest to Deputy McGovern, in view of all that has been said, that he should withdraw his amendment and allow the matter to be dealt with by the provisions of Section 18.  I do not think that there will be any hardship inflicted on anybody by that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite prepared to suggest an alternative and I hope to have the support of Deputy Keyes for it.  He has referred to individuals who are called upon to disclose their complaints.  He has stated that there should be some inducement rather than a desire to allow them to work for rates under the minimum wages.  That is no inducement for anybody to disclose his disability but, in order to give them an inducement, I would suggest that the Minister should pay the difference between what the man was actually capable of earning and the minimum wage.  That is only just and fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The disadvantages of the amendment have been pointed out by previous speakers but I just want to allay any fears that Deputy McGovern may have.  I do not think this investigation is going to take place in public in the degrading way which he bad in mind.  The section first of all says &ldquo;If, on application.&rdquo;  That means, of course, that a person who does not realise his infirmity himself is not going to make application.  A person of deficient mind does not realise that he has that deficiency and the application would be accepted from his father, mother, sister or brother or even his employer.  If the application comes in, it is not necessary, either, as far as I see from the section, and I do not believe the board would insist on it, <Col N="1059" /> that the worker should appear before the board.</P>
      <P>The inspector will call and I suppose we can rely upon inspectors being discreet and not making too much fuss about the matter.  The inspector can call round in the ordinary way, just have a chat with the person concerned and make up his mind as to whether the exemption is justified. If the board decides on exemption I think the form the certificate will take is: &ldquo;Exempted under Section 18.&rdquo; There is no reason why they should state what a person is suffering from, and I think, therefore, that all these things that Deputy McGovern was so much afraid of are not likely to happen. There is no reason why a person should be ashamed, because the person himself may not come into it at all.  If a person is suffering from a physical deformity he is not usually ashamed of it.  If it is a case of mental deficiency, the person does not know, and probably never will realise, that he has got this exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is well known throughout the country that the general time for employing agricultural labourers is 25th March to 25th March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it varies so much; perhaps other Deputies will be wiser on that matter. I know that in Cork County at any rate, and in adjoining counties also, it is 25th March to 25th March.  It would make things awkward, I think, to bring the Act into operation in the middle of a year.  Is there anything to prevent the Minister from bringing it into operation on that date?  Why wait until May or June?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us a rough idea as to what he proposes to do when the Act is passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Act is passed we must notify whoever we think will be representative of farmers and labourers to put up a panel of names. As I explained here on the Second Reading, I think the county committees of agriculture could be asked to suggest the names of farmers for those committees and the board.  As regards agricultural labourers, I said I did not think there was any organised body which could be said to represent them. I suggested that at least the T.D.s of all Parties might suggest the names, and preferably that the T.D.s of all Parties should agree to names from a given county.  At any rate we have to get the names together.  That will take a little time.  The county committees meet every month, so it might possibly be a month before we have all <Col N="1065" /> the names in.  We can then constitute the committees and the board.  The chairman of the board having been appointed, and the board having met to make an order saying they were going to fix the minimum wage, it would then take two months before they could make that operative, because they must give two months to the committees to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the T.D.s send in a list would it not be possible to let them know what the areas are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may take the districts to be counties.  If an area comprises, say, four counties, I should like as far as possible to have on the committee in that area a farmers' representative and a labourers' representative from each county.  It really means that we want, if possible, to get a farmers' representative and a labourers' representative from each county.  That may be taken as being about the representation that will be wanted.  At the very quickest, therefore, even if we were to get away to-morrow with this job, it will take over three months before the wages can be fixed.  There is always a little delay, and that is why I am giving a month extra.  There is also the staff to be got from the Civil Service Commissioners.  Those inspectors must be got, and that will take a few months also.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill might be described as a one-clause Bill, and it became necessary owing to the fact that we had lost certain powers that we had under the 1933 Act.  Under the 1933 Act it was possible for the Executive Council to raise the price of wheat after it had been fixed.  First of all, the Executive Council had to fix the price two years ahead, and within that two years they had power to raise that price, but they had no power to lower it.  When we were bringing in the amending Act of 1935 we amended very materially all the provisions relating to the growing of wheat but we did not include this particular power in the amending Act of 1935, although we deleted it in the 1933 Act.  I might say here that it was an oversight, because I am sure that if I had been aware of the omission I would have realised that this power would be required.  We would not require this power if we did not intend to fix the price of wheat.  The price of wheat was fixed for the 1936-37 crop &mdash;that is, the present crop&mdash;more than <Col N="1070" /> a year ago, and the Executive Council would now like to amend that price and raise it.  This particular year representations were made by the growers that they had a bad season for sowing wheat last winter.  They had a bad season for the sowing of the wheat and a bad season for the harvesting of it.  They had a bad crop and had expended more time and labour on it than they would have had to expend in a good year.  Taking all those circumstances into account, they thought that they should get a better price for their wheat than the fixed price.  They also argued that the consumers were not, in fact, losing anything by giving a better price for the wheat, because the world price of wheat was also high, and, at that particular time, had in fact gone above the price here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For what class of wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we were taking a class of soft wheat.  The flour millers met the wheat growers and said that they thought that the growers had made a good case, but that they did not like to pay that increased price unless they had some sort of Governmental approval.  The flour millers came to see me and I said: &ldquo;Certainly, I have no objection to your paying a better price, taking all these circumstances into account.&rdquo;  In fact, I said I would like to see them paying a better price.  They paid 27/6 a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be difficult to get the farmers to go back to 23/6 next year.  I feel that when the next harvest comes in the farmers will again make a good case.  It will not be impossible that the flour millers will agree that they should pay more and the farmers will look to get a better price for the wheat.  But I think it would be better that the farmers would now know what they will get next year.  In order to know that in time we must get this amending Bill, which we must have before we make an order.  The Executive Council did agree with me in saying that 27/6 was a fair price for this year on account of the bad season the farmers had in sowing, the bad season for the growing of the wheat, and the bad harvest period.  It was because <Col N="1071" /> of these drawbacks that the farmers got 27/6 this year.  If the seasons next year are good the Executive Council might think that 27/6 for the wheat would not be justified.  I move the Second Reading of this Bill specifically to give the Executive Council power to fix a higher price for wheat than was fixed something more than a year ago when the average price was 24/-.  The average price if now fixed would be about 26/6.</P>

The fact was that the Minister sent for the millers and told them: &ldquo;If you play ball with me I will play ball with you; it does not suit me at present to increase the price of wheat by 3/-, but if you do it I will get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to close one eye when examining this matter and I can guarantee that the Prices Commission will be effectively hog-tied and silenced.&rdquo;</P>

That is how the matter was stage-managed. The millers came in with a statement that they would love to pay 3/- more but that they were anxious to know whether it would hurt the feelings of the Minister if they were to do so, and the Minister said: &ldquo;No, it will not.&rdquo;  The millers then walked out and trotted off to pay this 3/- a barrel more.

He cannot reconcile them, but that is not my fault.  Every sane man recognises that the millers had a perfect right to pay the farmers 60/- a barrel if they liked, but that they should come trotting up to Dublin asking the Minister if he would allow them to pay 3/- more is rather too grotesque for <Col N="1073" /> belief.  Does any sane man believe that they were going to pay more for wheat if they could not put it on to the price of flour?

      <P>I am prepared to accept any statement the Minister cares to make, but not a statement that the millers voluntarily came to the Minister. The facts are that they were really indirectly summoned and told that the Minister would be glad to discuss this matter with them.  It may be that it was not the Minister who summoned them, but as you, A Chinn Comhairle, have ruled on other occasions, that the Minister is responsible for what happens in his Department, it is, I submit, an unfair attitude for the Minister to take up in this House that he did not do it, at the same time having a mental reservation that it was done by someone in his Department.</P>

Suffice it to say that the millers came and asked that experimental question: &ldquo;Can we do something that we have an absolute right to do, a thing that nobody can divert us from doing&mdash;can we give the farmers a minimum price of 3/- per barrel over and above what <Col N="1074" /> is laid down; have we your leave to do that?&rdquo; It may be that representations were made behind the Minister's back that induced the millers to make this approach.  At all events, it is extraordinary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister now says that the price will probably be raised next year.  The price was raised this year because the farmers had bad weather for sowing, there was bad weather during the period of growing, and there was bad weather for the harvesting.  At one time we told the Minister that wheat was a very precarious crop in this country and that taking the average year wheat was hardly likely to mature in this climate. What happened?  We were told that we were sabotaging the resources of the country.  But the Minister has now come to learn that the growing of spring wheat in this country is very precarious.  Is the Minister aware of the legal actions that are being taken by farmers who failed to harvest the crop against seedsmen who sold them Red Marvel Wheat?  Is the Minister aware that the seedsmen sold this wheat <i>bona fide</i> to the farmers and that actions are now being taken against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because it was not spring wheat they sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever it was, it was sold <i>bona fide</i> as spring wheat.  Does the Minister maintain that spring wheat is anything but an extremely precarious crop in this country?  Would the Minister advise any farmer to attempt the growing of the crop on any large scale, if he was not prepared to put in winter wheat?  When we told the Minister that, we were told that the whole thing was a complete fraud.  Let me mention one case of a farmer in Meath. The Minister can check on the approximate costs.  He planted 25 statute acres of wheat, and he estimates that he spent £50 on 25 barrels of seed.  I suppose he got the best seed that money could buy.  He estimates that the ploughing, harrowing, sowing and threshing of that wheat cost about <Col N="1075" /> £50.  The crop failed, or partially failed, and, on being sold, produced £40.  I do not suggest that that happened to all crops.  It did not.  But it brings home to Deputies' minds the particularly precarious character of the spring wheat crop.  Will anyone deny that while the average yield in the one or two pet years we had was nearly ten barrels to the statute acre, last year the fair average yield was between six and seven barrels? Will anyone contend that if farmers were getting the minimum price of 24/6 for six or seven barrels they could make any money?  Of course, they would not.  If the millers had not come in and added 2/6 to the subsidy which the consumer eventually has to pay, every wheat farmer would be &ldquo;broke.&rdquo;  Now, the Minister tells us that he looks forward to the price of wheat rising still further.  He says that the reason for that is that once farmers have got the price of wheat up, it will be very hard to get it down.  I entirely agree.  That is what happened in France.  Once wheat became a popular crop in France, the price rose and rose until, eventually, the French Government was buying wheat at 50/- a barrel in Paris and selling it at 17/- a barrel in London.  That has been going on, but I believe the present Government of France is ending that position.  Of course, the same thing is going to happen here.  It must happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you get an artificial price for a crop and induce people to grow it, and if you destroy the live-stock industry, and make it impossible to employ the land profitably, everyone will be &ldquo;broke.&rdquo; We could all grow melons or grapes if we were paid well enough to do so.  A time will come when all the land will be under wheat and the Government will be frantically trying to sell wheat abroad for whatever it will fetch.  I do not know what the estimate, as to the total value of the wheat crop, would be if we were to supply all our own requirements.  We have not got the most recent figures.  Suppose we are paying at present £1,000,000 a year, and that it is worth £1,000,000 to the farmers&mdash;which I do not believe&mdash; it is costing the community, as far as I <Col N="1076" /> can find out, £1,500,000, because flour is 10/- dearer here than in Great Britain.  In addition, it is costing all the administrative expenditure involved in advertising and inducing people to go in for wheat culture. There is, of course, the additional expense of giving cheap seed to agricultural committees and various other things.  I believe £1,750,000 would be the cost.  Giving £1,000,000 to the farmers, it would be much cheaper to tell them not to grow wheat, and to pay them the full price.  Of course, this whole ramp is extremely difficult to comprehend.  On the assumption that £1,000,000 is being given to the farmers, representing less than 2 per cent. of our entire agricultural output in normal times, we are spending from £1,500,000 to £1,750,000 per annum on that, while the remaining 98 per cent. of the agricultural output could be maintained without expense to the community in normal times.  In order to get people to understand the position it is necessary to say that I do not deny in existing circumstances, with the live-stock industry destroyed, and all the normal agricultural practices of our people disrupted, that any man who has to live out of farming exclusively must grow wheat, and must grow beet if he can get an acreage allotted to him.  I entirely approve of that.</P>

      <P>I say that the policy of indefinitely subsidising wheat, and the policy which leads to a continued increase in the artificial price of wheat grown in this country, is one that is bound to lead to disaster, not only for the agricultural industry but for the community as a whole.  Comparing the cost at which wheat can be produced in the world abroad, we must realise that wheat can be stored in a Canadian elevator for a half cent a bushel per month.  Compare that with what the Minister pays millers and farmers here for the purpose of inducing them to store wheat under similar conditions. Wheat can be carried from the Argentine to Liverpool for from 9/6 to 15/3 a ton, while it costs 15/- a ton to carry it 70 miles in this country.  Wheat can be put into an elevator to-day and taken out 12 months later just as good as the day it went in, and better.  Then <Col N="1078" /> think of the crop that can be grown on the prairies of America.  With machinery in the United States of America, a combined gang of three men can deal with 1,500 acres of wheat.</P>

      <P>Certainly not, and I do not propose to enter into any examination of Deputy Corry's activities in County Cork or to allow him to examine into my activities in County Mayo.  I do say that a policy designed to continue indefinitely an increase in the price of wheat is going to ruin agriculture in this country.  It is an <Col N="1079" /> attempt to bring our farmers into competition with the combine of three men.  Any such proposal is foredoomed to failure.  It is an attempt to harness the Niagara of progress with an eggcup. It has no conceivable justification whatever as a permanent policy in this country, although it can be justified if you are going to continue indefinitely the economic war.  I do not want to go too widely into the subject, but let me say that I believe this particular brand of insanity can best be exorcised out of the people by trying it out to the end.  I think it will have to be tried out to the end.  It can never be properly tried out until we recover our foreign markets.  I should like to see a premium on the price of wheat and our foreign markets open, so long as there is one farmer in this country who wants to grow wheat for sale.  I venture to make this prophecy: that if our natural markets were open and a premium of 4/- or 5/-per barrel, over and above the world price, is given by the Minister for Agriculture, or his successor in office, for wheat, there will not be one farmer in this country who will wish to grow wheat for sale, even at the premium price, if he has an opportunity of using his land for the production of the ordinary normal products of agriculture.</P>

However, let us not go into a general discussion of agricultural policy.  I want to make this last observation.  I have been told by the Minister that this subsidy was necessary, and I have heard from the Minister for Defence that this subsidy was necessary in order to provide that, in the event of war, no enemy can starve us into submission. If there is any reason left on the Fianna Fáil Benches, I want to put this to them in answer to that argument.  If any Deputy really believes in that danger, can we not build silos at the North Wall, Galway and Cork and put into these grain <Col N="1080" /> elevators sufficient wheat to maintain our population for 12 months?  Then if somebody declares war and cuts off our supplies, can we not require every farmer to plant two acres of wheat forthwith, and while that crop is growing and maturing on the land, the contents of our silos will maintain the people.</P>

      <P>Which point the Minister is going to put in answer to me for raising the price of wheat.  I will not attempt to answer the arguments of the Minister in defence of his proposals. Creating an artificial price for wheat is like beating the wind.  There are no valid arguments for this insane policy except that the Minister said he was going to promote the growth of wheat, and, cost what it may, it has to be done.  A few individuals are making money out of it.  A few men, who would be much harder hit by the Minister's general policy, are being spared some rigours by the subsidy on wheat at present.  I certainly feel that it is wrong and bad.  I feel that the most effective way to exorcise it out of the minds of the people is to let it be worked.  I pray for the day to come when we let subsidised wheat compete with the ordinary agricultural policy and let subsidised wheat compete with the live-stock products produced by our people and sold on the markets, and then we will see how long wheat will continue to bleed the consuming public of this country and provide them with an inferior article at an inflated price.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal, in the first place, with Deputy Dillon's insinuation in connection with the wheat crop this year.  It was only what one would expect from the twisted, suspicious mind of Deputy Dillon.  I hope this country will never be visited with one of the ten plagues&mdash;that is, that Deputy Dillon will never be on these benches in any sort of responsible capacity.  At the start of the harvest this year, we realised that the price of wheat, considering the season and the <Col N="1081" /> difficulties we had in saving it, was not sufficient and that the farmers were entitled to more than that price. As representatives of an organisation comprising over 30,000 farmers we called on the Millers' Association and demanded an increased price.  They told us that if we produced proofs of our statements they would be prepared to consider our case and give us the increase demanded.  We asked them what proof they required and they said, &ldquo;If the Minister for Agriculture says your case is fairly correct, we are prepared to increase the price.&rdquo;  On these grounds, Mr. Green, the chairman of the Wheat-Growers' Association and I called on Dr. Ryan and got a statement from him.  Armed with that statement, we went to the millers and put that case to them.</P>

      <P>Shut up, if you can.  We went to the millers and demanded a price.  They asked us to bring verification of our statements.  We went to the Minister and asked him to verify our statements.  We got that verification, we went to the millers and we got a price which meant £300,000 in the farmers' pockets.  That is the position in regard to Deputy Dillon's statement. I am glad that the Minister is now taking steps to enable him to increase the minimum price whenever the occasion demands.  I think that that is the proper way of meeting the <Col N="1082" /> situation.  Instead of receiving a subsidy, according to Deputy Dillon's statement, I maintain that the farmers are entitled to a market here for their produce and a price for that produce which will remunerate them for growing it and enable them to pay a decent wage.  Nobody can call that a subsidy any more than the price paid for anything else produced is a subsidy. Deputy Dillon's statement on this Bill, taken in conjunction with his action on the Agricultural Wages Bill, shows how his mind is working.  It shows that the biggest upset he has got is that the farmers have existed despite all his dismal prophecies and have succeeded in weathering the storm despite all the talk about bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>The land of the farmers in my constituency is rated, on Griffith's valuation, as wheat land.  In many cases it is valued at from 30/- to 35/-per statute acre.  The action of previous Governments in regard to grain are pretty well known to all of us.  They put the farmers in that area in such a position that the Cumann na nGaedheal members appealed to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Lands not to look for any annuities because they could not pay them.  That position has been changed, I am glad to say, and these farmers are now growing wheat, with advantage.  I can assure Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy on the opposite side that no change in the agricultural economy would induce them to go back to grass and the bullock.  Deputy Dillon spoke about wheat as a precarious crop.  I wonder if Deputy Dillon ever saw a dead bullock or a dead calf or if he knows anything about the loss every year in live stock. Apparently, he knows nothing about that.  He can only see the precarious element in wheat.  Wheat is a crop the price of which we can control.  We can see that the farmer gets a fair price for his wheat.  We can still grow 250,000 acres more of it and find a market for it at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters arising out of this Bill on which I should like to get a statement from the Minister.  I know that the Minister has been subjected to some pressure in regard to the admixture scheme.  I know that <Col N="1083" /> certain parties are pressing for a reduction of the admixture.</P>

The Minister will have power to alter the price if he thinks proper. On behalf of the farmers, I may say that we are deeply grateful to the Minister for his action this year in seeing that the farmers' interests were safeguarded and that they got a fair price for their wheat.  We are fairly safe in the knowledge that, when we grow a crop, we have a Minister for Agriculture sufficiently sympathetic to see that we get an economic price for it.  I welcome the amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers which the Minister seeks in this amending Bill are powers which, I think, he ought to have.  It is essential that he should have these powers if he is to have control of wheat-growing and see that justice is done not only to the farmer but to the consumer and the other interests involved.  As the Minister has told us, he had power to increase but no power to reduce.  As everybody knows, there was an abnormally low yield last year.  Hence, with bad harvesting and heavy work on the farms, the increase in the price of <Col N="1084" /> wheat was justified.  With a good summer and with a bumper yield, the Minister might, at some future time, find it necessary to exercise his powers in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>There is one point I should like to make&mdash;that it does not necessarily follow that because the wheat scheme is criticised from this side of the House we are all in agreement with that criticism.  On the contrary, there are farmers on this side who, I am aware from conversation with them, are believers in wheat-growing and will continue to grow wheat.  That is their own point of view.  Deputy Dillon looks upon the matter from the point of view of the 26 Counties and does not take into account that there are eight counties which depend almost entirely on grain-growing.  It is only fair that I should say that, so far as my knowledge of the negotiations between the Wheat Growers' Association, the millers and the Department goes, what the Minister said is substantially correct as regards his attitude and the part he played.  I do not think that there is much more for me to say on this except to refer to the criticism made about the growing of spring wheat.  It was said that the growing of spring wheat was a failure, or that to grow it is not desirable.  That is not what the practical farmer finds.  There was some trouble, as every farmer knows, in connection with spring wheat last year.  That was due to the fact that seed wheat got into the country which was sown as spring wheat though, in fact, it was winter wheat.  I understand that caused a lot of trouble in places like Meath.  A certain amount of inferior seed got in there, and, as might be expected, the results were undesirable, particularly as the summer was so wet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be any doubt in the mind of anybody that the Bill before us is required. Even Deputy Dillon did not deny the necessity for it.  The unfortunate thing about the whole situation is that the greatest condemnation of the success of any branch of agricultural activity is that it must have fixed artificial prices, and that is what we have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Deputy Minch has stated that there are wheat-growers on this side of the House.  There are, certainly.  There are people who will continue to grow wheat while there is a fixed price for it.  What I want to know is: is there ever going to be any relation between the price of foreign wheat and the price that we pay for wheat here?  In other words, is there ever going to be any consideration for the bread consumer. Is not that the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is.  I remember well President de Valera quoting the saying in this House, and, personally, I think the saying a good one, that whatever brings the greatest good to the greatest number ought to be pursued.  I do not think that even Deputy Corry will quarrel with that. It is well to point out that we have a greater number of bread consumers than of wheat-growers in this country. I am a wheat-grower myself, and as long as I can get an artificially good price for wheat I will continue to grow it.  If, however, there was a free market, if we could get into the market which at one time was open to us for the disposal of our live stock, we would grow and feed other crops to live stock so as to get a better return for our labour, but as long as we continue the policy of subsidies we must have fixed prices.  We must have the power to fix prices, to keep them well above world prices, irrespective of what the people pay for their bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But a policy of that sort is not, I submit, good business.  As long, however, as the Government pursue that policy, a Bill such as this is necessary. I think that we ought to have either now, or in the very near future, a statement from the Government as to where they are going to stop with regard to the price of wheat; as to what relation it is going to bear to the price of foreign wheat.  I think that for the sake of the bread consumer in this country such a statement ought to be made.  At the moment the price is reasonable when compared to world prices, but a short time ago the world price was much lower.  I do not know what is going to happen in the future. <Col N="1086" /> For the sake of the bread consumer, there ought to be some relation between the artificial price that we are prepared to pay for wheat in this country, and the cost to the bread consumer. There surely ought to be some consideration for the bread consumer. I hope that some comparison will be made either now or in the near future.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Dillon said in the opening part of his speech, I would not like to be thought so foolish, even by the Deputy or anybody else, as to say that the flour millers were paying this increased price out of their profits or their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon tried to infer that I thought it.  I need hardly say that I never asked the millers to do it.  I would hardly be so foolish.  I presume that they passed the increased price on to the price of flour.  To refer to the precarious crop that Deputy Dillon spoke about, I do not know if wheat is more precarious than any other crop.  So far as I am personally concerned, I can say that in my own district the crop that was really precarious this year was hay.  Much more hay was lost this year than wheat.  Yet, I am sure no Deputy on the opposite side of the House would say that we ought to give up growing grass or saving hay. It is true that last year a certain amount of seed wheat was imported here which was labelled spring wheat but which, in fact, was not spring wheat.  This was a misfortune for the farmers who got it, but I believe they have been compensated for the losses sustained.  What happened there does not prove that wheat cannot be grown here.  It does point to this, that we should be more careful, perhaps, about our own spring wheat.  We have already taken steps in that direction, under an Act passed last year, to have available a fairly substantial amount of our own spring seed in future, so that we need not be depending on imported seed not certified to be absolutely dependable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked about wheat <Col N="1087" /> being a precarious crop, and tried to infer that he has been right all the time in his contention that wheat cannot be grown here.  I think if Deputies were to refer back to the interesting debates that we had here in 1929 and 1930 they would find that we were right when we said that wheat could be grown here: that the soil and climate were suitable for the growing of the crop.  Everything that we said then has proved to be correct.  Wheat can be grown here, and, in fact, we are now growing 250,000 acres of it.  It was not correct for Deputies to say that the crop is being subsidised to the extent of £1,500,000, or anything like that figure.  We are growing, as I have said, about 250,000 acres, and, basing a calculation on about seven barrels of millable wheat to the acre, the subsidy amounts to something like £150,000, and for that subsidy the farmers are receiving in cash over £2,000,000 which, when all is said and done, is not a bad bargain.</P>
    <P>I do not see why there should be any relation whatever between the price of our wheat and the price of foreign wheat.  If we can grow good wheat, and if the flour miller and the consumer of bread are satisfied to give the grower what it costs him to grow it, if we can regulate our own economy here apart from what the price of foreign wheat is, why should there be any objection to our doing that in the case of wheat any more than in the case of anything else?  It is true that we have more bread consumers than wheat growers, but it is equally true that we have more bacon consumers than pig producers, and that we have more butter consumers than milk producers. Yet, all these people are being subsidised to enable them to meet competition in a foreign market.  If they were not subsidised they would be unable to meet that competition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon gave us an account of a combine in some foreign country, and he told us of three men who were producing an enormous amount of wheat, some 1,500 acres.  What is the point?  They are selling wheat here at the same price as that at which we are producing it, or perhaps a little less.  I do not see much point in it. <Col N="1088" /> These three men are able to produce 1,500 acres of wheat and by the time all the mortgages, the cost of shipping, and so on, are met, it is as dear as the wheat we grow ourselves.  The main point, from our aspect, is that we employ men here, we employ our own men, not Canadians or anybody else. I do not know what the Deputy wanted to prove.  He certainly did not succeed in proving very much.</P>
    <P>The argument was also raised that we would have to keep increasing our prices as time goes on.  I stated some two years ago that I could not tell the Dáil what was a fair price for wheat. I do not think farm costings are of very much use.  You do not employ a man by the hour to sow wheat.  If you did you could have costings and you could let him stand off when the work stops.  At the present time if it commences to rain the working man generally turns his hand to something else; he is not paid off for the rest of the day.  That is why it is impossible to do costings in agriculture.  You have to keep your man at some job or other while it is raining.  The main point is to give a sufficient price which will induce farmers to grow wheat.</P>
    <P>We have got a rather rapid increase in the acreage on the prices that ruled up to this year, but I am quite certain we could not get our 100 per cent. requirements on that price, and that is why I am anxious to recommend that we pay a higher price from this onwards.  This Bill makes it possible to give a higher price for next year's crop and the crop of the following year.  Without this amending Bill we could not alter the price up or down. We want to alter it upwards, to a certain extent.  I would be glad to answer Deputy Corry on the question of the mixture if I could be sure that the Ceann Comhairle would not rule me out of order.  Perhaps I will do it later on, in private.</P>

Through the various stages of the Bill special emphasis has been laid on this section and I think the Minister for Justice may possibly be in a better position to-night, presumably having given the matter some thought, to decide whether or not the business of the courts at the moment demands that we have more judges in this country.</P>

    <P>Practically all day to-day we have been considering ways and means to tide over the financial difficulties of farmers, farm labourers and other people.  I remember when the present Government were seeking office they issued a big advertisement calling the attention of the electorate to the high salaries that were being paid, and the very first people they attacked were the judges.  At that time, Fianna Fáil promised to reduce our taxation by £2,000,000.  Now we are going to add to the number of those people whom Deputy Corry used to call the bloated officials with the bloated salaries; we are going to create at least two more judges, irrespective of a dwindling law business.  I made it my business, within the last two days, to inquire whether there was or was not an increase in law business and I have been told that there is a very definite decrease.  Whatever that is due to I <Col N="1090" /> do not know, and I do not propose now to tell the House why that is so.  I think the Minister for Justice, and others here who are connected with the law, will be prepared to state that at the moment there are professional people who can scarcely make ends meet because of the lack of business and, notwithstanding that, we have this proposal presented to us to increase the number of judges.</P>
    <P>This is the way the Government redeem their promise to cut down taxation by £2,000,000.  Here they are proposing to give us extra judges, extra officials for a dwindling business. Even the stock-in-trade arguments which we have heard used on various occasions about an increased population do not now fit in.  With an increased population you might possibly expect increased litigation, but we have not even that prospect, and I think the Minister should now attempt to justify to the House the insertion of this section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have had various burdens thrown on the country, particularly on the backs of the agricultural community, including the burden of £5,000,000 by way of payment to England.  This is another burden, and the Minister for Finance will have to find the money somewhere.  When he was in opposition, the Minister for Agriculture stated that the agricultural community formed at least 75 per cent. of the population and had to bear 75 per cent. of the taxation.  He has forgotten that now.  He forgot it when he came here to-day, appealing for authority to fix prices in order that the agriculturists may be able to live.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice says that irrespective of how the agricultural community live, or where the labourer gets his wages, we are going to appoint more officials at bloated salaries, such as Deputy Corry and others complained of, and which we were definitely promised would be cut down. It is up to the Minister to explain why that section is being included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that on this stage I could usefully add anything to what has already been said with regard to this particular section. We have had arguments pro and con, <Col N="1091" /> and I am afraid anything I would have to say would be more or less a repetition of the arguments that were put forward from this side.  This section was debated on at least three occasions already.  We have a Supreme Court in this country that is the final court of appeal, and it is necessary that that court should be in such a position that it would possess the confidence of the people of the country or any other people interested in litigation that might arise in this country. We have the recommendation of the Joint Committee which was set up in 1929 and which reported in 1930, or 1931, that the judges of the Supreme Court should be increased in number. Another ground that might be urged as showing the necessity for an increase is that we are going to have a new system of appeals, that is, the re-hearing system, and it will be conceded, I think, that that will entail extra work for the judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time that committee was dealing with this matter, they not only recommended that there should be an increase in the Supreme Court for the purpose of strengthening that court, but also an increase in the number of High Court judges, and I think that, with the new system of appeals, under which judges have to go on circuit to hear appeals, you would have to have an increase in the number of High Court judges at any rate. We have taken what is called the middle course, as described by the <Col N="1092" /> Attorney-General on Second Reading. We are appointing two judges to act in the Supreme Court, but they will be available to do ordinary High Court work.  In that way, we hope to avoid the expense that would be incurred in having to appoint Supreme Court judges at the same time as appointing High Court judges.  We are trying to get over the expense of having to appoint High Court judges.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Whenever a local authority borrows or is deemed by the foregoing sub-section of this section to borrow money under or in purported exercise of its statutory powers from a lender who lends such money in good faith, the following provisions shall have effect in favour of such lender or any person claiming through or under him as against such local authority, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  neither such borrowing and lending nor any mortgage or other security given or purported to be given by such local authority to such lender for securing the repayment of such money and the payment of the interest, thereon shall be invalidated or questioned on account of any illegality or irregularity in the constitution of such local authority or the election of any of the members thereof;</P>
    <P>(b)  such lender shall not be concerned to inquire whether the purpose for which such money is borrowed by such local authority is or is not a purpose for which such local authority is authorised by law to borrow money or whether such money does or does not exceed in amount any limit on borrowing by such local authority, and such lender shall not be prejudiced or affected by the fact (if it exists) that such purpose is, ni whole or in part, not so authorised or that such money exceeds in amount any such limit;</P>
    <P>(c)  such lender shall not be concerned to see to the application of such money by such local authority or be prejudiced or affected by any misapplication of such money or any part thereof by such local authority or any of its officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> (3)  This section shall be deemed to have come into operation on and to have had effect as on and from the 6th day of December, 1922, and shall accordingly apply and be deemed always to have applied to transactions commenced after that date and before the passing of this Act (whether completed before or pending at such passing) as well as to transactions commenced after the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 3, before paragraph (c), to insert two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) such lender shall not be concerned to inquire whether any meeting of such local authority was or was not properly convened or constituted, or whether any particular notice to the members of such local authority was or was not duly given, or whether the proceedings at any meeting of such local authority were or were not legal and regular;</P>
      <P>(d)  where such local authority could not lawfully borrow such money without the sanction or the consent of the Minister, and such sanction or consent (as the case may be) was given or purported to be given by the Minister, such lender shall not be concerned to inquire whether any statutory condition precedent to the giving of such sanction or consent was or was not duly complied with, and such lender shall not be prejudiced or affected by the fact (if it exists) that any such condition precedent was not complied with by the person (whether the Minister, such local authority, or any other person) charged with the duty of complying therewith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to prevent persons who lend money to a body, which they believe to be a local authority acting in accordance with its statutory powers, from losing their money owing to the failure by the body to observe some of the many formalities which are required by the existing law.  This amendment is <Col N="1095" /> intended to supplement the provision in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  They provide that the lender is not to be concerned whether any meetings of a local authority were properly convened or constituted; whether proper notices had been given; whether the proceedings at any meeting were legal or regular; or whether any conditions precedent to the giving of the Minister's sanction to the borrowing were complied with.</P>

      <P>This amendment strikes me as being very radical and as going very far.  I should like to know what justification the Minister has for inserting it.  The mere formal reading out of an amendment of that kind seems to me to be very perfunctory, because the amendment is desperately radical.  A person can lend any sum of money to any authority and then hold the ratepayers liable, without first inquiring whether or not the local body supposed to be carrying out the law&mdash;and the Minister also is involved&mdash;is legally constituted, or whether the loan was properly issued. The amendment was circulated only an hour or two ago and it seems desperately radical.  Speaking for myself, I protest against it.</P>

      <P>In view of the attitude the Minister has adopted right through, my intention is to move this amendment and to divide the House upon it and not to move the others. It, is: To delete sub-section (3). All the other amendments standing in my name are to a great extent to the same effect as this amendment, that is, to remove from the Bill its retrospective application.  Everybody, when speaking here, gives lip service to the principle that retrospective legislation is vicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Last night I quoted at length from a speech made by Mr. Justice Maguire last year when he was Attorney-General in which he set down the times and the occasions on which, in his view, retrospective legislation might be permissible.  I am not going to repeat that quotation to-night because I do not want to delay the House, but I shall say that presumably when the Attorney-General of that time was voicing these views as to when retrospective legislation was something that one could stand over, he was speaking for the Executive Council and the Government. If that was the view of the Government, 11 or 12 months ago&mdash;the speech was made on the 10th December, 1935 &mdash; their view has considerably advanced since.  They are not at all now concerned to confine retrospective legislation merely to dealing with matters which, having long had a certain interpretation put upon them, had suddenly a new interpretation put upon them.  They are not now concerned to maintain the old interpretation of statutes.  The new attitude is that when they are up against a snag, in they come with a Bill <i>ad hoc.</i>  Whenever a Government Department find themselves brought into the law courts and when they have the pleadings before them, when they see the case their opponents have, apparently their attitude now is that they will come along to the House and bring in legislation to put their opponents out of court.  That is what they have done in this case.</P>
    <P>I say that is a negation of justice but I am not going to delay the House in dealing with the matter at any length.  From the attitude which the Minister adopted last night, a cocksparrow attitude, I may say it is perfectly obvious that he is going to steamroll this measure through the House exactly in the form he wants it.  He has no other House to face with the Bill.  He has his tame majority here who will follow him into the Lobby to uphold anything that he may bring before the House, no matter how unjust, no matter how little one can, with any sense of fairness, stand over it.  He has his majority there behind him to steamroll it through.  I am not therefore going to waste the time of <Col N="1097" /> Deputies or my own time trying to prevent his doing something which I know he has already made up his mind to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy realises that we usually try to discuss legislation here, particularly with regard to local government affairs, in a very calm, deliberate fashion, and that when useful suggestions are made by anybody on any side of the House they are always considered and, where practicable and where found to be useful, they may be adopted, and have even been adopted, by way of amendment of the legislation proposed.  I cannot say that much can be done in that way in regard to this Bill.  Though in its draft it is of general application, it is very largely of particular application, as Deputy Lynch knows.  I therefore do not want to go back over old sores and old disputes or to rake up the bones of dead controversies in dealing with this matter.  Deputy Lynch knows that we could, and with justice, go into many things that might not help legislation, some of which would not be very creditable to past administration. In the particular section to which Deputy Lynch's amendment has reference, we are not doing anything improper.  We are doing something, I think, that is quite a proper thing for the House to do and for the Minister to ask the House to do.  That is, affirming and standing over a judgment given in the High Court.</P>

      <P>On this amendment, <Col N="1098" /> no.  I agree with the pious opinions generally expressed by all Parties and all individuals in the House, that retrospective legislation is undesirable and I endorse what the Attorney-General said about a year ago, as quoted last night by Deputy Lynch, but Deputy Lynch will remember that the Attorney-General said then, and others speaking on a similar topic have said at all times, that while they agreed that retrospective legislation was undesirable, they equally emphasised the fact that there are special cases and exceptions when it is necessary.  These exceptions arose, I shall not say, frequently, but they did arise in the time of the last Government and they have arisen in the time of this Government.  They possibly will arise at any time.  I think this is one of the exceptions and that is the reason that we have to bring in this Bill.  In this particular case we are not doing anything that I think the House as a whole need have any hesitation in endorsing.</P>

Nobody voiced the view that retrospective legislation should be applied in a case of that kind.  Further, if the Minister were so satisfied with the judgment of the High Court, why did he prevent the litigants pursuing their case in the Supreme Court and try to have them fired out on a technical point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean, I think, Sir, that we can discuss more or less generally the retrospective character of this Bill on this amendment. The Vice-President has just made the point that the retrospective character of the Bill, in so far as it was referred to by Deputy Lynch, did not arise on this amendment.  I make that point to start off.  I stand up chiefly to call attention to the fact that, so far, in the course of this debate&mdash;during the Second Reading, and yesterday, and during the Committee Stage so far as it has gone to-day&mdash;we have had no viewpoint at all from the Attorney-General.  I should like to know whether the present Attorney-General stands over what his predecessor has told us here in the House should be borne in mind by an Executive Council or by a Government which proposes to bring in legislation of a retrospective character. We were told by the last Attorney-General, as has already been pointed out by Deputy Lynch, that legislation of a retrospective character should only be introduced&mdash;I think those were the words used by the previous Attorney-General&mdash;in order to give force to something which had always been regarded as the practice in some particular sphere, and that only on the rarest of rare occasions should that weapon of retrospective legislation be resorted to at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the instance under discussion here, quite the contrary is the case.  I understand that since about the year 1877 or 1887 a certain view of the law was taken in this country.  That view was upheld, as I understand it, by Mr. Justice Johnston in the High Court of this country.  There was an appeal taken to the Appeal Court.  That appeal was decided, as I understand it, on some technical ground, and the case had to be sent back to the High Court for the purpose of getting the fiat of the Attorney-General.  That fiat <Col N="1100" /> was got.  The law officer of the Government gave his fiat, and allowed this case to go on.  The only result of that would have been that the case would then have come before the Supreme Court for its determination on the substantial questions under repeal.  This is the time at which the Government thinks fit to step in. Those ratepayers of Listowel brought their case to the High Court; they would have the right to have brought it on appeal before the Supreme Court.  This is the moment at which the Government chooses to step in for the purpose of preventing the Supreme Court of this country from adjudicating upon a point in regard to which&mdash;if one can gather anything from the terms in which the Bill is expressed &mdash;the ratepayers were on a 100 to 1 on certainty.  They stepped in for the purpose of stopping the Supreme Court from expressing an opinion.  As I understand the course of the case from those engaged on it, and from what I have heard in this House yesterday and to-day, the clear meaning of the word was that which was given to it by Mr. Justice Johnston.  The meaning given to it was the clear and obvious meaning, and was the meaning given to it for the last 60 years.  Now we are told by this legislation that it is to be deemed to have an altogether different meaning. In other words, the meaning attached to it for the last 60 years, and the meaning given to it by Mr. Justice Johnston, is now going to be deemed to be entirely wrong.  A new meaning is to be given to it by the Government, and the ratepayers of Listowel are going to be saddled with, I think, a sum in the region of £12,000.  That is being done by this vicious type of legislation which is called retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>I got up chiefly to try and prompt the Attorney-General to give us his views on this particular retrospective legislation.  We do not want lectures here in the House on a general justification of retrospective legislation.  I should like to hear justified the particular retrospective legislation which we are faced with here.  Take this case of Listowel.  There is no good in burking the issue, because we all <Col N="1101" /> know that this legislation is not brought in for any general purpose at all.  We know it is brought in to defeat the judgment which the ratepayers of Listowel were going to get from the Supreme Court.  I should like to hear from the Attorney-General his answer to the question as to whether he approves of legislation being brought in to defeat what were always considered to be the rights of litigants&mdash; not litigants who are about to litigate, but who had gone before the court and who had already got a judgment.</P>

      <P>As it seems to be the desire of some members of this House that I should express my view, I would ask the indulgence of the House for a few minutes.  In principle, retrospective legislation is to me as repugnant as it was to my predecessor.  I desire to make that perfectly clear.  But, as the Minister for Local Government has stated, practically every authority, whether he was the writer of a text-book or a judge, who has had occasion to refer to this matter of retrospective or retroactive legislation, has always or nearly always emphasised that the exception, where it is a reasonable one, is of just as great public importance as is the rule, that is, that the circumstances of a particular time or the circumstances of a particular place may render it necessary for a Legislature to enact retrospective or retroactive legislation.</P>

      <P>I am glad that my friend Deputy McMenamin will not permit me to forget anything. I mean to come to that, and I trust that the Deputy will again remind me if I forget it.  I have said that I share the general view of lawyers, and the view I should say also of non-lawyers, that retrospective legislation, generally speaking, is to be deplored, but it is desirable that the House should realise the extent to which the doctrine to which I have just alluded applies to this Bill.  Clause 9 of this Bill, relating to Section 203 <Col N="1102" /> of the Public Health Act, and Clause 11, relating to the interpretation of Section 3 of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, undoubtedly express a view which is inconsistent with the view of the High Court, but in all other respects the Bill, in so far as it refers to litigation, is, so to speak, an affirmation of the decision of the High Court.  I speak subject to the correction of Deputy Fionán Lynch, who is peculiarly competent to correct me in regard to this. He represents Kerry.  He also was one of the distinguished counsel who conducted the action on behalf of the gentlemen in Listowel.  He will correct me, I trust, if I am wrong when I tell the House that the interpretation of Section 238 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, affected only a relatively trivial and insignificant sum of money as regards the town of Listowel.  As I say, I invite correction in connection with that.  I do not want to weary the House with technicalities, but, in so far as Clause 9 purports to overrule the decision of the High Court, surely no Deputy in this House will contend that it is not in the public interest.  I wonder what would be the reactions of Deputies opposite if the Minister for Local Government were to stand up here and, to their surprise, say that he was willing to jettison Clause 9?  Clause 9 is giving to that section of the Public Health Act, 1878, a liberal interpretation as regards local authorities; that is to say, that urban authorities interested in public health services will be able to borrow slightly more by virtue of the interpretation that will be given by Clause 9 than they could otherwise borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will any Deputy on the other side of the House, who represents a constituency in which there is a cry and a clamour for public health services, suggest that these services are to be cut down by abandoning this clause? Deputy Lynch, Deputy McMenamin, Deputy McGuire and, I am sure, other Deputies also, know that if any interpretation other than the interpretation proposed in Clause 9 were given to Section 238 of the Public Health Act of 1878, it would break the heart of every town clerk who had to deal with <Col N="1103" /> this matter, because owing to the trend of legislation since 1878 which, after all, is a long time since, assessable value has come to be very often quite different from net annual value.  There are allowances for new houses, particular hereditaments, and so on, which I need not go through, and it would mean that a town clerk or other officer interested, instead of taking up the figure for the net annual value, which is a figure easy to arrive at, would have to analyse the valuations of all the rateable hereditaments in his area in order to find out what was the assessable value of each.</P>

      <P>Extravagant borrowing?  I am not quite sure that I understand what the Deputy means. I am now dealing only with Clause 9 and I have told the House, and I have invited correction, that Clause 9, in so far as it affects the Listowel litigation, affects it only to an insignificant extent.  There were quite big figures in the Listowel litigation.</P>

      <P>Oh, now, I am sure the Deputy does not mean that.  He knows that that is not so. He knows that the difference in any provincial town in Ireland between the assessable value and the net annual value may be only a trifling difference that will arise in respect of new houses and certain other hereditaments, and that it can affect the borrowing power only to a trivial extent.  In so far as it would affect it, however, if the interpretation of the High Court were taken, it would, first of all, restrict to that small extent the borrowing power of the local authority for public health services.  That is, perhaps, only of small importance, but it would also involve the responsible official of the local authority in a detailed examination of the various rateable hereditaments within his area&mdash;a game which, I think, even Deputy McGuire would concede, would not be worth anything like the price of the candle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> Deputies, apparently, have been greatly impressed by what they conceive to have been the view of the late Sir George Vanston, who was a civil servant and an adviser of the Local Government Board.  Their gullibility seems to have increased as the debate proceeded.  The latest that we have heard now is that courts since 1878 have given it a certain interpretation.  Never, from the year 1878&mdash;and I have gone to some trouble to make sure of the fact&mdash;never since the year 1878 until the year 1936 did any court give it that interpretation &mdash; never; but here is what so impresses the Deputies; what they think to be Sir George Vanston's view. Vanston wrote a book on Public Health Law.  He carefully guarded himself from adopting the view that the Deputies opposite think so irresistible and so invulnerable.  Here is what he said, and these are the words of his note to the section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Local Government Board interpret &lsquo;net annual value&rsquo; to mean the assessable value for the purpose of a rate, and reckon property subject to different rating, as under Section 226 of this Act and Section 62 of the Towns Improvement Act, 1854, at one-fourth only of its annual value.  In the English Act, the words are &lsquo;assessable value for two years,&rsquo; which are construed to mean twice the assessable value at any given time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, the learned commentator makes it perfectly clear that he is attributing the view to somebody else.  He does not, either directly or by implication, suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Attorney-General suggest that seriously?  Vanston was the adviser to the Local Government Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am sure that when Deputy Lynch has been in the profession as long as I have been now&mdash;unfortunately, a very long time, 28 years&mdash;he will learn that, frequently, the client rejects the advice of his legal adviser, and that frequently the client is right.  However that may be, I have read the note and it speaks for itself.  It is, at most, the <Col N="1105" /> view of the Local Government Board, acting at the beck and the nod of the Treasury in Whitehall.  The Treasury Clerk in Whitehall, of course, was anxious to restrict the borrowing power of the local authority in Ireland as much as he could.  The Treasury Clerk in Whitehall was more familiar with the words of the English statute, which are undoubtedly &ldquo;assessable value,&rdquo; than with the words of the Irish statute&mdash;words which, as we have heard, would appear to have been interpolated during the passing of that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>What view did Judge Johnston take of those words of Vanston's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had already told the House that Judge Johnston had stated in terms that he had read the note in Vanston's book on Public Health and that he, Judge Johnston, was of the opinion that that was the correct construction.  I thought I had made it perfectly clear that clause 9 is a clause that undoubtedly purports to overrule the view taken by the High Court.  Possibly, I should not occupy more time in regard to this, but here is what the learned judge in the High Court said&mdash; I quote from the official report of his judgment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Sir George Vanston's valuable work upon the law as to Public Health (1913) (page 266), he says:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;The Local Government Board interpret &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; to mean the assessable value for the purpose of a rate.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the ingenious and, indeed, persuasive suggestions that have been addressed to me on behalf of the defendants, I cannot at this point of time adopt any other construction. I do not know whether the defendants admit that in the light of that construction of the Act there has been an excess of borrowing by the council, but if it is necessary I shall direct an inquiry before the Examiner as to the amount of the excess, declaring that the limit of the borrowing power was twice the assessable value for the purpose of a rate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all the hearing before the learned <Col N="1106" /> judge, it was by no means clear whether this was more than a mere academic question, because it was so utterly trivial.  It was by no means clear whether it would come out on one side or the other.  The words of the learned judge are not very forcible; that at this point of time, as it has been acted on for a certain period, it will not be upset.  However, I invite the Deputies opposite to try to persuade the people in any town in Ireland that this is not desirable.  Deputy Lynch knows that he dare not suggest in any other town in Ireland that that clause should not be inserted.  He knows that well.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Clause 11&mdash;the interpretation of Section 3 of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921&mdash;I cannot really add anything, and it is unnecessary to add anything to the words of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health here yesterday afternoon in which he informed the House of something that is within the recollection of the older members here.  That Act of 1921 was passed at a time when it was very desirable that the local authorities should be able to make temporary borrowings to meet what one may, in popular phrase, call current liabilities. It was found that that Act worked well.  The consensus of opinion was that it worked satisfactorily.  Will the Deputy suggest that there is anything outrageous in bringing the law into accord with what is the general desire of every local authority in Ireland? Let me remind the House&mdash;and this is really all I have to say in this connection&mdash;that the Minister stated here yesterday what is a fact, that all these powers of borrowing are subject to the overriding sanction of the Minister. One would have thought from what has been said here that local authorities can play ducks and drakes in the matter of borrowings.  Of course, they cannot.  They must get the sanction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to speak at further length on this matter.  All I say as regards this other clause is that the acts of a local authority that has been functioning over a period unchallenged <Col N="1107" /> by any constituent are as regards the public in general not to be deemed invalid.  That is not a new principle. It is a very old principle.  How is the contractor, who enters into a contract to build any of the much needed houses in any town in Ireland, to inquire whether the niceties of the election law had been complied with six years previously&mdash;because the root of the evil in Listowel goes back to 1925?  Is everyone who enters into a contract to lay pipes or do any other work for a local authority, or is the banker who lends money to a local authority, going to inquire into the niceties of an election held six years previously?  I ask that question because the public have been told that one of the bankers, in perfect good faith, lent money to this council that had been carrying on the affairs of Listowel during a number of years. Does any business man on the other side of the House advocate that the acts of a body carrying on in that way for years; carrying on in so far as it has control over local government, with the aid of public officials, ought to be repudiated on some subtlety?  Of course, the High Court has said they are not.  Deputy McGuire speaks as if out of the horse's mouth he had got information, as it were, as to the result of the race in the High Court. Surely Deputy McGuire would be anxious to take back some of his observations as to the probable result of the appeal.  First of all, it ought at least be a matter of some importance to the main question in this House that the High Court has decided in accordance with the principles in this Bill.  Surely that is a matter of some importance.</P>

      <P>Why the Bill. I asked Deputy McMenamin to remind me of something.  I have been trying hard to forget something.  The Minister gave the Listowel people their chance.  They were able to bring their action.  They brought their action in an inartistic and irregular way.  They wasted a year and they wasted the public time of the court.  They brought their action in a rickety fashion and it collapsed through their own fault.</P>

      <P>What does Deputy McGuire mean when he asks who raised the technical point?  What is a barrister's duty?  What is the Deputy's conception of the duty of an advocate?  Is it Deputy McGuire's conception of the duty of an advocate employed to fight his client's case and to raise any legal point in favour of his client than he is to swallow that point and not raise it in court?  What is the Deputy's conception of his duty towards the court?  Is it his conception that a barrister is merely a person who snatches fees?  The barrister has a duty not only to his client whose interests he has to safeguard but to help the court to the best of his ability in arriving at a decision as to what the law is.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is in considerable practice.  He is entrusted with a number of cases in the different courts.  The Deputy must have within his experience a knowledge of the way that courts are disposed to deal with merely obstructive points.  They generally find a way to brush them aside.  Generally speaking, if a court yields to a point of law it is a good point.  I was answering Deputy Lynch.  The people of Listowel got time.  Apparently they would need eternity.  They would want to bring action after action.  What guarantee is there that their present action is not a rickety action also?</P>

If the people of Listowel had the same talent for getting on with the work of procuring the completion of the houses standing there windswept, not quite finished for over two years; if they had the talent for getting the people who want houses in Listowel into these houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If they had the talent for accepting the £2,000 needed to link up their waterworks with the other scheme, it would be better for the townspeople than this flair they are displaying for litigation. In so far as this Bill makes the acts of an ostensible council lawful, there is a precedent for that and a well-known precedent which goes back as far as 1863, in the Drainage Act of 1863, the statute which governs drainage works all over the country, I will read for the House words which are familiar to Deputy McMenamin and me.  In that Act provision was made for the election of boards for the drainage of the country.  There are technical provisions as to what the qualifications of the elector are to be, the precise time when the election is to be held, who is to be eligible for election and what their powers are. In Section 13, sub-section (8), there is laid down this immensely important provision:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All acts done by any meeting of <Col N="1110" /> a drainage board or by any committee of a drainage board or by any person acting as a member of a drainage board, shall, notwithstanding it may be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such board or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were or was disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a member.&rdquo;</P>

Why should not honest men, honestly entering into contracts with people carrying on the business of a town, unchallenged by the ratepayers or by the inhabitants, be they bankers or building contractors as in Listowel, or the humblest person that might undertake work for the community, be entitled to contract with the body carrying on there unchallenged and to enforce these contracts in the ordinary way?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 36, after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and the payment of arrears of any such instalments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 enables the local authority to borrow temporarily for the repayment of instalments of principal and <Col N="1115" /> interest in respect of borrowed money. This amendment is intended to make it clear that the section confers power to borrow temporarily for any arrears of instalments of loans that have accrued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Attorney-General is not still here, because I should like to have his view on the question as to whether this does not mean that all limit on borrowing power is now removed in fact.  It would have been more honest and more straightforward if the Minister brought in legislation saying quite clearly that in future, subject, of course, to the sanction of the Minister, there is to be no limit to the borrowing power of local authorities. That is what this effects, because under this Act passed for the purpose of allowing borrowing for the purpose of defraying current expenses during a year, it is now allowing current expenses to mean not only what is generally accepted as being current expenses proper, but the repayment of instalments of old loans.  When a local authority finds that it has gone to its limit of borrowing under the Public Health Acts, it can, if the Minister sanctions it, borrow under this 1921 Act to repay all the loans which it already has had and which brought it up to the limit of borrowing. It can repay that out of the new borrowing under the 1921 Act and start all over again.  When it reaches the limit, it can borrow again.  That is, in effect, removing the limit imposed by the Public Health Act, 1878, on the borrowing powers of local authorities.  It was idle for the Attorney-General to stress that this is subject to Ministerial sanction.  There was always that subjection to sanction and the limit was imposed for some reason.  That limit is now removed and I should like the House to appreciate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not place exactly the same interpretation on this section as Deputy Lynch has placed upon it, though I admit it may be open to his interpretation.  I should like, however, the Minister to look into the section <Col N="1116" /> before finally disposing of the measure, for reasons which I shall state.  Let us assume that a council is elected on the 1st January.  That council makes up its estimate of the sum that will be required for the year. Finding that that sum will be unpopular in the town, they eliminate from their estimate portion of the interest and principal charges which they have to meet.  They say: &ldquo;We will borrow for these during the course of the year, as we are entitled to borrow for current expenses.&rdquo;  In that case, those current expenses would have to be met the following year and the same thing might happen, so that you would have a hanging gale, against which this section provides no safeguard. Members of a local authority, when they find that a big rate is necessary or that they have to meet some expenses not provided for by their predecessors, sometimes have objection to striking a sufficient rate.  It appears to me that there is a loophole in the section in that respect.  Although there is no direct obligation on councils to provide the full sum of money necessary in any year, it has been almost universally accepted that they should make full provision for their expenses.  Where the sum to be raised is very big, effort may be made to escape liability.  The Minister should, before the Report Stage, examine this section so that a loan for interest and sinking fund charges would only be permissible when the estimate for the expenses of the local authority had included sums for that amount and would not be permissible where no such provision has been made.  That would probably meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is, I think, covered.  Councils can borrow only for current expenses.  The final safeguard would be that these borrowings to cover current expenses and the question of the striking of a sufficient rate would be subject to the supervision of the Minister for the time being, through his officials.  Councils cannot borrow for instalments that may become due in the future but they can borrow for current expenses, which include instalments for sinking fund and interest in respect of any loans raised in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not seen my point.  If the council does not make provision in its estimate and, consequently, does not strike a rate to meet interest and sinking fund on a loan, the interest and sinking fund charge falls to be paid.  The Minister, I take it, could not object to the council borrowing in respect of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. I expect most of this money is due to the Board of Works.  Borrowings ought not to be made legal unless provision is made in the estimate and in the rate to meet those charges.  They are current charges but, if the council does not make provision for them, they do not lose their character of currency.  The council ought to be informed beforehand that it will not be lawful to obtain sanction from the Minister or borrow unless provision is made in the estimate and in the rate for those charges.</P>

We have had to hold up the rate and tell the local authorities concerned that we would refuse to let them go ahead until such time as they made provision for all their liabilities, including loan charges.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall continue in force until the next election for local authorities in so far as it relates in certain cases to the validation of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) borrowing by local authorities;</P>
      <P>(b) contracts entered into with local authorities;</P>

      <P>(d) the payment as current expenses by a local authority of annual or other periodical instalments of principal and interest or principal only or interest only in respect of money borrowed by such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, as appears on its face, to end the operation of this Bill after a particular period.  This Bill was found necessary to deal with a very abnormal and isolated situation.  I do not think that in the history of local government there has been anything like it and I hope that, in our time, there will not be anything else like it.  I maintain that this type of Bill, to legalise for a certain period illegally constituted authorities, is a sort of invitation to illegal constitution, provided the local authority can hide its illegality for 11 or 12 months.  I am not satisfied that the Bill, in itself, will prevent what I would not describe as illegal trafficking, but which is something like it.  During the first 11 months of the life of an illegally constituted authority, that authority is quite free to enter into contracts, quite free to borrow money and to do everything that a legally constituted council could do, but if inside the twelfth month some persons take action in the courts they can upset the whole council and have it <Col N="1119" /> declared illegal.  I do not think the Bill makes it clear as to what is the position with regard to the acts and things done by the council in the meantime. I think that a Bill embodying a continuing enactment of this kind is really a reflection on Irish public life.  The Bill is necessary to deal with one isolated abnormal incident.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether a man who enters into some contractual obligation with a local authority is immune under this Bill.  Possibly the fact that he had entered into the contract is not publicly known.  Suppose he gets elected to the council.  If he is able to hide the fact for 12 months that he holds a contract under the council he gets away with it.  I do not think that is good enough.  On the whole, the Bill does not lend itself to general application.  I think that if the measure were restricted to deal with the Listowel case, which obviously the Minister wants to deal with, it would be quite enough.  Then, after the next election, let the people of Listowel, having got this lesson, take the matter in hands themselves and have their business done properly and legally.  I do not think that an isolated instance of that kind justifies the bringing in of a measure like this, and of making it a continuing enactment that is to operate in every country in the Free State and against every local authority. If the Bill does succeed in putting things right in Listowel, and if they continue right there, then I think we ought to drop this Bill after the next elections have been held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be sorry to think that this Bill or any of the provisions in it would be an invitation to local authorities or individuals to commit illegalities of any kind.  I do not think that any such thing could be read into the Bill.  There have been illegalities and illegal elections in the past.  Election law is very intricate, and not every returning officer in the country, or every official of a local authority, is familiar with every aspect of it.  It could happen that a council, which had been elected in a <i>bona fide</i> way, might be upset on some really <Col N="1120" /> trivial technicality.  That could happen, and it would not be in the best interest of a town that trivialities could be raised after the lapse of 12 months either in regard to an individual or a council.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan talked about individuals entering into contracts.  There are other laws that cover any illegalities that a member of a local authority might be guilty of in the matter of entering into contracts with a body of which he was a member.  There are provisions in this Bill that have been felt to be necessary for a considerable time.  The greater number of them, I agree, have a bearing on the one case that has been referred to, the Listowel case.  But there are provisions in the Bill which I think will be found useful and helpful to local authorities and the members of them.  I think that the Bill in itself is a necessary one, irrespective of the case that it deals with in particular.  Deputy Cosgrave was not present last night when I was replying on the Second Reading, but I agree with what he said about the desirability of codifying local government law.  I admit that is very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officers in the Department have, during the last four or five years and even longer, been engaged on certain aspects of that work.  They have already gone a considerable distance with regard to some important sections of local government law.  I hope that before many more years have gone over our heads that this tedious operation of not only codifying the law, but of interpreting it in the light of modern development, will have been completed, and that it will be possible to put a measure dealing with it before the House for discussion and adoption.  While that work is being done, it is necessary from time to time to come along with Bills of this kind to remove doubts and to overcome difficulties that have been discovered in practice as well as to help local authorities and the Department itself to do things which are felt to be desirable but which the law does not permit.  There are two useful things, for instance, dealt with in this Bill.  One deals with town halls and the other with the extension of boundaries. <Col N="1121" /> Both may be said to be small things, but they are important and useful.  These occasional Bills are necessary and they may even be necessary after condification has taken place. I think the Bill itself as it stands has many useful provisions.  All its provisions, I think, are useful and necessary, and I believe that it will do good and not ill.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest possible sympathy for the Minister in endeavouring to get rid of the kind of festering sore that there was in Listowel.  I think, however, that he could have done that without bringing in a measure of this kind which, as a continuing enactment applicable to every public body, is really a reflection on the rest of the country.  If we had a codification of the local government law and it was found necessary to introduce legislation of this type in order to cover up illegalities that were taking place, I really feel it would be a reflection on the integrity of the people of the country.  Possibly there would be some justification for a measure of this kind if you had the same kind of thing going on in parts of the country that took place in Listowel, but, thank God, no other instance of the kind can be cited.  I really feel that this Bill, which is to be a continuing enactment applicable to the whole country, is a reflection on the integrity of the people.</P>

      <P>As this measure stands now, if a man who was adjudged a bankrupt five years ago is elected to a local council on the 1st of January next, he will be validly and properly elected.  Would the Minister say if it is intended under this Bill to qualify all persons, not otherwise qualified, when elected to a public body?  There is a big list of them, including persons convicted of offences and so on.  As far as I can judge from this measure, unless objection is taken within 12 months no further objection can be taken in that case.  That is as regards that local authority.  If the same individual were elected to another body he would still have his 12 months to run.  I do not know whether that was the intention of the Minister in connection with this Bill, but I should say it was not.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy knows the local government law.  He knows that there are certain Acts on the Statute Books that disqualify people who are bankrupts or who have been convicted of certain offences or found guilty of certain acts, from acting as members of a local authority. They are liable to fines every time they have so acted and every time they have cast a vote.  It is not the intention to qualify such persons or restrict the individual ratepayer from taking actions to test the validity of any such persons acting on a local authority.  There are Acts in existence which this measure does not amend that would enable any ratepayer, any local authority, or the Department of Local Government, if it were so informed, to point out the illegality of an individual of the type referred to by the Deputy acting as a member of a local authority.</P>

It concerns the Dáil also, as protecting the individual, in the circumstances of his necessity, from the oppression of the State, whether conscious or otherwise of the circumstances of his necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are highly elated because they have put the Irish Free State on the aerial map of the world and because, despite Kipling's dictum that &ldquo;East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet,&rdquo; there is the possibility that East may meet West on the plains of Thradaree, at <Col N="1126" /> Rhynana, Newmarket-on-Fergus.  The Dáil endorsed that action on the part of the Executive, and we are to be one of the termini of this inter-imperial, transocean, cross-continent, air transport service.  I do not intend in this motion to discuss the merits of that decision.  The initial activities consequent on that decision are under way.  The responsibilities of this State are definitely limited both as regards the capital outlay and as to any deficit that may arise in the working of the air transport service.  The Minister's words, however, when introducing this measure, are significant and relevant. They will be found in Volume 63, No. 6, column 2360 of the Official Debates.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The capital of the joint company will be subscribed and held as to 51 per cent. by the United Kingdom company, 24½ per cent. by the Canadian company, and 24½ per cent. by the Saorstát company.  The control of commercial, technical and operating matters will be secured to the United Kingdom company through its majority stockholding, and through the medium of the articles of association of the joint company, subject to the superior jurisdiction of the board of directors on questions of major policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to remember that that is the relevant background, when they endeavour to picture the needy Clare worker engaged in producing this almost world-wide air transport service at a wage of 27/- per week.  He has to try to maintain a family on it and to maintain his own strength to do the work necessary for the carrying out of this operation.  In column 2360, we find the Minister further stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In return for landing facilities to be granted to the joint company by the United States Government, Pan-American Airways will be granted landing facilities by the Governments of Saorstát Eireann, the United Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland; and that company will participate on a basis of reciprocity with the joint company in the operation of the services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the relevant background. Remember that it is to a mighty <Col N="1127" /> Empire, a powerful Republic and an extensive and wealthy Dominion that we are affording facilities.  We are one of the legs of the tripod, and against that background I want you to picture the needy Clare worker, trying to make an existence and affording facilities to that powerful Empire, that wealthy Republic and that extensive Dominion.  He is the man who is providing the facilities; he is the man who is making the sacrifices in respect of it.  Fortified by the guarantees as to capital outlay; fortified by the guarantees as to working expenses, and as to whatever deficits may arise in that connection, if and when they do arise; fortified by the provision that the Saorstát is not to bear any higher cost than £12,000, we find that the Government initiates the work upon this Rhynana scheme.</P>
    <P>There was first erected there a powerful transmitting wireless station and it is to be regretted that the first message that powerful transmitting wireless station should send to the world was: &ldquo;Starvation wages are being paid at Rhynana on the scheme initiated and being carried through by the Irish Free State Government to afford transatlantic, transocean, across-continent, inter-imperial air transport services.&rdquo; That is the first message it had to send to a listening world, if the world were listening. That is the message it continues to send and that is the message it must continue to send unless this Dáil stops the scandal.  The agricultural worker in England is getting something like 33/- a week.  His wage is higher, and what is his work in comparison with the work being done on the constructional operations at the proposed air base at Rhynana?  Can it be said that it is anything nearly as severe, nearly as arduous?  Can it be said that the agricultural worker in England will require as much food or will require the same quality of food to repair wasted tissue and restore expended energy.  It cannot, and no Minister and no Government can say it can. The Canadian navvy will probably get a wage approximating to between £4 and £5 in value of English money on the construction work at the other leg <Col N="1128" /> of the tripod of these air transport services.  The question I want to put seriously to the Minister and to the Deputy in charge is: Have Canada and Great Britain succeeded in imposing upon us a standard of living which they would not impose on themselves?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy McGuire is listening, and I am glad the rest of the House is listening, even if the Deputy in charge of this particular matter is not listening.  It is not necessary for him to listen because he knows it already.  He knows that there is no answer to the statements I am making and when he gets up to reply, he will find that he has no answer to make.  Canada and Great Britain must have succeeded, then, in forcing upon this Government a decision to introduce into this State a standard of wages and a standard of living far below what Canada, and Great Britain would agree to in respect of themselves.  If that is not the position, on what is the standard based? On what do they base this wage?  That is an interesting inquiry.  Probably the first thing that influenced the Government in establishing this standard was the fact that there are sufficient people in want to accept that standard, that there are sufficient people unemployed and in need of sustenance to take that wage and to accept that standard of living.  I do not think that even the political head of the Board of Works would have the temerity to stand up and say that the fact that there are sufficient people in need is a satisfactory reason for the introduction of that rate of wages and its imposition on the workers of Clare. I do not think he will because that would not tally with the alleged Christian administration within a Christian social order about which we heard and still hear a good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a great national service, we are told.  It is not alone a State service; it is a national service.  It is not alone a national service; it is an international service.  And we have in the picture, as I indicated a moment ago, a powerful Empire, a powerful Republic and a powerful Dominion. <Col N="1129" /> Let us measure this wage by any standard you care to set up.  If you regard the working man as a mere machine, into which you pour sufficient material to maintain him to carry on the work in which you have employed him, are you giving him, at the rate of 27/- per week, sufficient wage to enable him to carry on the heavy navvy work he has to do at Rhynana on that air base?</P>
    <P>Do not imagine a Clare worker to be anything more or anything greater than a mere machine, a machine to which you will only allow sufficient to enable it to carry on.  Do you think that on 27/- a week you can give such a man sufficient food, sufficient of what the body needs, to enable him to carry on?  We were told last night and it was not disputed&mdash;I do not think it can be disputed&mdash;on the authority of the British Medical Association that the least sum necessary to maintain a man, his wife and three children, just to maintain life in them, was £1 4s. 0d. per week.  That was the sum necessary in 1933, to give them sufficient food, and let me underline the word &ldquo;food,&rdquo; in order to maintain them in such a state of health that they might just live.  If the Government thinks of a labourer only as a human machine, does it consider that 27/- a week is capable of maintaining a single man to carry on the work which he is supposed to carry on at these constructional works at Rhynana, Newmarket-on-Fergus? Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance may have a higher social ideal for working men.  I am quite ready to believe that the Minister, who dabbled in poetry at one period of his life, might have a higher ideal for the working man than to think of him as a mere human machine.  He might consider that he should have a home.  He might consider that he would be entitled to have a family.  If he does not insist definitely and conclusively on a single man standard for employment at Rhynana, then what standard does he think that a man, his wife and family can maintain on 27/- a week?</P>
    <P>Let us forget the British Medical Association, let us forget data lines and all the other appurtenances with which the cost-of-living figures are surrounded. Let us try to get a small <Col N="1130" /> family budget sufficient to maintain a man, his wife and three children.  Let us start with bread alone, and if Deputies, or those people who occupy high positions, go into the matter they will find that a man, his wife and three children will spend 12/- a week on bread alone.  The price of bread has gone up, of course, in the last few years.  They will want at least two bags of coal per week.  These will cost 5/4.  A quart of milk daily, which is not an excessive quantity for such a family, will cost 2/7½ per week.  Three lbs. of butter will cost 3/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would you get butter for 1/- per lb.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He will get country butter, as opposed to dairy butter at that price.  I have gone to the trouble of checking these prices against actual purchases.  These are not items put down without any reference whatever to the actual state of affairs.  I have actually checked these prices against actual purchases.  At the minimum, 3 lbs. of butter will cost 3/-, ½ lb. of tea ?, half a stone of sugar 1/10, rent 3/-, light and soap 1/-.  On my calculation at least 30/- per week is necessary to purchase sufficient of these commodities for a man, his wife and three children.  Mind you, in that calculation, I have not included any meat, not even a Sunday meat dinner.  I have not included eggs or vegetables, clothing, insurance or tobacco.  I have not included any papers which the working man might buy so that he might have the advantage, doubtful though it is, of reading some of the speeches of Ministers when they go down the country telling us about the Christian social order, that they are going to introduce at some time in the near future.  I have simply taken the smallest amount necessary to sustain life, to repair wasted issues, to replace expended energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see the wages paid to workers by the Clare County Council.  The Clare County Council pays 35/- per week to its workers and that is not an extraordinarily high standard.  The North Tipperary County Council pays 35/- per week to these workers.  Maintenance <Col N="1131" /> work under the Electricity Supply Board is paid for at the rate of 10d. per hour.  Workers on the beet sugar factory are paid at the rate of 11d. an hour, and yet on this leg of the tripod&mdash;international, interimperial transoceanic, transcontinental, aerial transport service&mdash;this Government is asking workers to work at 27/- per week.  Let us take even agricultural wages paid in that area.  Practically all the agricultural labourers employed in Clare live indoor.  That is to say, the amount of labour given apart from indoor workers is very casual.  Let us take the position of what is generally known as a servant man or boy in these districts.  He gets an average of £26 a year in cash and, in addition, gets board, laundry and his bed.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he thinks these can be provided less than £1 per week for a man living indoor.  That would mean that an agricultural labourer in that area is getting 30/- per week.  That is based on the single man standard.  It is based on a standard that does not give the right to a man to marry, to have a home and a family.  Even last night we were told here during the discussion on the Agricultural Wages Bill that the average rate of wages paid to agricultural workers in Clare was £1 4s. 0d. per week.  If the average rate is £1 4s. 0d., it means that there must be many farmers in that county who pay a good deal higher than £1 4s. 0d.  Therefore, when I say that 30/- per week is the standard paid in that district I am not stretching the matter to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Our time is limited.  That is to be regretted because there are many things I should like to say.  I can merely deal with the dry bones of the matter now.  We hear a good deal of talk about a Christian wage.  That possibly may have several interpretations. I do not know what the Government's interpretation of a Christian wage is, but it is a wage, I take it, that can be sanctioned by Christian principles.  We have the highest Catholic authority describing it as a wage which will enable a man and his family to live in decent, frugal comfort.  That is the highest <Col N="1132" /> Catholic authority's interpretation of what a Christian wage is, Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is it a wage that will give frugal comfort if it does not afford any meat or any vegetables, or any provision for clothing or insurance, or provision of any sort for old age?</P>
    <P>Quite recently we had a more exact definition of what is a Christian wage. It comes from an important source.  A leading divine in the Protestant community, speaking quite recently here in Dublin, went into somewhat greater detail regarding what a living wage is. He said: &ldquo;A living wage is another important consideration.  I suggest that £3 weekly is a living wage for a man and his wife and four children, and £4 for a man and his wife and six children.&rdquo;  He does not say whether it should be a public employer, or a private employer.  We were always led to believe that a public employer, and the Government in particular, should be the best employer, and when we are blessed with a Fianna Fáil administration surely the rate ought to go up in proportion to the standard which, in their programmes, they say that they set.  Then we had an employer giving a standard of what the wage should be. We had Mr. Roantree at a conference at Oxford saying: &ldquo;Regardless of what other firms in the same industry are paying, and capital should take no surplus profits until that is done.  My human needs figure is to-day 53/6.  The minimum rate for a single woman should be 30/-.&rdquo;  Try and remember that in connection with the air base at Rhynana.  Try and remember that in connection with the facilities that are to be extended to the Empire, to the Republic, to the Dominion, and see the Clare working man suffering all the difficulties, suffering all the hardships, making all the sacrifices, and wading waist deep in water.  If you go on to a low plain and proceed to dig a canal, you will have to wade knee deep in water if you want to continue work. Rhynana is a tide-inundated place and if you proceed to dig a canal, or do extensive excavations in it you have to wade waist deep in water.  The Board of <Col N="1133" /> Works are providing waders in order to deal with that.</P>
    <P>You will have an idea then of what is the position of those workers.  They have 27/- a week to maintain themselves and their wives and families, with insurance deducted.  In a great many cases those people bring home sometimes 19/- or 20/- a week because of broken time.  That is the position. If there is a shower in the morning they lose a quarter of the day.  Then they come home with 19/- or £1 to their wives and families in order to try and carry them over to the next week, until they will have sufficient strength to go into the work again.  I have been speaking to some strong Fianna Fáil supporters in that area, and they said to me: &ldquo;If this matter were brought to the notice of the Government, I do not believe the Government would stand for it 24 hours.&rdquo;  They have stupendous faith.  There are still people with faith in this country, and there are people of great faith around Newmarket-on-Fergus.  They say: &ldquo;If you brought this matter to the notice of the Government, they would not stand for it; they would alter it,&rdquo; Now I have brought the position to the notice of the Government.  I have indicated by any standard by which you care to measure it&mdash;by the standard of a mere human machine&mdash;that you are not affording sufficient food to give them vitality to continue the work.  If you allow a man to be a social being, entitled to marry and have a family, you should give him sufficient to maintain a family.  On this Government job, which is an international job, you are not giving a standard of living which would be in any way respectable for a coolie.  I am asking the Dáil, therefore, to pass this motion, and see that the Government increases the wage to a figure approximating to a living standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion as moved by Deputy Hogan it will be perfectly unnecessary for me to intrude for any considerable length upon the time of the House. I am anxious to give to the person replying as much time as possible out of the limited time at our disposal. I do not think it will be necessary for <Col N="1134" /> me to do anything further than to allow the cool, impartial setting out of the facts, as given by Deputy Hogan, to sink into the minds of Deputies of all Parties in this House, so that they will realise the injustice that is being inflicted upon Irish workers in this national scheme.  It gives one cause to wonder if it is not a set and definite policy of the Government, on each and every opportunity that presents itself, to set themselves up&mdash;in contradiction of their statements in previous times&mdash;as being pro-taganists of a low wage policy.  Looking back over the past few years we had debates and discussions on the 24/-a week standard which was inflicted under minor relief schemes.  Subsequent to that, we had the diminution of that scanty figure to 21/- a week paid in certain counties under the Forestry Department.  Later than that we had the broken time system adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary on varying types of schemes throughout the country.  We had men earning as princely a sum as 15/- a week to maintain themselves and their families, in order to save the unemployment assistance fund.  Now we come to the scheme which has been referred to by Deputy Hogan as work of the most arduous kind. We have been previously told that the work on those schemes was of a light type, and did not call for any strenuous effort, but this scheme cannot be so classified.  I know of no more arduous toil than that which is called for in the sinking of those canals and the irrigation at Rhynana the men having to work, as Deputy Hogan has said, in a tide inundated plain.  I think if we had a definite policy on the part of the Government to indicate to the world at large, this is the one place where they would be inclined to set up a decent standard, because it cannot be denied to the other parties to this international transaction that this wonderful aerial service is going to mark its progress by the infliction of a low wage upon the workers engaged upon its construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with that, the local authority pays 35/-.  Is this an indication from the Government that they <Col N="1135" /> deprecate the payment of 35/- a week by the Clare County Council?  Is it an indication that North Tipperary must mend its hand, or that the county council must mend its hand in regard to its workers, whose most arduous work is the maintenance of roads, where they at least have a firm footing?  Viewed from any standpoint, I think it will be difficult for Deputies of this House to associate themselves with the continuance of this wage.  It cannot be that the future of aviation is going to depend upon whether or not the labourers engaged on this scheme will have a living wage of 30/- or 35/-, which would be a bare subsistence level, or whether they have to maintain themselves on the coolie standard indicated by Deputy Hogan in moving this motion.  I do not intend, as I said, to go over the points which have been made by him.  I do not think it is necessary, when a motion of this kind is put up for discussion, that there should be a long series of speeches on the same points.  I think the matter has been clearly set out, and needs no further demonstration.  I am anxious to leave as much as possible of the time at our disposal to hear any possible reply that can be given, but I am confident that no reply can be given from the Government Benches to satisfy any impartially-minded man that this is a justifiable wage.  I only regret that it is not possible for Deputies to use the freedom of their conscience in recording their votes because, if they were free to do so, I am perfectly certain the Parliamentary Secretary would find himself forlorn on the Government Benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder whether the Labour Party imagine, when speaking in this House, that they are speaking in a silence-cabinet&mdash;that they are speaking things that cannot be heard by anybody&mdash; because, if they were to believe that the things they say were being heard by the community, then they have a very curious thing to explain.  The story that we get from them is that this Government and everybody associated with it, and everybody except themselves, <Col N="1136" /> are out to grind the faces of the poor, are out to pay coolie wages, are out to calculate upon the sufferings, the poverty and the necessities of the people, for the purpose of unfairly, dishonestly, and inhumanly overworking them and underpaying them.  That is the story they have been carrying, and that is the story they have been telling to an electorate, 80 per cent. of whom are working people&mdash;80 per cent. of whom are people who are interested in wage standards and who would be affected by a policy of that kind &mdash;and they have been saying that for years.  Yet, at the end of the whole of that period, they have not been able to gather to themselves 5 per cent. of the whole voting strength of the community.  They are, apparently, the only angels.  They are the only people who want to do good for working people, and after 16 years they have not persuaded 5 per cent. of the people to believe them.  They have not affected the 95 per cent. of the people who listened to all that nonsense and turned their backs on it.</P>
      <P>It has pleased Deputy Hogan to use, as a description of this scheme, a phrase which it is advisable for us to remember&mdash;&ldquo;international, inter-imperial, transoceanic, transcontinental, aerial transport service.&rdquo;&mdash;and the whole case he has put before you to-day is based on the sonorous syllables of &ldquo;international, inter-imperial, transoceanic, transcontinental, aerial transport service.&rdquo;  That is the whole case that he put to you. He repeated that phrase 15 times, and if it was not good when he said it the first time, it certainly was not improved by repetition.  The mere fact that he has got hold of that phrase, however, does not affect in any way the nature of the work which is being done, and Deputy Hogan, in a question which he put down here the other day, and especially, in a supplementary question, made it perfectly clear that it was the precise nature and quality of the work to which he objected and on which he thought the wages should be based.  In his supplementary question on that occasion, Deputy Hogan asked:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that 27/- a week is a reasonable rate of wages considering <Col N="1137" /> the work which the men engaged on the Rhynana scheme at present have to do?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, in order that there might be no doubt about it, he asked another question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that wading waist deep in water is work which is paid for at the rate of 27/- a week?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now he has come down from the general &ldquo;international, inter-imperial, transoceanic, transcontinental aerial transport service,&rdquo; to the actual work that the men were doing, and it is on the basis of the actual work that the men are doing that the rate of wages is settled.  Now, what is the actual work which the men are doing?  I have here the actual specification, which covers the whole of the work which is being done by direct labour under the Board of Works:</P>
    <P>(1)  The opening up of existing drains, sluices and outfalls; the clearing of bushes, undergrowth, etc.</P>
    <P>That is the actual work upon which they have been engaged up to date.</P>
    <P>(2)  and (3) the excavation for main drains and boundary drains.</P>
    <P>(4)  Levelling and grading.</P>
    <P>(5)  Excavating trenches for subsoil drains; laying subsoil drains; back-filling with stone and replacing turf.</P>
    <P>(6)  Piping, culverting, and filling existing drains.</P>
    <P>(7)  Laying temporary surface roads, including quarrying.</P>
    <P>(8)  Strengthening existing embankments.</P>
    <P>(9)  Preparation of soil for grass surfacing, including ploughing, harrowing, rolling, fertilising, and sowing.</P>
    <P>That is the whole of the work.</P>

      <P>I will give the House another reality.  I want you to go down, in imagination, to Rhynana. What do you find there?  You find an old drainage system, consisting of an embankment set up for the purpose of drainage, with drains inside it and a complete network of filled drains behind it&mdash;a flat, non-boggy surface. Now, that is the whole reality, and that is an accurate and full description of the whole of the area in which we are working, just as that is an accurate specification of the work we are doing. What are we doing now on that old drainage area?  We are opening existing drains, sluices and outfalls; we are clearing away bushes and undergrowth; and precisely at that moment when we are doing that, Deputy Hogan intervenes with the statement that the wages which are being paid for doing that particular kind of work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy, as I have already told him, has asked two Supplementary Questions in which to clear up the obscurity in his original question.  Now, in precisely what work are these people engaged?  Will the Deputy tell us?  These people are engaged in doing drainage work.  They are employed there draining a particular area, and a great deal of the work they are to do is not even arterial drainage.  Some of it even ceases to be field drainage.  In fact, £17,000 worth of the work happens to be at ploughing, harrowing, rolling and breaking up the land.</P>

In 1931-1932 we had the Kilmaley drainage works £1,800; rate of wages 27/- a week.  A sum of £14,000 was spent on the Sixmilebridge works in 1932 at 27/- a week; on the Fergus works in 1932 there was a sum of £13,000 spent at the same rate.  In 1933, on the Inagh drainage, there was spent £13,700 at 27/- a week.  In the same year in Manus there was spent £2,600 at 27/- a week.  In Scariff, in 1931, there was spent £16,359 and again the rate was 27/- a week.</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe that throughout the whole time the rate of wages paid on these drainage works has been 27/- a week.  Someone is going to contend for one of two things&mdash;I do not mind which they contend for&mdash;that this is not drainage work&mdash;even after I have read the specifications&mdash;or that the drainage rate should not be 27/- a week.  Now which is it?  They have never challenged the drainage rate of wage in all these schemes that have been going on under the eyes of Deputy Hogan.  Now they suddenly discover that this is a cruel wrong and an outrage; that it is grinding the faces of the poor; that it is deliberately using their necessity for the purpose of paying a low rate of wage, a rate that, as I have shown, has been paid in probably £60,000 worth of work on drainage in Clare&mdash;in precisely the same work.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy complaining that it is international, inter-imperial, transoceanic, cross continental aerial transport work or drainage? The Deputy used that phrase; he read it out to me 15 times and I intend to remember it.  He brought this in as a background to misrepresent this work. By what authority does the Deputy speak here?  Does he speak with the authority of the men who are employed at this drainage work?</P>

      <P>The statement by Deputy Hogan that the men are working up to their waists in water is untrue.  We issued rubber boots up to their thighs to all these men.  Does the Deputy think that we are fools enough to ask these men to work up to their waists <Col N="1141" /> in water?  Sometimes in engineering as well as in fishing, men have to get into waders, but we gave them rubber boots up to their thighs.  I was over the whole works and I never saw a man even up to his ankles in water.  What has happened in this&mdash;the men have been in contact with us.  They put forward suggestions of one kind or another.  They put forward a suggestion in relation to broken time; they put forward suggestions in relation to waders and they put forward one in relation to a shelter.  There has been a suggestion in relation to enabling a man to transfer from one gang of men to another gang more convenient to his residence.  All these suggestions have been met.  I want Deputy Hogan to go down and ask them whether these suggestions have been met or not.</P>
