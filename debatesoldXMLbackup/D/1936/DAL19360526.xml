      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will state the reason why an increase in salary voted by the local committee to Nurse Kavanagh, tuberculosis dispensary, Waterford, more than a year ago, has not been sanctioned and why several letters addressed to his Department in the matter were not replied to.</P>

      <P>This matter came under the Department's notice only on an entry in the minutes of proceedings of the Waterford Corporation of the 2nd May, 1935.  A reply to an inquiry by the Department as to the reason for the increase in Nurse Kavanagh's salary was received from the Corporation on the 15th July, 1935, and was acknowledged.  From this reply it appeared that the case for additional salary was based on a statement that the total number of attendances at the local tuberculosis Dispensary in recent years had increased.  It was ascertained, however, from the annual returns furnished by the local tuberculosis officer to this Department in connection with the numbers of tuberculous patients treated under the Waterford city scheme that these numbers had declined from 380 in the year 1931 to 315 in 1933 and 341 in 1934. It was, therefore, considered advisable to await the receipt of the return showing the number of patients for the year 1935.  This return, recently examined, shows the number treated as 382 <Col N="898" /> or slightly higher than the 1931 figure. The question of increased remuneration to the tuberculosis nurse has also been under consideration in connection with the proposed development of the school medical service scheme as to whether any portion of the duties under that scheme could be assigned to the tuberculosis nurse.  It is hoped to give a decision in the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in dealing with the matter referred to in the Deputy's question.  Some time was necessarily involved in devising a procedure which would enable the cases eventually to go before the High Court without cost to the workers or their representatives. This aspect of the matter was settled early in 1935 and arrangements were then made with the Office of Public Works for the submission of applications which were received in my Department on October 30th last.  As the Deputy is aware from the copies of the schedules setting out the applications which were sent to various interested parties, including the Deputy, on November 30th, 1935, a very large number of different employments is involved.  On that date also statutory notice was given of my intention to give my decision on the applications on or after January 6th, 1936.  I expect to be in a position to give my decision at a very early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaints have been addressed to me on a few occasions by registered importers regarding the quality of the oranges imported from Spain, under the Spanish Trade Agreement. As registered importers were at liberty to import from Spain under the licences issued to them the particular quality of orange required by them, I do not consider that the situation is one which calls for intervention on my part.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to a question asked by Deputy Desmond on 15th May, 1935, the Spanish Government undertook that their exporters would supply the kinds of oranges ordered by Irish importers, and I have no reason to think that this undertaking is not being honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, and in view of the fact that his eyes have been opened, and that something approximating to rubbish is being dumped here by Spanish exporters, is he aware that the licences which he issues to importers under the Spanish Trade Agreement quota operate in such a way as to make it impossible for anybody but one individual to import oranges; that he then divides the cargo upon its delivery in Dublin, and that the business of ordering, as a result of the restrictions which the Minister incorporated in his quota licences, is reserved to one individual or firm?</P>

      <P>A duty of 50 per cent. on articles manufactured of bakelite, of the descriptions set out, was imposed by an Emergency Order in December of last year.  The duty has been in force since then.  The Emergency Order was repealed, following the introduction of the Budget, and the duty has been made permanent by this Resolution. Bakelite articles are being produced here by two firms, one at Nenagh in the County Tipperary, and the other at Bray in the County Wicklow.  Not all classes of bakelite articles are being manufactured here, and only those which are set out under the various headings are being made subject to the duty.  They are mostly household appliances of one kind or another, and <Col N="908" /> are being produced mainly by the Nenagh firm.</P>

      <P>But they are types of articles that are becoming increasingly common in certain houses, particularly in view of the high cost of ordinary china.  In view of the fact that the Minister purports to put a tariff of 50 per cent. on these articles, we would expect to get some information from him as to the number of persons employed in the factory that has been set up here to manufacture them, and as to why he thinks that a 50 per cent. tariff is required in order to give it protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that all these articles are now being manufactured here.  I take his statement to mean that the market is already being supplied because he is not taking power to license the import of the goods described here.  I would like to know if that is the position&mdash;that the company is now in a position to manufacture on a commercial scale and to give deliveries.  It seems to me that a duty of 50 per cent. will add unnecessarily to the cost of these articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to bring to the Minister's attention. In connection with articles dealt with in an earlier Resolution, he said that he was watching quality and price &mdash;the price at which those particular articles were being sold to retailers. I would also like the Minister to take into account the question of design. I am not thinking now as to whether some of these articles would have a lion or a Mickey Mouse on them for deceration purposes.  What I mean is this: take, for instance, a milk jug. I am anxious to see that it will pour through the spout, because at times we have seen articles put on the market <Col N="909" /> which, instead of pouring through the spout, poured through the sides. I hope we are not going to be in for a spate of bakelite or clay articles of that nature.  Design is a very important question and the Minister ought to pay particular attention to it.  While people pay attention to the price at which an article is sold, if they find that the cloth on the table has to be washed every time something is poured out of one of the jugs, the price will become a secondary consideration, and a duty of 50 per cent. will not be prohibitive unless every phase of the market is studied.  I ask the Minister, when he is practically granting a monopoly to two firms, to see that the designs and quality are up to the standard before the goods are put on the market for the consideration of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All the articles set out in the Resolution are being manufactured here in a variety of designs.  I do not think that there should be any difficulty in producing bakelite goods here of quality and design as good as can be produced anywhere.  The industry is one which is conducted largely by means of machinery and the equipment of the factories operating here is, I am sure, as good as the equipment of factories operating anywhere. Because the industry is one which is operated by machinery, the amount of employment given in it is not very large.  I understand that to supply the requirements of the country in the classes of goods made subject to duty by this Resolution the services of about 40 workers would be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Both classes are, I think, employed, but a high percentage would be female workers.  A very large range of goods manufactured from bakelite and on sale here are not being made subject to duty at the present time.  The duty imposed is at the rate of 50 per cent. but Deputy <Col N="910" /> Mulcahy will notice that, in the fourth column, there is a reference to the Finance Act of 1919, which means that the duty on these articles when imported from Great Britain is only 33? per cent.  The price at which the Saorstát-produced articles are sold is slightly higher than that at which the British articles can be sold here, due to the fact that the smaller production makes costs slightly higher.  In so far as the demand for articles of bakelite is increasing, there is no reason why the expansion of the industry should not permit, at some stage, of a reduction in price.  The articles I have seen produced by the companies concerned appear to me to be excellent. They were well finished and some of them were of quite useful design.</P>
      <P>There is no licensing provision in respect of this duty.  As Deputies are aware, these articles are of very low value and it is not necessary to have a licensing provision, because the actual payment of duty by people who desire to import these articles or the use of substitute articles of this description would involve no hardship. There is no difficulty in securing adequate supplies of these goods in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>It is sought by this reference to place a duty of 33? per cent. on preparations consisting wholly or mainly of acid calcium phosphate to be used as a flour improver.  The price of flour is sufficiently high already as a result of the tariff on imported wheat and as a result of the fact that the Government are, by their policy, collecting the taxation necessary to keep their wheat policy going across the shop counters rather than by the ordinary revenue machinery.  I do not think that an additional burden should be placed on the people who are at present obliged to bear these high costs and I should like to know from the Minister what the object of this proposal is&mdash;whether it is a revenue proposition or whether there is any prospect of employment being given as a result of the imposition of the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This duty was also imposed by Emergency Order last December and it is being made permanent by this Resolution.  Deputy Mulcahy need have no apprehension that the imposition of this duty will have any effect on the price of flour. The flour improver produced in the Saorstát will be sold at the same price, ex-factory, as flour improver is sold ex-factory in Great Britain.  The import of flour improver averages in value about £45,000 per year and it is expected that employment will be given to some 30 persons in its production here.  A factory is being built at Dun Laoghaire by the firm which is proposing to engage in this industry and it will be sufficiently equipped to supply all the requirements of the Saorstát.  It is not an industry of the first importance but it is one worth having in so far as it means additional employment here without any increase in the cost of the manufactured commodity.</P>

      <P>There is a very substantial tariff on tea sets and breakfast sets which raises appreciably the cost of these absolutely necessary household articles.  The duty here, so far as we can understand the effect of it, is intended to catch the higher priced tea sets.  I should like to get some information from the Minister as to what is the position of the industry with regard to the manufacture of these higher priced tea sets, and as to whether there is any fall in the cost of the Irish manufactured tea sets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one firm engaged in the production of pottery ware in the Saorstát.  That is the company at Arklow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Carrigaline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are undoubtedly producing some of the goods, but they engage only in specialised lines, like teapots and things of that kind.  The ordinary run of commercial pottery ware is produced mainly at Arklow. The duty was first imposed at the rate of 30/- per cwt., and it was realised that that duty would only prove effective upon the cheaper classes of goods in the production of which these firms are engaged.  We were satisfied with that position because it was anticipated that, during the period when they were coming into production, and training workers, it would be these cheaper classes of goods only they <Col N="913" /> would be producing.  The firm, however, are now well in production and are proceeding to engage in the production of the finer classes of goods of this description and, consequently, the 30/- per cwt. duty, which works out at 10 per cent. or 12 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> on the main range of tea sets and breakfast sets and so forth is being increased by the imposition of a 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty.</P>
      <P>There are from 300 to 400 people employed in the production of these goods in the Saorstát, and that number represents an increase of 120 or so between September, 1935, and April, 1936.  I think that, generally speaking, the public have been satisfied with the quality of the goods produced.  There may have been some reason to complain heretofore about the variety, but Deputies will appreciate that in the establishment of a new industry, which involves a considerable amount of manual skill on the part of the workers, difficulty will be experienced in the initial period which will become less as time progresses, and it will be possible for the firm to increase its varieties and generally to supply a range of products which will enable all tastes to be catered for.  The classes of goods which are being made subject to this 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty represent only a proportion of the classes produced by the concern, but it is in respect of these classes that the demand is most substantial and that the additional protection necessary to transfer that demand to the home concern was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate that in respect of products of this kind, there is naturally a temptation to traders to seek exclusiveness of design. On that account, they are slow to place orders with the concern here when they feel that their competitors may have goods of the same design, and, therefore, there is a stronger temptation to import, even at the higher price and pay duty, than there would be in the case of certain other classes of goods; but that situation will be only a temporary one, and in fact there will, we anticipate, be a sufficient variety of designs and qualities to enable a certain <Col N="914" /> amount of individuality to be maintained in the trade of particular firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions arise on this duty, on one of which at least I ask the Minister to make a comprehensive statement.  I take it that the object of the Government's policy is, while protecting Irish industry from external competition which in the judgment of the Government is too rigorous to enable home industrialists to compete, that legitimate competition shall continue to operate within the tariff barrier between the various firms engaging in the protected industries.  I should like the Minister in that connection to state now if the Executive Council approves of trade rings being formed behind tariff barriers, with the object of maintaining prices at the highest possible level at which they can be maintained, without allowing any foreign merchandise over the tariff barrier provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to inquire into the arrangements or agreements that may have been entered into by the earthenware and china producers in this State. It does not matter in the very least what Party or political affiliations the promoters of these companies have.  It is the duty of a Deputy in this House to ventilate any legitimate grievance he believes the consuming public are under.  I believe there are trade agreements being entered into between the producers of earthenware and china in this country with a view to maintaining prices and eliminating competition, by undertaking to divide up the types of pottery and allowing one company to produce one type exclusively on consideration that the other company is allowed to produce all the other types, and, on foot of that arrangement, eliminating all competition and allowing both firms to charge whatever they please for their products, always provided they do not raise their prices more than 50 per cent. above the price at which merchandise is offered from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that does not apply only in the case of china.  It applies in the case of druggists' sundries, and it <Col N="915" /> applies in the case of a number of other sub-heads which may arise on this schedule of tariffs, and I think the Minister ought to make a statement now as to whether he is prepared to assent to rings of that kind being formed and whether he is prepared to say that, in the event of his Department being satisfied that the tariffs are being made use of for the purpose of establishing rings of that kind, he will take such steps as may be necessary to break the rings, and, if needs be, to withdraw the protection which is being used for the purpose of exploiting the consuming public.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is an administrative point.  The Minister has proposals to vest the Revenue Commissioners with a licensing power under this head and I want to ask him if he will recommend, as a matter of routine, the issue of a licence for the importation of any single piece of china which is required to replace a broken piece from an existing set which was imported prior to the imposition of the duty.  The Minister will understand that in paragraph (b) of reference No. 29, he attaches a duty of 50 per cent. or 30/- per cwt. on all cups, saucers, sugar basins, slop basins, jugs, teapots and coffee pots.  These frequently are replacements of dinner sets or tea sets which have been in use for some time, and it does not seem reasonable to levy duty on those goods when it is manifestly impossible to get them from either of the firms which are manufacturing that class of merchandise in Saorstát Eireann, and it would be of very great assistance if the Minister indicated his readiness to give a routine recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners for the issue of a licence in any case in which he was satisfied that a person was genuinely replacing a broken piece.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the second point raised by Deputy Dillon first.  It is, I think, the practice at present to give licences for the import free of duty of parts of sets required <Col N="916" /> for replacement where the quantities imported are not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a case where the Revenue Commissioners refused to grant a licence for the importation of one tea cup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of that case, but I have stated the general practice.  In the case the Deputy has mentioned the circumstances may be such that the general rule could not apply.  As to the general question of arrangements to which the Deputy referred, I do not think the matter arises in this case in relation to this industry.  I think Deputies will find that there will not be a sufficient number of producers within the country to make a ring necessary by those who want to exploit the market. Consequently, we cannot rely upon competition between producers in this industry in order to keep down prices. I think it would be a very foolish thing to do.  But the position is that arrangements and understandings have been made with the firms concerned as to the prices they will charge.  If it should come to our knowledge that prices in excess of those agreed on are charged, then action of one kind or another will be necessary to deal with the position. So far as the general question of principle is concerned, we have power under the Control of Prices Act to get a report from the Prices Commission as to whether such rings exist, and whether they are influencing prices unduly.  We propose to amend that Act, to increase the powers of the Prices Commission and to give them whatever powers are necessary in order to make price fixing organisations inoperative, where their activities are harmful to the public interest; whatever powers are necessary in addition to the existing powers will be sought.  That is a matter which we will perhaps discuss more effectively when the proposals for the amendment of the Control of Prices Act are brought before the House.  That will depend upon the pressure of business in the draftsman's office and in the <Col N="917" /> Department of Industry and Commerce. In any event, we will have legislation to deal with the matter this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware in connection with this tariff that these two companies, one at Arklow and another at Carrigaline, have agreed that one of them will produce brown teapots on the undertaking and consideration that the other will not?  The Minister is, I am sure, aware that the brown teapot is universally used, and that in parts of the country nothing else is used.  This tariff of 6d. or a shilling on a teapot means a good deal to the poorer country house.  Does the Minister think that that agreement to which I have referred is a desirable agreement to be arrived at?  With the tariff that these companies have already got, I should think there is nothing to prevent them producing in each firm a brown teapot.  This would result in both concerns being keyed up to such a standard of efficiency, both constrained to charge the lowest penny they could charge.  They should be fairly competitive.</P>

      <P>When both concerns between them are not yet supplying the requirements of the country, I think it is a good thing that they should not both concentrate upon similar lines of goods, but should endeavour to ensure that the requirements of the market should be met first.  When both concerns have reached the point that any new trade that they can get is to be obtained in competition with one another, then I have no doubt that competition will develop.  But at present the two firms are not producing enough to supply the requirements of the country, and, consequently, we are allowing imports in free of duty.  In any event, Arklow is possibly one of the most up-to-date potteries in Europe. Deputies are aware that it is one of the most recently constructed.  They have there all the latest devices for the making of new varieties of pottery ware, whereas Carrigaline is an old firm. Mechanical methods are adopted in Arklow wherever possible, and in that way there is no comparison between it and Carrigaline.  There is a rather substantial difference between the methods of working in each concern.  The production of other classes as well as white teapots is carried on in Arklow. They produce in Arklow things that are to be seen in the Gaeltacht as well as in other parts of the country.  In addition, they have a very big market to supply in the matter of those other classes of goods which they have not yet been able to supply in full.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The entry in reference No. 30 proposes to put a duty of 50 per cent. or 1/- the article on &ldquo;toys which exceed nine-pence in value, and are, in the opinion <Col N="919" /> of the Revenue Commissioners, completely or substantially manufactured, and either are made wholly or mainly of wood... and soft toys not made wholly or mainly of rubber.&rdquo;  This 50 per cent. tariff is one of the standard rates that the Minister seems to have concentrated on for a wide range of articles very often affecting the poorer classes of the people.  The type of toys here are found more in use among the poorer classes of the people than amongst the better-off classes.  The House should require a very substantial case to be made by the Minister that a definite amount of employment is being given here, and that it is employment of a kind that would root the toy industry here and would develop a very definite craft.  In my opinion, before the House agrees to a tariff of 50 per cent. or 1/- the article on toys which exceed nine-pence in value, it should be well satisfied that a definite amount of employment will be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Toys of various descriptions are been made to some extent in Galway and in Gorey but the principal industry has been established at Tralee, in the County Kerry.  There is, it seems to me, no reason why all these soft toys and all wooden toys other than the very cheap wooden toys which are imported at low prices, should not be made here.  I have been encouraging firms to engage in this industry because the value of the goods imported is quite considerable.  The total value of the toys imported during 1934 exceeded £30,000 in value.  I am not sure that the existing concerns will be capable of supplying in full the demand for this class of goods, but I think they should be given a chance of doing so.  We imposed the duty, as Deputies may remember, by an Emergency Order after the conclusion of the Christmas season.  The greater part of this trade is, of course, seasonal. These goods are sold in very large quantities in or about the period of Christmas and the imposition of the duty at the commencement of the year gave the firms an adequate opportunity <Col N="920" /> of producing in sufficient quantity and variety to enable the demands of the Christmas season of this year to be supplied.  We hope that that will be done.</P>
      <P>I am not sure to what extent employment in the trade can be regarded as seasonal employment, but the numbers employed at present are not high. Whether that is due to the fact that employment is seasonal or that the firms concerned have not succeeded in getting over their initial difficulties yet, I cannot say, but I know that various projects are under consideration for an extension of operations and an improvement of the technical direction of the firms engaged in this industry and I would like to see them given a chance.  I do not think it will involve very great hardship on anybody to have particular classes of toys, such as those described in the Resolution, made subject to duty at this time of the year because I am sure the existing concerns can supply the present demand, whatever may be their position concerning the demands that will arise in the weeks preceding Christmas. I am quite certain they are capable of meeting the demand at the present time in full and on that account they should be given an opportunity to develop so as to enable the full trade to be supplied from Saorstát sources.</P>

      <P>In connection with the duty imposed on toys, the Minister says that one of the principal centres of manufacture is in Kerry.  I think I am right in saying that the promoters of the industry in Kerry were recently constrained to communicate to the public Press to the following effect, that admittedly a tariff was put on to protect their products, but immediately afterwards a series of other tariffs were put on which raised the cost of the raw materials to such a point that the first tariff ceased to have any material benefit for them and the net result was that the wooden toys and other toys they were making were a little dearer than they had been before, and the toy factory in Tralee was back very much to where it had <Col N="921" /> begun.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comment on that communication to the Press and how far it is true to say that all the raw materials of the industry were tariffed after the imposition of the protective tariff on toys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I recollect the letter to which the Deputy is referring and I may say I had some difficulty in understanding what they were getting at.  It would be entirely incorrect to say that all the raw materials were subject to duty.  When I went into the matter it came down to the point that a certain class of fleecy cloth, used for teddy bears and pussy cats and soft toys of that description, was involved.  So far as that class of cloth is concerned, at the present moment licences are being issued for its importation to anybody who requires it for the purposes of toy manufacture, and it is not required for any other purpose, so that any difficulty which the Tralee concern may have on that account is nil.  So far as I am aware, they are getting all the materials they need to import, free of duty.</P>

I am sure he also recognises that there was a tariff in connection with thread which is also used in making kittens and teddy bears.  I do not know whether the wood used for the purpose of manufacturing toys has also been tariffed. It amazes me to discover that a firm, <Col N="922" /> which I happen to know is largely promoted by enthusiastic admirers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should irresponsibly address a letter to the public Press stating that the costs imposed by way of tariffs on the raw materials had largely negatived the original tariff.  I invite those admirers of the Minister, who are now told <i>coram populo</i> that their contentions were rubbish, that they were wrong and their information was incorrect, to bear in mind when they next hear the Minister telling me that I am wrong that there is as much foundation for the Minister's insolent replies to me as there is for the insolent manner in which he purports to dispose of a letter addressed to the public Press by his enthusiastic admirers in Tralee.</P>

    <P>This is another of the 50 per centers and it is imposed in this instance on tennis balls.  There has been a general kind of revenue tariff on tennis balls and other sports goods of 15 per cent., with a 10 per cent. preference.  It is now proposed to bring the tariff within the 50 per cent. range.  The Minister, no doubt, will tell us that there is a firm in this country going to manufacture, or manufacturing, these tennis balls and that he has an agreement with them that the price will not be more than the price which is being charged in England, or at least very little more, for similar articles.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he has any such agreement, and if he has&mdash;he has already referred to agreements in connection with others of these reference numbers and indicated that he may have something to say about them when he is introducing amending legislation to his Control of Prices Act&mdash;will he take the step of issuing as a White Paper, to be laid on the Table of the House, copies of such agreements that he may have entered into or may enter into in the <Col N="923" /> future?  The public want the protection and the assistance of public information and public knowledge in order to check the rise in prices of articles coming under this 50 per cent. tariff.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he will issue to the public in future copies of such agreements.  I would like to hear from him why this tariff is being raised to 50 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The tariff is being raised because tennis balls are now being manufactured in the Saorstát. The duty of 15 per cent. with a 10 per cent. preferential rate was imposed for revenue purposes only.  This duty is intended to be protective.  These goods are being made by the Dunlop Company in Cork in sufficient quantities to supply all the requirements of the market here, which is estimated at about 10,000 dozen per year.  The general understanding in respect of price is the same in regard to these balls as it is in regard to other products of the firm; that is, the price is not to exceed the British price by more than 15 per cent. It is, I think, possible that the full increase may not be effected.  A duty at the rate of 50 per cent. is considered necessary because any lower duty might not be effective to prevent the importation of certain classes of tennis balls where a small addition to the price could not be regarded as an effective deterrent.  Anything&mdash;even second quality balls&mdash;could be imported and continued to be sold if a lower duty were in operation.  A duty of 50 per cent. on articles of this kind is not unduly high.  At any rate, the duty has no relation to the price, and the price they are sold at must not exceed 15 per cent. above the price in Great Britain.</P>

Tennis is a healthy game and it is a bad thing to handicap it by adding to the expense of already abominably expensive balls.

That is all that is suggested. The Minister is undertaking to make a stipulation as to price.  Why is he willing, on behalf of the consumers of this country, to pay Dunlop's £1,000 to make tennis balls in Cork when there is no reason to believe that any one will benefit except Dunlop's?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was arguing as to a price of 15 per cent. more than in Great Britain.  He objected to Deputy Dillon's argument because there was the assumption that the cost here was the same as in Great Britain.  Whenever the argument is put up that costs here are higher than in Great Britain it is always being scoffed at by the Minister.  Still, in the last two discussions the Minister intervened in order to defend the 15 per cent.  But who is to decide the question of quality of the article produced or whether the quality is the same as that of tennis balls sold at 15 per cent. less in Great Britain?  Will the Minister, or the Minister's Department, decide this question?  Will the balls have the same bounce as the Minister has when he comes in here? I understand that is a very important quality so far as tennis balls are concerned. <Col N="926" /> Will the position of the tennis associations here be taken into account?  Will the views of the mere consumer be ruled out altogether? Will this question of quality be decided by the officials of the Minister's Department?  The Minister says that tennis balls are to be of the same quality but 15 per cent. above the British price.  Again, I ask who is to decide the quality?  Surely, the Minister can answer that?</P>

      <P>It is a question of practice.  The consumer must decide.  It is not merely a question of pulling the wool asunder.  It takes practice to decide.  I am interested in the fact that again he fixed 50 per cent. for prohibitive purposes, but when certain cases are put before him he admits that owing to the condition of manufacture in this country a higher price will have to be charged.  That is the case made against some of his tariffs. If that holds good in such cases then, <i>a fortiori</i>, it holds good in this case.</P>

    <P>This is only a tariff of 40 per cent., but it covers a whole series of articles, from pavement gutters and component parts to sewer pipe ventilators, stands, frames, kitchen sinks and similar articles down to fire-grates, ranges <Col N="927" /> stoves and safes and strong boxes. Although this is only a 40 per cent. tariff, it is as bad or worse than some 50 per cent. tariffs we had before us. Quite a large number of these articles have been subject to a tariff of 25 per cent.  Here we have articles that enter into every home and into a lot of constructional work in the permanent fabric of every home, such as firegrates and ranges, as well as utensils such as pots and pans.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what has happened in the industry that has been manufacturing these things that forces him now to bring in a proposal to raise the tariff on these articles from something like 25 per cent. to 40 per cent.  Attention has already been drawn to the fact that, according to the figures disclosed in the census of production for 1933-34, the industry to which most of these articles apply is an industry in which there has been a substantial reduction in the average wages paid to workers. So that I think that in the case of this reference here there is occasion for the Minister to tell the House what is the necessity for this tariff and what exactly are the conditions, or have been the conditions during the last few years in the industries which are manufacturing these items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why any cast-iron products should be imported except products of very special use and design.  It is our hope to secure that all the cast-iron goods required in the Saorstát will be produced in Saorstát foundries.  We proceeded to encourage the establishment of new foundries and the development of existing foundries for that purpose, first of all by requiring, through the Housing Board, that in houses subsidised from State funds Irish-made cast-iron goods should be used, such as down-pipes, grates, ranges and articles of that kind, to the extent that they were available.  For a considerable period Irish foundries were not in a position to supply all the cast-iron goods required in such houses, and no duty was in fact imposed on such articles as grates and ranges on that account; because, apart from the <Col N="928" /> market for these goods which existed in the ordinary course, even the special market in subsidised houses could not be supplied by the Irish foundries.  They have got to that point now, and we consider it is time to proceed further and endeavour to have produced here some part, if not all, of the substantial requirements of the country in cast-iron goods of the kinds described in the Resolution.</P>
      <P>The imports of these goods in the year 1935 were valued approximately at £300,000, and that is a very substantial sum to pay out for goods we could produce here.  We are, therefore, making subject to the duty which is applied upon certain classes of cast-iron goods, cast-iron goods of the descriptions set out in the Resolution. It is contemplated that arrangements which have been made for increasing the production of these goods will result in their manufacture here in the course of the coming 12 months.  We are taking power to license imports free of duty for the present, and that power will be utilised to ensure that any person not able to have his requirements met from Saorstát foundries will not have to pay duty; he will be allowed to import free of duty until such time as the production of the Saorstát foundries is sufficient to enable the requirements to be met.</P>
      <P>There are three or four main classes of goods covered by the Resolution, such as gas pipes, smoke pipes, water pipes, and gutters.  The importation of these last year was valued at £47,000.  Other pipes and fittings were imported to the value of £82,000.  The imports of domestic stoves, grates, and ranges were valued at £152,000. Deputies noting that figure will bear in mind what I have stated, that in a house subsidised from central funds only Irish-made grates and stoves could be used, or else the subsidy had to be sacrificed.  The importation of cast-iron hollow-ware, for the manufacture of which at Waterford a new industry is about to be established, reached in 1935 £31,000 in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is contemplated that in the production of these goods some 500 additional workers will be employed. <Col N="929" /> We consider that that is employment of a kind worth having, as it is adult male employment in the main; that, in so far as there is no technical difficulty about doing this work here, it should be done, and that the imposition of a duty of 40 per cent. will be justified by the results.  On the question of prices, which I know Deputies will refer to, I would point to the fact that there are a substantial number of foundries operating in the country, and that it is to be anticipated that the competition between them which, judging by recent Press reports has in certain cases been very keen, will be sufficient to enable prices to be kept down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is certainly a caution, because any argument can be used both ways, upside down and inside out, according as he wishes to use it.  We are now assured that competition has set his mind at rest, and that that is an assurance that prices will be kept down.  Ten minutes ago we were told that he was getting an assurance that prices would be kept down, and that was quite adequate to meet the situation.  That is not all, because the Minister quite blandly says that Deputies need have no anxiety in this case, as there are several foundries in the country, and we all know this, although the Minister is himself engaged in wiping out all the independent iron founders in the country at present.  He has sponsored a plan for the introduction of Allied Iron Founders into Waterford.  He has been asked to receive a deputation from the independent iron founders, but, so far as I am aware, has refused to speak to them.  He may have mended his hand since I heard last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied Iron Founders will establish an absolute monopoly in all castings required, and any independent iron founder, engaged in work similar to that which Allied Iron Founders propose to undertake, will be put out of existence.  Allied Iron Founders is an off-shoot of the British association which controls the vast majority of the moulds of the British iron founding industry.  So far as I am aware, Allied Iron Founders will have an agreement with Allied Iron Founders of Great <Col N="930" /> Britain which will make available to them all the moulds which Allied Iron Founders of Great Britain control. That means that any independent firm endeavouring to compete with them here is faced with destruction, and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Finance here for a moment, because he will, perhaps, give us a little information on one aspect of this Resolution. This Resolution refers to pots, pans, sewer pipes, drain pipes, and rain pipes.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has just told us that the market for those commodities was secured for Irish producers by a proviso which was made by the Department of Local Government and Public Health requiring anybody who was building a subsidised house to use Irish-made ranges, down pipes and gutters if they were to get the grant. That all sounds very nice and benevolent, but perhaps the Minister has noticed that one of the firms engaged in the production of ranges, down pipes and gutters has, since its inception, and since those tariffs and inducements were brought into operation by the Government, paid its shareholders two capital bonuses&mdash;not dividends, but capital bonuses; has paid a substantial dividend on the twice watered capital; has paid to its directors a handsome fee at the conclusion of its last year's operations, and paid them a large bonus into the bargain.  Most of those ranges, down pipes and gutters are being used in the houses of persons who have got a grant and are, therefore, persons of small valuation; or, alternatively, have been incorporated in the fabric of labourers' cottages, thereby raising the rent by so many pence per week on labourers who are not able to pay the rent at all in many cases.  The Minister assures us that competition is going to keep prices down.  If competition kept prices down, how was it that one firm was able to make two capital bonuses for its shareholders, handsome dividends for every year, and a large monetary bonus for its directors after its last year's operations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the particular firm to which I am referring will be affected by the competition of Allied Founders, and I do not believe it for the same reason which I ventilated on an earlier resolution&mdash;that there will be a policy of &ldquo;scratch me and I will scratch you.&rdquo;  The gentlemen making the capital bonuses will undertake not to chip in on what Allied Founders want to make; Allied Founders will give a <i>quid pro quo</i>, and will not chip in on what those gentlemen want to make.  Between the two of them they will wipe out all the small foundries scattered through the country who, as the Minister knows, sought an interview with him but did not succeed in getting it.  I want to ask the Minister does he think that the profits which have been made in the production of the cast-iron goods referred to in this schedule are legitimate?  Does he think that this tariff has been fairly <Col N="932" /> taken advantage of in so far as it has operated heretofore?  Does he think that the firms engaged to-day in the production of rain-water goods and sewers have given the consuming public of this country fair value?  I shall be glad to hear the Minister on those questions.</P>
      <P>In regard to paragraph (k) of this sub-head, a 40 per cent. duty is going to be levied on firegrates, ranges and stoves.  What will the position be in regard to anthracite-burning stoves? The Minister is aware that there are one or two firms in Great Britain, one firm in Sweden, I think, and one firm in Germany which specialise in a certain type of anthracite-burning stove and range.  Those ranges are peculiarly suitable to the consumption of Castlecomer coal.  Is the Minister in a position to say if there will be any alternative provided by Allied Iron Founders or any other foundry in the country now or intended to be set up in the country for the Esse anthracite stove or the Swedish anthracite stove which has been available heretofore?  If no alternatives are going to be afforded, is it the Minister's intention to recommend the issue of licences for the importation of those stoves?  Under paragraph (p), safes and strong boxes are to be made liable to this duty. Does the Minister seriously intend to require a duty of 40 per cent. to be paid on all safes being imported into this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If steel enters into their composition will they be exempt? The duty applies to articles (whether completely or partly manufactured) made wholly or mainly of cast iron. If the outside shell of a safe is made of cast iron, and the lining and door are made of steel, will that exempt the safe from this duty?  Perhaps the Minister would give us some indication of what class of safes he has in mind, because so far as I am aware few safes, if any, are now made exclusively or mainly of cast iron, and, if a reference of this kind is introduced into the schedule, surely the Revenue Commissioners will interpret it as <Col N="933" /> meaning that any safe, the exterior casing of which is mainly of cast iron, is liable to the duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a slightly different point on paragraph (k).  I take it, of course, that the Minister is aware that the number and type of fire-grates, ranges and stoves installed in this country is legion. There are hundreds of them.  I think the Minister is quite right in giving protection for what is going to be manufactured in this country, but I notice that he has put a duty on component parts of such articles.  As between the person who is bringing in component parts, intending to assemble them in competition with the foundries here, and the person who is bringing in component parts as replacements for parts which have become worn out, I think the Minister should surely be able to draw a line of demarcation.  I know that the life of a fire-grate or range is a debatable point; in fact, many controversies have arisen as to how long one ought to last.  It will be many years before the cessation of a certain amount of trade in replaceable parts for a whole lot of types that are not going to be manufactured in this country, and never were manufactured in this country.  A maker in some other part of the world, who has either the patent or the patterns, can provide the article more quickly and more cheaply than any person in this country who has to make a pattern for the precise part wanted.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
      <P>There is also another point which Deputy Dillon was touching upon.  I take it that safes that are made of steel, with steel linings and filled with fire-resisting materials between the walls, would not be affected by this particular duty.  I should like the Minister to deal with those few remarks when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this particular duty, we have some of the manufacturers, who have been manufacturing some of these articles for years, making a huge profit, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, both as a result of dividends and capital reductions, and we also have the fact that the existing production, whatever that happens to <Col N="934" /> be, has not been able to provide all the needs of the country in connection with some of these articles, according to what the Minister says.  In other words, their output was limited; but if they were able to make huge profits under such circumstances, I think it is evident that, with an increased output, they will make bigger profits.  This will, of necessity, tend to raise the price of the various articles concerned. The Minister pointed out the amount we spent last year on imports of stoves, pipes and other articles.  Now, if the firms referred to, which were able to make these huge profits, had reduced somewhat the prices of some of these articles, perhaps there would not have been such an extensive importation of these particular articles into this country; or even if they had devoted some of their profits to producing articles which they had not hitherto produced, perhaps those imports could have been decreased without the use of this increased tariff.  Let us take the case of pots, pans and kettles. They are used in every house&mdash;even the poorest house&mdash;in the country.  Of course, the Minister will probably say that he has an agreement with these firms that they will not increase their prices by more than 5 per cent., or 10 per cent. at the outside.  Well, if so, why give them this 40 per cent. protection? Although I am not keen on protective duties&mdash;in fact, less keen than some people, except in approved industries&mdash;I will not cavil with the Minister in putting on a duty of 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. if, in the particular industry concerned, it can be proved that the duty, whatever it may be, is purely protective, and that it will not mean an increase in the price of the articles to the extent of the duty imposed.  What I do protest against is giving these manufacturers a chance to charge 40 per cent. extra&mdash;which they will charge&mdash;on articles which are in every-day use.  For instance, in the last paragraph of this item, you have smoothing-irons of every description. They are used in every household, and they may be taxed also.  I protest against the price of such an article, which is in every-day use in every household, being put up as a result of the tariff.  The most significant item, <Col N="935" /> however, is at the end, and that has reference to glue-pots.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to tax glue-pots to this extent, but if it means such an increase in price as I have suggested, I think it will mean that the Minister and his Party will find themselves in the glue-pot.</P>

      <P>Well, take the case of the Nenagh factory for the manufacture of aluminium goods of this description.  What is the position there?  The wholesale price there is exactly 40 per cent. over the world price, plus the cost of carriage and packing, which brings the price up to practically 50 per cent. above the world price.  Yet the Minister says that the price is not increased.  I hold that the same thing will happen in regard to the articles mentioned here.</P>

      <P>Now, the Minister is not going to escape in that way at all.  I am talking about the consumers. They are going to be put out of <Col N="936" /> business.  It is their fate.  The manufacturers can look after themselves, as is instanced in this case.  However, does the Minister deny that the Nenagh factory is charging 40 per cent. over the world price, plus the cost of package and freight, and that when these articles were coming from England they were delivered here in Dublin free of the cost of packing and freight, whereas now they will not be delivered from Nenagh here except with that increase in price, plus the cost of packing and freight?  I think that the Minister had better stop telling this House and telling the people outside this House that this kind of thing is not taking place.  It is taking place, and it is a scandal that it should be allowed to take place.  I am not concerned with the case of any particular manufacturer.  As I have said, the manufacturers can look after themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was being discussed here the other evening, I understood that one of the reasons given by the Minister for a high protective tariff of 50 per cent. was to protect the ordinary manufacturer here against the power of a combine or combines.  I think the argument was that, although a 10 per cent. tariff&mdash;I think that was the actual figure mentioned by the Minister&mdash;would enable a manufacturer here to manufacture the particular article concerned in an economic manner, still it would be necessary, in order to protect such home manufacturers against combines, to introduce the 40 per cent. additional protection.  Now, Sir, my difficulty in following the Minister is this: he asked Deputy Dillon as to what leg he was standing on.  We find it difficult to know, from night to morning, what leg the Minister stands on in a case like this.  As I have heard the case, the representation of certain existing manufacturers is that there is a great danger that the introduction of a big combine, disguised in whatever manner it may be disguised, will have the effect of crushing a number of existing manufacturers in this country out of existence.  Perhaps the Minister has not heard that.  I do not know whether there is now any truth in the <Col N="937" /> suggestion that the Minister refused to receive a deputation from these people.  Deputy Dillon could not say whether it was true up to date or whether quite recently the Minister has changed his mind on this matter.  It is possible that he has not heard this, but I understand that it is the representation of certain existing manufacturers in this country that that will be the effect so far as 12 or 13 of them are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on the last occasion when we debated these matters, one night last week, the Minister was particularly alive to the dangers that might accrue from combines.  It appears now, however, that his sight seems to have been clouded suddenly and that, in connection with that particular matter, that danger, apparently, no longer exists, although undoubtedly, the fear which now seems to have passed away from the Minister, seems to have passed into the breasts of the manufacturers already engaged in these foundries throughout the country.  I quite admit that the Minister may say that it is the business of these manufacturers to look after themselves, and that, if they cannot do that, it is not his business. He may hold that, even though they may be crushed out of existence, his business is to see that, if certain articles now manufactured abroad can be manufactured here, they shall be manufactured here, no matter what happens to the existing industries. Let us suppose that the fears of these manufacturers are justified, and that they are crushed out of existence.  That means that you will have a monopoly here.  We are in a difficulty with the Minister on that matter, and perhaps he will grasp our difficulty.  The Minister, of course, will probably tell us that he will intervene if such a monopoly leads to increased prices. We do not know the number of cases in which he has intervened, but it will be noticed that, up to the present, whenever he came to deal with the question of prices, he took up the line that he had entered into an agreement in the case of a number of firms to be established&mdash;whether large concerns or small concerns&mdash;on this matter of prices.  He has not said that in the present instance, however.  Not merely <Col N="938" /> did he not say that, but I think he implied the contrary in his interruption of Deputy McMenamin.  There was no question here of a guarantee of only a 10 per cent. or a 15 per cent. increase in price.  All he relied upon was the competition of a number of existing firms.  The fear is that as a result of the steps taken many of them are going to be crushed out.  Competition was what the Minister relied upon to keep down prices to a reasonable extent. The Minister is giving 40 per cent.  We are told there is no fear that that will mean an increase of 40 per cent. because there is no agreement between the foundries.  He says it will be only 12 or 15 per cent., because there will be competition between the powerful combine and the ordinary manufacturers here.  It will be noticed that the Minister took up the line in connection with tennis balls, that an increase in price was necessary owing to conditions of manufacture here not being as favourable, apparently, from the manufacturers' point of view, as in Great Britain.  There is no indication that the same will not happen in this case.  The market is smaller here than in Great Britain and the argument the Minister used with regard to tennis balls applies here.  He gave no indication of the rate that he expects prices to go to, as he has made no agreement, as far as I can judge, with the firms to which reference was made.  The Minister said that the prices will not go up at all, that articles as good could be produced here, and that consumers will not suffer.  That is a remarkable contrast with the line he took up in connection with the manufacture of tennis balls.  It is impossible to find any principle as a basis of the Minister's activities.  The reference concerns a number of articles, and the one person never thought of in all the tariffs and taxes we are putting on is the consumer.  He is the goose that lays the golden eggs.  That is his sole function, and if ultimately he is killed it does not matter.  As far as the Minister is concerned, there is no danger of that.  He is quite convinced that the consumer can go on interminably laying golden eggs when tariff after tariff is put on, and when he has been mulcted and exploited. <Col N="939" /> but never has there been any advertence by the Minister to the position of the consumer.</P>

      <P>The second half of the Deputy's speech contradicted the first half.  We are told that the new concern at Waterford is the product of a combine.  It happens to be a Saorstát company in which two-thirds of the shares are held by Saorstát nationals. It is a company established under the provisions of the Control of Manufactures <Col N="940" /> Act.  I have no power to stop that company engaging in that industry in Waterford.  Why is it suggested that I have?  That company is entitled to engage in that business or in any business without leave or licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce or any Government Department. It is so constituted that it has that right.  Anyone can engage in the manufacture of these goods in the Saorstát and is entitled to do so without a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  If a half-dozen new foundries were started by Saorstát companies there is no power given the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the Oireachtas to prevent that development taking place.  Anyone engaging in any one of these industries has to do so in the knowledge of the fact that other people have the same right to do so that they have, and that they may be faced with competition. Provided that competition comes from a Saorstát company, it is entitled to engage in manufacture here without licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  I have been told that I refused to receive a deputation from the Saorstát Iron Founders' Association. I have no recollection of having been asked to receive a deputation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was arranging to establish a new industry in which there would be no competition, that would be denounced as something monstrous. Here the competition is active and is <Col N="941" /> likely to develop.  Those engaged in the industry at present do not like that.  Of course they do not.  No manufacturers like competition, but it is not our business to stop that competition developing when it is done in accordance with the law.  What does the Deputy want?  I am at a loss to understand his position.  Apparently he does not want competition to develop and, at the same time, wants to pretend that the absence of competition is detrimental to the interests of consumers.  I do not believe that existing Saorstát foundries are going to be wiped out.  In any event, if they were wiped out, they have to face that possibility.  It is three years since I met the manufacturers and pointed out that there were cast-iron goods, not produced here, imported to a value exceeding £300,000 per annum.  I urged and encouraged them to extend their activities so as to produce these goods.  Time and time again during the past three years they were pressed to reduce the imports of the items that appear in the shipping statistics.  If they have not taken advantage of the market that is there waiting for them, they have no reason to complain when another Saorstát firm comes along. Even this other Saorstát firm is going to have a very big task before it if it is going to produce here the greater part of the goods imported without infringing on the market already supplied by existing firms.  The value of cast-iron products of the kind mentioned in the resolution imported last year was £300,000.  If the new concern at Waterford produces cast-iron goods of that value, it is going to be a very big concern indeed, and it would certainly take more than 12 months to get into a position in which there would be such production.  When it has got to the stage, if it ever does get there, in which all that £300,000 worth of goods will be produced and sold by it, then the existing Saorstát foundries will be in no worse position than now, and the existing markets which they are supplying will not be impinged upon in the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, I state here and now, that except in relation to industries for which there has been special legislation, <Col N="942" /> like the cement industry, or except where a reserved commodity Order under the Control of Manufactures Act has been made, there is no power in the Government to prevent any Saorstát firm engaging in any manufacturing process here, and anybody who goes into any industry has got to do so in the knowledge that any other Saorstát firm has the same right to engage in that industry that he has. In so far as the foundry industry is concerned, I have been perturbed by the fact that its development has been slow, and that, despite the assistance given to it, there was not recorded the same increase in production and the same increase in employment that other industries can show, that there was still a very substantial importation of cast-iron goods.  I am glad to say that plans have been made which will result in that increase in employment and that reduction in imports which we desire.  It is of course ridiculous to talk about this firm getting into a position in which it will have a monopoly.  There is at least one existing foundry in the country which is as large, if not substantially larger, in relation to the capital invested in it and its total productive capacity, as the Waterford concern ever will be.</P>
    <P>So far as component parts are concerned, it is proposed to grant a licence for those where they are not of standard design and are required for replacement.  I do not think any difficulty will be experienced in that connection.  All the classes of goods which are being made subject to duty at this reference were not dutiable heretofore, and the statements made by speakers to the effect that firms engaged in these industries had already exploited the protective position therefore are proved to be groundless. These goods were not previously dutiable.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain the procedure he adopts in regard to consulting people interested when he decides to put on tariffs.  I cannot make out what the procedure is.  There are a number of manufacturers in the State, according to the Minister, in the foundry industry.  He saw them in 1933. Apparently since then he has not personally heard their views.  He is dissatisfied with them, and he puts on a tariff of 40 per cent., obviously without consulting either the consumer or the manufacturer.  Up to the present I thought it was only the consumer that was neglected, so far as consultation was concerned, but now, apparently, existing manufacturers, according to what I can gather from the Minister's statement, are equally neglected.  He saw them in 1933.  Here is a radical change in his programme and they have not been given an opportunity or have not been called by the Minister to put their case, whatever it is, before him. He referred to the assistance that he <Col N="944" /> had already given them in 1933.  What precisely was the time that the Minister gave assistance to the foundries?</P>

      <P>Well, not to the extent he expected.  Is it worth while cavilling over these matters? The Minister expresses discontent at the method by which they utilised the opportunities which he provided for them.  Apparently he considered these opportunities of such a nature that they should have utilised them to a much greater extent; they did not utilise them to the extent that the Minister expected.  That is the statement he has just made to the House. Now he proposes to put a tariff of 40 per cent., under reference No. 33, as he has done under reference No. 32. He could give the new company an opportunity to see whether it would avail of them under existing conditions and would be prepared to work under existing conditions.  Has the new company indicated to the Minister that this is the tariff it would expect?  We have had in this House occasions on which the Minister has told the House that manufacturers had come to him <Col N="945" /> and told him of the tariff that they thought would be necessary to help them to operate successfully.  We have heard many instances of that in the past.  Was the new company that is being set up in this case consulted as to the range of the tariff?  Perhaps the Minister would answer that, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I am in a difficulty in trying to follow the Minister's statement.  I think he will admit that the difficulty is not altogether on my side.  I did not ask whether the Minister said: &ldquo;I will give you a 40 per cent. tariff.&rdquo;  What I want to know is, did the Minister get the views of the new company on the kind and height of tariff that they would be looking for.  Was that put before the Minister?  According to statements that we have heard from him in the last couple of years, it has been put before him on many occasions. The procedure of the Minister used to be quite simple.  Manufacturers came to him and said that if they got a 25 per cent., a 30 per cent. or a 40 per cent. tariff, they could manufacture a certain thing, and the Minister simply said to them: &ldquo;You can have your tariff if you can manufacture this thing.&rdquo;  That used to be the procedure of the Minister in his earlier years.  What I want to know is, has he been in consultation with any of these companies or not?  I gather that he has been in consultation with the new company as to the types of articles that were to be manufactured, and, I presume, as to the height of the tariff.  I am not saying that he indicated to them that he was going to give them a 30 per cent., a 40 per cent. or a 50 per cent. tariff.  I gather that he consulted them.</P>

A new firm is going to be established, and without waiting for an opportunity to see how it will utilise its opportunities, the Minister immediately gives it a 40 per cent. tariff.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the opportunities created for them.  I was referring to the fact that a situation was created in which the demand for their goods exceeded the supply.  I think they could have taken greater advantage of the situation, but advantage was taken of the situation because practically every foundry increased its production.  A number of new foundries were established, at least three or four, apart from the expansion in production in the case of existing concerns.  I never contemplated that the whole of our imports of cast-iron goods was going to be wiped out without the establishment of new foundries, and I am astonished that any person engaged in the business should contemplate that the importation of all cast-iron goods could be wiped out without the establishment of a new foundry.  Now that there is a new foundry being established, I cannot see why they should be getting so apprehensive as to the possible effects upon their own business in view of the fact that there is a market here to be supplied which nobody is supplying.  That market is worth £300,000 a year, and the whole of it can be supplied without taking one pennyworth of trade from the existing concerns.  If the new concern, to which reference has been made and which has established a foundry at Waterford, gets up to a production of £300,000 a year, then I think it will be doing more than its promoters contemplate.</P>

      <P>When we were dealing with reference No. 32, I referred to one other point in connection with this industry, and that was the effect on wages as between 1931 and 1933-34.  The information published by the Minister's Department indicates that the average wage income of the wage-earner in the metal industry has substantially decreased between these years.  In respect of the year 1933, the information published by the Minister's Department showed that the average income of the wage-earner in the metal industry was £10 18s. 0d. less per annum in 1933 as compared with 1931, and that in 1934 it was £8 8s. 0d. less as compared with 1931.  I take it that the industry we are dealing with comes under what is classified as &ldquo;metals,&rdquo; and excludes engineering.  But if those in engineering employment are to be included with those in the metal industry, then we find that the wages fall in the case of the average wage-earner has been greater than the wage fall of the metal worker when taken separately.</P>

      <P>Owing to the way in which the Minister operates, there is no other way left to me of finding out the average wages paid to wage-earners in industry in the country.  If the Minister has any information as to the trend of wages in the metal trades, <Col N="950" /> he ought, when he is putting these substantial tariffs on metal manufactures, to be able to tell us something about them.  The only way people have of watching the trend of wages over the 22 industries which are dealt with in the census of production is to take the total wages pool in the industry in a year, take the figures of employment for October, and consider the relation of the number of persons employed in October of each year to the total wages pool of that year.  In both the engineering and metal industries there has been a substantial fall in wages.  There has been a more substantial fall in the engineering trade than in the metal trade.  The figures the Minister has given us show that there have been reductions, as I pointed out, of £10 18s. 0d. and £8 8s. 0d. respectively between 1931 and 1933 and 1931 and 1934.  I do not think that the Minister can deny that the average wage in the metal industry has fallen.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only interpretation that can be put upon what the Minister says is that he has not examined the situation.  The Minister cannot but look at things in the ordinary way.  Taking the Minister's figures for October of each year as representing a rise or a fall, the Minister cannot but have been curious enough to relate that to the wages pool.  If he has not done that, it is a very peculiar thing.  Perhaps he thinks that that is not the right way of dealing with the matter.  May we ask him what the right way is, and what way the Minister has selected to show the trend of wages?  The trend of wages, as shown <Col N="951" /> by the method I have adopted, is substantially down.  We have no indication as to what is causing that&mdash; whether it is the difficulties the small foundries are finding themselves in in relation to the large foundries or not. If that be the position, the question arises whether the tendency will not be more in that direction in the future as regards the smaller foundries unless the Minister examines the situation and brings it under review.  Apparently, the Minister knows nothing about the matter.</P>

The Minister proposes to impose a tariff for the purpose of increasing employment at a level of wages satisfactory to the community as a whole.  Our submission is that the Minister's machinations heretofore have resulted in a fall in the standard of wages of persons employed in the metal industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has adduced figures showing how we have arrived at our conclusion.  The Minister repudiates Deputy Mulcahy's calculation. He says that the calculation as made by Deputy Mulcahy is likely to produce a false impression, and is a misrepresentation of the official figures. This question has been debated on this resolution and on many other resolutions in the past.  On each occasion the Minister for Industry and Commerce has maintained that he is being libelled by the interpretation put upon his figures.  We now ask him how he wants the figures to be interpreted. When he has done that, we shall be in a position to tell him where and for what reason we have been misled by the figures which, he alleges, are at present misleading us.  The second question that arises on this reference is in regard to the 40 per cent. which is being placed on covers of pots, pans and kettles.  The metal cover of a pot <Col N="953" /> made of cast iron or one of the other materials mentioned in this resolution, and carrying a duty of 40 per cent., may become more expensive than a similar cover made from blocked tin. Has the Minister considered that aspect of the question?  Most pots can be used with a metal cover which has been tinned or with a cover made out of blocked tin.  The terms of this resolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Have nothing to do with tin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They exclude tin.  If a situation arises in which the metal cover, carrying 40 per cent. tariff, is more expensive than the blocked tin cover, the effect of this tariff will be to make people pay far more for the cover of a pot than they paid heretofore, without conferring any benefit whatever on the foundries which are supposed to be producing these articles in Saorstát Eireann.  Of course, the Minister has not thought of that question, and, of course, he knows nothing about it.  But he ought to think about it now.</P>
      <P>I now come to the third question with which I want to deal.  I raised the question of the Allied Iron Founders on the last reference.  The Minister replied that, if the Allied Iron Founders could capture all this trade, the ordinary rules of competition would have to apply.  I want to know from the Minister if there is to be a catch-as-catch-can agreement between the Hammond Lane Foundry, in Dublin, and the Allied Iron Founders, in Waterford, to smash all the independent foundries and then divide up the market for cast-iron goods in this country between them on their own terms.  The Minister has said, in connection with the pottery industry, that he approves of an arrangement of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said quite the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he feels that, when firms are gradually spreading themselves to capacity to cover all the requirements of the country in a given line of merchandise, it is prudent that any two firms in the trade should divide up the trade between them and <Col N="954" /> specialise in several branches, so that eventually the position may be reached in which firm A will be producing the country's requirements in five or six commodities belonging to a certain category, and firm B will be producing all the country's requirements in the other six commodities included in that category.  The Minister says that when that stage is arrived at these firms can proceed to overlap one another and to compete against one another in all the other products, but is there any probability that that will happen?  I would ask Deputies to remember that the smaller foundries in the country largely produce by manual labour.  They do not use modern machinery; they have never been designed to replace manpower by machines and have always preferred craftsmanship.  The new foundries, as the Minister explained to us, are equipped with the most modern machinery and are designed to produce everything with the least possible expenditure on labour.  Are we going to be confronted with a situation in two or three years in which all the independent foundries are wiped out of existence&mdash;the foundries in Sligo, in which, no doubt, Deputy Frazer Browne is interested, and the foundries in Cork, on which perhaps Deputy T. J. Murphy will have a word to say&mdash; by a combination of the Hammond Lane Foundry and Allied Iron Founders, and the consumers of this country being left to the tender mercies of these two combines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have some experience of the proceedings of the Prices Commission in regard to these classes of goods.  A situation developed in which the Prices Commission was moved by the Minister. They had the representatives of the Hammond Lane Foundry before them, and some pretty strong comments were passed at a public session of the Commission.  I think that at one juncture a prominent official of the Hammond Lane Foundry was asked by Senator Johnson, who was a member of the Commission, if he did not think that £1,500 a year was adequate remuneration for his services, to which that official replied: &ldquo;How do you expect me to live on £1,500 a year?&rdquo; If the people of this country are going to provide capital bonuses, bonuses for <Col N="955" /> the directors and salaries of £1,500 a year for somebody who thinks that is a very poor wage for him out of the pots and kettles and covers, I think the House should sit up and take notice, because I do not think the people who use cast-iron pots and covers for such commodities ought to be asked to provide profits and salaries on these scales and, mind you, to bear a tariff of 40 per cent. in order to provide such profits and salaries.  No one in the House will pretend that a tariff of 40 per cent. is necessary unless the producers of these goods are going to ask 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. more than these goods would cost if they were imported.</P>
    <P>If an industry can be set up in this country which is going to provide employment for men who would otherwise be idle, at fair wages and at reasonable cost to the community, no Party in this House will make any difficulty about taking such steps as may be necessary to establish it; but if we are asked to put on 40 per cent. with a view to handing over the consuming public of this country to the tender mercies of the Hammond Lane Foundry and Allied Iron Founders, I think we ought to pause, and Deputies who represent those constituencies in which independent iron founders are going to be put out of existence ought to have the courage to say what they think of the proposals at present before them.  I have no doubt that Deputy Frazer Browne was approached by some of the iron founders in his constituency. Would he not tell us now what their view was?  Deputy T.J. Murphy must have heard something from the representatives of the Cork iron foundries who came to this House seeking an interview with the Minister. He will be better able than any of us to tell the House what their representations were, but surely, when we come to consider these tariffs, we ought at least to hear what these independent employers, who built up their businesses without any tariff at all, have to say and how their interests are likely to be affected by the proposals which the Minister has put before us now.  Perhaps the <Col N="956" /> Minister would tell us if he ever saw that deputation.</P>

There is another matter on which I am not quite clear.  Under the heading &ldquo;Special Provisions&rdquo; there is this note: &ldquo;The duty mentioned at this reference number shall not be charged or levied on any article which is made from paper chargeable with the said duty.&rdquo;  I do not understand what that applies to or what is the exact meaning of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This reference imposes a duty upon packing and wrapping papers.  There are certain classes of wrapping papers manufactured in the Saorstát at present, particularly the class of paper known as common brown wrapping paper, which is manufactured by two or three mills all situated in the County of Dublin. The main development, however, which is responsible for the imposition of this duty, is the formation of a company for the reopening of the Clondalkin paper mills, where classes of packing and wrapping paper of the kinds to which the duty applies will be made, including kraft paper and imitation krafts.  The development of the industry at Clondalkin will give substantial employment.  It is contemplated that the price at which the paper will be sold will not exceed the British prices for similar papers by more than 10 per cent.  That is the outside limit beyond which the price cannot rise.  In fact it is contemplated that the cost of production here will not exceed the cost of production in Great Britain, and that the price here will be similar to the price in Great Britain.  There are certain costs here which may prove to be higher.  The enterprise on which the company is engaged is a big one, involving substantial capital investment, and it will be some time before the necessary work will be finished to enable production to begin.  In the meantime, where necessary, licences will be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paragraph in the fourth column <Col N="958" /> of the schedule to which Deputy Dockrell referred is designed to show that the duty will not be charged on &ldquo;any article which is made from paper chargeable with the said duty, nor on any paper which is at importation used as packing or wrapping for another article.&rdquo;  Articles will not be dutiable merely because they are made from such a class of paper.  That provision in the schedule excludes from the scope of the duty paper used for wrapping other articles. The items (a), (b), (c), (d), etc., in column 2, are classes of paper which are exempted from the duty.</P>

This is one of the most oppressive tariffs that has been put on for a long time by this Government. I have already directed the attention of the House to the reaction which this or an analogous duty has had on the price of flannelette.  I have reason to believe that licences were given to certain persons to import free of duty flannelette, while these licences were refused to other persons.  The Minister says that the only persons given licences to import flannelette were boot manufacturers who wanted it for the purpose of lining boots.

How many boots would be lined by £435 worth of flannelette at 7d. per yard?  Surely that would line a good many boots.  I wonder how many flannelette-lined boots are sold in this country?</P>

I am principally concerned to direct the attention of the House to the repercussions of the duty on cotton piece goods.  First, it is sought to reconcile the country to this duty by announcing that we are going to establish a factory at Athlone, to be known as Cotton Textiles, Limited.  This factory is to cover so many acres of ground, and the impression has been circulated that it will employ almost half the population of Westmeath.  We are told it will produce cotton goods which will rival the most luxurious products of America and other countries where cotton piece goods are manufactured.</P>

      <P>It was imposed nominally to protect these items.  It was then extended to operate on shirtings for revenue purposes.  Later the operation of this tariff was extended to flannelette.  Now every cotton textile, except a cotton textile with a pattern printed on it, is liable to the duty.  So far as I can find out, this reference No. 35 now includes printed goods, and it is rather difficult to elucidate the exact meaning of the tariff, because there are one and a half columns of qualifications.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="962" /> could help us by saying whether this now extends to cotton goods with a pattern printed on them?</P>

      <P>They are still excepted. I say that to impose this duty on flannelette is to put a very unjustifiable burden on the poor.  By the poor I do not mean those who do not want to work, the fellow who is not working and who will not work.  When I refer to the poor, I mean the people who want to work, but who are not able to get a job, or the poor who are working night and day and who are poor all the same.  They are the people who have my sympathy, and they are the people who buy flannelette.  Flannelette is sold at 6d., 8d., 10d. or 1/- a yard. These are, I suppose, trade secrets, but it is no harm to let the House know that 6d. flannelette costs 4?d.; 8d. flannelette would cost 5?d. to 6d.; 10d. flannelette would cost 7¼d. to 7?d. and 1/- flannelette costs anything from 8?d. to 9¾d.  You are going to put on a duty of 33?per cent.  In those circumstances the flannelette that used to cost 4?d. is now going to cost 6¼d., and when it costs that to the shopkeeper, it is going to cost the consumer 8d. That means you are going to increase the price of a garment such as the ordinary country-woman buys by about 7d.  The usual requirements for the manufacture of a garment made out of this material is 3½ yards, and that means that the average country-woman who buys material for garments for herself or her children is going to pay the Government 7d. on each article of clothing, the material for which she purchases.  I say that it is a very unjustifiable burden to put upon the people.  The country woman may avoid that by putting her children or herself in an inferior cloth as compared with that which she was in the habit of using.  She therefore buys the cheapest flannelette, and she gives 7d. per garment to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to longcloth, union and sheeting.  Sheeting is being made in this country, and the position is extremely difficult, because the interest of the consuming public conflicts with the legitimate interest of a perfectly <Col N="963" /> honourable firm.  So far as I am aware, there is only one firm making sheeting in this country.  I do not think they want to make it.  I think they would be much better pleased if their looms were left free to manufacture something else.  They have a long industrial tradition in this country, a tradition for making good stuff, not only for consumption here, but they have captured a very considerable foreign market by giving good value in everything they have produced.  It is perfectly true to say they can produce sheeting at 8?d., but it is equally true to say that if you compare the sheeting they are able to produce with what can be produced from the enormous mills in America and in Great Britain, it is quite impossible for the Irish enterprise to compete in value at all, with the result that the country-woman who buys 5 yds. of sheeting to make a pair of sheets for the bed has now to be content with a pair of sheets that you can read the <i>Irish Independent</i> through.  She is not able to afford to pay for a better quality.  Heretofore she got a Manchester or American twill calico in her sheets.  Now she is restricted to the product of the one firm producing in this country.  The result is that, while she is paying out more money, she is getting an article not in any way comparable for value with what she got before.</P>
    <P>I say that the tariffs which bear upon the poor in this country in that way are not sound tariffs from the community point of view and cannot be justified in this House.  That disposes of three principal types of cotton cloth which are normally bought by the consumer. I want to refer now to a cotton cloth normally purchased and used by manufacturers, and that is the cotton webbing used in the manufacture of semi-stiff collars.  Sometimes one feels it is perfectly useless to ventilate these matters here, because a great many Deputies do not take any interest and a great many others do not know what one is talking about. There are about ten Deputies here considering this problem.  I think I will draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that there is not a quorum, <Col N="964" /> and perhaps we will get some of the Fianna Fáil T.D.'s in to listen to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is useful that members of the Fianna Fáil Party should come in here to hear a little of the ineptitude of the Minister, representing them.  The Minister has put on a duty on this fabric designed for the manufacture of semi-stiff collars. It is, also, designed for the lining of poplin shirts and collars which represent a very considerable part of the export trade of Irish manufactures. The result of the duty is that the cost of these poplin shirts has been so raised that Irish manufacturers are rapidly losing the trade they had abroad for these commodities.  There is no prospect of this fabric being manufactured in this country; nobody proposes to make it.  The only result of the tariff is to destroy the existing industry and to increase the cost of collars and shirts to the consuming public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I directed the attention of the House before to the fact that it is the common practice of the Government, at present, by the Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, to impose a heavy penalty on a number of products nominally with the intention of forwarding their manufacture in this country.  Included in the imposition of those duties are raw materials. Slingsby's ladders were brought in with one tariff and chased out with another.  Numbers of manufacturers are induced to invest their money in business here.  Some of these manufacturers believed that it was a good thing to make their contribution towards reducing the adverse trade balance against this country.  Their contribution was very badly needed when the adverse trade balance was greater than the amount of our export trade.  They developed their home trade.  They did not come in to scramble for an economic price because they captured a very good market in Great Britain and Northern Ireland <Col N="965" /> in competition with other manufacturers there.  Now these men who concentrated on the foreign market, and made a market for Irish export trade, find that they have been knocked out of that competition, not by anything they encountered in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but simply by the tariffs imposed on raw material coming in here.  We all know that the Minister, who is a glib but incompetent man, says he would be prepared to consider applications for a refund of any duty paid on cotton web which he was satisfied had been subsequently exported.  But how are we to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners of the exact square of cotton webbing hidden in a 56½ gross of silk cotton lining. Any practical person in the trade knows perfectly well it cannot be done. How are you to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners of the proportion of cotton web that is used in facing and put into collars and shirts?  In practice the collar manufacturer knows it cannot be done, with the result that the concession is perfectly worthless, and factories are closing down so far as their export business is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty whatever about exempting cotton webbing from this duty.  The Minister had, admittedly, a difficulty in regard to certain other fabrics which can be converted from the purpose for which they were primarily imported.  For instance, he did license a shirt manufacturer to bring in shirting free of duty.  Before very long it became clear that the shirting was being sold to retail traders.  So that concession was withdrawn.  Cotton webbing, however, is a material which cannot be sold retail because it cannot be used, or made up, except by special machines, and these special machines are in the hands only of collar manufacturers and shirt manufacturers.  So that even if the shirt manufacturer did import webbing nominally for the purpose of manufacture, and then sought to sell it, he would not find anyone who would buy it because it would not be any use to him.</P>
    <P>I have, by letter, asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give a general licence to shirt manufacturers <Col N="966" /> to import this commodity free of duty. Instead of examining that, the Minister made it the occasion of an attempt to hang round my neck an application for a special concession for an individual manufacturer at the cost of his rival.  I was obliged to repudiate that suggestion, and to remind the Minister that the methods of political blackmail do not pay.  I now wish to renew the suggestion that the manufacturers of collars and shirts, who built up this useful export trade, should be relieved of these burdens.  I urge upon the Minister that this duty of 33 1/3rd per cent. is going to be a very unfair burden upon those people, and that this is the time to give some indication of what he expects General Textiles to do in the town of Athlone.</P>
    <P>The resources of the State have been mustered, and great publicity has been given to the very formidable enterprise in Athlone.  I would like to ask what is this enterprise designed to supply the community with, and what burden will the community have to bear in order to maintain that enterprise?  `This duty is intended, no doubt, to subsidise something in connection with the future General Textiles.  In view of that, the Minister ought to tell us the full extent which he can see that that something was growing into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that this duty is not a new duty.  It is in operation since the beginning of 1934. The re-enactment of the duty in this form was necessary because of the successful evasion of the earlier duty.  The definitions that we used in the Resolution passed in 1934 were used for the purpose of defeating it. In fact, as Deputies are well aware, in certain English trade journals instructions were published as to how the Saorstát duty could be evaded. The sole effect of this duty is to recast the definition of the articles which it is intended should be liable to duty for the purpose of preventing these methods of evasion.  Having said that, I have said all.</P>

      <P>So far as flannelette is concerned, the greater portion of it imported is not subject to this duty at all.  Certain classes are subject to duty.  The only question that arose in connection with that flannelette was whether we should issue licences for its import prior to manufacture here.  It was decided for administrative reasons not to do that.  It was thought that it would be difficult to administer any system of licences fairly, and, as I informed the Deputy some weeks ago, it is contemplated that flannelette of Irish manufacture will be available in the very near future.  In the meantime licences are not being issued except to one restricted class of persons who require very small quantities of that class of cloth for boot manufacture.</P>
      <P>So far as sheetings are concerned, the type of sheeting through which you can read the <i>Irish Independent</i> or, more profitably, the <i>Irish Press</i> is not subject to duty.  Cloth which is less than four and a half ounces per square yard in weight is exempted.  The sheeting made subject to duty is manufactured here in excellent qualities. The Deputy reminded the House that a not inconsiderable export trade in that cloth is done by that firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of these Indian Brahmins are walking around in head-dresses manufactured in the Saorstát.  As far as webbing is concerned, I am not prepared to issue licences for the importation of webbing where it is intended to be used for the manufacture of goods for home consumption. I have informed the Deputy and made it known that I was prepared to consider the issuing of <Col N="968" /> licences for the importation of quantities of that cloth wherever evidence was produced that orders for export had been received and that the cloth was required for the purpose of fulfilling these orders.  But the difficulty of administering a general licence provision would be so great that it could not be considered.</P>
      <P>On the final question which the Deputy asked, namely, the intentions of the company establishing a cotton mill in Athlone, I can say that they propose to manufacture, in the main, classes of cotton cloth which are not liable to this duty.  This resolution only relates to certain definitions of cotton cloth, and other classes of cloth, such as linen and union cloth, which are manufactured here by other concerns. The classes of cloth which will be manufactured, in the main, at Athlone are those which are exempt from this duty.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is fully aware of the circumstances under which the duty was imposed.  Cloth, which it was intended should be subject to duty, was brought in free of duty by the process of raising the nap and describing it as flannelette.  Therefore, we had to make flannelette liable to duty earlier than we would have done so.  We would not have imposed a duty on flannelette until we were satisfied that production had commenced here and that supplies of Irish-made flannelette were made available. In order, however, to defeat the evasion of the main duty, it had to be extended to cover flannelette.  On the question of whether licences should be issued for the free importation of <Col N="970" /> flannelette we have decided against it on the ground that we are up to the stage at which the Irish-made article will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to have them dressed and dyed so that they will be mistaken for furs of much greater value.  The business in dressing and dyeing rabbit-skins in imitation of more expensive classes of furs is quite considerable, and arrangements have been made for the dressing and dyeing of the skins here.  It is for that reason that the duty is being imposed.  It is rather difficult to say to what extent those goods are imported at the present time, because they are not classified separately, but the total value of dressed skins and furs imported in 1935 was £61,000.  Some substantial part of that sum is represented by dressed and dyed rabbit-skins. A company is being formed, I understand, and arrangements are being made for the dressing and dyeing of the skins here.  Possibly other people will also engage in the business in due course.  The duty of 1/6 per skin which is being imposed will, I think, be sufficient to encourage people to engage in the business and to protect them in it.  The one firm to which I have referred hopes to use Saorstát rabbit-skins for some part of the business.  I understand that Saorstát rabbit-skins are not altogether suitable for the production of certain classes of imitation furs, but they can be used for other classes.  To the extent to which they can be used they will be used, and the intention is to ensure, if necessary, that they will be used. The amount of employment which will be given in the actual dressing and dyeing of skins will be between 30 and 40, but if the curing of Saorstát skins is undertaken, a large number will be employed.  I cannot give a precise figure for the additional employment which will be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first consideration which arises in this regard is, has the Minister made any estimate of what this will represent in additional cost on the raw materials of ready-made clothes and gloves?  Those rabbit-skins are principally used for fur-trimming&mdash;largely for the trimming of women's moderate-priced coats.  The Minister will also remember that it has been a cause of innumerable actions in London, Paris, New York, and many continental centres, where dermatitis has arisen from irritation caused by badly dyed rabbit-skins on ladies' coats.  Those two matters require attention.  Then the Minister, no doubt, is aware that Messrs. J. and N. Phillips, of Manchester, have established a little glove factory in Tipperary. Before this business was established in Tipperary, a glove retailer in this country searched the markets of Czecho-Slovakia, Italy, Germany, the United States and Great Britain, and he bought the cheapest gloves he could get in these markets and passed the benefit of his purchases on to the consuming public in Ireland. Now one manufacturer from Great Britain comes into Ireland and sets up a small glove factory in Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more than one glove factory engaged in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="973" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that may be so, but not that I am aware of.  In any case, however, one firm from Great Britain sets up a small glove factory in Tipperary, whereupon it becomes the patriotic duty of every glove vendor in this country to stop searching the markets of the world for the best and cheapest products of this particular branch of manufacture, and it becomes his patriotic duty to deal with one Manchester firm because they have established a branch factory in Tipperary. That is bad enough, even as it is, but I should like to know whether the Minister has asked manufacturers whether this rabbit business will interfere with their business and whether these rabbit-skins are extensively used in fur manufacturing.  A third point to be considered is that these skins are largely the product of special types of rabbits.  The rabbit which one catches in the hedgerows of this country is not of much use for the imitation fur business. The type of rabbit used in that business is primarily a cultivated rabbit&mdash;certain breeds of rabbits that have long coats.  It is quite true that the breeding of these rabbits could be stimulated in this country, but if all the rabbit-skins which are required are not being produced in this country, this duty of 6d. will have to be paid on every rabbit skin, no matter whether it is processed in this country or not, because the sub-head refers to any rabbit-skin which has been, before importation, dressed or cured and dyed.  Well, you cannot shift rabbit-skins about without dressing them.  If you did not dress them to a greater or less degree, they would walk away out of the bay.  They must be cured to a certain point before the final processes are applied.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, the Revenue Commissioners will be bound to interpret &ldquo;dressing,&rdquo; when it is not further defined, as any curing process.  Of course, mind you, it may be that an attempt will be made at this stage to differentiate between curing and dressing, but in practice what will happen is that the Revenue Commissioners will inform the Minister that it is administratively impossible to draw the line between these two processes, and that rabbit-skins which have been cured at all have been dressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> My last point is this: Suppose that this duty is developed for the purpose of developing the production of rabbits with suitable skins in this country. There is always the danger that, where you have a restricted market, such as we have here, for imitation fur, fur may go out of fashion for two or three years.  If you had access to markets all over the world, then if the market failed owing to a change of fashion in, say, London, you might be able to sell your products in Berlin; or if the market failed in Berlin, you could sell in Vienna and so on.  If, however, you are trading in only one country and producing rabbits for that trade, and if fur goes out of fashion for two or three years, you are &ldquo;busted.&rdquo;  I suggest that the Minister ought to take that aspect of the situation into consideration before determining on developing the production of these rabbits upon any large scale in this country.  Perhaps the most important point, however, is the question of what effect this imposition will have on the ready-made clothing business and on the glove business in this country.</P>

      <P>It is not anticipated that the imposition of this duty will have any effect whatever upon the glove manufacturing concern in Tipperary or any other glove manufacturing concern in this country.  Neither is it anticipated that it will increase the cost of ready-made clothing.  Rabbit-skins or any class of skin which are shaped and constitute part of a manufactured garment are already subject to a duty of 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>If Saorstát rabbit-skins are used, and cured, dressed and dyed here, there will possibly be some increase in price.  These rabbit-skins are produced and sold from some countries at the present time at very low prices, and, occasionally, advantageous purchases can be made.  The increase in price, however, will be of no consequence in relation to the cost of the garment in which these skins are used.  Cured rabbit-skins will not be liable to duty, and there will be no difficulty in distinguishing between a <Col N="975" /> skin that has been merely dried and cured and one which has been dressed.  In that connection, I think Deputy Dillon is a bit foolish to attempt to prognosticate the actions of the Revenue Commissioners in such matters.</P>

      <P>The effect of this Resolution is to impose a minimum duty of 1/6 a gross.  All classes of buttons defined in the Resolution are subject to a duty of 75 per cent. but we found that the <i>ad valorem</i> duty on articles of low value was not altogether effective.  It is necessary to supplement the duty on <Col N="976" /> buttons of this description by the minimum duty now proposed.  There are at present two firms manufacturing buttons in the Saorstát and others are likely to be established in the near future.  In respect to these classes of buttons there is no reason why they cannot be supplied satisfactorily from home sources.</P>

      <P>The Minister excludes &ldquo;buttons made wholly or mainly of wood, glass, stone, metal, leather, mother of pearl or an imitation of mother of pearl.&rdquo;  That leaves bone buttons or composition buttons.  Has the Minister any idea of the advance that has taken place in the price of composition buttons since the duty of 75 per cent. was put on?  Composition buttons are selling here at least 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. over the price at which they were selling before the duty. The ingredients here are laughable, and that the Minister could be deluded into telling this House that a duty of 1/6 per gross was designed to remove the inadequacy of the 75 per cent. tariff on composition buttons astonishes me.  The average fancy buttons brought in here for women's wear are in three sizes.  The very small ones are used for trimming clothes, the medium ones are ordinarily used on short coats, and the large ones on ladies' full-length coats.  What astonishes me is that the Minister, who was in the drapery trade for years, should evince such extraordinary ignorance of facts of which he must have been aware during his commercial career. Whether it is by design or for the purpose of fooling the House or diffidence I do not know.  The average price of composition buttons is from 18/- to 24/- a gross and a 75 per cent. tariff would add about 15/- to the cost.  How does the Minister suggest that a duty of 1/6 a gross is a more adequate protection than a duty of 75 per cent.?</P>

      <P>The tariff was considered necessary because of the circumstances of the industry abroad, where very strong organisations have been established.  In fact, rather considerable opposition on behalf of these organisations towards the idea of manufacturing these articles at all in the Saorstát became apparent, and it was considered that without effective <Col N="981" /> protection serious efforts would be made to put any concern engaging in the industry here out of business. Consequently it was considered desirable to impose a substantial duty while at the same time assuring consumers by alternative methods of price regulation.</P>

      <P>The facts of the case are that there is some kind of cartel in control of the manufacture of fibre cases.  There are only one or two sources of supply from which fibre can be obtained, and the cartel approached the producers of fibre and said: &ldquo;If you supply fibre to the factory at Portarlington we shall refuse to take any fibre from you.&rdquo;  Evidently, they succeeded in their efforts because eventually the Portarlington firm joined the cartel and, having joined the cartel, the cartel drew off its dogs and allowed them to get a supply of fibre.

      <P>Thirty-three one-third per cent. is the nominal duty, but then it goes on to provide for a duty of 1/- and 1/6 on cases of a certain size. The Minister admits that the duty of 1/- may represent anything from 33? to 50 per cent. on certain cases, and that the duty of 1/6 may represent anything from 50 per cent. to 70 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  What is the <Col N="982" /> necessity for a duty of that kind? Any duty that operates as a protection is adequate, because there is not going to be any dumping in this case. Dumping goods at less than the cost of production could be met by a total prohibition of imports.  Dumping has gone out of fashion.  It is no longer a menace, because it is recognised and met by every Government in the world.  A fair protective tariff may be justified in certain circumstances, but to withdraw the element of competition altogether seems to me to be inviting exploitation.  In that connection, it may be as well to face the facts, and I am going to say something now which may not be popular.  It is not only the manufacturer who tries to exploit consumers; it is very often the workers who are getting fair wages and enjoying fair conditions in an industry.  If there is an absolute prohibition of imports imposed, the workers will naturally go to the employer and say: &ldquo;Look here, we want our wages doubled.  Sock it on the consumer; he has no alternative but to pay.&rdquo;  As the Minister knows, that actually happened in the flour milling industry.

I suggest that no case can be made for putting a prohibitive tariff on fibre suit cases, because supplies of the raw material are now available to the producers, and the only effect of the tariff will be to eliminate all competition and to leave consumers at the mercy of the producers of this particular article.</P>

      <P>In this case it is sought to put a duty of 30 per cent. on articles and appliances intended to supply heat by means of the combustion of gas. There was a duty of 15 per cent., with 10 per cent. preference, on gas meters. The effective duty, I suppose, would be 10 per cent. on gas meters and appliances imported from Great Britain.  Here it is sought to increase the duty from 10 per cent. preference to 30 per cent.  I see in the latest issue of the Customs official import list a reference to 15 per cent. on gas meters and 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>This refers to heaters and cookers.  A duty at this rate was imposed on gas heaters and burners in 1933.  Subsequently, however, a point was raised about it.  It was contended, from the definition which <Col N="986" /> was used on that occasion, that the duty actually applied only to the burner, and not to the cooker or heater in which it was installed.  Consequently, we are changing the definition so as to make it clear that the duty applies to these heaters and cookers <i>in toto</i> when imported assembled.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that the point made by the Minister is, that because the 30 per cent. tariff has not, in fact, affected heaters and cookers since then, this is an attempt to make effective for the first time a tariff of 30 per cent. on gas meters and heaters, and on the parts that go to make them up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The duty was effective. These articles are assembled here by a number of concerns, but the contention was brought forward that the duty should apply only to the actual gas burner, and not to the apparatus in which the burner was installed.  It is because there is some doubt as to whether the existing definition is really adequate to give effect to the intention which existed in 1933, that the duty then imposed is being repealed and re-enacted here with a definition which indicates precisely the scope of the duty.</P>

      <P>This deals with the tariff on laces.  It is proposed to put a tax of 2/- a gross on laces imported in bulk, and on laces imported together with an article of personal clothing or wearing apparel, the tax is to be 3d. the lace.  I would like to hear from the Minister what has been the development in the manufacture of laces in this country.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By an Emergency Order, a duty of 100 per cent., or 2/- per gross, was imposed on certain classes of laces imported in bulk in November of last year.  The reason why a change was effected was because it became evident during the year that laces were being imported from certain countries at an extremely low price, with the result that the production of laces here was being impaired.  The import figures show that for the first nine months of 1935 dutiable laces amounting to 53,000 gross were so imported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mainly from Japan. The prices at which laces are being produced here is, I think satisfactory. A peculiarity about the business is this, that almost irrespective of the price at which laces are purchased they are sold at the same retail price.  At least, apart from a very obvious difference in quality, there is not much difference in the retail price.  The ordinary pair of laces is sold at the same price, whether purchased wholesale at one figure or another.  The partial manufacture of laces, as Deputies are aware, is proceeding at Ennis, and a fairly substantial amount of employment is being given in that town.  I think the number of persons employed there at present is between 70 and 80.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there are certain other processes carried on by the firm, but their principal line is the production of boot-laces.  They are still importing the braid of which the boot-laces are manufactured.  The production of the braid is the second stage of the development of the industry and it cannot be attempted until the total production has been brought up to the point at which installation of the necessary machinery and expenditure of capital for the purpose would be justified.  We are getting near that stage now.  In the situation existing in this trade, it was considered that a prohibitive duty should be imposed and this duty is intended to be prohibitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There has certainly been that increase in regard to particular numbers which they offer for sale. The Minister says that there are from 60 to 70 persons engaged in putting tags on boot-laces in Ennis.  That is very difficult to believe.  What the firm of L.J. Jordan and Co. are chiefly engaged in doing is putting tags on the boot-laces.  They take in the braid, cut it into suitable lengths, and put tags on it.  That is &ldquo;lace manufacture.&rdquo; They also finish elastic. They take in elastic in considerable quantities in a semi-finished condition and, probably, bleach it.  I find it hard to believe that there are 70 or 80 persons employed at that.  Are they men?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the existing duty on knitted fabric is 45 per cent., which was first imposed by the Finance Act of 1932 to encourage the manufacture of knitted fabric in the Saorstát.  Most of the <Col N="991" /> larger hosiery firms produce their own requirements of cotton fabric and, in addition, a number of firms are engaged in the making-up of garments from knitted fabric purchased by them. This fabric was imported but certain firms are now making fabric for sale to the making-up firms and it has been represented to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department is, apparently, satisfied, that the existing rate of duty is not sufficient to afford protection against foreign competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason that it is not.  Even though Saorstát fabric is purchased at competitive prices, as the cost of the commodity is comparatively small, it necessitates a fairly substantial duty to induce home firms to purchase their materials from the home manufacturers.  It is believed that the chief competition in cheap fabrics is from continental sources.  It is stated that these continental firms are prepared to cut prices in order to get over the tariff.  To safeguard the newly established industry against this undercutting, a fairly stiff tariff on the lines of that set out in the schedule to the Bill was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary but, of course, the Minister for Finance is frantically trying to read from his brief while not having the faintest notion of what he is talking about. There was some kind of factory started at the North Wall by people associated with the home-spun industry and the knitting business in Donegal for production of this cotton fabric which was principally made into men's cheap underwear and women's cheap underwear.  I am not sure whether or not that factory ever came to fruition, but I think it did.  The knitted fabric referred to in this reference is clearly knitted fabric used in the manufacture of fleecy underwear and cheap cotton underwear, the average retail price of which used to be from 1/- to 2/6 and is now from 2/- to 3/6. Personally, I think it is a very bad tariff.  I think that tariffs which make the clothing of the poor very much <Col N="992" /> more expensive than it was are bad tariffs.  The market for knitted fabric here is never going to be a considerable market, and it is only being purchased at very great expense to that section of the community least able to bear it.  There was one shop in this city which actually used to bring in up to 5,000 dozen of men's vests and under-drawers made of this knitted fabric.  They sold to the people in Gloucester Street, Gardiner Street and the slums of this city for 1/- a garment.  That same garment to-day costs 2/-.</P>

      <P>Whether dignified or undignified, it is irritating to hear a man who knows absolutely nothing about a subject talking about that subject.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take into consideration the fact that the poor purchase socks, cotton stockings and cotton underwear, you will find that this tariff imposes a burden of extraordinary dimensions upon their annual budget.  What often amazes me is that Deputies will cheerfully trot into the Lobby and vote for a tariff of this kind without ever weighing in their minds for a single moment who are going to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This business originally arose from the fact that we put a duty on for the purpose of excluding Japanese competition. <Col N="993" /> This 1/- garment to which I have referred was, of course, a Japanese garment, so we put a duty on all cotton underwear to prevent Japanese competition. A great deal of this cotton underwear, in fact, came from Holland. Most of the stuff sold at about 2/- or 2/6 came from Holland; most of the stuff sold for 1/- came from Japan; and most of the stuff sold between 1/- and 2/- came from Great Britain.  When we put on these duties it was discovered that Irish manufacturers were importing this knitted fabric and sewing it up on machines.  Then this firm undertook to make the fabric at the North Wall, so far as I am aware, and now we have a duty of 60 per cent. on the knitted fabric, so that not only are we to have the duty which originally excluded Japanese underwear, but we are going to have a duty on the raw materials of the industry which is being set up here.  What the cumulative effect of that is going to be on the purse of the poor, I do not know, but, in my personal experience, the garment which used to be available to the poor for 1/- is now retailing from 1/9 to 2/-, according to where it is sold.  The garment that used to sell for 2/- is selling for 3/-, and the garment that used to sell for 2/6 is selling for 3/6.  I do not think a tariff of that kind is defensible, but I am aware the Fianna Fáil Party does, and that is just the fundamental difference between us.  There is no use asking the Minister any question as to why they fixed on 60 per cent., or why it is necessary.  He does not know, and we might as well face it, but it is right that the House should know what it is doing.</P>

He will start to prove, as he did in the case of the last item, that an extensive raw material upon which a comparatively small protective duty has been imposed will increase the cost of the article by over 100 per cent.

      <P>The Minister is an exponent of Irish industry and he described the knitting yarn industry as a new industry that has been established in this country.  They were making knitting yarn in Blarney before the Minister was born. Deputy Miss Pearse could tell him that.  There was no one who ever held a needle in his or her hands who does not know the difference between good and bad wool.  If the Minister thinks that the manufacture of knitting yarns in Blarney is a feather in the Fianna Fáil cap it is time he woke up.  They were making knitting yarns in Blarney before the name of de Valera was heard of in this country and they will be making it there long after that name is forgotten.  The important thing at the moment is what exactly does reference No. 43 do?  Does it raise the tariff or does it lower it or alter it in any way? Why are we asked to pass this item at all?  I should like to hear from the Minister is it his purpose to increase the tariff or to reduce it?  It is rather difficult to discuss the resolution when we do not know what its terms are.</P>

      <P>I was saying that the purpose of the duty is to safeguard the new tyre manufacturing industry which has been established in Cork from an undesirable form of competition which has recently sprung up in the re-manufacture and retreading of second hand tyres.  When the new manufacturing licence under the Control of Imports Act was granted to the Irish Dunlop Company for the manufacture and repair of tyres there was an understanding that so far as possible the full market for tyres in the Saorstát would be reserved to the firm of Dunlop.  It was recognised at the time that the Saorstát was not sufficiently <Col N="998" /> large to accommodate more than one tyre manufacturing company. Since then there has sprung up a practice which unless dealt with early might have led to a development rendering the manufacture of tyres in the new factory uneconomic.  Until at least such time as the industry is firmly established and our market capable of supporting that firm, it is considered that nothing should be allowed which would jeopardise the success of that undertaking.  I think most people have been gratified that the Dunlop tyre has come back to the country in which it was first invented. Our job is to make sure that the new industry will be allowed to develop and expand until it will be able to disregard such competition as would otherwise have arisen if this tariff were not imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest principle laid down by the Government is that in order to promote the manufacture of boots in Ireland, you must wear out your boots and there must be no attempt at mending or repairing them; and when the tread wears off your tyres you must buy new ones&mdash;not attempt to retread the tyres&mdash;in order to keep the rubber factory operating in Cork.  We have now come to that position that you cannot get your tyre repaired.  This is the astonishing extravagance into which this country has been driven by the folly of the Government in their economic policy.  The Minister suggests to-day that the repairing and the retreading business has assumed such immense proportions that it is necessary to prohibit it.  I take it, if that principle is admitted, we come to the position that if the ready-made clothing manufacturers warn the Government that they find the spinsters are retreading and repairing the ready-made clothes when they become partly worn, the Minister will prohibit that.  The Minister has warned us that the Dunlop Company is in jeopardy owing to the practice which he tells us has grown up of retreading and repairing tyres.  I have had placed in my hands correspondence which was conducted in the last few weeks by a citizen with the Department. That citizen asked the Department <Col N="999" /> for permission to send his partly-worn tyres to England to have them retyred and reimported.  He expressed his readiness to get the work done in Cork if the Dunlop Company would undertake it.  Failing that he asked leave to send his tyres for rethreading to Great Britain.  He was informed by the Minister that there was no machinery by which a citizen of the State could send his tyres out of the country for repair and have them brought back.  The position now is that a citizen cannot get his tyres retreaded. How then does it happen that the Minister tells us that the practice of sending tyres out of the country for the purpose of having them retreaded is assuming such proportions that it was jeopardising the success of the Dunlop Company, while at the same time we have the fact that an individual citizen cannot get leave to have even four tyres retreaded?  There seems to be some inconsistency there.  I think the Minister ought to explain to us how that arises.  Secondly, I would like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to explain the reason underlying the decision which prevents a set of tyres being retyred.  Is that to be elaborated in due course into a rule that you cannot get a sole put on your shoe or a patch on your coat?</P>

      <P>The Dunlop enterprise in Cork is not in jeopardy at present, but it might be jeopardised, its economic working might be upset, if this practice of remoulding tyres was to extend very considerably.  A very small capital investment, and a very small amount of employment in a small enterprise would effect a substantial remoulding of old tyres by this new process, and it was feared that if that development were allowed to take place indiscriminately over the country, not merely would it be detrimental to the employment position, but it might jeopardise the economic working of the Cork plant, the plans of which are based on a certain output of tyres per year.  We are desirous that this service should be available to the people here, and the arrangement is that it will be made available by the Dunlop Company. We have intimated to the Dunlop Company that this duty which is imposed on the strip will be reconsidered at the end of a short period in the light of the actual service they are giving to the people of the country, both from the point of view of the facilities available and the cost entailed. <Col N="1001" /> Nothing has happened yet which would justify us in saying that the Dunlop enterprise in Cork has been jeopardised; but there was a danger that this particular development might take place upon a large scale to the detriment of that enterprise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the Schedule, Part I, in columns 2 and 4, to delete the figures &ldquo;18s. 8d.&rdquo; in each case in which they occur, and substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;11s. 8d.&rdquo; and to make consequential amendments elsewhere in Part I of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to reduce by ¾d. the duty upon sugar.  When dealing with the question of the taxation of sugar we are dealing with a tax that has already been very strongly dealt with by the Minister for Finance.  In June, 1931, when £750,000 had to be provided for the relief of rates on agricultural land, an increase of a ½d. was put on sugar.  The Minister for Finance who was then in Opposition here, dealt with that situation.  His speech upon the <Col N="1006" /> subject will be found in volume 39, column 996, of the Official Debates. In that speech he proposed to consider the matter in the case of the small farmer and agricultural labourer, and indicated how a ½d. per pound tax on sugar would hit households of people like them.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I propose to take the average income of the small farmer or agricultural labourer as ranging from 27/- to 30/- per week.  I know that there are a large number of agricultural labourers getting nothing like 27/- a week.  Some of them are getting as low as 18/- a week.  I think 25/- a week is the figure in many districts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Government has brought about the situation here which shows that the wages of agricultural labourers are far below 27/- and 30/- or even 25/- a week.  In these circumstances he considered that the imposition of a ½d. on a pound of sugar in these households is equivalent to a tax of 2¼d. per week, or 9/9 per year.  He dilated very strongly upon the position which would be created for people like small farmers and agricultural labourers paying this tax of a ½d.</P>
    <P>Since that time the Minister himself has added ¾d. to the high taxation, which he considered was then imposed on sugar.  He proposes, in his Financial Resolutions this year, to take off one of these farthings, but he leaves the ½d. on.  I want to point out to the Minister, and the House, the mess the Government has made of this sugar business, from the point of view of the consumer of sugar throughout the country and the taxpayer.  The ½d. that is left on as compared with what the situation was in 1931 is reflected in the price charged for sugar to-day and the price charged then. The increase to the purchasers of a ½d. on the pound of sugar means an expenditure over the counter, by those buying sugar, to the extent of £555,000, assuming that the consumption is 104,000 tons per year.  But between 1931 and 1935 the official figures indicate to us that the import price of sugar into the country had fallen from 9/8 to 7/6 per cwt.  That is equivalent to a fall of one-fifth of a penny.  So that in fact if the taxation situation <Col N="1007" /> was relieved to the extent of the additional ½d. that the Government are now leaving on sugar, even at 1931 prices, people would be getting their 104,000 tons worth of sugar at £225,000 less than they are having to pay, relative to the import price of sugar.  So that between the extra ½d. and the one-fifth of a penny that they would expect to save on their expenditure on sugar, when they take into consideration the value of world prices of sugar, there is paid £780,000 more for sugar than they would have to pay if the 1931 position obtained.  But not only are the people paying £780,000 unnecessarily more for sugar, but the taxpayer is called upon to pay nearly £700,000 additional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional! Will the Deputy show how he works that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in 1931-32 putting it at the rate the taxpayer had to pay the revenue got £1,426,000. The revenue got in £1,426,000 when the Customs duty on sugar was a ½d. less than people are asked to pay to-day. Now, when they are paying a substantial increase, because of the extra ½d., as well as losing £225,000, because they are denied the advantage of the world fall in the price of sugar, the Minister is only expecting to get £712,000 into the revenue, and the additional £714,000 fall to the revenue from sugar, at the rate that was paid in 1931, has now to be found from the taxpayers' pockets.  So that one aspect of the Minister's mess is that the people have to pay £1,450,000, when we take into consideration the assistance given to the sugar beet industry in the past and make allowance for that, additional over the counter to meet the additional tax, because they are denied the advantage of the world fall in the price of sugar, and something like £700,000 in additional taxation found by other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the position that farmers are getting substantially less per acre for the beet they are growing than in 1931.  Nationally we have the position that in Leinster, out of 18,079 acres of beet grown, 13,357 is the acreage substituted for turnips and mangolds; <Col N="1008" /> and in Connacht out of 13,427 acres of beet, 12,178 is the acreage substituted for potatoes, turnips and mangolds. That is why I say that the Government by their policy have made a mess of the sugar business, and why the House should not tolerate the imposition of a customs duty on sugar to the extent that the Minister is asking, when we take into consideration the unnecessary amount of money that is being paid by the people over the counter and in additional taxation, even if additional benefits over the 1931 period were being spread through the country to the farmers.  As I say, in Leinster farmers are getting substantially less for their beet than in 1931, when the people were paying less in sugar taxation than they are to-day, and the Exchequer was getting substantially more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a factory, which existed merely as an exhibit of the limitations which our predecessors were prepared to impose upon agricultural and industrial development in the country, and which cost the taxpayers £390,000 per year, could scarcely be described as anything else except a white elephant.  It became quite a different proposition when we purchased it as a going concern, lock, stock and barrel, for a trifle over what the subsidy amounted to in the year 1931-'32, and when we reorganised it in conjunction with the other factories upon a basis that, at any rate, has resulted in giving to our farmers, to their sons, and to the inhabitants of the smaller towns in the country a very useful and profitable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to hear what really was behind the motion moved by Deputy Mulcahy.  Apparently, he put it down in order that the Minister might talk about sugar.  I examined the sugar position very fully in my Budget statement. <Col N="1010" /> If the Deputy really intended that there should be a serious discussion on this matter, he would at least have endeavoured to refute the arguments which I put forward in that statement in justification of the step which we took in purchasing that factory, reorganising it, and running it in conjunction with three other new factories, in order, as far as we possibly could, to meet all our needs for sugar.  Of course, the Deputy in this, as in other matters, like all his colleagues in the Opposition, likes to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I took the precaution to bring with me Volume 49 of the Dáil Debates, and there, between columns 378 and 1,251, any Deputy or person interested can read the whole history of the Sugar Manufacture Bill, 1933.  If he has been at all impressed by anything which Deputy Mulcahy said here this evening, and does consult this volume, I am sure that as well as being impressed he will also be astonished.  He will find there that, with the exception of one division which was taken upon a purely obstructive amendment on the Committee Stage, the then Opposition, including Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon, did not once divide on this proposal to extend the sugar manufacturing industry in the Saorstát.  The Second Stage of the Bill went through without a division, as did also the Report Stage and the Fifth Stage.  In the course of the discussion the House was informed that if this project was undertaken, an increase in the price of sugar was inevitable. It was pointed out that that was the price we would have to pay in order to retain in this country the £800,000 which we were sending out each year to purchase foreign manufactured sugar.</P>

      <P>We know that temperamentally Deputy Dillon is always to be found with the thick headed minority. If the Deputy is going, as it were, to get out of step with the rest of public opinion, and to believe that there always was work for the people who are now being employed in the sugar factories&mdash;although, according to Deputy Morrissey's speech on the general resolution, even in the year 1926 there were at least 76,000 persons unemployed in this country&mdash;if he, contrary to what again is the popular belief, thinks that in the past Irish fields were employed in the way which was most beneficial to the community, even though the fact that in the past they had been allowed to remain in pasture had manifested its ill consequences in a declining population over three generations, then as I say, we would have to argue the matter on a different plane.  That is a plane upon <Col N="1012" /> which I do not propose to place myself, because it is an entirely irrational one.  I do not think Deputy Dillon will find a supporter for his side of the controversy outside the walls of bedlam.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the inhabitants of our small towns, Thurles, Tuam, Mallow and Carlow, would be unemployed if those factories were not there, when by erecting those factories and encouraging our farmers to grow sugar beet we saved £800,000 for this community, then the proposition is an economically sound one.  Those are the facts which underlie this undertaking, and in the year 1933, when the Bill to give the Government power to establish those new factories was before the Dáil, it was because even Deputy Dillon could not close his eyes to those facts that this Bill went through the Dáil without a division being challenged on any stage of it, except as I said, on an entirely unimportant and wholly obstructive amendment which was put down by Deputy MacDermot on the Committee Stage. Of course, the Bill having gone through, the Opposition were able to go through the country and say: &ldquo;Oh yes; we were in accord with Government policy in that regard.  We agreed with them that the factories ought to be established.&rdquo;  Does Deputy Dillon deny that he agreed?  Deputy Dillon, in the year 1933, did not talk about this being misuse of Irish fields.  He was quite in favour of it.</P>

If they had carried that Resolution, and if the Government had adopted it, we would have Deputy Mulcahy coming into the House to-day to tell us how very much dearer sugar was because the Government had compelled the sugar factories to use turf entirely in the generation of steam.  That would have been the argument if that had been the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are some yarns that ought to be taxed, and there are some very big ones.  We have just listened to a few from Deputy Mulcahy, and I am showing that they are so thin that one can see through them, because the Deputy who has been complaining about the price of sugar to-day is the Deputy who, with full knowledge that sugar would be dearer if we established these three new factories, did not vote against the increase in the cost of sugar.  However, as I have said, they do like to have it both ways in the Opposition, and so the Deputy comes in here to-day and complains about the price.  The Deputy referred to the price the farmers were getting for their beet.  When this Bill was going through, on the Second Stage, I made it clear that the figures for the cost of production which I gave to the Dáil were based upon a price of 35/- per ton for beet with a sugar content of 17½ per cent.  The price which is now being paid for beet is 37/6 per ton &mdash;a flat rate, without any advertence to the sugar content.  In other words, the price is up by 2/6 a ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is less than what we calculated upon for the past two years.  It has been slightly less than the figure which was taken as the basis of our calculation.  In any event, the position is that in 1933 Deputy Mulcahy was willing to submit to an increase in the price of sugar of ½d. or ¾d. per lb., concomitant with a price of 35/- a ton for beet with a sugar content of 17½ per cent., whereas the price <Col N="1015" /> which is being paid by the factories for beet now is 2/6 more than that per ton &mdash;37/6&mdash;and the difference in the price of sugar is approximately ¾d. per lb. more, which was the increase we indicated <Col N="1016" /> when the Bill was going through the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a remarkable Resolution in many ways, and I am surprised that it has not been given heavier type, because it is the biggest duty that has ever been imposed by this Assembly.  Several remarkable things struck me about this duty.  The first is that nobody ever heard of glass being sold by weight.  We have all heard of a pound of butter and a pound of tea but I do not think any of us ever heard of a pound of glass.  That does not figure on the manufacturers' invoice.  I am interested to know why there was recourse to this method of regulating the duty.  I was wrong in saying that glass is never sold by weight as, when it is broken, it is sold by the ton as &ldquo;cullet.&rdquo;  I do not think any Deputy ever heard of an invoice for 2 lbs. weight of glass for a window. In fact, if he did, he might also hear that the 2 lbs. did not reach to the <Col N="1017" /> top to keep out the draught.  The size of the duties by percentage increase range from 39.83 per cent. to 500.75 per cent.  What is the meaning of putting a percentage increase of 500 per cent. on glass?  The Minister may say: &ldquo;We have only put these duties on; we do not intend that they shall be ever collected.  A company is going to manufacture all sorts and sizes of glass here, and until then licences will be issued.&rdquo;  In any case, I contend that duties of this size should not be put on, even if there was not the slightest intention of ever collecting them, or that the public will ever have to pay them, because they have a disturbing effect on the public mind.</P>
      <P>I should like also to bring to the Minister's attention that not only is the company supposed to be going to make polished glass, plate glass, silvered glass, rolled glass, and figured glass, but they are also going to engage in various other operations.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is true that they are also going to silver, bevel and work the glass.  It seems an extraordinary proceeding, if that be true, that the company that has the fixing of the price at which that glass is to be sold to people who are going to work or silver that glass, are also going to engage in that work themselves. We have heard a lot of talk about people being put out of business in certain industries, but if this company does not want other people to continue in business it would not be very hard to prevent their continuing any kind of business that the company does not desire.  I hope the Minister will be able to answer that question. It has been customary in this House to act on the principle that persons who are engaged in manufacture, or what is equivalent to manufacture, namely the subjecting of materials to any process, should get their raw materials at the cheapest price and that the heaviest duties should be reserved for the finished article, in this case wrought or silvered glass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the example of ¼ inch silvered and bevelled polished plate on which the percentage increase is 119.72 per cent., whereas the rolled and rough cast stock sizes, which are <Col N="1018" /> absolutely raw materials, come in at the following percentage charges for duty, as compared with the glass charges&mdash;309.31, 354.51, 487.03, and 500.75 per cent.  I submit to the Minister that there is absolutely no justification for imposing these duties, even though he never intends to collect them.  Further, I should like to point out to him that the heaviest duties should be put on the finished articles and the lightest on those commodities which are raw materials which will be worked in this country.  I should also like the Minister in his reply to deal with the question of the company's engaging in silvering and working glass when they are in turn fixing the price of the raw material for people who are also doing that work and who are going to sell the finished article to the public.  I would ask the Minister to deal with these matters as fully as he can in his reply.</P>

      <P>The company which is engaging in the production of this glass will manufacture all the classes of glass which are being made subject to the duty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The intention is that these rates of duty should not be paid.  In so far as this glass is not available from within the country, licences for its free importation will be issued.  It is contemplated that all these classes of glass will be available from home sources as and from some date in the month of July.  This industry is being established by the Irish Glass Bottle Company at Ringsend, the capital of the company having been increased for the purpose of enabling them to extend their operations in this way.  They are putting up a factory at Ringsend which will have a capacity in excess of the requirements of the country.  The company have hopes of developing an export trade in certain classes of plate and sheet glass, and they are building a factory the capacity of which will be roughly 50 per cent. in excess of the total requirements of the country.  The factory will, of course, be a very modern factory, equipped on the most up-to-date lines and will be able to produce glass very efficiently, but it is necessary nevertheless to have substantial rates of duty because of the manner in which this industry is carried on or may be carried on by certain concerns in Continental countries.  So far as these concerns may desire to retain an export market here for themselves, they are in a position to quote substantially lower prices for their export trade than would be remunerative on their own home markets.  There is a prospect that that might happen in relation to the market here.  It is however contemplated that glass will be available at or about the price at which it is available at the moment. Under no circumstances would the increase in price be more than 10 per cent.  It is in fact anticipated that no increase in price will be occasioned unless it should happen that there are charges or costs here which are in excess of those experienced in other countries, but I do not think that is likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of the duty is not, of course, <Col N="1020" /> any indication of the price that will be charged as, in relation to an enterprise of this kind, where there is only one firm actually engaged in the business, it is necessary to have a definite understanding regarding the price to be charged here.  If the price should rise over and above what we would consider reasonable in the circumstances, then the question of the imposition of the duty would have to be reconsidered. The industry is an important one.  It is one well worth developing and it has been undertaken by a company who have made a success of their existing enterprise and have shown that they are possessed of a very high degree of technical skill in the glass-working industry.  I have no doubt that this new enterprise of theirs will be as successful as their glass bottle enterprise.  I have mentioned that they have hopes of developing an export trade in sheet and plate glass.  I am sure all Deputies will join with me in hoping that their anticipations in that regard will be realised.  The development of an export trade in highly manufactured goods of this description would be of considerable benefit.  In so far as no Irish made plate or sheet glass will be available for some weeks to come, we are at the present time issuing licences to all firms engaged in the importation of this commodity to bring in their ordinary requirements free of these duties.  As it will probably be some time after the factory gets into production before a full range of products in adequate quantities will be available, licences for importation will continue to be issued when it is evident that supplies from the Saorstát company cannot be secured.  The number of workers which may be engaged in this industry will be somewhere between 80 and 100.  It will, of course, give very suitable employment to male workers of a fairly highly paid character, and that number will be increased if the anticipations of the company concerning an export trade are realised.</P>

They propose to do all the processes of manufacture from the raw materials up.  No doubt they will make arrangements to supply firms doing any other process of manufacture in the country with whatever materials they require, in whatever state they require them. It is to be anticipated that there will be no interference with those other concerns that may be doing partial manufacturing processes in the case of glass at the present time.</P>

      <P>On this matter, I think the Minister was more indefinite than he usually is.  The Minister spoke of an agreement with this company as regards price.  He spoke of the products of this company, but his statement as regards price was much less definite than that which he made earlier in the case of tennis balls. He spoke of the price that he would think reasonable, and of other countries which produced glass in large quantities for their internal use.  The gist of his argument was that that enabled them to put a quantity of glass on what is to them a foreign market at a lower price than the cost of production. Is that happening here as regards plate glass at present?</P>

It will not merely manufacture ordinary plate glass, but it will also do the silvering, bevelling and so on.  As Deputy Dockrell has pointed out, there are other firms in the country engaged in that particular business.  They will now have to get their plate glass from this firm.  The question is, will they be in a position to compete with this firm in view of the fact that they will have to get their raw materials from it?  They will have to compete with this firm in this market for a finished class of work&mdash;bevelling and silvering&mdash;but as this is the only firm that can supply them with the raw materials what chance will they have of carrying on under such conditions?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 46:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete reference No. 4 and all relevant references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the provision in reference No. 4 is to increase from 33? per cent. to 75 per cent. the rate of duty on flock which, I take it, is a raw material for a number of industries.  I should <Col N="1026" /> like to ascertain from the Minister what industries will be affected in this particular way, and what is the idea behind the increase in duty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in duty is intended to turn the demand more definitely to Irish-produced flock.  Flock is used almost exclusively in the manufacture of mattresses and upholstery.  It is produced by teasing wool cloths, and it is produced in this country.  It is only used in certain classes of mattresses and upholstery work, the principal material used for that purpose being fibre.  There is no reason why we should import flock, and, now that the production of flock has developed here, it is thought that we should shut out imports altogether.  I think that the flock produced here has been found quite satisfactory in quality and price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what amount of employment will be provided, and why, if this industry has operated since 1932 under a 33½ per cent. effective tariff, it is now necessary to add 42??</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>About 20 or 30 persons are employed in the production of flock at present.  The lower rate of duty was imposed because we were, perhaps, somewhat apprehensive as to the suitability of the home-produced flock for the purpose which I have described. These apprehensions have now disappeared. The material is, of course, of very low value, and although an <i>ad valorem</i> duty may look high on paper, it means very little in practice. The increase is not so considerable as it might appear at first sight.  In any event, there will be no increase in the price of flock produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement implied that his fears as to the quality of flock produced here were, to a large extent, unfounded.  In those circumstances, would not a duty of 33? per cent. be sufficient?  What is the necessity for the additional amount?  If the quality is good, that in itself ought to appeal to the people using this material for mattresses.  I think it is also used for upholstery. What is the necessity for the increased tax now, if the quality is good and the <Col N="1027" /> prices are reasonable, as the Minister says?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an importation of flock, not a very substantial importation in value, but substantial in relation to the total output of the industry, and it is desired to stop that.  We have agreed to increase the duty, but, in doing so we have secured undertakings that the prices of the Saorstát-produced flock will not be increased.  Therefore, the increase in the duty is designed to stop importation and to turn the whole of the demand for flock to Saorstát sources. The use of flock in upholstery work, in any event, is declining, and it is rapidly being replaced by fibre.</P>

      <P>Here we have again the doubling up of a duty.  It is proposed to delete the Imperial preference rate on certain classes of jute piece goods and thereby, together with the change in the rate of duty, to increase the effective rate on certain piece goods from 25 to 50 per cent.  I notice also that in reference No. 8, to which I have another amendment, it is proposed to do the same thing in respect of empty jute sacks and bags&mdash;to increase the effective rate to 50 per cent.  These are items which, since 1932, have had a duty of 25 per cent.  The Minister, after four years, now proposes to increase that to 50 per cent.  I should like the Minister to tell us what are the conditions of production and employment in an industry which has this protection since 1932, which, in his opinion, now make it necessary to double that protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A fairly substantial extension of the jute industry is in contemplation and classes of jute cloth which are at present imported will, we trust, shortly be manufactured here. The old jute mill at Waterford has been acquired by the company which operates the Clara Mill, and is being rebuilt and reconditioned and equipped with modern up-to-date machinery with a view to a substantial expansion of jute production.  Deputies who have been reading the papers will have noted that conditions in the jute industry are very disturbed at present, and it was considered probable that the existing rate of duty, which is 37½ per cent., would not be adequate to secure the continuation of production here without perhaps some reduction of costs.  No doubt, the only result of leaving the duty unchanged would have been the lowering of production costs here in some way, and the only way available would be at the expense of the workers employed in the industry. It is possible that the conditions in the jute industry will be restored to normal again, in which case the higher duty might not be required, but, at present, the higher duty is, I think, necessary and, in consequence of the protection, the conditions in the industry will be maintained.  There will be no increase in prices, but there will be a substantial increase in total production and in employment in the industry.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the duty ... shall be paid at whichever of the following rates <Col N="1029" /> produces in each particular case the greater amount of duty, that is to say:&mdash;The rate of an amount equal to 33? per cent. of the value of the article or the rate of 3d. the article.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Crackers are sold by the box, and I doubt if you went into a retail shop and asked for a cracker, you would get it.  I presume it refers to the box, and I should be glad if the Minister would say that is so.  There is another point to which I wish to draw his attention.  It is not the week before Christmas, when crackers are consumed, that delivery is made, and my information is that at the moment there are no crackers being manufactured in the Free State.  Orders are at present being taken for immediate delivery, and, in a very short time, stocks will have to be delivered.  The contention of my informant is that there is no machinery available at present for manufacturing crackers.  If that is so, there will either be no crackers or they will cost more.  The Minister has not taken any powers to license importation, and I think it would reduce the thing to an absurdity if a duty of 3d. per cracker was imposed.  It would mean a 400 per cent. increase.  I should like the Minister to clear up these points.</P>

      <P>This duty on Christmas crackers is an extension of the duty in existence upon certain similar classes of goods&mdash;Christmas stockings, Easter eggs, and articles of that kind. It applies to each article.  Each individual cracker is liable to duty.</P>

There is no licensing provision at the moment, but we are contemplating introducing a licensing provision, by way of amendment, to meet particularly the case of very cheap and small articles used for decoration purposes, which may not be produced here. There are, of course, a number of firms engaged in the production of crackers and there is no reason to anticipate that an adequate supply to meet all requirements will not be available.</P>

    <P>I understand that the effect of this reference is to increase from 1/- to 1/6 the tariff on sparking plugs.  The Minister must be aware of the great increase in cost to the transport companies that the duty on sparking plugs imposes.  I would like to hear from him what is his idea in increasing that duty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in duty has been decided on because despite the existing duty the import of sparking plugs is still very considerable. In 1934 the total quantity imported was 70,000; in 1935 the total quantity imported was 129,000.  These goods are produced by two concerns in this country, one in Drogheda, and one in Dublin.  The prices at which they are sold are similar to the prices at which the imported plugs are sold.  There is a very substantial profit allowed by the manufacturing firms to retailers of these articles.  Plugs which may be sold ex-factory at anything from 4d. to 2/- are all retailed at on or about the some price.  In consequence of that the existing duty of 1/- per article was not fully effective.  What we are proposing to do is to abolish the preferential rate, so that there will be a flat rate of 1/6 an article and we think that would be sufficient to enable the two firms in the Free State to secure the whole market or to encourage other firms to go into the business here so that there would be a full supply of sparking plugs.  As far as I am aware there has been no complaint about the quality of the sparking plugs.  They have been found satisfactory.</P>

He is now demanding the same thing in respect of sparking plugs made here, that the firm that makes the sparking plug or the retailer selling it, will get 5/- for an article the cost of production of which is anything from 4d. to 1/6, and he invites us to increase the tariff in order that that machinery may last.</P>

      <P>It is not for me to go into the whole economy of the motor industry.  Perhaps it is necessary for the motor traders to get a substantial profit on articles of this kind, so as to enable them to carry on.  The profits in these things have always been considerable. Sparking plugs are imported at prices as low as 4d. or 5d., but they are not imported at that price by the individual retailer.

      <P>The position is that there has been a difficulty in getting the retailers to push the sale of Irish sparking plugs, because they get a smaller profit on these than they do on the imported plugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put before us to-day prohibitive tariffs. He put on tariffs of 50 per cent. and 75 per cent.  He put them at a prohibitive figure in order to prevent people buying stuff for which they might have a greater preference when home manufactured <Col N="1033" /> stuff could be got here.  In this matter the Minister tells us that we can produce plugs here at a price which would enable them to be sold at a substantial profit&mdash;at half the price at which they are being sold at present. He takes no steps to put on a prohibitive duty.  This is a toleration duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point which the Minister might clear up.  At present there is a tariff of 1/-, and we equate that roughly at 100 per cent.  He tells us that makes no difference in the price of the article that is sold here.  That is to say, if 5/- were charged before, 5/- will be charged after this imposition, and that will be continued.  I understand that the retailers here are in this position, that they have an opportunity&mdash;unless the Irish articles cost 100 per cent. more, which is against all the Minister's contentions&mdash;of making a very substantial profit by retailing not the imported article but the home-manufactured article.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like it to be clear that the cost of production here is undoubtedly higher than outside, because the total production is smaller. For that reason, there is nothing like the same amount of profit to the manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making all allowances for that.  Is the cost of production 100 per cent. higher here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of some classes of plugs it would be.  The Deputy will understand that the sparking plug will come at a higher price to the individual purchaser than to the large firm that buys big quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to the home-manufactured plug as well as to the imported sparking plugs. That does not affect the argument one way or another.  But if what the Minister says is true, and if that 50 per cent. is going to make a difference, the imported plug will still be sold at the same price to the retailer.  If the home manufacturers and the wholesalers have not pushed through with the advantages they have at present, surely they are not likely to do it now.  There must be something extraordinarily <Col N="1034" /> peculiar in the whole situation.</P>

      <P>A duty was put on varnish three years ago of 7/6 per gallon (full) if imported in liquid form, or 5/- per gallon preferential; if imported in paste or powder form the duty was 3/- per lb. (full) or 2/- per lb. preferential.  After three years' experience of that duty the Minister is asking for power to admit varnish on licence.  I would like to ask the Minister what has happened in the varnish-making industry during the last three years to justify him asking the House now for permission to allow varnish in on licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is due to the fact that certain new industries have been established which require a very special kind of varnish which is not made here.  The existing duty has been completely effective and, in respect of ordinary classes of varnish, there is a very substantial production here.  Certain types of varnish required in industrial processes are not produced here.  I might instance the case of lead pencils and there are other cases where special varnish for industrial purposes in small quantities is required by particular firms.  It was not considered practicable to make that varnish here because of the smallness of the quantities required and therefore we consider it necessary to issue licences in that connection.</P>

    <P>It is proposed to increase the effective duty on yeast from 18/- to 36/- per cwt.  Three years ago there was a Customs duty imposed at the rate of 18/- per cwt. (full) or 12/- per cwt. preferential on yeast.  There is no provision now being made for a preferential rate.  What are the circumstances that make the Minister increase the duty now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase has been proposed for the purpose of prohibiting imports of yeast.  Yeast was still being imported, notwithstanding the first duty, and in fact there was substantial evidence that the existing duty was being paid by the importing firms.  There was no increase in the price of imported yeast following the imposition of the duty and it is considered necessary to effect the change.  Arrangements were made to secure assurances from the Saorstát producers that their prices would remain unaltered.  These assurances have been received and it is on that basis that the increase has been effected.  There is no question of the ability of the Saorstát firms to produce all the yeast that is required in the country.  The change over was effected in a manner which caused no inconvenience to the firms using this material.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that outside firms have been able to sell yeast here at the same price, completely ignoring the tariff of 12/- per cwt., preferential, I would like to know from the Minister whether the question arose between himself and the yeast-manufacturing company of reducing the price here behind the bigger tariff barrier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That question may arise.  The Saorstát yeast was always sold at the standard price.  The duty was imposed when there was evidence that certain Continental brands were being sold at much below the standard price.  These Continental brands have disappeared off the market.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price at which British yeast was sold here&mdash;I suppose this is as good a definition as any I could give.  Prices were more or less standardised for a long period of time. As regards Irish yeast, it does not cost any more to produce it here.  There was a temporary invasion of certain Continental products which have now disappeared.  Importers of British yeast paid the duty and the price of their products was not increased and the protection which it was intended to afford to the Saorstát yeast producers was not effective.  We are. therefore, increasing the rate on the understanding that the prices will remain the same.</P>

They examined the situation with some care.  It is not a very important industry and the amount of employment is not considerable. We imported inside soles, in 1935, to the value of £2,300 and we felt it was desirable to raise the duty in order to stop that importation.  There need be no increase on that account in the price of the Saorstát products.  I think either of the two firms engaged in the business would be quite capable of supplying the whole of the market.  No very considerable hardship is likely to be occasioned by the increase.</P>

    <P>In 1934, the tariff in this instance was 33? per cent. on shotgun cartridges. Now the Minister proposes to raise it to 50 per cent.  A duty of 33? was certainly ample protection for an industry of that kind, and, as was pointed out, at the time it was imposed, was greater than it ought <Col N="1038" /> to be.

      <P>This duty applies to shotgun cartridges which are now being manufactured in Galway.  Prior to the imposition of duty the whole of the market here was practically supplied by certain English concerns. Imperial Chemicals supplied the bulk of it.

      <P>The number was about 1,000,000 altogether.  It was considered desirable to increase the duty so as to shut out that 1,000,000, and to shut out all such imports hereafter.

The Galway firm has a monopoly and produced fairly high-class and middle-class sporting ammunition.  If they turned out a cheap cartridge it could be used by farmers for firing at vermin.</P>

      <P>To delete reference No. 18 and all relevant references thereto in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>Here it is proposed to increase the duty on certain refrigerating apparatus from 25 to 50 per cent.  The duty of 25 per cent. was imposed in the early part of last year and, as the Minister is aware, at least four firms, for a very long time established in the country as agents for refrigerating apparatus manufacturers, began under the tariff of 25 per cent., and in co-operation with the Government's expressed policy at that particular time, to assemble refrigerators here. Fifty per cent. of the work of installing refrigerators was done in this country even before that in connection with the building of the cold rooms and other matters.  These firms have a fairly long established connection with creameries and other industries of that kind throughout the country.  Some of them have been here for 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this tariff of 50 per cent. imposed at a time when another firm has got a State guarantee in connection with a trade loan, they regard the increased duty as being specially intended to assist the new firm, which has not been connected with the installing of refrigerating apparatus in the country in the same way as the older firms have been in the past.  Under the 25 per cent. tariff a considerable amount of work done was in assembling the refrigerating apparatus here, and additions had to be made to the engineering staffs for that assembly work.  There was already a fair engineering staff connected with these firms that did the work of installation and putting in of the refrigerators throughout the country. Now these firms find themselves in the position, with the arrangements that have been made and with the new company apparently being specially favoured by this particular tariff, that they will not be able to carry on; that the plant which it would be necessary for them to instal here to carry on in a competitive way under the 50 per cent. tariff with a new industry set up on <Col N="1042" /> more modern lines will force them to dispense with the staff they have.</P>
    <P>The position requires explanation from the Minister in asking us to increase the duty.  We would like an explanation of his attitude towards the companies that have already been here, that have already been doing assembly work and have established commercial relations with many industries throughout the country over a period extending in some cases, as I say, to over 40 years.  If these firms are closed down, then their connection from the point of view of the maintenance of a considerable amount of refrigerating fabric in the country will be completely cut off and the fairly widespread refrigerating plants put up by these firms will be dependent upon a new firm with a different type of apparatus and different technique for their maintenance.  They, at any rate, seem to be of the opinion that a certain number of industries in the country will suffer through being deprived, in the new circumstances, of services that these firms have been able to render in the past and were continuing to render as well as carrying out an increasing assembly business under the 25 per cent. tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if any such development, as Deputy Mulcahy has pictured should result from the imposition of the duty.  In fact, as a result of the duty we have had approaches from certain concerns which propose to do work in this refrigerating line which has not hitherto been done here.  I anticipate an extension rather than a contraction of the number of firms engaged in the industry.  We are increasing the duty from 25 to 50 per cent. and extending the scope to include refrigerators other than those used for commercial purposes and compressors not exceeding ten horsepower for use with refrigerating apparatus. A substantial industry has been built up in Dublin in which ice-cream cabinets are manufactured and other commercial refrigerating units are assembled.  The industry is giving employment at present to some 60 persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as ice-cream cabinets are concerned, it is manufacture; so far as refrigerating apparatus is concerned, it is mainly assembly up to this.  The work is of a highly skilled nature and the bulk of the persons employed are skilled adult workers.  Arrangements have been made for the extension of the scope of the industry.  Because of this duty we propose that household refrigerators should also be assembled from the complete knock-down condition and, in addition, a wide range of compressor units will also be assembled that heretofore were imported completely assembled.  The use of domestic refrigerators is on the increase and their assembly here will provide an appreciable amount of additional employment of a good type.  So far as the increase in the duty is concerned, there will be no increase in price on that account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a reduction, which is more important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend upon a number of factors.  One of the factors is the matter to which I referred already, the extent to which manufacture can be increased so as to reduce overhead costs per unit.  The development of the industry&mdash;a development due to the changing habits of the people as much as to any other cause&mdash;and the extended demand for this equipment should, in due course, lead to a reduction in price, a reduction which may be accentuated if the number of additional concerns which have made approaches to my Department engage in the business of manufacturing and assembling this equipment. It was felt that the existing duty of 25 per cent. was not sufficient to secure the interest of all the firms that were concerned with the sale of ice equipment in this market in the assembling and manufacturing of them here and that the increase in the duty would be justified by results.  We appear to have reason now for that conclusion because, not merely will there be a substantial extension of operations on the part of those at present engaged in the manufacture or assembly of these units, but it seems likely that we will have new firms entering into the business as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> We are retaining the licensing provision, because certain classes of equipment used in industrial and other processes may have to be imported for some time to come.  Whether that will be so or not will depend upon circumstances.  So far as we are concerned, we are anxious to secure that all this apparatus should be assembled and, to whatever extent practicable, manufactured here.  That is the purpose of the duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The representatives of the Department would go to a concern engaged in this industry. as in the motor car industry or other assembling industry, to consider and discuss what additional items of equipment could be assembled or <Col N="1047" /> manufactured here.  In the case of the compressors we satisfied ourselves that the work could be done; we saw it done.  We discussed it with interested parties and got certain technical officers of the Department to report upon the work that was involved.  We were quite satisfied that this work could be done, and we decided that it should be done.  I do not think any firm engaged in this business seriously will have any difficulty about getting it done; it is not a very difficult operation. Any firm entering into this business upon any worth-while scale would be able easily to provide itself with whatever equipment is necessary for the purpose.  I want to deal with the reference which the Deputy made to certain people having information that this duty was going to be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no truth at all in that statement.  Nobody had any information that the duty was going to be imposed.  Undoubtedly, we had from interested parties applications for extension of the duty, and the inclusion of new articles within the scope of it, all of which we discussed with the people who made the applications.  The only information which was given to them was that if action was taken on their representations it would be taken in the ordinary course in connection with the Finance Act.  What action was likely to be taken, if any, was not communicated to anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's information to the House is not exactly in accordance with what was conveyed to me.  In the first place, there has been considerable extension of the sale of what are known as domestic refrigerators during the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous to the introduction of that particular instrument there had been considerable activity on the part of three or four firms in connection with cold rooms, cold storage, and other equipment of that sort for creameries, big commercial <Col N="1048" /> establishments, and so on.  Each one of those firms employed a certain number of men&mdash;engineers, office staff, and so on.  As far as I am aware, they did give very satisfactory service to the public.  A smaller institution came along here, and they have particularly good salesmen.  It is quite possible that some members of this House have reason to appreciate that fact.  They seem to be as hot on the scent as any foxhound which can be got in the country, and they do not lose the scent until they get their prey.  They have sold those articles extensively through the country. There is a big market for them, and they are very expensive.  I hope the Minister has taken steps, if they are going to be manufactured here, to ensure that a satisfactory staff will be employed at the work, and that the people will get value for their money.</P>
      <P>But that is the smaller end of it. By reason of this imposition, the position of the other older firms engaged in the business has been rendered particularly precarious.  Even the introduction of the 25 per cent. duty last year reduced the staffs, and possibly also reduced their remuneration. It reduced the numbers who were engaged here for a long time in the various establishments throughout the country which had paid rent, rates, and other charges of that sort. I am taking the Minister's figure of 60.  Having regard to all the circumstances, it does not bear any exten sion, allowing for the necessary number of persons that would have to be employed in selling the smaller machines.  The commercial machine is what is of particular importance. The smaller machine is only a relative individual loss, but you can imagine the position of a creamery or big commercial house when one of those plants which it had established goes out of order.  It would require first class service, and that is one of the great advantages of those older firms here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will certainly be well advised to take that side of the case into account because if they are going to be closed up and if the property of <Col N="1049" /> those people who have invested their money in those plants is in any way damaged, it will be a very serious matter.  I should like to know if the Minister has made careful enquiries into the number of persons employed. The figures that he has given and the figures I have bear a certain relation to one another, but the figures I have with regard to salesmen have not been met by the Minister and they constitute very much the larger percentage of the employees.  This is a new institution. People are finding it necessary and perhaps, in certain cases, where people have to keep meat for a few days, or to keep other items of that sort; or in cases where they wish to have ice at short notice for the manufacture of ice-cream or things of that sort, it is an advantage to have it, and while it is necessary to safeguard the interests of these people, it would be advisable to take every precaution to ensure that where creameries and concerns of the kind I have referred to have established plants for producing large quantities of ice, their interests will be safeguarded in connection with any arrangements that take place.</P>

      <P>I should hope that all those who are engaged in this business will make all the usual arrangements with regard to service and distribution. It was practically the same in connection with motor cars.  When the restriction on the importation of complete motor cars was first effected there were selling organisations that were very much perturbed, and, in fact, people did lose their employment in the beginning, but after a time all the firms concerned realised that it was necessary to conform to the new conditions and they engaged in assembling motor cars here.  As a result, employment is considerably greater now than it was before the new conditions were imposed.  I feel sure that the same thing will apply in connection with these goods.  Certain firms will hesitate before taking the step of assembling here, but I imagine that the incentive of the extra 25 per cent. should be sufficient to encourage them, and there is evidence of that already.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On ground rice and rice flour?  Very good.  We had occasion to point out, when the whole series of tariffs were put on in connection with commodities used in the worker's home in the Budget last year, that the tax inspector could not leave his examination of the worker's home without feeling that the worker might have a rice pudding on a Sunday and, accordingly, a tax had to go down on the Sunday rice pudding.  Now the Minister for Finance proposes to increase that tax from 2/- to 4/- a cwt. I do not know whether it is the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce that is responsible. It is the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Very good.  Part of the promises we had long ago contained a statement that in the grain-milling industry 14,000 additional workers would be brought into the industry.  As a matter of fact, there was some odd number.  It was over 14,000.</P>

      <P>I say grain milling, and not only were there 14,000 promised, but 14,000 odd.  I admit that in the meantime, up to 1934, 481 persons had been added in the grain-milling industry.  Is this increase from 2/- to 4/- on ground rice an attempt to bolster up the Minister for Finance's Budget on the one hand, or is it an attempt to bridge the gap between the 481 people that have been put into the grain-milling industry and the 14,000 people that the Minister promised would be put into it?</P>

      <P>This is a protective duty.  The manufacture of ground rice and rice flour has been undertaken by some flour-millers in Dublin, and the materials are being sold here at prices similar to those charged for imported commodities.  It is not a very big trade, and the whole of our requirements can be supplied from internal sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it from the Minister that this increase in the price of rice flour will not give rise to a further increase in the price of bread?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that this has no relation to bread. This commodity is mainly used for confectionery purposes and for home consumption, and the Deputy may take it that there will be no increase in prices in connection with this duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
