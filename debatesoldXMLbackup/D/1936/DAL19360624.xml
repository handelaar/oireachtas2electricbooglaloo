      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that owing to the neglect of the Unified Society some thousands of stamped health insurance cards surrendered to the society by insured members were mislaid and subsequently destroyed; whether he has taken any and if so what action to establish the ownership of the destroyed cards with a view to having the proper number of contributions credited to the insured persons affected; whether he proposes taking any steps to ensure that pending the final adjustment arising out of the loss of the stamped cards insured persons whose cards were destroyed will not be deprived of benefit to which otherwise they are entitled and whether he will indicate the steps which he proposes taking to obviate a recurrence of the incident in question.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the society that a parcel of cards for the first half of 1934 has been temporarily mislaid, but that there is no reason to assume they have been destroyed.</P>
      <P>The contributions on these cards have already been credited to the insured persons concerned and, therefore, no question arises of any insured person losing benefit by reason of the fact that the cards have been mislaid.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that 1,500 health insurance cards, the property of insured persons who were also members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, are believed to have been given to a contractor <Col N="162" /> for waste paper?  Is he further aware that when the contractor was communicated with on the following day by the society, he stated that the material he received was all destroyed? Is he further aware that a large number of applications for benefit are now being queried on the ground that cards do not appear to have been received, and will he indicate what steps have been taken to ascertain the names of the insured persons whose cards were lost and what arrangements have been made to protect their interests?</P>

The rate for drainage labourers employed in County Kilkenny has been fixed with due regard to local conditions, and it is not proposed to increase it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has simply denied that the average yield from income-tax has decreased.  I think the Minister, in asking the House to pass an income-tax rate of 4/6 in the £ ought to give the House some information.  The total yield per 1/- of income-tax in the year 1931-2 would appear to be £1,170,000, but the yield per 1/- since the income-tax rate was raised to 4/6 has substantially diminished.  I suggest to the Minister that it has diminished by at least £170,000 in spite of the fact that he has been having a very large screw put down on the income-tax payers of all kinds.  It is a matter of interest that the House should hear from the Minister what are the reasons why this fall in the capacity of the income-tax payers to pay income-tax has come about, and whether he has any remarks to make.</P>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister is refusing to reply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary. The House has an opportunity of hearing the Minister.  The House has never heard the Minister say anything except that certain reliefs were given to people with small salaries.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the total of that relief which has been given.  It is a matter of interest to the House to see that, on the surface, at any rate, in so far as the figures <Col N="165" /> provided by the Minister are concerned, the income-tax payers are not able to make the same return per 1/- income-tax as they were able to make before the present economic state of affairs came about.  It is a matter upon which the Minister should say something to the House because the facts are that there has been a drop of about £750,000 or £800,000 that the House would have expected would have been raised in income-tax if the income of the people was sustained in the same way as it was in the year 1931-2. Although the rate of income-tax has been raised by such an amount as would warrant getting in more than we did last year by the sum of more than £750,000 that £750,000 has vanished.  It could only have vanished, apart from what the Minister said in regard to any reliefs that have been given, through a falling off in the income of income-tax payers.  When the Minister is asking the House to pass such a large income-tax rate as 4/6 in the £ we are entitled to hear some explanation from the Minister of the manifestations that the income of the income-tax payers in the country has fallen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister on several occasions in a reasonable way for some comment on this very serious aspect of our finances, not only of our national finances but of the domestic finances of our people.  We are dealing this year with a Budget which has put a burden of taxation on the people higher by probably £200,000 than the Emergency Budget of 1932-3.  We have every indication throughout the country of the way in which farmers, labourers and wage-earners are hit by the present conditions.  Here we have a burden being placed on income-tax payers that was in fact reduced&mdash;had to be reduced <Col N="166" />&mdash;a year or two ago by reason of the fact that it was apparent to the Minister that the income-tax payers could not bear the taxation which was being then imposed on them.  With even this reduced tax of 4/6 it is obvious to the Minister and must be obvious to the Government generally that there is a substantial fall in the capacity of income-tax payers to bear this tax. Surely when we are starting off on what the Minister himself promised last year was going to be our first normal Budget, and when the size of that normal Budget is bigger than the Emergency Budget which the Minister first introduced four years ago, we are entitled to hear from him some comment on the situation disclosed by the falling off in the returns for income-tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that matter arises on a different section, Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, on this important matter we ought not to pass Section 1 without hearing the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I really think the Minister ought to give us some indication of the reasons that have compelled him to have income-tax remaining at what it is.  When the Minister was in opposition I remember the very forcible case he made from this side of the House that the income-tax levy at that time was a handicap to the extension of industry in this country. I am sure the Minister does not forget all that himself.  As a matter of fact, the Minister was very impressive in pointing out that, unless there was a very substantial reduction in income-tax, there could not be expected in this country any expansion of industry. The Minister seems to have forgotten all that.  He appears to think that the right thing to do now is to <Col N="167" /> extract, in any way he can, all the money that can be extracted by way of income-tax.</P>
      <P>Surely, when the Minister says that there is a dwindling-off in the income-tax returns, and when he is not able to collect what he thought he would be able to collect on a certain figure, he ought to see that there is something wrong and to realise that it is the writing on the wall.  If we are to have any faith whatever in his sincerity and to hark back to what he said when he was in Opposition, there is every reason for him to be nervous of the present situation.  If the Minister has any information, I think he ought to take the House into his confidence and tell us exactly what he thinks of the position that exists in the country at the present time.  The Minister knows the way in which the farmers are crippled at the present time, and he knows the way in which they have had to be spoon-fed.  He knows that that spoon-feeding is at the expense of the nation, and that it has to be done in order to keep the farmers on their feet at all. Will the Minister tell us how long is that going to continue, and does he think that he can keep up that position indefinitely either by increasing income-tax or by maintaining it at a figure which is not making a proper-return? Surely, the Minister will realise that we are entitled to some information on the matter and that we ought, at least, to have his mind on the present situation in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a further word, Sir, as to why we must regard the situation disclosed by the income-tax returns as being so serious.  We do know that the wages of agricultural labourers throughout the country have been very substantially reduced, but in spite of a growing population in the country there were less agricultural labourers employed last year than in 1931.  We know that farmers' prices for the produce that was their main source of income are practically halved.  We know that their condition is such that farmers, generally, throughout the country, for the last two financial years, have ended up owing the Land Commission and the <Col N="168" /> county councils £2,250,000&mdash;a position they were never in before&mdash; and that for two years' running now, that position has been stabilised. Yesterday a reference was made to the large number of farmers in the country who, from the point of view of the Land Commission, are not able to pay their way.  We have now final information from the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to the position of those industrial concerns that are covered by the Census of Production, and we know that such additions as have been made to the number of industrial workers in these industries in the last three years of the Fianna Fáil régime were additions to industry at average wages of 18/7 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>That discussion is rather wide of income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, it shows how heavy the burden of government is, if any portion of it has to be borne substantially, on the one hand, by farmers, and, on the other hand, by agricultural labourers or by the new additions to the wage-earning classes in industry.  We now have our first normal Budget.  The first normal Budget shows an increase in expenditure over the emergency Budget, and, from anything that the Minister has indicated to us, the burden of government is going to increase rather than to decrease, and any increase in the burden of government must be borne by an increase in income-tax rather than by an increase in the costs of the various necessities of life that have borne the burden of taxation in the last two years&mdash;costs that are daily becoming more burdensome to the people of the country, who are in the position that they are spending less on clothing, less on boots, and less on the necessities of life than ever they spent before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A speech on the Budget generally would not be relevant now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But, Sir, the position disclosed in the Minister's statement is that we are going to have an increased cost of government, and income-tax payers seem to be the only <Col N="169" /> people that will be able to bear an increased amount of the cost of government, but, according to the Minister's figures for last year and this year, these people are shown to be people who are less able, to-day, to bear the burden, even of the present income-tax, than they were in the year 1931-32. Knowing that, and realising that, the Minister sits silent before the House when asked to face up to that situation and when asked to relieve our fears, if he is able to relieve them, and to deny the statements we make with regard to the fall in the capacity of the income-tax payers to pay income-tax, if he can deny them.  However, it is a nice sample of one-Chamber Government that we should be treated in this way not only in connection with the most important measure that comes before the House in the year, but with a measure in connection with which we have to take into consideration not only the taxable capacity of the taxpayer, but the cost of government generally and the cost to the taxpayers of their own subsistence and the maintenance of their homes and their families; and not only their capacity to pay to-day, but their capacity to pay to-morrow.  As I say, it is a nice sample of Ministerial responsibility and of what one-Chamber Government can be in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is no harm, Sir, to point out in connection with this debate that the Minister has evidently decided to adopt this year the same attitude that he adopted on the Finance Bill last year, which, it will be remembered, led to a very protracted discussion in this House in an effort to draw a statement from the Minister or to elicit some information from him.  We were accused, at that time, of obstruction, because we tried to get some information from the Minister, and I think it is only right to state now that, if this debate is to be similarly protracted in an effort to extract information that the Minister should volunteer to the House, the Minister himself is responsible for it, and nobody else.  This is the most important measure that this House has to consider in the year.  It has been the practice in this House, since its <Col N="170" /> foundation, that, on the Committee Stage, the Minister in charge of a Bill would give a short explanation to the House in moving each section of the Bill.  The Minister for Finance departed from that practice last year. He ignored it, by refusing to give the House any information, and apparently is adopting the same attitude this year. To say the least of it, that is not treating the House the way it should be treated.  Deputies are entitled to get information on any Bill brought before the House, and particularly a Bill such as this, that is going to inflict such heavy taxation on the people.  I suggest to the Minister that, in fairness to the House, and for the proper expedition of business, he should conform to the practice that has been followed for a number of years.</P>

After all, the Minister's position is recognised as the most dignified after that of the President, and it seems to me that he is failing in his duty to that position, as well as bringing a certain amount of disrespect on it for successors, if he continues his present attitude.</P>

      <P>In regard to that, all I can say is that prior to 1932 the Minister reserved, particularly on the Finance Bill, the right to deal, when concluding the debate, with points made by the Opposition and there are sound reasons for that.  The time of the Dáil is very valuable.  It ought not to be abused by Deputies who think that the proper function of occupants of the Front Opposition Benches is to rise not once but four times, and to launch interrogatories at the Minister after they had time to make them in debate&mdash;first of all on the general Resolution, then in the debate on the Committee Stage and also on the Report Stage of the Resolution.</P>

      <P>At this stage I call the attention of the House to this fact, that the text of the Finance Bill is almost a verbatim copy of the terms of the Resolutions which have already been debated in the House, not once but three times, and, Sir, it was the invariable practice, prior to 1932, of the then Opposition, which had regard for the value of the time of this House, and which was anxious to permit the business of the House, in so far as the legitimate purposes of government were concerned, to be carried on without obstruction, and particularly in regard to this resolution relating to income-tax, to allow it to go to the Vote of the House without any prolonged or discoursive discussion.</P>

      <P>The reason was that then we had an intelligent Opposition which did on the preliminary stage elicit all the facts required.  That is the reason why any Deputy or any Minister is entitled to reserve to himself discretion as to when he will intervene. No Minister is called upon to rise in debate and to give information that more properly ought to be elicited by form of Parliamentary Question. For the purpose of eliciting merely information not for discussion of the merits pro and con of any measure, but to enable an intelligent discussion to be carried on, the House has devised the special procedure of Parliamentary Question.  If Deputy Mulcahy was really concerned about this question of income-tax, he could have taken the trouble to put down a Parliamentary Question which would have elicited all the information that he thought he required in order to conduct a discussion on this question of income-tax with value to the House and to the country.  I have refused to violate or to permit what I believed was a violation of the procedure of the House, by giving information during the course of a committee discussion which in my view would be more properly elicited by the form of Parliamentary Question, and which, if it is put down, <Col N="173" /> I am perfectly prepared to give.  That, Sir, is the reason for the attitude I have adopted to-day.  There is no question of obstructing or being unwilling to give information.  There is merely this, that those who undertake the responsibility of opposing a measure which the Government thinks necessary for the proper provision of the public services will, at least, fortify themselves before the debate with the information which they think they require in order to carry on these debates intelligently.</P>
      <P>On the general question as to why it is necessary to maintain income-tax at the present level, a full exposition of that position was given by me in the course of my Budget statement.  I pointed out that the House had decided that present services were to be maintained at the present standard and at the present level, and that in order to maintain these services at that standard and at that level, it was necessary to ask the people to contribute a certain amount of taxation.  We have divided that taxation between taxation upon incomes and property and taxation upon commodities.  The House, and particularly the Opposition, I may say, did not disagree with the Government in its decision to maintain these services at the present level, and it must now face the responsibility for imposing the necessary taxation.  So far as the general rate of income-tax is concerned, I think that income-tax payers in this country have a right to congratulate themselves that we have been able to provide for these services without having to increase the rate of income-tax.  To-day it stands at 4/6. We have been able to maintain it at 4/6, and that must be remembered.  In connection with the point made by Deputy Mulcahy, that the yield per 1/- of the standard rate appears to have fallen off, it is true that the standard rate to-day is 4/6 as compared with 3/6 when we came into office.</P>

      <P>There is one thing about the Deputy I admire.  I often admire his parliamentary industry while at the same time I pity it because it seems to be very much like the efforts of poor Mother Partington who tried to keep back the tide with her broom.  For the last four years he has been trying to sweep back the tide of social reform in this country with a broom, with the broom of the empty vapid speeches which he makes here hour after hour and day after day upon every motion that comes before the House until, Sir, when he has uttered one sentence, or given us one set of figures, we know inevitably what is going to come next. When he tells us about the 600 people less who are employed in agriculture, we know that inevitably he is going to talk next about the £10,000,000 that this Government has disposed of during the last four years.  I venture to say that, if we were to change places, I could get up in the Opposition Benches and make the same speech, possibly a little more effectively, which Deputy Mulcahy makes every day in every month that the Dáil is in session in this country.  That is all beside the point.  I say that I admire the Deputy's parliamentary industry while I pity it because, Sir, he comes along here, entirely without the proper equipment&mdash;without the proper factual equipment that any person who presumes to lead such an Opposition as sits opposite should have&mdash;and makes a foolish speech.  He has asked me to-day why it is that the yield of income-tax, though the standard rate is 4/6 in the £, appears to be less than it would have been if the conditions of 1931-32 still obtained.  In reply to a question which was put down by Deputy Maguire, which I answered some weeks ago, I gave the Deputy information which would have enabled him to answer that question. May I refer to these figures again in order to show why it is that, although the standard rate is 1/- higher, nevertheless the yield of income-tax would seem to have correspondingly declined, or rather would seem not to have increased by a corresponding amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House of course will appreciate <Col N="175" /> that income-tax payers constitute a sort of pyramid.  Underneath we have a large broad stratum of people with comparatively small incomes who pay comparatively little.  Above that there is a stratum, more restricted in extent, of people who pay slightly more and so on until we come to the top where there are one, two or three comparatively limited classes, who pay greatly increased amounts.  With that fact before them the House will appreciate, when I give Deputies the figures which I am going to give now, why it is that, though the standard rate of tax has been increased, the yield of income-tax has not increased by a corresponding amount.  I gave these figures to the House once, in answer to a Parliamentary question; again just a week ago on the Second Reading of this Bill, and I am now going to give them to the House for the third time.  I hope that this time Deputy Mulcahy, and those who are associated with him in the Opposition, will be capable of assimilating and understanding them.  In 1931-32, this halcyon year to which Deputy Mulcahy so often harks back, a married man enjoying an earned income of £325 and who had to maintain himself, his wife and two children had to pay 7/10 income-tax each year when the rate was 3/6 in the £.  To-day that man pays nothing.  In 1931-32, if the same person had an income of £350 he paid £2 7s. 3d. in income-tax.  To-day he pays nothing.  If his income were £375 he paid £4 6s. 7d.  To-day he pays nothing.  If he had an income of £400 he paid £6 6s. 0d. To-day he pays nothing.  If the same person instead of having two children, had three children and had an earned income of £375 in 1931-32, when the standard rate was 3/6, he would have been paying £1 19s. 4d.  To-day when the standard rate is 4/6, simply due to the fact that we have had regard to the position of a man who has family responsibilities, he pays nothing.  He would have paid £3 18s. 9d. if he had an income of £400 in 1931-32.  To-day he pays nothing.  If he had four children in 1931-32, with a standard rate of 3/6 in the £ and an income of £400 per year, he would have paid <Col N="176" /> £1 11s. 6d.  To-day he pays nothing. If he had had, as is quite common in this country, a family of five children in 1931-32 and had an earned income of £425, he would have paid £1 3s. 7d. in income-tax.  To-day with a standard rate of 4/6 in the £, he pays nothing.</P>
    <P>I think that if the House ponders over these figures even Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;I am not quite so sanguine about Deputy Morrissey&mdash;will apprehend why it is that although the rate of tax to-day is 4/6 as compared with 3/6 in 1931-32, nevertheless the yield from income-tax has not increased correspondingly with the increase in the standard rate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, after all, is not the judge in this matter. The majority of the House is.  The Deputy is one of those on the benches opposite who talked about the sacro-sanctity of majority rule.  The majority of the House has decided quite clearly that it has had all the information it wants on this matter.  It has been given completely, not merely upon the discussion of the Bill, and on the resolutions, but in the discussions that have taken place here, year after year, ever since the standard rate of tax was fixed at 4/6.  I suggest that no one wants any more information for the purpose of being able to discuss this matter intelligently.  The Deputy's attitude is merely for the purpose of holding up, and obstructing the passage of the Bill.</P>

The Minister now proposes to delete the statutory period, and to make it possible to go back and investigate the accounts of any person arising out of any circumstances over any period of time.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5.  It is rather a pity that Deputy Crowley would not give the House the benefit of those words of wisdom which he uttered on the back bench.  This amendment is one which speaks for itself and I am sure the Minister does not want me to elaborate it.  This matter was brought before the House on the Finance Bill of last year.  One of the Minister's reasons for not accepting it was that he had not had sufficient time to consider it.  He promised to look into the matter before the present Finance Bill would come before the House.  The object of the amendment is to secure the concession extended to others for parents whose children are apprenticed to trades or <Col N="186" /> professions.  As the law stands at present, it is only when children are sent to the universities that parents get this concession.  The amendment is fairly tightly drawn because the Minister pointed out last year that the amendment then tabled would open the door too widely and that there would be too many demands for the concession, resulting in substantial loss to the Revenue.  For that reason, the amendment is restricted as much as possible. I should like if the Minister would tell us whether he is accepting the amendment or not or whether he has had time fully to consider the matter.  I think nobody will dispute the fairness of applying this concession, which is given to parents who send their children to a University, to apprentices, particularly in view of the declared policy of the Government on the industrialisation of the country, and in view of the shortage of trained and skilled men in this country, which is so much that we have to bring in a number of the natives of other countries.</P>

      <P>We are anxious not only to learn the Government's attitude on this amendment, but also their reasons for not accepting it.  The Minister for Finance asks for additional reasons why this amendment should pass and that additional income-tax relief be given to parents who are bearing the cost of the higher education of their children in this particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I am prepared to urge on the Minister and on the Government further reasons why this amendment should be passed and that further relief should be given to parents who are bearing the cost of the higher education of their children.  I take it the Minister does not disapprove of parent doing their best, according <Col N="187" /> to their means, to give the highest possible education to their children. I take it that with the position as it is in the country and in view of the various discussions we have had about the difficulty of getting Irish technical experts in the sugar factories and other factories throughout the country, that the Minister realises the importance of the amendment, and that he does remember the ideal that has been held up in Fianna Fáil propaganda throughout the country about the great industrial development there is going to be here and the brains that will be necessary to direct that not only administratively but technically. I take it too that the Minister realises that nobody can better prepare the way to provide the educational requirements to meet developments of that particular kind than the parents who have children who have the capacity to absorb higher education.  If the Minister knows anything of the cost of even primary education or secondary education he will realise that parents with large families have a very heavy burden to bear in meeting the heavy expenses involved in a three or four years course of University education as well as meeting the expenses in the case of apprenticeships in engineering, architecture or anything like that.  I take it that the Minister's Department will have some estimate of what this would amount to.  The Minister, in dealing with Section 1, declined to give the House any information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss the capacity of parents to give their children higher education, and I do want to say that if a labouring man, or an agricultural labourer, is in the position by any hook or crook of giving higher education to his children he should be assisted to do that, and so should the farmer and so should a member of any other section of the community.  The Minister has indicated the type of relief that recent actions of the Government have given to persons with families.  A very <Col N="188" /> small amount has been saved to these people, but except relief of this particular kind is given you are going to deprive quite a large number of children&mdash;whose parents cannot without some additional assistance give them the benefit of University education&mdash;of getting this University education. If there is any <i>bona fides</i> at all in the Minister's contention that we are having higher industrial development here and that we do want better trained technical brains to assist in that development, and that we do want these to be Irish brains, and that we want them quickly, the Minister will approach this matter in a sympathetic way.  We would like to know if his position is that that relief must be a class reservation for people to whom the amount of money they spend on their children's education is of little concern because of the size of their incomes?  If this is not to be a class reservation, the Minister will give more consideration to the amendment. The Minister knows that the income of every class in the community has been reduced and the capacity of every class, except those very well off, to give their children a higher education is substantially reduced.  I am putting these arguments to the Minister and I would like to hear on what grounds the Government are refusing to accept the amendment.</P>

If the Minister is not inclined to treat this seriously and to refrain from play-acting, he should be compelled to do so.  This is a serious and important matter.  There is an amendment down on the Paper and certain reasons have been advanced in support of that amendment.  The weight to be attached to these reasons is a matter of opinion.  The Minister may consider that the reasons put forward are not sufficient or he may consider that they are bad reasons or that they are badly put, but these things have nothing to do with it.  We are not all as glib as the Minister and in any case we are entitled to be told what is the reaction of the Minister to this amendment; whether he is prepared to accept it and, if not prepared to accept it, to give the reasons for its rejection.  That is all we are asking.</P>

Apparently, the Minister has attempted to carry out that promise to make fuller inquiries into the matter to see if it could be given effect to and perhaps he will now give the House the benefit of those inquiries.</P>

If the proceedings before I came in bore any relation to what I have been a painful witness of in the House for the last 20 minutes, I am glad I was not here during the opening stages of the debate.  The conduct of the Minister in the present instance is lamentable from the point of view of the House. Two Deputies of standing&mdash;any Deputy in this House is a Deputy of standing &mdash;but two Deputies whose views certainly <Col N="191" /> require attention have stood up here and put forward their views. These views have been treated with open contempt by the Minister.  I suggest that is an abuse&mdash;I admit that the Chair cannot remedy it, but merely because the Chair cannot remedy it and deal with the conduct of the Minister, does not make it less an abuse of the position which the Minister holds in this House.  An amendment has been moved.  The Minister may object to the form of the amendment, to the words of the amendment, but at least he might have addressed himself to the subject of the amendment.  He might even have used this opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you rule, Sir, on the point of order raised some considerable time ago by the Minister, might I point out that in discussing this amendment, the conduct of the Minister, his failure to answer the points put forward by two Deputies on this side of the House, is relevant to the attitude that the House ought to take up towards this amendment.  Arguments were put forward by Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Mulcahy in favour of the amendment. The Minister refused to deal with these arguments.  He had several opportunities of doing so.  He might have done so after Deputy Morrissey sat down.  He invited then further discussion.  Deputy Mulcahy intervened and once more the Minister could have given reasons why this amendment before the House should not be accepted by the Government. He could have pointed out what was unsound in the reasons put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey.  He did not do so.  The only articulate expression of opinion that we heard from the Minister was, mainly, in the form of interruptions to the Deputies in question.  One was the plea&mdash;I suggest it is to a large extent a quible, a matter of mere words&mdash;that as the word apprentice ship was not mentioned here, therefore the amendment before the House was in no way connected with the matter that was before the House 12 months ago in connection with apprenticeship.  But apprenticeship is training, a very important type of training.  If apprenticeship is not training then again &mdash; I was in a similar difficulty yesterday&mdash;I fail to know what apprenticeship is meant to be.</P>
      <P>I suggest, Sir, that when the Minister asked for reasons he might at least have the courtesy to listen.  I suggest that the conduct of the Minister is disorderly, and I ask your ruling on that point: that when we are addressing the House the Minister should at least listen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I again point out to you the way in which, from the start, the Minister has treated this particular matter.  If training is not apprenticeship, why do people pay a fee for an apprenticeship?  It is quite obvious that it is regarded as training, and why there should be exemptions for certain grades in this country who are undergoing training, who are taking out professional courses&mdash;why exemptions should be made for children of that class and no exemptions made for the children of the labouring classes, why no voice should be raised, even on the Government Benches, on their behalf, and why it should be considered that the man who is not rich enough to send his son for a profession should get no exemption, even though his son or daughter is undergoing a course of training subsequent to the primary period, a course of training that is absolutely necessary for the acquirement of a trade or profession in which that young person is to spend his or her life: why that person should not get exemption and why a person, for instance, going on for medicine or the higher branches of engineering should get exemption does, I submit, require very careful consideration by the House and, if not by the Minister, certainly by those who are interested in the proper development of training in industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that for a long time now, since the establishment of the State, there has been a fair amount of effort to stress the importance of training of all kinds, to try to raise, so to speak, the level of technical training to the level of other types of training.  Why should not every help that the Government can give be given?  In vain, efforts have been made to know what the attitude of the Minister and of the Government is to the case put forward by Deputies Morrissey and Mulcahy.  I see no reason why there should be this disrespect for, this <Col N="194" /> looking down upon, technical training: why there should not in that particular case be exemption and why help should not be given.  Training of that kind is quite as essential to the future participant in the industrial life of this country as is university education to the future professional classes, and the main purpose of the amendment is to restore a certain amount of equality in that particular matter. For that reason I recommend it to the House.  I think it does require not merely the careful consideration of the House, but I should be very much surprised if the House, if left to itself, would not give it very hearty support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's reference to the amendment that it does not refer to apprentices, I would ask the Minister to read the words: &ldquo;Undergoing training by any person (hereafter referred to as &lsquo;the employer&rsquo;) for any trade, profession, or vocation.&rdquo;  If that does not mean apprentices, I do not know what it means.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to discuss a matter here with any sort of rational approach because some of those who venture to put down amendments do not, apparently, appreciate the meaning or significance of words. Deputy Morrissey charged me with discourtesy to the House because I had refused to deal with a matter which had been discussed in the House last year, and with the arguments in favour of which I ought to be perfectly familiar.  I asked Deputy Morrissey to tell me what the House discussed last year.  The Deputy, of course, did not know what the House discussed last year.  He said that his amendment had been discussed in the House last year.</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon, it is on record.  I asked him to show me where the word &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; appeared in this amendment.  He stood up and <Col N="195" /> referred me to certain words in his amendment, but among them the word &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; does not appear. The proposal which was discussed here in the House last year referred to &ldquo;indentured apprentices.&rdquo;  That was the phrase used in the amendment which was under discussion and which was rejected by the House last year but it does not appear in Deputy Morrissey's amendment to-day.  Why not?  Because the Deputy had not sufficient originality to try and put, in his own words, the proposal which he wished the House to discuss.  The proposal which appears on our Order Paper is part of an amendment which was discussed in the British House of commons some weeks ago and which the Deputy lifted holus-bolus and put down here in order to show a certain section of the people how much concerned he was about their welfare; but he could not sit down and give one half hour of his time to think out a form of words that might meet the situation.  He expects that the Minister is going to waste his time discussing a proposal lifted, as I say, out of the records of a discussion elsewhere, and then flung at the House without a single argument to commend it.  Deputy Mulchay jumped in after Deputy Morrissey to make confusion worse confounded. The whole of the Deputy's speech was related to the advantages of higher education and why we ought not to encourage it.  There is not a word in this amendment about higher education.  Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan's speech&mdash;Saladin turned Crusader&mdash;was the gem of the debate, because the Deputy said that this amendment was designed to assist the children of the labouring classes.  The Deputy's colleague has been telling us all through the week that the labourer in this country receives something between 18/-, 23/- 24/- and 25/- a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has something to do with the principle and with the amendment.  The Deputy's colleague, with all the ponderosity, the mental ponderosity, which characterises him has recommended this amendment to the House as something which is designed to benefit the children of the labouring classes.  The labourers, according to Deputy Mulcahy, earn 18s. 7d. a week.  Will the Deputy produce to this House that unique specimen, the labourer who is earning 18s. 7d. a week and who pays income-tax and who will come within the terms of the income-tax section?  I think if the Deputy is able to do that, he would die as rich as Barnum and will supersede him as the greatest showman the world has ever known. Where is this labourer with an income of 18s. 7d. a week who is called upon to pay income-tax?</P>
      <P>Who is it pays income-tax in this country?  Deputy O'Sullivan was not here to listen to me, but let me again cite some examples from the category of income-tax payers.  Unless a married man with two children has an income of over £400 a year, he does not pay any income tax in the Free State under the present régime.  If he had been living in the halcyon days when Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan was here instead of there, and the standard rate was 3/6, he would have been paying £6 6s.  To-day, if he has two children and an earned income of £400 a year he does not pay anything, and it will take quite a big revolution in this country before there is any child the son or daughter of a labourer who has £400 a year earned income.  I think I have disposed of that sort of sentimental tosh which Deputy John Marcus O'Sullican trots out to the House in support of this and other amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the sort of speech the Deputy is always prepared to make on a resolution of this sort.  I believe at one time the Deputy had quite a reputation as a philosopher.  He turned <Col N="197" /> from his earlier avocation and became an historian, and we, of course, know that the muse of history is often allied to the muse of rumour.  Now he has become a politician, where few regard the truth except those who have the responsibility for Government and sit on these benches.  Surely the Deputy might learn another speech when he comes to discuss financial proposals in this House?  He gets up here and talks day after day, and all of us know his heart is not in his work. He has learned a speech by rote from the Complete Speechmaker and he makes an oration which, I have no doubt, if I had the book from which he conned it, I would say was headed &ldquo;Speech for any Budget, or for any section of a Finance Bill.&rdquo;  That is the sort of thing we have had from Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was in a position at one time, in days when taxation was so much lighter and so many other things could have been done, when there was so much more money at the disposal of the then Administration than there is at our disposal now, to do quite a lot of things of this sort, but he never did them.  Remember this, that if we were to accept the proposal contained in this amendment, it would cost us a considerable sum of money and it could lead to further demands for further concessions and would mean that whatever we lose by making these allowances we shall have to make good, not at the expense of the income-tax payer, but at the expense of the labouring classes and the children of the labouring classes for whom Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan has expressed so much concern this afternoon.  The Deputy was in power here from 1923 to 1931.  Why did not Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, Deputy Richard Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey, who was running with them if he was not actually one of their team&mdash;why did not they during that period press upon the Government the desirability of making the concession which is asked for here?  Now they are full of concern, but when they had the power it did not give them any concern at all.  I do not know if it would be quite Parliamentary for me <Col N="198" /> to say that they did not give a damn about the children of the labouring classes, but if it cannot go on the record, at least it expresses very tersely what was the position when Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey had power to influence the financial policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is not as simple a thing as appears on the surface.  We are asked under certain circumstances to do certain things.  I may say that since a similar matter was mentioned in this House, not last year but two years ago, I have given it the closest possible consideration.  I have come to the conclusion that it would not be possible to grant a concession on those terms.  In this year's Budget we have gone very far.  We have increased the children's allowance&mdash;not merely in respect of children who happen to be engaged in trade or in respect of children who are being educated, but in respect of every child.  We have raised the allowance from £50 to £60, and I think that is a very substantial concession in a year like the present. We are asked now to go further.  We are asked to give the concession where a child is required to devote the whole of his time to training for a period of not less than two years.  That misses the whole point.  The reason why this concession was given originally was to encourage people to educate their children.  Of course, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, who was Minister for Education in the last administration, has not yet grasped the full ambit of the concession.  He and Deputy Mulcahy have been talking as if the concession were confined to those who are enjoying the benefits of University education.  Of course it is nothing of the sort.  It is given in respect of any child who is receiving full-time instruction at a university, college, school or other educational establishment.  There is quite a number of children in this State who are at school after the age of 16 years, and who are not students of a University.  Most of those who are studying for the leaving certificate are over the age of 16, or may be over the age of 16.  They are benefiting, and they are not going to a University and do not intend to go to a University. <Col N="199" /> They will go into trade or they will go into commerce, or they will go into the Civil Service.  The reason why the concession was given in the first place was in order to encourage people to educate their children.</P>
    <P>The position, of course, is quite different in regard to people who have children who may be employed.  In effect, what this amendment asks us to do is to grant the concession in relation to children who are employed; in relation to the boy who is fortunate enough to get inside the closed borough of a trade.  Mind you, that word &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; is not mentioned here.  It is not mentioned because if it were mentioned it would be quite impracticable to grant the concession in respect of what were described last year as &ldquo;indentured apprentices,&rdquo; because the term has no legal significance, and neither has the phrase that is used here.  The parent of a boy&mdash;it does not matter how wealthy the parent may be&mdash;who is assumed to be engaged in any avocation is to receive an allowance in respect of that particular child.  What happens to the parent of a boy who is not fortunate enough to get inside the closed borough, or to the parent of a boy who is not disposed to work?  Of course that particular boy will notsay that he is not disposed to work.  He will say that the one ambition of his boyish soul is to become a bricklayer or a tailor or an engineer or a plasterer&mdash; to get into one of those trades which, as I said before, are virtually closed boroughs&mdash;but that he cannot do it, and he does not want to thwart the natural abilities which he has; he wants them to flourish and expand. But at the back of his mind he has no desire to work or train or equip himself. Supposing we are to do as Deputy Morrissey says, how are we going to confine it to this, the really fortunate section of the taxpayers? Mind you, the whole thing has been put up to me under the guise of a concession to the working-class people of this country.  If there are any working-class parents who would be benefited by this concession&mdash;I contend that there are not, because I gave the <Col N="200" /> House figures which show quite clearly that the ordinary artisan in this country does not in any conceivable circumstances, if he is a married man with a family, become chargeable for income-tax&mdash;how are you going to justify giving this concession in regard to the boy who is fortunate enough to get inside the closed borough and be in training for a trade, and refuse it to the father of the other boy who has not got the same chance or to the father of the boy who is not disposed to work?</P>
    <P>The whole thing, as I said before, is quite impracticable.  Again I repeat that in this year's Budget we have given a very substantial concession by increasing the children's allowance from £50 to £60.  We cannot do more. If we are called upon to do more we can only do it&mdash;again I want to repeat and emphasise this&mdash;at the expense of the great majority of the people of this country, that is, at the expense of the people who are not fortunate enough to enjoy sufficiently high incomes to be called upon to pay tax on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave as his first and, I may say, his main objection to this amendment the fact that it had been lifted bodily from the British House of Commons; that it was all amendment which was moved to the British Finance Bill.  I thought myself that it was quite a good amendment, and that it went some way to meet the objections of the Minister as to the necessity for some redistribution, so that the door would not be opened too wide.  The Minister tried to make capital of the fact that it was an amendment which was moved in the British House of Commons.  Of course, he overlooks the fact that Section 4 in his own Bill deals with a section of an Act passed in the British House of Commons in 1920, and that the whole code of income-tax legislation in this country was lifted bodily from the British Government.  The Minister's next objection to it&mdash;of course, it is part of an article which we had last week or the week before last in the Fianna Fáil bulletin&mdash;is that it would cost a good deal of money; that the <Col N="201" /> money would have to be found at the expense of the social services for the poor people, and that it would be found nowhere else.  Might I suggest that he might find it out of the £2,000,000 he was going to save in taxation or the additional £10,000,000 he has added on?</P>
      <P>The Minister has not tried to meet the amendment.  I suggest that the reason why he has talked so much around the amendment was that it was more difficult for him to make a case against this amendment than the ones previously moved.  The Minister found fault with the amendment because the word &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; did not appear in it, and then proceeded to tell us that the word &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; had no legal significance at all, and even that the phraseology of this amendment had none.  It is quite clear that the Minister is not prepared to give the same concession to persons who apprentice their children to professions or trades as he gives to parents whose children go to a University.  That is the net point, and all the Minister's talk around the subject is not going to get away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious, Sir, that in the course of his speech the Minister did realise that the amendment does include apprentices.  He says he has given consideration to the matter since it was last before the House.  All he has told us is that, as a result of that, he does not feel inclined to make any concessions.  He has given no reasons; he has only said that he is not going to do it.  He is satisfied that he will not give the concession but he has not told the House the grounds on which he bases that refusal.  He has refused to do that, and the House is still wondering on what grounds the Minister makes the discriminations, or stands for the discriminations, that now exist in this particular code.  One is that, in the ten years in which his predecessors were in office, they did not do it.  Am I to take it that it is the settled policy of the Government that even in minor matters&mdash;I know that in major matters they are doing the very opposite, even in financial major matters&mdash;am I to <Col N="202" /> take it that in minor matters they are determined to make no advance whatsoever beyond what their predecessors had made?</P>
      <P>There is a reference in another part of the amendment to the amount of any earnings being taken into account, but this is an instance of a person being in training, training that is supposed to be for a trade.  I presume the father is not a person of great wealth, at all events, or a person who can afford to give his children the educational advantages that have already been provided for.  That was the gist of the case made to the Minister.  I now see that the Minister accepts as the proper wage for the workman 18/- a week.  That was the wording of his statement&mdash;that that was the typical and normal labourer.  Leaving that aside, however, is there any reason why the parent, whose child is undergoing or receiving training of this kind, should not get relief as well as the parent who is better off and who can afford to send his child to a regular educational establishment?  It is training in both cases.</P>
      <P>I have not that contempt that the Minister seems to have for this particular type of training.  I never had it.  In introducing the Technical Instruction Bill in this House, I made it perfectly clear that mental training of any kind was important for this country and that it was a mistake and a piece of snobbery to rate certain kinds of mental training higher than others.  Now, there is a certain kind of training given here.  It may be apprenticeship, it may be indentured apprenticeship, that is included, but it goes farther than that.  There is no reason why it should be confined to that.  Why should not that type of training be measured along with the other type of intellectual training to which the Minister has referred?  That is the case the Minister has not met and that he has not attempted to meet. He has met it with an argument that, coming from the Minister who has imposed the amount of taxation that he has imposed, does not seem to us to be meeting our point at all&mdash;and that argument is that he cannot afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, for a Government, famed for <Col N="203" /> its extravagance like the present Government, to bring forward an argument of that kind in itself shows the weakness of its case.  He gives no indication as to what the amendment would cost, what the burden would be, or what would be the number of people who would be likely to find relief under it.  All kinds of arguments are put forward about people who are usually inclined to waste their time.  That class of person seems to have become a fixed idea with the Minister, and now, because a certain number of people, apparently, do not want to work or to learn a trade, therefore, according to his argument, the number of people who do want to work or to learn a trade are not to be helped.</P>

      <P>I wish, Sir, with your permission, to make a few supplemental remarks to what has already been said on this amendment standing in Deputy Morrissey's name.  The amendment that I had on the Order Paper&mdash;No. 4&mdash;embraced a somewhat similar, if not identical, principle to that contained in Deputy Morrissey's amendment, and I regret that circumstances, over which I had no control, precluded me from being here to move that amendment.  Consequently, I must take Deputy Morrissey's amendment as it stands.  The principle is the same.  It came as somewhat of a surprise to me to learn that people who were attending, say, a university for lectures, and who were, at the same time, apprenticed to either a profession or trade, were not entitled to the relief in the relevant section of the Act of 1920.  I had always understood that that section was, shall we say, administered, if not interpreted, in a very liberal spirit.  There had been no public demand that I had ever heard in reference to the subject matter of the amendments in my name or in Deputy Morrissey's name.</P>

      <P>We awaited his explanation with some interest, but I am afraid, after this stage of the Bill goes through, we will be awaiting his explanation still&mdash;without interest. This amendment was put down in the British House of Commons and I suppose the Minister will say that Deputy Morrissey is copying the British Labour Party.  I put down my amendment without any consultation with Deputy Morrissey, because it occurred to me, from a case brought to my knowledge by one of my constituents, that it was an injustice that required to be remedied.  But the <Col N="205" /> attitude of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was in striking contrast, I understand, with the attitude that the Minister has taken up on this amendment.  He received it with complete sympathy but regretted that the circumstances of the time would not permit him to meet it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that up to the present the Minister did not express even sympathy with the amendment, until I pulled out that observation.  To that extent, there is this difference between the British Chancellor of the Exchequer of a Conservative Government, who expressed sympathy with the Labour view, and the Minister for Finance here, who, up to the present, did not express any such sympathy.  The point, as I understand it, is that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer would accept it only that he could not afford it. That the Minister for Finance was not in sympathy with the amendment was I think the natural deduction, as I understand, to be drawn from the observations made by him.  At all events, neither he nor the British Chancellor of the Exchequer is affording this relief which is required in my view in the interests of ordinary decency and justice.  It will cost the Exchequer very little.  The Minister has not told us how much it will cost.  Such as it is, the Minister says it would fall on the labouring class. I am told the Minister said so in his answer.  I would like to know how it will fall on the labouring class.  Does the Minister take up the attitude that his Parliamentary Secretary took up last year and say: &ldquo;Why should not the tax fall on the working class?&rdquo; That was the attitude of his Parliamentary Secretary last year when taxation was imposed by the Minister in the Budget.  Why should not these taxes fall on the working class?  If the Parliamentary Secretary was correct, why should it not fall on the working class?  Apart from that aspect, how does the Minister suggest that the cost of the scheme suggested <Col N="206" /> in the amendment would fall on the working class?</P>
      <P>There is only one possible explanation of that remark, and that is that the Minister has so heavily taxed everybody in the community, even to the working class, that there is nobody left to take on the residue but the working class that has not yet been taxed by the Minister in his depredations in the Budgets and the Finance Acts of the last few years. I cannot see any other explanation why the principle behind the Act of 1920 should not apply, whether in part or in whole, to people receiving instruction and education or those apprenticed in trades or professions. During that period in a young man's life he is a liability on his parents, and it was in order to meet that situation that the provisions of the Act of 1920 were inserted by the British Parliament. They will not be extended by the Minister in the circumstances of this country, when it is eminently desirable that people should be apprenticed to trades of an expert character.  If there is any substance in the policy of the Government, or in the claim that they make that they have established some industries here &mdash;let us take it that some of their claims are correct, and let us take it as a hypothesis that there is to be industrial expansion&mdash;you must have expert people trained in industry, or if not you have to bring over foreigners. We have the claim of the National University graduates that they should be employed in these industries that are supposed to be established here. Assume that they are here, you must have specialists trained if they are to be a success and if you are not to be providing employment for foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to get factories started, in many instances expert assistance had to be brought over and, incidentally, at very high salaries.  I mentioned the sugar factories, where very high salaries are paid to the managing directors.  In order that they will be able in the future to take up positions in these factories, you have got to make a start now by apprenticing young people to trades and industries. If you do not train the youth of the <Col N="207" /> country now, in 10 or 15 years' time you will be carrying on the same policy, of bringing over foreigners to do expert work that ought to be done by trained Irish experts.  One of the ways in which assistance can be given, not merely to ordinary people in trades, but assistance towards the establishment of something in the nature of Irish industries is by giving a benefit of this kind.  This is a practical test of the sincerity of the Government in their industrial policy. There are large numbers of people unemployed here at present.  One of the greatest problems that will face this country for some time to come is the problem of what is to be done with young people from 17 years upwards who are leaving secondary and primary schools.  The Government refused to raise the school-leaving age, having adopted the policy that the school-leaving age as it stands is sufficient.  We are in favour of raising the school-leaving age, so as to contribute in some way towards a solution of the very pressing problem that exists of providing some sort of hope for future careers for young people from the primary, secondary, and even technical schools.  If they could be assured of some training in trades or professions, and if there was some inducement held out to their parents to put them into trades or professions, considerable advantage would accrue to the community.  One of the ways in which the Government might, at small cost to the Exchequer, show their sincerity is by giving this small relief in reference to people apprenticed to trades and professions, limited, if the Minister likes, to any class, as an earnest of his intention to meet in some way the problem of young people leaving school and the problem of unemployment that must be solved by any Government.  I suggest that the way to have any decent industries, and the way to have people employed in these industries is to have them manned by Irish people.  This is a method by which a beginning could be made, but the Minister did not express even sympathy with the amendment until it was dragged out of him by the <Col N="208" /> observation I made at the opening of my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, above every other Minister, should know something of what the cost of education means to parents.  He has had to do with a big body of civil servants throughout the country, and I am sure he has had drawn to his attention the examination into the distribution of expenditure in the incomes of a certain number of civil servants in connection with an examination into the cost of living that took place some years ago.  Some 63 budgets were submitted by members of the Civil Service with a view to indicating how expenditure ran in the various classes of incomes.  The incomes ranged from £300 and under to £400, from £400 to £500, and from £500 upwards, and taking the average incomes as £250, £350, £450 and £600 of persons in the Civil Service, the expenditure on education is recorded as £5 on £250; £7 10s. on £350; £18 on £450, and above £40 on £600 and over. There was a rise in the figures from £5 on £250 to £40 at £600 as expenditure on education.  We see from that something of the desire to spend such moneys as can be made available on education.  It has been the complaint in the past that instead of education being directed towards trade or technical lines, there was too much clerical or office work about it.  Even with the development of technical education since the new Act was introduced some years ago, that tradition of office work has stuck to a great extent to these schools generally throughout the country.  If, as Deputies have said, there is anything behind the protestations of the Ministry that they want to prepare the people of the country for a better class of industrialisation, then certainly some sympathy should be shown for the position indicated here, that people who have money show only too great an anxiety to expend it on their children's education. That being the attitude on the part of the parents, the attitude of the Government should be to hold out any inducement that would indicate to them that the education of their children should, as far as possible be <Col N="209" /> directed along technical lines.  The Government should be prepared, by such assistance as can be reasonably given in accordance with the principles they have already laid down in respect to giving relief on educational expenditure, to give them the relief that has been asked for here in order to induce a greater tendency towards education on the technical side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to reply, but the last speech coerces me to get on my feet again.  It is quite clear that there is no proper appreciation of the position in the minds of the Opposition.  First of all, let us remember what we are considering. We are considering an allowance granted under the income-tax code.  I have already given figures to this House to show that unless a married man who has two children has an earned income of £400 per annum or over, he does not have to pay any income-tax.  Therefore, so far as the overwhelming body of the people of this country is concerned, they pay no tax.  I think our population is about 3,000,000.  I doubt if, in present circumstances, the total number of our citizens who are assessed for income-tax exceeds 100,000.  That is to say that roughly income-tax payers are less than 3 per cent. of our population. These are rough and approximate figures, but at any rate they will help the House to visualise what the position is.  Deputies will, therefore, understand the significance of my statement when I say that until the average head of a family in this State has a total income, all of it earned, of more than £400, he is not likely to be called upon to pay income-tax at all.  The plea has been made for this amendment that it is designed to encourage people to see that their children are properly trained for industrial occupations.  What is the proper way to train them and prepare them for normal industrial occupations?  It is to give them the best possible primary and technical education the parent can.  The original purpose behind this children's allowance was to encourage parents to see that their children were educated. educated in the broadest sense, as distinct from the manual training which <Col N="210" /> a person will get in a workshop.  With the growth of technical education, a boy who desires to become apprenticed to a trade will be much better served if he delays going into that trade a little and instead spends a year or two at a technical school.  Technical and secondary education is to be had nowadays in any of our urban centres.  It does not matter whether the boy is going into an industrial occupation or into commerce.  Technical and secondary education is to be had in most of our towns and cities at very little expense, so far as fees are concerned, to the parents.  There is nothing in the income-tax code confining the benefits of the concession which at present exists to parents who send their children to the universities.  It is very difficult to discuss these matters intelligently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; if the people who are advocating the concessions are themselves not familiar with the existing position.  We have heard Deputy Costello, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Mulcahy.  They all argued on the basis that the existing concession is confined to the parent who is able to send his boy or his girl to a university college.  That is not a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor is it a fact that my argument was based on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the concession is granted to a parent of a child over the age of 16 years who is receiving full-time instruction.  Deputy Costello argued about the part-time or half-time case.  There are sound reasons why the concession cannot be given in that case.  An essential condition is that the boy or girl should be receiving full-time instruction at a university a college, a school or other educational establishment and that covers vocational educational establishments as well as primary and secondary schools and university colleges. The reason it was given was to induce parents to give their children a better opportunity for education.  As I have said, it has been argued here that we ought to extend it, or rather, not that we ought to extend this concession <Col N="211" /> but grant another one on an entirely different basis, that, instead of including parents to see that their boys or their girls are properly educated before they send them for technical or commercial training, we ought to induce them to neglect the long-term advantages which a good education will give to a boy or girl and snatch at the short-term advantage by putting the boy or girl into a job in which that boy or girl will get a few shillings and thus relieve the parents of their ordinary obligations to their children.</P>
      <P>The whole basis of the concession, as I have said, is to induce parents better to educate their children.  Remove that inducement by widening the limits within which these concessions may be given and you at once adopt an attitude which is not consistent with, and which I think would negative, the general policy which was behind this concession originally.  No boy or girl going into any technical occupation loses anything by spending a year or two extra at a vocational school.  Any boy who goes to apprenticeship, whether to engineering or otherwise, knowing something of trigonometry and of draughtmanship, and knowing something about physics and mechanics and natural philosophy generally, if properly trained, is going to receive the greatest benefit from the manual training which apprenticeship is intended to give him, and it is only manual training that apprenticeship is likely to give him.  He is going to benefit by having this training. The purpose of the inducement at present is to give the boy that training. The amendment now before the House would negative the advantage that the State seeks to secure for those children by granting this concession. Apart from that altogether, there are other reasons why, in principle, this amendment could not be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the difficulties in drafting amendments for the purpose of giving effect to certain proposals.  In the wording of this amendment there is nothing defining training or specifying the amount of training that would be required.  It is quite possible we might have one boy put into a draper's <Col N="212" /> shop and running messages.  If we take the case of two brothers, one might be a draper and an income-tax payer and the other might just as well be an income-tax payer and a grocer too.  One of these boys might be in the draper's shop, another in the grocer's shop running errands and the parents of each might claim reduction in income-tax, on the grounds that both were receiving vocational training, as this amendment is drafted. There is nothing in the amendment and I propose to ask the House to reject it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On each occasion the Minister gets up he demolishes the case he made on his previous incursion into debate.  I gathered from his previous statement that the particular objection he had to this amendment was the immense cost it would involve to the State.  If there is any validity in portion of the argument to which we listened, surely it was that it would involve the State in very little cost indeed.  If the Minister could spare a little of the heat which he brought into this discussion, and turn his attention to his own argument, he would see that he tried to demonstrate to the House how so few people of a certain class are in position to take advantage of this amendment&mdash;and he mentions this in the speech which he has just concluded&mdash; because they do not pay income-tax. The Minister in his responsible position as Minister for Finance refuses to give the House the necessary information when he speaks of the immense cost this would be to the State.</P>

      <P>May I ask you, A Chinn Comhairle, to try to keep <Col N="213" /> the Minister in order when other Deputies are speaking?  We listened to him and did not interrupt him.  I must appeal to the Chair, for the sake of the dignity of the House, to keep the Minister in order.  How many people are there paying income-tax who are likely to avail of this particular concession?  A certain type will&mdash;the thrifty type&mdash;and it is the thrifty type that is going to be hit by the proposal of the Minister.  The Minister gave a long disquisition on certain types of education.  It may have been relevant to the amendment, but I doubt if it was.  It certainly was not relevant to any part of the case put forward by any of the Opposition. I admit it is most useful that young people should get full primary education and full technical education.  Even if they have such education, that may not relieve them of the necessity of entering into apprenticeship and learning a trade and learning something which the Minister so much despises&mdash; a kind of hand-work or handicraft, which they would learn in the workshop. I value that very highly, not merely as a necessity for the acquiring of particular trades, but also highly as a method of training.</P>
      <P>Again, I protest against the snobbery that would limit education to a particular type.  It is because the Minister really refuses to put any value on that particular type of training that I am supporting this amendment.  There is no reason why any young man should be an expense to his parents because he remains at a primary school up to the age of 16, if necessary, or takes a post-primary course after 14 years of age in a technical school or a vocational school.  There is no reason why, when parents make sacrifices of that kind, and then send the child to be apprenticed, that relief should not be given to them to the extent that the State can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main argument brought forward by the Minister was the argument that was used by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England.  But there is a tremendous difference between the circumstances in the two countries. Incidentally, the Minister indicated what that difference was, namely, that <Col N="214" /> it is very few people indeed, comparatively speaking, who will be in a position to take advantage of this concession.  The better-off class are already provided for, and the Minister is satisfied, apparently, with that.  His idea is that a labourer with 18/- a week is already provided for, but there is a class not provided for. Parents may have gone to the expense of educating their children as far as possible in a post-primary or vocational school, and may then send them to a technical school.  Why should these people not get the concession which the richer parents get who send their children on for University education? The Minister made no case against the amendment.  The case he attempted to make, at the conclusion of his speech, demolished the case he made at the beginning.</P>
    <P>Question put and negatived.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing his Budget this year, referred to his intention of giving this relief of £60 in respect of children.  I had proposed in the amendment, which I was, unfortunately, unable to move, that that allowance should be extended to a certain type of children who, though not technically receiving full-time education, were receiving what was, in fact, full-time education.  The Minister made great play in his Budget speech with this relief.  He told us that he was going to rake the pockets of the taxpayers, to put his hands deep down into their pockets under an earlier section of the Bill which enables him to go back for arrears of income-tax to the beginnings of the code in respect of people alive and, in respect of people dead, to the year 1922.  He was going to collect by that process £50,000, and he proposed to apply that sum to the financing of Section 4 of the present Bill.  The Minister did not tell the House at that time that the British Government proposed to insert a precisely similar section in their Bill. There is a precisely similar section in the British Finance Bill of this year, and it occurred to me that perhaps that was not pure coincidence, that <Col N="215" /> there might be a very real reason why the Minister was forced to give this concession in respect of Irish children. I should like if the Minister would give me the real reason why this provision appears in the present Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my business to give hypothetical reasons.  I want the real reason from the Minister.  I discovered, by a glance at the British Finance Bill, that there is a precisely similar provision there.  That struck me as peculiar.  I put it no further than that.  Will the Minister say if that is due to mere coincidence or, if not, how it comes about?  Section 4, as a whole, is almost identical with a section in the British Finance Bill.  As a matter of curiosity, I should like to know what is the explanation of that singular phenomenon?  It may be that it is pure coincidence.  If it is not, I should like to know what is at the back of it.  The Minister made a great parade of the fact that he was going to give this relief and endeavoured to justify the quite unwarranted and unjustifiable provisions of Section 1 by alleging that he was going to finance the reliefs under this section by means of them.  I should like to know why the Minister did not deal with a specific class of case to which I referred&mdash;a case which actually occurred. A person was under what would be popularly called &ldquo;full-time instruction&rdquo; at an educational establishment, but because he happened to be technically engaged as an apprentice, his parents were deprived of the allowance under the Act of 1920.  Why did the Minister not meet that case which, in justice and decency, was deserving of consideration?  Is the Minister not going to reply?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's interruptions <Col N="217" /> are generally unseemly. Deputy Costello asked if it was pure coincidence that the increase in the allowance granted in respect of children in this year's Finance Bill was the same as that granted in the British Bill.  The answer is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It happened that we found ourselves in command of the necessary resources as a result of last year's very satisfactory Exchequer income and the improved position of the country, to increase the allowances granted to income-tax payers in respect of children under 16 years of age and in certain circumstances in respect of children over 16 years of age.  It was purely a coincidence that we decided that this should be done.  But it is satisfactory to note that what we thought, after careful consideration of all the factors and circumstances, was the best and most equitable way of granting relief to the general body of taxpayers appealed also to the Minister on the other side who had the same responsibility as I had and who also decided that if they had a little money to grant relief to income-tax payers that this was the best and most equitable way of granting it.  It is satisfactory to me to find that the investigation which took place on the other side in regard to their problem led to the same conclusion as the similar investigation which took place on this side.  That is the first point. The second point is this&mdash;that the Deputy has asked if there was some esoteric significance in the fact that the relevant section in our Finance Bill was worded in almost identical terms with the equivalent section in the British Finance Act.  The Deputy made a point about that.</P>

      <P>That is, the Principal Act in regard to this question of children's allowances, the Finance Act of 1920 by Article 73 of the Constitution was made part of the general body of our statute law.

      <P>That explanation of the Minister drove Deputy O'Sullivan out of the House.  I am not surprised. I have never heard a more definite and complete piece of nonsense than I have listened to from the Minister in the last few minutes.  I was waiting for a definition of the Constitution and the Minister in a sort of whisper paid some tribute to my knowledge of constitutional law and practice.  In a speech which the Minister made some time ago he referred to me as being disreputable in my attitude and variable in my opinions.  I am glad he has changed his views on that and on other matters.  However, I will pass from <Col N="219" /> that.  There was one thing that pleased me in the Minister's slightly hysterical observations.  He said the reason why this allowance is given in respect of children this year is because the Government were in a position to do so as a result of last year's satisfactory Exchequer income and the improved position of the country.  I was glad to hear the Minister saying that.  I expect the Minister will now announce to the House that on the Report Stage he will move to delete Section 1 of this Bill from the Finance Act for this year.  Because when justifying Section 1 of the Bill which gave power to the Minister to put his hands down deeply into the taxpayers' pockets and to open up transactions long since closed, he said that he inserted this section in the Bill in order to finance the relief given in respect of children.  In his opening Budget statement the Minister said that he wished to remove the absurd power in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners to reopen transactions now closed.</P>

      <P>The point, Sir, is this: that the Minister said he proposed to exercise the powers given by Section 1 in order to get £50,000 in the coming year.  I am speaking subject to correction, but as far as I remember he said that that £50,000 was to be devoted towards financing the giving of additional relief to children under Section 4 of the Bill. Section 4 is a section which gives relief in income-tax in respect of children.  In his speech on the Budget the Minister stated that he proposed to finance this additional relief by the powers which are now contained in Section 1 dealing with income-tax. But we have the fact here to-day that the Minister states that he does not require these powers because of the improved position in the country and the very satisfactory Exchequer income&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, these are his words and I suggest to the Minister that the only conclusion he should come to now, notwithstanding the fact that Section 1 of this Bill has been passed, is that on the Report Stage he will move to delete Section 1 because the powers sought under that are for the purpose of raising £50,000 for the financing of the allowances in respect of children.  Owing to the satisfactory Exchequer income and the improved position in the country of which the Minister tells us he will not want that Section 1 now.  That is a very satisfactory statement if he will but follow it to its logical conclusion.  We are all for giving relief in income-tax in respect of children.  Personally I read that section with delight for it means something to me personally.  But I have some regard for my constituents.  The vast bulk of the income-tax payers are living in the constituency that the Minister and I represent and these people are entitled to some consideration. It is now no answer to say that it is only people with under £400 a year who are getting relief. I welcome the Minister's statement that the reason why he brought this relief section into the Bill was because of the increase in the Exchequer income and the improved state of the country.  I am glad that the Minister has discovered that the statement he made in his Budget speech was wrong and that he does not require, in order to finance this Bill and to rake in this miserable sum of £50,000, to reopen those past transactions in the case of income-tax arrears and go back to 1922 in the case of dead people and to go back years before that in the case of living people. Now we have it that the Minister can under Section 4 of the Bill give this relief.  I ask him to draw the logical conclusion from his own statement and to delete Section 1.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1935. That was the section which, I think, would be regarded in any Parliament of the world as a joke from the way it is framed.  It has in it the extraordinary fraction used for the first time of something being five-fourths of something else.  The general effect of the section is to increase, for income-tax purposes, the valuation of houses and rateable hereditaments by 25 per cent.  This amendment was put down 12 months after the Finance Act, 1935, was passed for the purpose, if possible, of putting an end to what we believe is a provision which has caused hardship and injustice to a class of people who deserve consideration at the hands of the Minister, namely, people who are thrifty.</P>
    <P>We believe the operation of the section has caused very considerable hardship to classes of the community who would be described in other countries as, perhaps, middle class or, if I might quote the phrase of a well-known man, now dead, the late Mr. Arthur Clery, &ldquo;the lower rung of the upper middle class.&rdquo;  The Minister has no particular interest in those people.  They are the class of people whom he referred to a few moments ago as the people with an income of £400 a year and two children.  They are the class of people with smallish incomes, around £400 or £500 per year, many of them civil servants, many who, out of their income, or perhaps by effecting a policy of insurance on their lives, have bought their houses in the hope that, by saving out their fairly meagre income of £400 or £500 per year, they would be in a position before they came to the end of their days to pay off the amount of money required to purchase their houses. They bought these houses in recent years, many of them small villa houses in suburbs around Dublin, where building operations have been going on.  They bought the houses at a time when they were valued recently under the provisions of the existing Valuation <Col N="222" /> Acts, with the bias in the mind of the Commissioner of Valuation and his staff that, in modern circumstances, the valuation which should be put upon these houses should be fairly high.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that the section hits houses valued many years ago, the valuation of which, by reason of changed circumstances and different times, is entirely out of all proportion or relation to what ought to be the modern valuation of property.  The vast bulk of the houses which have been hit by this section are newly-erected houses, occupied by people with smallish incomes, more or less struggling people, people who have to keep up a certain appearance, people who have to try to put something by for the rainy day.  Having purchased a house on the basis of a certain valuation, and paid a certain purchase price on that basis, they find that suddenly by a section of an Act of Parliament introduced last year, not merely have they to pay income-tax on a valuation increased by 25 per cent., but that, by virtue of that section of the Act itself, the market value of the houses has been depreciated. That was a very considerable hardship.  By merely introducing that section thousands of people find that not merely have they to pay an increased income tax, but that the asset which they had put aside in a thrifty way, as a provision for themselves and their families, had been depreciated, by the action of the Minister in his rapacity to get in more taxation, by a very considerable amount in market value.  The Minister has had 12 months' experience of the working of this section.  We have been informed of the injustice which has been brought about.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the general principle applicable to this section which inevitably causes injustice. First of all, it increases the valuation of houses, which had been recently valued, by 25 per cent.  Presumably, when that valuation was made in the last five or six years it was the highest valuation that the Commissioner of Valuation could fix upon it.  It was, therefore, a valuation that was determined in accordance with the Valuation Acts in modern circumstances.  Artificially, for the purpose of income-tax it is deemed by the section to be increased by 25 per cent.  The net result is not merely to put an additional tax on the people who own the houses, but to depreciate the market value of these houses by that further increase in circumstances for which there was no justification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that the general principles to which I am referring have their application in particular instances in connection with thousands of houses in his own constituency.  He can get the circumstances from the Revenue Commissioners, if he likes. I am not going to give him any private information conveyed to me or my collagues by constituents.  The Minister introduced this section last year on the plea, in my recollection, that it had been thought that legislation would have been introduced into this House to enable the property of the country to be revalued and that it was merely anticipating that for income-tax purposes. The real truth of the matter was that he found himself unable to increase income-tax, not because he did not want to increase it, but because it would not pay the Exchequer to increase income-tax, either last year or this year, by reason of the existence of the double taxation relief agreement between this country and Great Britain; and he had to resort to this method of indirect taxation on <Col N="224" /> small property-owners, on thrifty people, who have bought houses in the last five or six years.</P>
      <P>I say this section has worked hardship and injustice.  In principle it is entirely unjustifiable.  If taxation has to be raised by a tax on income, then do it in a straightforward fashion by increasing the income-tax.  Do not let the Minister say that he is not going to increase income-tax because he has such regard for income-tax payers: because he thinks it would not be for the benefit of the trade.  Let him give the real reason&mdash;that he is afraid of it by reason of the fact that money would be lost to the Exchequer in consequence of the operation of the double taxation agreement that exists between this country and Great Britain.  Do not let him resort to this indirect method of effecting an increase in income-tax and, at the same time, trying to cover his tracks from a political point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  Last year, when this proposal was first introduced by the Government, I described it as one calculated to penalise the thrifty.  The same can be said of it this year.  If its introduction last year caused hardship, it is surely indefensible to continue it this year.  I understood last year that it was to be a temporary measure, but that does not seem to be so, seeing that we have it before us again this year.  I do not know why the Minister should wish to discourage people from purchasing their own houses.  That surely, is a desirable thing to do.  House-building not only provides substantial employment, but it helps to make available more houses for those badly in need of them. This proposal also alters the basis on which people who are now buying their houses have to make their calculations. There is no doubt whatever but that this proposal will discourage people from entering into agreements to purchase their own houses, while it will also operate as a hardship on those who have already entered into purchase agreements.  I do not think that a tax such as this should be inflicted on the section of the community that it affects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> The Minister has asked for examples of cases where this tax has caused hardship.  While people have expressed their individual objection to the tax, it would be hard, I think, to bring them to the point in which they would be prepared to say and hold themselves out before their neighbours as suffering from a hardship that they could not bear.  In my opinion this is a tax that should not be continued.  I rather thought from the Minister's remarks last year that it was to be only a temporary measure, but, apparently, like a good many other things that were said to be temporary, it has now come to stay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The purpose of this provision was to ensure that property-owners would pay their due and equitable tax upon the incomes derived by them, or on the annual value enjoyed by them in respect of property which they own.  Play has been made in the House that this proposal has occasioned hardship.  I have asked Deputy Costello, and I presume Deputy Dockrell took the request as being addressed to him also, since he referred to the matter in his speech, to cite to me one single instance in which this provision had worked inequitably or had inflicted hardship.  It is not necessary to mention names.  Deputy Costello seemed to think that he must cite the names of the individuals concerned. That is not necessary at all. Let him give me the facts, let him show me any single instance in which hardship has been inflicted or any injustice done.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in no single case which has come under their notice has any person been asked to do more than pay tax upon the actual income which was enjoyed by him, taking one year with another, from the letting of property, or the annual value which was enjoyed by him because of the possession of such property, and if any single instance of hardship has not come under the notice of the Revenue Commissioners or if it has not been brought to their attention.  I have asked Deputies to bring it to my notice, and I repeat again that it is not necessary to mention names.  I can say this, that <Col N="226" /> if there was such a case of actual hardship it is fully covered by the provisions of the section which would prevent any inequity or any injustice being done.</P>
      <P>The real fact is that property in the State, whether it was built prior to the war or subsequent to the war, is considerably under-valued.  We hope to bring in a measure which will redress this anomaly : to put those who own hereditaments in this country, particularly in urban areas, upon a more equitable basis as compared with their fellow citizens who have to pay tax upon the full amount of the income derived by them, whether from the exercise of a profession or as a result of gainful employment, or in any of the other ways in which income may be derived, except the ownership of property.  We are not doing any person any injustice in placing property owners on the same basis as the general body of taxpayers in the country, and the existing provision in the statute does no more than try to do that, leaving an ample margin in favour of the taxpayer to cover any contingencies or any inequities that there may be in individual cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood when this tax was originally introduced&mdash;this strange vulgar fraction of ours&mdash;that there were principally two arguments put forward in support of it, one of which has just been referred to incidentally by the Minister, namely, the desirability of a revaluation of the country as a whole.  The two reasons were: first, the inequalities of the present valuations owing to the developments that have taken place since the original valuations were fixed, and, secondly, the increase in the general value of property.  I gather that the Minister relies on the advice that he has received from the Revenue Commissioners so far as reason No. 2 is concerned, that the value of property in the Saorstát has gone up over a number of years since the present valuations were fixed. Personally, I do not think that the procedure adopted here by the Minister is calculated favourably to affect the value of house property.  Men who <Col N="227" /> yesterday were induced to buy houses, every inducement held out to them, urged to do so, people pointing out what an excellent thing it was to be the owner of a house, suddenly find that they are singled out, though the Minister attempts to deny this, for special treatment, not favourable treatment, but the contrary type of treatment, by the Minister.  I think in itself that is against what I might call general policy.  No matter what the revenue may get out of it&mdash;I think, if my memory serves me right, £60,000 was mentioned by the Minister last year&mdash;I find there is never any consideration of the effect of general policy, whether or not it is good policy to do these things.</P>
      <P>Turning to the other argument that I have heard frequently put forward, namely, the inequality between the valuations of different houses, certain important aspects arise.  Houses that at one time were valued at the same figure, as the result of recent developments no longer have an equal value. It may be that one is half the value or, if you like, twice the value of the other.  It seems to me that this arbitrary fixing all round of an additional 25 per cent. to the valuation already fixed increases the injustice that is done to one type of taxpayer. There are many cases where houses are not relatively so valuable now as they were at the time that the valuation was originally fixed, and yet this additional imposition is introduced. Let me emphasise once more that there is definite injustice done to different types of householders.  This whole procedure is bad in itself, and to the ordinary taxpayer it must look nothing else except an expedient to raise money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but at least you might endeavour to justify it by trying to do justice between the different types of taxpayers.  To me this is purely a dodge to raise extra money which it is inadvisable to raise in other ways for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Costello.  As the <Col N="228" /> Minister for Finance and the President expressed it on more than one occasion here in reference to the ordinary raising of taxation, if a certain tax had gone to the limit, the further raising of that particular tax would not be reproductive so far as the Revenue is concerned.  On these grounds, therefore, I think there is no case made why this absurd provision should remain any longer on our statutes.  As usual, the Minister has confined himself to vague general statements.  He never deigns to give the House any solid reasons for the proposals he puts before it, nor did he give any solid reason for the step he induced the House to take last year.  He did not give any justification last year, and he is not giving any this year.  I suppose it would be useless to expect the Minister to do anything in the present case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accused me of not giving him any specific instance of hardship and injustice, and he proceeded to say that the Revenue Commissioners had assured him that in their administration of this section in the 1935 Act they had come across no case of injustice, and they had extracted from the taxpayers under Section 3 of that Act nothing other than a tax which would be produced by a letting from year to year or on the annual valuation.  That statement from the Minister meant precisely and absolutely nothing.  The Revenue Commissioners merely administered the Act.  They are directed under Section 3 of the 1935 Act to collect the tax as if the valuation of the house was increased by 25 per cent.  They look through the lists of valuations, increase them by 25 per cent. and make the necessary assessments and adjustments.  They have nothing to do with whether there is hardship or injustice.  I have never suggested that the Revenue Commissioners were not administering the law in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that this particular section in its inception, its conception and its working is an unjust section.  The Minister asked me to give a specific instance.  Take the case of any person who purchased a house before the <Col N="229" /> Minister introduced his 1935 Budget.  I submit that that section has done that man, whoever he is or whatever his station in life, an injustice.  If he is paying income-tax he has to pay an increased tax on a purely fictitious and artificial valuation of his premises.  The Minister suggested that this was done to remedy an inequity between various classes of the community.  I drew the Minister's attention to the person who purchased a house and paid a certain figure on the basis that the valuation was a certain amount.  The Minister ought to know, in connection with the ordinary business affairs of life, that when you are purchasing a house one of the relevant considerations is the valuation.  I will give the Minister a present of a little legal information.  If on the face of the particulars of sale of premises sold by public auction there is a mistake in the valuation of the house, that sale could be set aside.  So essential in connection with the purchase price, the fixing of a purchase price of a house, is the element of the valuation, that if it is wrongly stated in the particulars of sale by the vendor, that sale can be set aside.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants any specific instance, he can get it from the Registry of Deeds; he can get that information on the telephone; he can ask the Registry of Deeds what transactions by way of purchases of houses were registered prior to the introduction of the Budget in 1935.  In every instance the purchaser is suffering an injustice.  In the case of every house that was let in this country prior to the introduction of the 1935 Budget, the owner is suffering an injustice.  He let it on the basis that he had to pay a certain amount of rates and taxes, and he suddenly finds, when the Minister introduces his Bill, that his rent is decreased.  If the arrangement is, as sometimes happens, that the rent is to be inclusive of rates and taxes, then he loses in that connection.  If the rent is over and above taxes, that means over and above all taxes except income-tax, the owner is still hit.  The Minister may go to the Registry of Deeds, or to any house agent, and ask how many houses were let before the introduction of the Budget last year and in respect of every one of these <Col N="230" /> persons a grave injustice has been done.  We ask, not that that injustice be remedied, but that further injustice should cease by the deletion of the section from the Act of 1935.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made great play that there has been no injustice done to any person who has purchased a house.  I should like to compare the case of two people, A and B. A has, let us say, £700 to invest, and he purchases a house.  He entered into that transaction after making careful calculations as to the yield he would get from purchasing that house.  On the other hand, B decided that he would not buy a house, and invested the money in some security which gave him a certain yield of interest.  Does the Minister deny that as between those two people, A and B, the action of the Government has worsened the yield from one class of security as against another.  What we complain of on this side of the House is that there is a discrimination as between one type of investor and another.  I do not suggest that there is any personal bias or anything like that on the part of the Minister, but it is most undesirable to single out one section of the community for a tax that does not fall on the rest of the community.  I think if the Minister wants to look for injustice he need not go past that aspect of the matter.</P>

I understand that the Minister, when he was introducing his Budget, made great play of this section as one of those under which he was giving substantial relief to the community.  I want to be quite sure that he is not taking back with one hand what he has given with the other.  In the case of professional people who would come under this section it has been the practice to allow replacements of their machinery.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is now intended to continue to allow replacements of machinery and also to allow wear and <Col N="231" /> tear of existing machinery?  If it is not, I am afraid he has left people very much as they were.  However, I hope he will answer quite clearly as to whether the existing practice of allowing renewals is to be discontinued, or whether it will be continued along with this new allowance for wear and tear of machinery.</P>

This particular concession extends the same allowance in the case of plant and machinery used for the purposes of a profession as is at present given for wear and tear and obsolescence of plant and machinery used for the purposes of trade.  That is the purpose of the section.  It will cost us this year about £3,000 and, possibly, next year it will cost us £6,000.  But there is only one concession given.  People can either have it in this form&mdash;and I have told the Deputy what it is going to cost&mdash;or they can have it on the present basis of replacement, but they cannot have it both ways.  Deputy Dockrell or any other trader has not got it both ways, and there is no reason why professional people should have it both ways either.  They can elect to have it one way or the other, but they cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>Well, then, is it not like Pat's blanket&mdash;as broad as it is long?  A person is now going to lose the replacement allowance and he is going to get wear and tear.  I described it as taking away with one hand what he had given with the other, and the Minister found fault with that description.  Perhaps I would not have described it in that way if he had not so enthusiastically heralded the allowance that he was making to professional people and the amount it was going to cost the Exchequer. My recollection is that the figure was £5,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course I do not know whether it is a case of Pat's blanket; I never wrapped myself in that symbolical garment.  I certainly never mentioned the figure of £5,000 in my Budget statement, and I did not make any great ado about this.  I merely mentioned that it was going to cost the Exchequer £3,000 this year and £6,000 next year.  As to the advantages or otherwise of the concession to the people concerned, I never put myself in the position of judge.  All I know is that the demand for this concession came from them, and I suppose they know what suits them best and whether or not they are going to get anything out of it.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (which relates to relief from double income tax on profits from the business of shipping) of the Finance Act, 1927 (No. 18 of No. 27), shall apply in relation to profits or gains arising from the business of air transport in like manner in all respects as it applies in relation to profits or gains arising from the business of shipping, and, in order to give effect to such application, the said Section 4 is hereby amended as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) by the insertion in sub-section (1) of the words &ldquo;or the business of air transport&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;business of shipping,&rdquo; and</P>

      <P>Their hearing may be better than the Deputy's.  However, I was merely saying that this relates to double income-tax on profits on the business of air-transport.  It is a provision that has been introduced into our statutes in compliance with an international convention.  It has nothing to do with the double income-tax agreement with Great Britain except in so far as it applies to Great Britain as well as to other States.  As a matter of fact, I think we have the same thing in regard to the United States and, possibly, Denmark.  Deputy Costello is mixing this up &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 in Part 1 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any provision of any Act or rule which authorises a claim for repayment of income-tax to be made within a specified period shall be and is hereby amended so as to authorise the making of the claim within a period of 15 years after the end of the year of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is so eminently just, so entirely reasonable in its scope and in its intendment that I have not got the slightest hope that the Minister will accept it.  The Minister has taken power under the first section of the <Col N="235" /> Bill to reopen all arrangements and agreements with income-tax payers&mdash;to reopen all past transactions and all previous assessments.  No arrangement or agreement is binding upon the Minister.  No burden of proof is imposed on the Minister before he can reopen these transactions.  No burden of proof is imposed on him before he can exercise the very drastic powers he has taken under Section 1 of the Bill. The Minister can go back, in reference to any transaction dealing with income-tax with a person who is alive, from the time when that person purports or is supposed to have earned a single penny of income up to the present moment, notwithstanding the fact that the court may have made previous assessments and notwithstanding the fact that agreements may have been made and honoured for many years and that all the references and records of transactions in connection with the case have been entirely lost and destroyed. That is the power the Minister takes.</P>
    <P>The power asked for in this amendment merely seeks that the unfortunate income-tax payer, if an error is discovered over a period more than that allowed at the present time, which, I think, is six years, should have authority and right to go back and should have the right to get that error remedied and his over-payment to the Exchequer repaid to him.  The period of 15 years is put in merely to draw the attention of the House and of the public outside to the extraordinary contrast that exists at the present moment between the rights of the taxpayer and the rights of the Revenue.  It might appear that 15 years is a long time to go back on a past and closed transaction. In normal circumstances, I would not have asked the House to authorise any such reopening of transactions after such a length of time.  I think that, in normal circumstances, six years, probably, would be sufficient, but I think that in matters of this kind there should be some reciprocity and that the injustice is so compelling and calls out so compellingly for remedy that some effort, on the part of the Minister, should be made to remedy that injustice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> Now, there have been actual cases where errors have taken place in assessments, and admittedly so, and because six years was the period existing&mdash;although it was admitted even in law, and in justice certainly, that repayment ought to be made and reconsideration ought to be given on behalf of the taxpayer&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners took refuge in the law and stated: &ldquo;We cannot do anything because of the law and because of the control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo; If the Revenue Commissioners have power, as they have been given power under Section 1 of the Act, to reopen transactions long since closed&mdash;not merely so far back as 1922, but so far back as 1913 and 1912 and subsequent to the War; any period, in fact, that the Revenue Commissioners think right in reference to a living man &mdash;I think it is a small thing to ask that a taxpayer should be entitled to reopen cases that have been closed since the establishment of this State.  That is what this amendment proposes.  As I have already said, I put it down without the slightest hope that it will be accepted.  I have no doubt that it will not be accepted, because, as I have said, it is so fair, just and reasonable, and we are coming to the stage now, in connection with income-tax and taxation generally, in this country&mdash; and I speak here now with all the gravity I can command&mdash;that injustice in connection with income-tax is at such a point that it has become almost morally open to taxpayers to take steps to evade their liabilities.  I make that statement with the full knowledge of the responsibility I have in making it&mdash; with the full knowledge that I have of the methods that are being employed to extract taxes from the people at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to know, because I have made my position clear in this House again and again in connection with Budget proposals and discussions of Finance Bills, that I do not stand, and that nobody on this side of the House stands, for anything in connection with evasions of tax by methods of fraud.  Of course, the amendment I wrote down on the paper to-day made that clear again.  I have <Col N="237" /> never stood, in this House or anywhere else, for fraud or the condonation of fraud, but the person who is best able to evade the taxes that are being imposed by the Minister and his Government; the person who is best able to evade the exactions of the Minister's officials; the person who is best able to meet the methods of those officials, is the gentleman who does not stop at fraud.  The people in whom I am interested are people who, years ago, made what they conceived to be, on proper evidence, a fair return of their income-tax in the circumstances then existing, and I am advocating in this amendment that, if a mistake arose, or if a mistake is discovered subsequently&mdash;a mistake, perhaps, due to the depredations of the Minister and his officials in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by Section 1, if it becomes law&mdash;if, as I say, a mistake is made and discovered as having taken place more than six years ago, all that this amendment asks is that that mistake should be remedied and that payments made by a taxpayer, which he was not bound to make, and which he made in circumstances under which he was not liable to make them, ought to be refunded to him and that he ought to get back from the Revenue that amount.</P>
    <P>The amount of money that will be involved as a result of the inclusion of this amendment is infinitesimal.  I will say now that I am not interested in the amount of money that is going to be got back, nor am I interested in the particular people who may be affected by this amendment.  I think that the number of people that will be affected by it will be so small as to be negligible.  I am interested, however, again, in directing public attention to this unjustifiable exercise of governmental powers, in favour of the Government, to enable them to rake money from taxpayers who will not be able to produce the necessary evidence to rebut claims made upon them, by reason of the stale demands that will be made, and to leave, as the Government intends, such a state of affairs that on one side there is the Minister and his officials with that power, and, on the other side, the taxpayers who <Col N="238" /> have not the power to reopen any transactions over a limited period of six years.  That is so unjust as to require no further comment.  I have no hope that the Minister will accede to this.  What I have hope of doing is of so harnessing public opinion outside against this Government, or any future Government that stands over proposals of the kind embodied in Section 1, that neither will be able to stay in power one day to cause hardship, injustice, torture of mind or uneasiness amongst honest taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly the Deputy has no hope that the amendment will be accepted.  The amendment does not deserve to be accepted. After all, what is the real position? The only person who knows all the facts about his income is the income-tax payer.  On the part of the Revenue Commissioners they have generally to make some sort of investigation, the <Col N="239" /> results of which depend on the honesty of the taxpayer in the first place.  If he is not as honest as he might be, or if he is more ingenious or more intelligent than the Revenue Commissioners, they may have difficulty in ascertaining what his true income is.  Again, it is the taxpayer who has all the facts, and if he, with all the facts in his knowledge, fails to make a claim within such a time as will enable the real facts to be ascertained, then it is he should suffer the penalty, and not the Revenue &mdash;not the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to retain taxpayers' money to which admittedly they are not entitled?  That is the point of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that any claim not made within the proper period is going to be a very difficult claim to investigate.  If it is not made within a reasonable time, the delay has probably arisen, by reason of the desire of the taxpayer who makes it to allow such a period to elapse that it will be difficult to discover the real facts.  Apart altogether from that, again I come back to this: that it is the taxpayer who knows the facts, and if he fails to make a claim within the proper time he ought to suffer the disabilities that his negligence imposed upon him.  On the other hand, if the Revenue Commissioners are not able to make a correct assessment within a limited period it is almost inevitable due to the fact that the true amount of the taxpayer's income has not been disclosed to them.  Therefore, they should not suffer the loss, because it is not their fault that they have not been able to ascertain it.  It is the fault of the taxpayer who did not make the real disclosure.  There is no parallel between the case of the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners. The taxpayer has it within his power to make a claim on the true facts of his income.  He knows them, and can disclose them; and if he fails to do so within a proper and reasonable time the fault is his, and the disability and the penalty should be his.  That is the position and the Deputy knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the usual flippancy, but no attempt to deal with the situation.  There was a time when the Minister was arguing against Section 1.  Certainly his argument was much more against Section 1 than against the amendment. The Revenue Commissioners and the tax-collecting body in this State are very efficient, and act as a machine. It is quite possible that in his capacity as Minister he does not realise that. But is any other Deputy unaware of it? The Revenue Commissioners seem to ignore very often the ordinary conditions of life in this country, especially the conditions under which business is being carried on.  The Minister said that the only person who knows exactly what his income is is the taxpayer. That is all right so far as a person whose income is made up of salary is concerned.  He knows his income, but I doubt very much whether the majority of persons, prior to recent activities on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, had any idea of their actual income.  Many of them did not keep books or accounts in the way in which the Revenue Commissioners apparently believe that they are kept. Every Deputy knows that men have been compelled by the Revenue Commissioners to get in auditors, not for this year or for last year, but for the last 15 years, as a result of threats of various kinds by the Revenue Commissioners. I have been told, as other Deputies have been told, by men that they had no idea up to this how they stood, or what their actual profits and losses were.  That is the way in which men conducted their business, and it is completely ignoring the actual situation as it prevails in this State, for the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners to pretend that up to ten or 15 years ago the ordinary business man knew what his income was.  He had no idea what it was and could not form an approximate idea, because he did not keep accurate accounts.  Now, as a result of the activities of the Revenue Commissioners, and of the new powers given them by this Bill, investigation has revealed to taxpayers that they were entitled to certain reliefs that they were unconscious of and that they had a right to claim.  The <Col N="241" /> injustice came out after examination by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister was quite right when he said that there was no parallel between the position of the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer.  There is not.  The balance is altogether on the side of the Revenue Commissioners, and against the unfortunate business man, who is constantly asked to keep accounts stretching over ten, 15 or 20 years concerning every item of his business. That is supposed to be fair and just because the State makes the demand, and because the State is all powerful.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,327 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Governor-General's Establishment (No. 14 of 1923).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of this Estimate are substantially the same as last year.  There is an increase of £12 in sub-head A, of which £5 is due to the normal increment in the salary of the Private Secretary and £6 is an addition to his bonus.  The increase is more than offset by a reduction of £15 in the allowance for travelling expenses, leaving a net decrease of £3 in the total amount of <Col N="242" /> the Estimate.  When speaking on this Vote last year I said that I had thought that would be the last time it would be necessary to ask the Dáil to make provision for the Governor-General's establishment.  My expectation has not been realised.  Pressure of other urgent Parliamentary business made it impracticable to introduce, as I had hoped, during the present session the contemplated proposals for the new Constitution.  The general plan of these proposals, which the Government hopes to place before the Dáil in the autumn, includes the abolition of the office of Governor-General. I may say that I am conscious of the desirability, which has more than once been stressed in discussions on this Vote, of having someone outside and above political Parties to act on public occasions as the ceremonial head of the State.  I have, however, views as to the method of appointing such a person which differ, I think, from those of the Opposition, chiefly because I feel that if we are to have an office of this kind the person holding it should have a more important function than that of appending his signature to Bills or of officiating at a garden party or a race meeting. I think that the person to act as head of the State here should be directly elected by the people and be responsible to them as the supreme guardian of their constitutional rights.  I had the creation of such an office in mind in 1921, and I have often left since that if such an office had then existed our people might have been spared much of the misery that followed.  I do not propose at this stage to say more. The full proposals will be submitted to the Dáil within a few months, and ample time will be then afforded for their discussion.  I hope that when they are brought here for discussion members of the Opposition will consider them on their merits and with a single-minded regard to the permanent interests of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. In moving this motion.  I should like to express satisfaction that the President of the Executive Council has committed himself to the <Col N="243" /> view that there should be a person who can be described as head of the State, outside the conflicts of Party politics here.  He refrained from indicating whether that person after being elected by the people, as he described, would or would not be the representative of the Crown in this country.  Perhaps he would give us an indication of his intentions on that point when he is replying.</P>
      <P>Among the many interesting things that the President said in the course of his speeches of last week, to me the most interesting was his suggestion that we could all combine in regarding as the overshadowing constitutional issue in this country, the reunion of Ireland.  I greatly regret that by an unavoidable accident I was unable to be present at the debate on the President's Department yesterday, to enlarge on that theme.  But it is germane to what he has just said to suggest to him that in coming to a conclusion upon this question of having a representative of the Crown as the ceremonial head of the State, he should take into very serious consideration its reactions upon the North of Ireland.  I could go much further, I need not say, on that topic, but I imagine it would not be in order on this particular Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is not very easy to make a speech that is in order on this Estimate.  In fact anybody who is moving to refer back the Governor&mdash;General's Estimate for reconsideration finds himself in somewhat the same position as the Governor&mdash;General does&mdash;that is to say, that what he may not do is much clearer than what he may do.  He is hedged about by all sorts of restrictions and prohibitions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;arising out of rulings on previous occasions.  It has been held not to be proper to go into any sort of full discussion as to the desirability of having such a functionary or as to the merit of the individual who is in the position of Governor&mdash;General and the manner in which he performs his duties.  But what is quite strictly relevant is to <Col N="244" /> consider whether the establishment that we are asked to provide for by this Vote is actually appropriate to the duties that the Government allows him to perform.  Now, the salary of £2,000 of the Governor&mdash;General is provided out of the Central Fund and we are not concerned with it this evening. In addition, there are various other sums provided for that are not included in this evening's Estimate, sums for stationery and printing, sums for the Gárda Síochána attached, I suppose, to the Governor&mdash;General, and for posts and Telegraphs services of the Governor&mdash;General.  These are not included in this Estimate, but in this Estimate are included some other sums for telegrams and telephones, sums for a motor&mdash;car, travelling expenses, household expenses, salaries and wages and an allowance for the household staff.</P>
      <P>It may seem a little ungracious to query these expenditures, after the President has told us that it is the last time we shall be called upon to sanction them, and also because the Governor-General has celebrated, his final year by an outstanding, sensational, and perhaps the only activity that has been connected with his tenure of office.  I refer to the exchange of cables between him and President Roosevelt on the subject of the death of his late Majesty, which the Executive Council so modestly concealed from public notice until I elicited the information by a Parliamentary question.  Because of that, and because the Estimate is not to be submitted to us again, it might seem a little ungracious to be questioning these sums were it not that a sense of public duty really compels me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was humorously said in America, in connection with the New Deal, that, under the arrangements introduced by the Brain Trust at Washington, it had become more profitable for a farmer to abstain from farming than to farm and that a man could make more money by not raising hogs than he had ever been able to make by raising hogs.  I cannot help feeling that, much as the Fianna Fáil Party used to protest against the salary and expenses allowed to the Governor-General <Col N="245" /> under the last régime when Deputy Cosgrave was President of the Executive Council, in fact what they have been doing is more extravagant, because the money that is being handed over to the present Governor&mdash;General has not to be spent at all in the public service.  I am making no insinuation against Mr. Buckley, or any reflection upon his honour or character, when I say that he has been giving absolutely no value, on account of the Government's restrictions and regulations, for the public money appropriated to the upkeep of his establishment.</P>
    <P>We have had a good deal of facetiousness on previous occasions in connection with this Vote.  We have heard the Governor-General compared to the man in the iron mask, to the invisible man, to somebody marooned on a desert island, and to a remittance man, paid so much a year as long as he keeps himself out of sight.  All these comparisons, facetious though they are, have their justification because, at the bottom of them all, there is the cast iron fact that over and above a salary of £2,000, and some other odd sums, outside this Estimate, there is a further £2,000 in this Estimate, which is being paid away to him for simply doing nothing.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should provide Mr. Buckley with a motor car or with the various officials attached to him&mdash;a chaplain and private secretary and soforth&mdash;when in fact absolutely all that is required of him is to do a little clerical work by signing his name that would be overpaid for by £200 a year, and to keep out of sight.  A total of £4,000 a year is paid to a man on the main condition that he keeps out of sight. Without any antagonism to, or reflection upon, Mr. Buckley, I would say one of two things must be happening. Either he is accumulating a fortune out of money that ought to be spent for the public benefit, or else the money must be going in some direction that was not contemplated by those who assented to the payment of that money.  The money should be spent upon State purposes and no other purposes.  So far from there <Col N="246" /> being any evidence that it is being spent rightly, all the evidence is that it cannot be spent rightly because the person receiving these sums is not allowed to do the sort of things that would make them appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is easy to mention the sort of things that the Governor-General is not doing, and it is no blame to him that he is not doing them.  He is not receiving foreign representatives in this country in the name of the King.  The President of the Executive Council has undertaken himself to act for the King on such occasions.  He is not contributing to the carrying on of the government of this country by any advice or suggestions drawn from ripe administrative experience. He is not fulfilling any function of political appeasement as between parties such as the head of the State on occasions is expected to fulfil.  He is not providing in his establishment any sort of rallying place for culture in this country.  He is not bringing people together and providing an opportunity for greater knowledge of each other and appreciation of each other by different sections of our community. A great deal could be done to bring together what used to be called the old ascendancy class and others who are not of that class.  A great deal could be done to bring together the new intellectuals and the old conservatives, and to help to weld all our people into one.  Nothing of that sort is being attempted by our present Governor-General; nor is he allowed to attempt it.  There is nothing personal against the Governor-General in my remarks.  I only repeat to-day what I have stressed each year in this Assembly, that the Government have no excuse for calling upon us to provide this money.</P>

      <P>When the county that I represent heard, some years ago, of the appointment of Mr. Donal Buckley as Governor-General, we considered it, and rightly so, an honour to the county. But in my view, not speaking in any way as a political representative, but speaking as a mere citizen, the County Kidare has found this to be rather an empty houour indeed.  The President informed us that the Vote for the <Col N="247" /> Governor-General is substantially the same as last year.  I wonder is the Governor-General himself substantially the same as last year. We do not know where he is.  Where is the Governor-General?  If an ex-serviceman wants to get a pension or to get his allowance, he has to have a certificate signed that he is alive, and he must produce that certificate.  Not so with the Governor-General.  Nobody knows where he is.  If a man is not genuinely seeking work, he is knocked off unemployment assistance.  Does the same rule apply to the Governor-General? I recall that when I pronounced the Governor-General's title in Irish last year, it brought a certain amount of laughter.  I am not going to venture to do that again, because my Irish is still in the same position in which it then was.  On one point I do not agree with Deputy MacDermot's reference to the Governor-General. That point is in relation to the Governor-General possibly augmenting his private fortune or the funds paid to the Governor-General being directed into other channels.  I may possibly assist Deputy MacDermot when I say that I do not believe he meant that reference in any kind of way which would seem mean.  As we have not anybody here to speak for the Governor-General himself&mdash;the President, when he mentions the Governor-General, does so as if he hated to have to do it&mdash;</P>

      <P>That makes the matter clearer.  In his introduction to the Vote, the President intimated that the future head of the State, however he is to be designated, would be elected by popular vote.  I hope the President will elaborate somewhat more the manner in which he intends that election should take place.  How are the candidates to be put forward, or is only one candidate to be put forward? There is one other point in connection with the Governor-General to which I should like to allude.  That is, as many <Col N="248" /> would have thought and as I think in all sincerity, that he would have thought fit, acting as he is to-day and in the position which he occupies, to be present at the funeral of the late King.  I do not know why it was not so.  After all, he is the King's direct representative here.  I am sorry to say that, in the elections taking place at the moment, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who went over to attend the King's funeral, has been the subject of attack on that account.  Possibly, if the Governor-General had been present at the funeral, it would have saved that attack on the Lord Mayor.  Whether that would be to the Lord Mayor's disadvantage or not, it is not my business to elucidate or investigate.  I hope the Governor-General will not, next year, be substantially the same as he is this year.</P>

      <P>This question of the Governor-General and his abolition is one of the points of the President's constitution-mongering scheme that are very detrimentally affecting the economic position of the country.  Therefore, it is necessary that we should be a little bit clearer than the President has left us as regards his proposals. The President has told us that, next year, the office of Governor-General will not exist, that there will be a head of the State, that this head of the State will be directly elected by the people and will be responsible to them as supreme guardian of their constitutional rights.  We should like a little more information as to what power is to be resided in a head of the State responsible to the people as the supreme guardian of their constitutional rights.  Does the President contemplate that the supreme guardian of the people's constitutional rights should have power to step in and say: &ldquo;Stop the economic war?&rdquo; Does he consider that it has anything to do with the constitutional rights of Irish farmers that a situation should be created by the Government which reduces the prices of their cattle from £18 to, say, £9 or £10?  It is very important at this particular time when, apparently, the President's proposals in connection with the Governor-General are being formulated, that we <Col N="249" /> should know whether it is intended to perpetuate a system by which the farmer suffers in that way while, in respect of export trade, the country leses from £11,000,000 to £12,000,000 a year.  Is there in the President's proposal any grain of hope that the new type of head of the State, appointed in this way, would have power, as supreme guardian of the people's constitutional rights, to step in and bring to an end the set of circumstances which are causing the people so great loss?  We should like to have information with regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also like to know, with a view to seeing whether hope is any nearer than we think, whether or not the position of Governor-General is one of those things which are in political dispute between the Free State Government and the Government of Great Britain.  When the President was dealing with his External Affairs Estimates he implied that he and his Government would be perfectly ready to sit down and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the economic differences that exist between his Government and the Government of Great Britain but that the Government of Great Britain required that, as well as bringing about a settlement of the economic matters in dispute, there should be brought about a settlement of certain political matter in dispute.  Therefore, the position of the country to-day is that no hope is extended to the people by the President or his Government that the economic damage being done by the Government's policy to the country is going to stop until a certain number of political questions between this Government and the British Government are settled.  It is important that we should have an express statement from the President as to whether or not the position of the Governor-General is one of the issues in dispute.  Twice within the last few days we have drawn attention to interviews published, as coming from the Vice-President, in Irish newspapers and French newspapers, to the effect that in 1932 they were within a measurable distance of settlement of some of these questions and that political difficulties were drawn across the issues. <Col N="250" /> Was the position of the Governor-General discussed in any of the conversations that went on?  I think in view of the statement that the President has made to the House we ought to have some explanation of these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan last night said that the President was gradually assuming the character of President Tá and President Níl in this country.  The older and less complimentary phrase of that was to describe a person as being like Leanbh Machree's dog, who ran a bit of the road with everybody.  He is in the Commonwealth of Nations and out of it; he is at war with Great Britain but is anxious to form an alliance with them; he is in the League of Nations but is thinking of leaving it; he is denouncing the Public Safety Act, but deems it his duty to use it.  Can we ever hope that the Fianna Fáil Party, led by President de Valera, will ever come down on one side of anything, or are we ever to contemplate the spectacle of the whole crowd of them trying to straddle every fence to which they come?  I believe we are now to be introduced to another face-saving device by Fianna Fáil.  We are to accomplish a government without a Governor-General.  I remember here on the occasion of the President's first election to the office that he holds now. Deputy Seán Moylan thwacking the desk when proposing the President for office and saying &ldquo;with the help of God&rdquo;, and there was a pious &ldquo;amen&rdquo; from the remainder of the members of the Party, &ldquo;I shall propose him as first President of the republic this time five years.&rdquo;  This is to save the faces of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in this addition to be in the Commonwealth and a republic; we are to be a member of the League of Nations and not a member of the League of Nations; we are to have a Governor-General and no Governor-General.  Let us face this fact calmly&mdash;our Constitution under which we are at present living requires that the law of this country to be the law must be passed by Oireachtas Eireann and receive the assent of his <Col N="251" /> Majesty the King.  The office of the Governor-General is simply to discharge the constitutional duties of the monarch within the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann, and it does not matter how the person chosen for that office is chosen.  So far as I am aware, in the long run, so long as our present constitutional status remains, the President, acting on behalf of the Executive Council, must recommend the name of some person to his Majesty, and on receiving the King's assent that person becomes Governor-General and acts for the purpose of implementing the law and in several other constitutional matters as the representative of the Sovereign in this country.</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to make any fundamental change in that Constitution, because if such proposition is in the minds of the Executive Council the country ought to know it, and if it is not, why does the President pursue the policy which has become associated with his name in the public life of this country of bewildering and deceiving the people who place their trust in him?  No one can close his eyes to the fact that there is a very considerable body of people in this country who have a profound belief and almost reverence for the person of the President of the Executive Council.  If he says that something is the case, those people pin their faith to that act of belief, the reason for which even they find it extremely difficult to understand. Their faith has led up to the conclusion that President de Valera has said it and it must be true.  Very well now, either we are to have a Governor-General or we are not.  Why does the President, enjoying the prestige he has with the people, stoop to the expedient of ambiguity in that matter?  I say that because it is stooping for somebody who has the confidence of the people not to tell them honestly what the facts are. Surely the ordinary people must have much more respect for the man who says, &ldquo;I will not declare a republic; the circumstances make it impossible for me to do so,&rdquo; than for the person who says, &ldquo;Although I know that it <Col N="252" /> is not in the best interests of the country to declare a republic, though at one time I said it was in their best interest, but, knowing now it is not, I am not prepared to do it, but I am going to try to deceive the people into the belief that I am to declare a republic when in my heart I know that I have no intention of doing so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the purpose of this grand new departure, whereby the Executive Council's nominee as Governor-General is to be elected by the people, is the sheerest piece of codology.  Because what will happen is that the Party which wins the general election will name the person they otherwise would name to the King and he will become one of the candidates on the Party panel.  That form will be gone through and some of the more innocent members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have been talking about a republic down the country will go down and say: &ldquo;This is the same as President&mdash; what is the difference?&rdquo; The average person down the country will ask himself: &ldquo;What is the difference?&rdquo; President de Valera wants us to believe that there is no difference?&rdquo; but we who understand the situation know very well where the difference comes in.  Constitutionally he remains the representative of his Majesty in Saorstát Eireann, and he is not the President of an independent republic having no association with the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Why cannot we be honest in this matter?  In this I direct my observations to the President personally. Why cannot the President realise that, having the prestige he has, he should not stoop to deceit of that kind?  I know it is clever deceit.  I know it is the kind of deceit that he can get away with, but it is deceit that will be exposed some day to the minds of the people who understand how it happens. Because some day they will discover what it is, and, having then had reason to distrust his word, their disillusion will be proportionate to the amount of confidence they have in him now.  I think the people would have more confidence in the President if he came out and said: &ldquo;I did say that I would get a republic; I now find I <Col N="253" /> cannot get a republic.  I made a mistake. Maybe we will be able to get a republic in the next generation or in the generation following that, but in the meantime we have to face facts, and the fact is that it is now in the best interests of the people to remain in the Commonwealth of Nations, and I am not going to encourage them in leaving the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe if the President had the courage to say that, 90 per cent. of his followers and a great many of ours would say: &ldquo;That is honest talk.&rdquo;  It is no discredit to any man to get up in public and say honestly that he miscalculated the future.  Mind you, the Minister for Justice to whom a tribute has been paid in this House, has earned that tribute by his disarming statement here.  He got up and said that &ldquo;it is scandalous for the present members of the Opposition to be embarrassing us; you could not blame us for doing that when in Opposition, because we did not understand; but those who sit on the Front Opposition Benches do understand what the responsibilities of office mean.&rdquo;  It was so true that there could be no excuse for anybody here acting irresponsibly, because they do not believe they have ever acted irresponsibly.  The difference between their attitude and the President's attitude to the Government in 1931 is evidence of the fact that there is responsibility here.</P>

      <P>I believe the people appreciate that.  I do not believe anyone is able to make any capital out of it.  I believe that when the Acting Minister for Justice makes a statement of that kind it cannot be used against him, because the person who tries to use it against him on a public platform will find the very admission recoiling upon himself like a boomerang.  Why cannot the President take up the same attitude?  I know the President can weave words and probably will at the end of the debate in order to involve the whole of this problem in a cloud of <Col N="254" /> incomprehensible verbiage.  But he ought to settle it in one way or the other finally&mdash;whether the Governor-General is to be the representative of His Majesty in this country or whether he is not.  If he is to be the representative of His Majesty in this country, it does not matter two straws how his identity is arrived at&mdash;whether he is nominated by the Executive Council after the general election, which is the present system, or before the general election, which is the President's present proposal, the result will be exactly the same.  These kind of things, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, are the kind of things that upset the whole country.  People do not know where they are.  One goes to bed at night and wakes up in the morning, and does not know what kind of an upheaval one will be launched into the middle of.</P>
      <P>I respectfully submit to the President that what this country wants far more than any Constitution-mongering, which he or his Ministers may feel inclined to indulge in, is peace.  We have not had peace in this country for the past 20 years.  I believe that what is in the minds of 95 per cent. of the people is: &ldquo;How long, O Lord, how long are we to go on chopping and changing and having sensations and grand declarations that the dawn of freedom is at hand?&rdquo; Peace is what the people want.  Is the country going to get it?  When is the President going to be finished with chopping and changing, and making fine distinctions as to whether people are seanascails or governors-general, or presidents of republics that do not exist?  Let him come out frankly and tell the truth.  If he does, I think he will be astonished by the measure of support which he will get from the vast majority of the people for a calm, truthful, and honest facing up to the facts that will confront our nation, whether we like it or not.</P>

If Deputy Dillon would only try to consider the matter from a sensible standpoint he would not be making speeches here and, to use a rather vulgar expression, constituting himself a nuisance.</P>

      <P>There is no need for me, I think, once more to repeat what I said last year about the person who is at present Governor-General.  That man has rendered and will, I am perfectly certain, be recognised as having rendered as great a service to this nation during those years as any man could have rendered.  The sum provided is a modest one.  The Executive Council insisted on a reasonable sum being made available for his establishment as long as he was there. It is a reasonable sum.  It is only one-sixth of the amount that was expended formerly, and I deny that any person who was in that position formerly gave any more service in reality to this State than he has given.  In fact, if I were to judge, and I think if the people of Ireland as a whole were to judge, they would say that the present occupant has rendered genuine national service by his conduct, whereas that cannot be said of those who went before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we are bringing this proposal here for the last time.  Of course, one cannot ever stop Deputy Dillon from speculating.  He will speculate about all sorts of things. He has not sense enough to wait until he knows what the proposition is, or listen to the language in which a proposition is stated, before he starts criticising it.  I said in the most unambiguous language that the proposals which we will bring forward for the new Constitution will mean the abolition of the office of Governor-General, and I hope it will be taken as equally unambiguous when I say, in reply to Deputy MacDermot, that the person who will occupy that office will be the people's representative, elected by the people and representing nobody else.  Is that definite enough?  As I have said, I do not <Col N="258" /> propose at this stage to go into these proposals any more because, as I indicated yesterday, I think it is only right that the proposals, when they come before the House, should be taken as a whole, and that they ought to be discussed as a whole and not piecemeal.  I introduced this matter at this stage simply to explain why it was that the promise that I made last year has not been kept.  I said last year that I hoped it would be the last time it would be necessary to introduce this Estimate.  The hope was not realised for the reasons I indicated this evening in my opening statement, namely, that the pressure of other work prevented us from having the new Constitution introduced in this Session, and the introduction of it would have meant the abolition of the post.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy MacDermot brought in the question of the telegram which was sent to the President of the United States.  He talked about something being hidden away. Well, when you have gentlemen like Deputy MacDermot about you may be perfectly certain that, if there was anything that could cause any trouble by misrepresentation of its effect, it would be brought out.  I read the reply, and I have no hesitation in reading it again, to the President of the United States.</P>

      <P>Did the President publish any of the telegrams?  Are our relations in connection with this matter the same as those of Dominion Prime Ministers?  Is that not an answer?  The Deputy knows perfectly well why that, <Col N="259" /> any more than other things, was not published.  We did not publish any of them.  What does the Deputy mean by hiding away?  Is not the whole of our policy perfectly well known to the people of this country and is our action not quite consistent with it?  A telegram was received from the head of a State.  A courteous reply was due and was sent in the express terms in which I, also, who got a similar telegram, replied.  The President of the Executive Council replied to the Secretary of State of the same State who sent him a similar telegram.  There was no secrecy about it, and I call it misrepresentation on the Deputy's part. It is the same sort of attitude that is adopted by Deputy Dillon&mdash;that we are deceiving the Irish people.  I doubt if ever there was put on paper before an election as explicit a statement of our policy as was put by me to the people before the last two elections.  I ask anybody to point to as detailed a carrying out of the proposals that we put before the people as there has been in our case.  I promised the people that the Oath would go, and that other things would go.  I promised the people that before the bigger constitutional changes were made that they would be consulted, and that is going to be the position.  There is no ambiguity whatever about our position.  People try to pretend that there is ambiguity in because there is evidently ambiguity in their own minds with regard to it.  As I have said, I do not want to go into the matter any more at this stage, because the proper time to deal with this is when the proposals as a whole come before the Dáil.</P>

    <P>Any provision of any Act or rule which authorises a claim for repayment of income-tax to be made within a specified period shall be and is hereby amended so as to authorise the making of the claim within a period of fifteen years after the end of the year of assessment.&mdash;(Deputy Costello.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported on this amendment, I was going on to say that the Revenue Commissioners, excellent as they are as a machine and almost as inhuman as a machine, have no real conception of the conditions of business.  I wonder whether these excellent officials were ever really <Col N="261" /> acquainted with any business, with the lives of business people, or have ever met business people in the ordinary way.  Anybody who has lived in the country, who knows farmers and business men, knows perfectly well that they have not, and never had, any exact idea as to what their net earnings are.  They may have been altogether wrong and may have underestimated their earnings.  Very often, I believe that they do quite genuinely, underestimate their earnings.  I have always found one attitude towards such underestimation, genuine underestimation on the part of such business men, by the revenue collecting machine, and that is fraud, nothing but fraud.</P>
      <P>Anybody who knows the country should be aware that that is not the explanation.  The explanation is that businesses in the country towns&mdash;I am not speaking about the cities; I do not know nearly so much about the cities as the country towns&mdash;are not run upon an exact system of book-keeping. Many of them, as a result of the operations of the Revenue Commissioners, have introduced a better system now.  They have been compelled to adopt that course by the Revenue Commissioners to investigate into the past.  If that investigation goes against them they will have to pay out under the provisions of this measure.  Surely it is mere equity to demand that they should have a similar concession on their side, that if they find they did not claim what they were entitled to claim, and if they contend that they thought their business was a more paying concern than it really was, as sometimes happens, they should be allowed to claim back if they paid to the Revenue Commissioners more than was due. Is there anything unfair in asking that exactly the same principle should apply to them as applies to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should the Statute of Limitations, and I admit it is an excellent statute, be scrapped only for the powerful and not for the weak?  The revenue collecting machine is a powerful machine and I do not think that <Col N="262" /> those who operate that machine, often in a machine-like fashion&mdash;possibly all the more efficient from the collecting point of view&mdash;have any conception of the psychological effect it has on many business people in the country. Why, it almost drives many of them to despair; they feel they are absolutely helpless in front of an institution of that kind.  They know perfectly well, they are often convinced, that their case is just, but they feel they are not able to make it against the Revenue Commissioners.  I have met men brought almost to the verge of insanity by that particular feeling. They may have been wrong, but they were genuinely convinced that they were being fleeced by the Revenue Commissioners and they had no remedy.</P>
    <P>If that is their attitude towards the machinery of the Revenue Commissioners, why should they not get this benefit?  Why should the Statute of Limitations be repealed in this one-sided fashion?  Why only for that powerful, terrifying Government machine and not for the person who is daily becoming more helpless, namely, the taxpayer?  The amendment is, in my opinion, eminently reasonable, but I am afraid it is quite obvious that Deputy Costello was quite justified in his pessimism and in feeling that its reasonableness could not make any appeal to the present Minister for Finance.  But that does not absolve the House from doing its duty in this respect; that does not justify the House in committing an injustice by refusing to give the same measure of even-handed justice to the taxpayer that it gives to the tax-collecting machine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is only explained by the fact that he has no genuine grounds for his refusal to accept this amendment.  He purports to misunderstand some of the sentences I uttered when I was moving this amendment.  I will repeat that the reason I did not think this amendment would be accepted is because it is so just and reasonable and its basis is that of reciprocity.  If the Revenue Commissioners have power to reopen closed transactions, if they have power <Col N="263" /> to ask a taxpayer to tell them what his income was 30 or 40 years ago and to make him pay on alleged mistakes that were made 30 years ago, surely it is only just that on the taxpayer proving in court, if necessary, that he has paid to the Revenue Commissioners more than six years ago something which he was not legally bound to pay, the Revenue Commissioners should refund that money to him.</P>
      <P>The Minister will find if he looks up the records of the Revenue Commissioners that there are in fact cases of such genuine overpayments, payments in connection with which I believe the inspector of taxes concerned would readily admit that it was a payment that was made by the taxpayer without any necessity and made through a genuine mistake on the part of both parties, the inspector and the taxpayer. If the Revenue Commissioners have all the powers they have got under the Minister's Budget and that will be conferred on them perpetually by this measure, it is a small thing to ask on behalf of a taxpayer that he should get his legal rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave only two coherent reasons that I could follow for his objection to this amendment.  He said the taxpayer is the one person who knows his income and therefore he ought to be bound by his mistakes. Let us examine that.  Who is the taxpayer up against?  He is up against experts in a very difficult branch of the law.  He is up against people whose job it is to collect the last farthing they can lay their hands upon and who are under no obligation, moral or legal, to tell the taxpayer what his rights are.  You have here a man who is working so hard that he allows his accounts to get into arrear and possible into a mess.  In order not to be bothered with the exactions and the worries of tax officials, he neglects to make claims for relief to which he is legally entitled.  It is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to collect all the taxes they can.  He does not learn of his rights to relief until years afterwards.  There are cases in which even minors are involved under trusts of a will.  They are unable to <Col N="264" /> recover the taxes paid during their minority because the six years have elapsed.  Is that justice or equity, or is there any answer to such a claim as that?  There is none, and the Minister can make none.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the second branch of his so-called reply, says that if the claim is not made within six years it is difficult to investigate it because it is not made within a reasonable time. If it is difficult for the Minister to investigate the claim made by a taxpayer seven years after he has made a payment which he was not legally bound to make, if it is difficult for his expert officials who have all the records before them in their offices, every minute in connection with the case preserved in the records of the Department, every step of the case on paper, every account that was furnished, every payment made, every item of the claim sifted and considered to the last degree&mdash;if it is difficult for the Minister and his officials to investigate such a claim, how much more difficult is it for a taxpayer who is asked 40 years afterwards, when all his evidence is lost, to show that he did not make a claim that some official says he made?  Let us even put it at seven years.  Why should it be more difficult for the Minister to investigate that claim?  In the case of a payment which was obviously unlawful, and which has been made without legal justification, why should it be unreasonable to ask the Revenue Commissioners to pay that back to the taxpayer on his establishing in court, if necessary, the fact that it was unlawfully made?  The truth of the matter is that the Minister is very hard pressed in his effort to get taxes in every direction, notwithstanding his glib statement to-day&mdash; which was, of course, disproved in his Budget statement&mdash;that the revenue is so grand and that the country is becoming so prosperous that the income-tax is coming in like water out of a spout.  Notwithstanding all that, he has to resort to every possible device that his trained officials in the Revenue Department can consider to extract every few pounds out of the pockets of the taxpayers who probably are not legally bound to pay it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> I think, as I said at the beginning, that the claim which I make in this amendment is unanswerable in equity and in ordinary common justice, but I have no possible hope that it will be acceded to by the Minister, for the reason that his Government is so hard pressed for taxes to enable them to continue their mad career of spending that they must resort to this class of thing, which, in my view, as I have indicated on a previous amendment, will so exasperate the taxpayers and in the end cause such disrespect for the Revenue Commissioners and for revenue methods that the taxpayers will eventually arrive at the conclusion that they are morally entitled to take every possible method to avoid payment of their taxes.  The net result of that will be that the dishonest people will get away with it.  The honest people will not be able to resort to those methods and will be made to pay for the methods of the dishonest taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 in Part I to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The charge of excess profits duty effected by Part III of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, and the Acts amending or extending that Act in reference to such charge is hereby repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, Sir, is to endeavour to repeal the provisions of the Income-Tax Act of 1915, which imposed the charge for excess profits duty.  The grounds for the amendment and the reasons for the amendment may be stated in a very few words.  It is about time that the charge for excess profits duty was wiped off our Statute Book.  It is about time this fiction that people did not pay their excess profits duty in 1915 should be put an end to.  Above all things, it is about time that those provisions should cease to be used as a further instrument of tyranny to extract payments which in my view are not due by taxpayers throughout the country.  In any event, in my opinion the provisions <Col N="266" /> relating to excess profits duty have long since been exhausted, and, as I say, ought to be wiped off the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>This charge for excess profits duty was imposed during the European War&mdash;very shortly after it had started &mdash;when it became apparent that people were making profits out of the European War.  In 1915, by the Finance Act of that year, the charge for excess profits duty was imposed. It was intended to meet the situation created by the possibility of war profiteering.  Twenty-one years after that charge was created we, in a State which did not exist when that charge was imposed for the first time, are using it to extract money for the revenue out of the taxpayers of this country, and it is being used&mdash;I say it with all sense of responsibility&mdash;quite improperly and quite unjustly.  The provisions of the Income-Tax Act of 1933, which extended the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in reference to excess profits duty, were, in my view, something that this House, while it had the lawful authority to pass them, had no moral justification for passing. In 1915 this charge was imposed.  We may take it that the British Revenue extracted out of the business people of this country as much money as they could.  We may take it that in 1922, when the Free State was established, when a new Government was set up, and when, in order to finance the depredations caused by the civil war, every possible pocket had to be searched in order to provide the £35,000,000 damage which was caused by the Party now forming the Government, as much money as possible was got as a result of this tax.</P>
    <P>In 1926 the last Government called a halt and said: &ldquo;We have done enough about this excess profits duty. Except in cases of fraud or wilful neglect we will not have any more of it.&rdquo; I am speaking roughly now; that is the general effect of it.  That situation existed for seven years&mdash;from 1926 to 1933.  In 1933 the Minister introduced provisions into the Finance Act of that year which gave extraordinary powers to the Revenue Commissioners in connection <Col N="267" /> with Excess Profits Duty&mdash;this out-of-date charge&mdash;provisions which, in my view, are used for improper purposes.  I do not use the words &ldquo;improper purposes&rdquo; in the ordinary sense, but rather in a technical sense. I will illustrate what I mean by referring to one of the provisions of the Finance Act of 1933.  If a business is being sold at the present time the purchase of that business cannot be concluded until the Revenue Commissioners give a certificate that Excess Profits Duty has been paid.  No matter through how many hands that business has passed from 1915 to the present time, a period of 21 years, that transaction cannot be concluded until the Revenue Commissioners give a certificate that they have no claim to Excess Profits Duty.  What is that used for?  They will give no certificate until they get paid for it.  They will give no certificate until Excess Profits Duty is paid.  That section is being used for the purpose of extracting Excess Profits Duty; that is why I say it is being used improperly.</P>
    <P>Two people come along, one saying: &ldquo;I have sold this house,&rdquo; and the other saying: &ldquo;I have bought it.&rdquo; In order to conclude that transaction a certificate must be got to the effect that there is no charge for Excess Profits Duty.  The Revenue Commissioners, quite properly doing their job under the direction of the Government, say: &ldquo;Well, we do not know whether Excess Profits Duty has been paid or not.  We will raise an assessment.&rdquo; The parties are then faced with this situation, that that sale cannot be concluded for years if they dispute the revenue claim.  In order to put an end to the revenue claim, and to get that certificate, as business people they say: &ldquo;We will cut our losses and try to compound with the revenue.&rdquo; They pay the Excess Profits Duty, for which in 99 per cent. of the cases they are not liable.  I say it is about time that stopped.  I think I referred to the case of public house A. Perhaps I should not identify it so specifically.  The Minister smiles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Public house A was assessed for income tax.  The owner did not owe any income-tax, and was able to show that, but in effect what was said to him was: &ldquo;Pay something in income-tax or we will assess you for Excess Profits Duty on public house B, which you bought in 1929 from somebody who bought it from somebody else who carried on business in 1919.  If you do not pay the tax you do not owe on public house A, you will have to pay Excess Profits Duty on the profits which two or three of your predecessors made in 1919.&rdquo;  I say that is an improper use of the powers given to the Revenue Commissioners by the provisions of the Act of 1935.  Again I stress the point in the public interest that the powers should not be used in that way, because it will bring disrespect for the law; it will bring disrespect for the Revenue Commissioners; and it will eventually hamper the collection of revenue.  It will not merely hamper the collection of revenue and impede it, but it will make it exceedingly difficult ever to collect revenue from even honest taxpayers when they see such penal provisions put into an Act.  Now, penal provisions, perhaps, have no binding force in conscience. I do not know, nor will I express any view on that, but I know that it is very easy for a taxpayer to be able to tell himself that a law that is used in that way by expert officials in a harassing fashion is not binding on him in morality, whatever it may be in law, and that he is entitled to use every device, legal or illegal, to outwit the expert officials who are on him like hounds after a fox.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, in fact, it does not matter how the Deputy looks at it.  People who, after all the discussion and controversy that there has been about this question of liability to Excess Profits Duty, do not disclose the fact that they had made themselves liable to Excess Profits Duty in earlier years, must be, in my <Col N="270" /> view at any rate, if not in the view of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and, of course, I am not the judge in the matter&mdash;guilty of something bordering very close on fraud or wilful neglect. In any case, however, if it was legitimate and proper&mdash;and I contend that it was legitimate and proper&mdash; to collect the revenue yielded by this duty prior to 1932, there is no reason why we should forego that revenue now, particularly when so much better use is being made of the revenues of this State.  The proposal which the Deputy has put down, supported by the speech to which we have just listened, would mean that from now on, and for a further number of years, we should lose at least £200,000 per annum, and it must be remembered have to take this Excess Profits Duty people who cannot afford to pay or from people who do not owe it.  We have to take this Excess Profits Duty as a whole, and to remember in connection with it that, if the State has been collecting Excess Profits Duty for a number of years, in the earlier years, when the duty was enforced, very heavy repayments had been made in regard to it.  Now the Excess Profits Duty is not, as the Deputy seems to think&mdash;any more than is any other revenue duty&mdash;a perquisite of one particular Administration, to be utilised by them for their purposes and to carry out their policy, and then to be abandoned by their successors. We should come to a pretty pass indeed if we were to be told that, because our predecessors had imposed a tax on tea or sugar for the particular purposes for which they wanted moneys which were raised as a result of these taxes, their successors, when they went out of office, were to be debarred from imposing the same taxes.  The State is a continuity. It is a Corporation; it is continuing.</P>

      <P>It is a definite continuing <Col N="271" /> entity, if the Deputy wishes to split hairs about it.  There is no sincerity behind this amendment of the Deputy's.  No person has been called upon to pay Excess Profits Duty who has not been in a position to pay, and there is no such person from whom the State may not justly have demanded it.  If it was proper for the administration which the Deputy supported to have searched every pocket as he said to defray the cost of a civil war, it is the right of any other Government that takes office in this country to search the same pocket in order to wage war against poverty and unemployment, as we are doing. I cannot see any merit in the argument the Deputy has put before the House in order to bolster up this most misconceived amendment of his. He is charging it as offence by the Revenue Commissioners, in connection with certain transactions, that they make certain that any taxes which might be due to the State by one party to that transaction must be paid before they will give him a clear certificate that they have been paid.  What else can they do in the discharge of their statutory obligations to the State?  In a case where they have clear reason to believe that what has been due to the State has not been paid, are they to give the defaulting taxpayer in that case a clearance from his liabilities?  Yet, that has been the gravamen of the charge which the Deputy launched against them, that they do their duty, and see that the taxes are paid before they give any person a clear receipt. I cannot see that there is any wrong or any hardship in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every citizen in the State has to pay his due meed of taxes.  If he is not so well placed as those people who are affected by Excess Profits Duty, if he does not happen to be one of the people who are so well circumstanced that they have to pay property tax of one sort or another, if he happens to be a workman or a farmer&mdash;and God knows we have heard often enough from Deputy Costello's colleagues about the position of the farmers and the workmen&mdash;if a person of that sort does not want to pay taxes he has to forego <Col N="272" /> some of the necessaries of life.  He has to forego tea, sugar, tobacco, porter and entertainment.  If he wants to get away without paying taxes he has to deny himself these things.  Why should the class for whom Deputy Costello speaks, the person who is wealthy, the person who has made this money at the general expense of the body of taxpayers not pay?  Make no mistake about it, the term Excess Profits Duty is no misnomer.  These profits were derived from buying cheap and selling dear during a period when prices were mounting.  So far as businessmen or shopkeepers were concerned, it represents in general exorbitant profits upon goods which they had to retail, and the exorbitant profits were in general provided by the community.  I think there is scarcely a tax that can be so justified as this Excess Profits Duty can be justified in relation to that particular period.  These persons held these taxes, and held them, as I say, unjustly, and if we get it from them we are entitled by every canon of justice and equity to get it.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the position in this House to-day were to revert back to the position in 1930 or 1931, we would have the administration supported by Deputy Costello enforcing the collection of this tax as we are doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>A complete answer to that last observation of the Minister is that the people who form the Opposition here now formed the Government in 1926 and repealed the provisions of the Act of 1915 except in cases of fraud and wilful neglect.  I make the Minister a present of cases of fraud and wilful neglect.  I object to this stale demand being made, and more particularly object to tax being demanded from people who do not owe it.  The Minister made a speech which ran to greater heights of nonsense than I thought was possible for the Minister to go in this connection.  In some of the other amendments he excelled himself in dodging the issue by deliberately making a series of platitudinous observations which had nothing whatever to do with the topic we were discussing. He reached the quintessence in this <Col N="273" /> one.  He made a speech about war and poverty as if he were, in fact, making war on poverty.  Incidentally, let me remark, he is creating poverty.  We are not dealing in this amendment with taxation imposed by Parliament on those who made profits, or who were justly bound to pay their due share of taxation.  The Minister conveniently forgets, and certainly did not deal with the provisions of the Act of 1933, which made a person, who had no connection with a business, when the profits were made, pay for the profits made by his predecessor.  The actual case I referred to is one of a man who bought business premises in 1929.  The profits, if any profits were made, were made in 1915. There were various people concerned in the business between 1915 and 1929. The premises were sold in the open market in 1929, on the basis of the law as it then was in reference to excess profits duty, but seven years after that transaction, a demand was made on the man who does not owe excess profits duty and who never made a halfpenny profit in the business, because he did not own it in 1915.  He was asked to pay.  How the Minister could get over that set of facts in his platitudinous observations I cannot understand.  He made profound observations about poverty, and of the duty of the people to pay and that sort of humbug, but overlooked the fact that people are being asked to pay who are not bound to pay; that people are being asked to pay excess profits duty who never made excess profits duty, and had no connection, good, bad or indifferent, with the business in relation to which the assessment is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Budget proposals I drew the attention of the Minister to an actual case, speaking from my own experience of it, and not speaking in the air.  Nobody is asked, the Minister retorted, to wage war on poverty and unemployment, moryah, and nobody is asked to pay something that he does not owe.  What about the assessment for excess profits made last year on a farmer?  It is quite clear, on the face of the Act of 1915, that a farmer cannot be assessed for excess profits duty.  I saw that the assessment was raised, not for the purpose of getting excess profits duty <Col N="274" /> but in order to try to find out some extraneous information which would enable the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps, to assess the individual in question for some other purpose.  My client was a man of 84 or 85 years of age, and as he had several strokes of paralysis, in the opinion of his doctor, if he was told, he would have died.  The whole case went on, on my advice, without the man knowing about it.  We appealed to the special commissioners of income-tax and we were asked to produce accounts.  They are called capital accounts.  I know nothing about accountancy, but this man who is carrying on the business of a farmer was asked to produce capital accounts.  They are something that accountants have to produce, but they had nothing to do with the man's business as a farmer.  The special commissioners made an order to produce such accounts.  There is no power to make such an order, but they did so.  We then appealed to the Circuit judge and the case was to come on in the country in due course. I had no shadow of doubt, from the first time I was consulted in the case, that there was no jurisdiction for this assessment, and I was further convinced, as the case went on, that it was not for the purpose of getting excess profits the assessment was made but for other purposes.  The day before the case was to come on we received information that the Revenue Commissioners had consented to the assessment being discharged. After the family had been worried for 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I could give plenty more.  I know all the facts but I do not want to worry the House.  If I have left out any fact which is relevant the Minister can produce it.  A demand for excess profits duty was made on that farmer, but the Revenue Commissioners assented before it came to court to its being discharged.  They kept the bluff up to the last minute. I can bluff pretty well myself, but I had no doubt whatever that the case would have to be discharged in the <Col N="275" /> Circuit Court.  What was the result? That man could not be told or worried about the case or he would be dead. That was the opinion of his medical attendant.  A son of his, an elderly man, conducted the whole business. It went on for a considerable period. I do not know the extent of the cost to which the taxpayer was put, but I know that he had to employ counsel in connection with the appeal, and had to employ an accountant to deal with the demands of the revenue authorities. He was out of pocket several hundred pounds at the very least, which he can never recover, in reference to a wholly unsustainable demand. Provisions of that kind in a Bill of this nature should not be allowed to stand on the Statute Book of this country.</P>

      <P>At any rate he has mentioned this case about the man who was a farmer.  The Deputy knows as well as I do, in connection with this particular case, that the question was whether the person was only a farmer, whether he had not made very considerable profits, running into tens of thousands of pounds, out of an ancillary business, the business of cattle dealing.  The Deputy knows that the question had not been decided as to whether profits derived in the particular circumstances in which they were derived in this case, from the business of cattle dealing, came within the ambit of the definition of husbandry. When the assessment was made that was still an open question. <Col N="276" /> The Revenue Commissioners and the Inspector of Taxes who made the assessment were quite entitled to proceed on the assumption that profits derived from carrying on a cattle-dealing business were properly assessable for taxes.  That was the question at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Deputy's clients coming into court a similar case was tried before the Circuit Court judge before whom this case was going to be heard, and after a long and reasoned argument, after taking time to consider his judgment and indicating that there was a great deal to be said for the contention of the Revenue Commissioners as well as, admittedly, there was a great deal to be said against it, he did deliver a lengthy judgment in favour of the taxpayer, whose case was somewhat similar to that which Deputy Costello has mentioned in this House.  Now, we have been told about the methods of the Revenue Commissioners.  What did they do in this case?  The moment it was clear that the law favoured the taxpayer to whom Deputy Costello has referred they withdrew the assessment. They intimated to the taxpayer's legal advisers that they were prepared to withdraw the assessment.  Of course it was said that they had to go in and have the assessment discharged by court order.  That was not the seeking of the Revenue Commissioners.  Before the assessment was discharged by agreement, by court order, they had agreed to withdraw it.  That is the point the Deputy put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the one case that he dealt with, shall I say, with any preciseness in this House.  What do we find?  That there was a question as to whether a person who had admittedly made substantial profits, running into tens of thousands of pounds, was assessable for taxes or not.  It was an open question. Another taxpayer had contested the authority of the Revenue Commissioners to make an assessment in a <Col N="277" /> somewhat similar case.  He won his case before the Circuit Court judge, and at once the assessment in the second case was dropped.  It was agreed that it should be discharged by court order.  That is the whole foundation for Deputy Costello's speech here to-night.  Charges have been bandied about in this House as to the way in which revenue is collected and as to the manner in which the law, which is devised to protect the honest taxpayer, is enforced.  Remember this: the dishonest taxpayer does not defraud the Revenue.  The Government has to get a certain amount of money to carry on services of which the Dáil has approved.  If the State does not get that money from every taxpayer according to what is properly due by him, if some taxpayers are able by various devices, subterfuges and concealments, wilful or otherwise, to avoid paying what is justly due to the Exchequer, other taxpayers&mdash;people who are in receipt of salaries and others who have a proper conscience in this matter, who have a better sense of public duty, who are prepared to pay their way&mdash; have to make good the dishonest man's default.  It is not the Revenue loses. We have to make good at the expense of the honest man what we have been cheated out of by the dishonest man. Since this Government came into office it has made up its mind that taxes would be collected efficiently, and, in so far as we are endeavouring to make those who are in default in their proper obligations to the State meet these obligations, we are protecting the honest man and the honest citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has allowed his rhetoric about the dishonest citizen and the dishonest taxpayer to run away with him.  Let me make clear that I have no sympathy with the dishonest taxpayer.  The people being harassed are not dishonest taxpayers, in the main.  The dishonest taxpayers are well able to look after themselves.  They are able to look after themselves as efficiently as the Revenue Commissioners are able to do their work and they get away with it very often.  It is the honest taxpayers who are being harassed and <Col N="278" /> worried, I can say, without exaggeration or hyperbole, even to the grave. These are the people with whom I am in sympathy, the people I am defending in this House.  The honest taxpayer who suffers from a conscience is not able to get away with fraud but in order to save himself from worry he pays money which he knows he is not bound to pay to the Revenue.  The Exchequer of this country has gained very largely from that class of thing during the last four years.  Yet this is the Government which masquerades as a Government that made up its mind that taxes were going to be collected efficiently and that the honest taxpayer would not be allowed to suffer.  May I say that the Minister has not stated correctly the point at issue in the case to which I referred at all?  The point in that case was not whether cattle dealing was assessable, as a farming business, to excess profits duty.  The question was whether the man was a farmer or was engaged in cattle dealing&mdash;an entirely different proposition.  One was a question of law, the other a question of fact.  On the question of fact the man took the stand: &ldquo;I never dealt in cattle in my life.  I did ordinary farming and made money during the war, and, unlike many another farmer, I kept it.&rdquo;  He told that to the Revenue Commissioners. He made the case from start to finish that he never engaged in the cattle business as a dealer.  The point of law which the Minister has tried to get away with was not involved in that case at all.  He was not asked by the Revenue Commissioners whether he was a cattle dealer.  He was asked to produce his accounts so that they could look through his books to see if they could harass him in any other direction.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House much longer on this amendment.  Deputy Costello said that he is not in favour of dishonest taxpayers. I am afraid that, like myself, his memory may not always serve him. I see that in volume 62 of the Official Reports, column 456, Deputy Costello said on May 14th: &ldquo;If they have not been discovered the perpetrators of the frauds are entitled to get away with <Col N="279" /> them.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be applauding the fox who is able to get away with the goose.</P>

I think now I have given the Minister a sufficient lecture on legal principles.  If the Minister wants any more tuition I would refer him to some lecturer on the ordinary law of contracts, and on principles of equity.  If he has not all the information he wants perhaps he would apply to some Deputies in this House who have been newly called to the Irish Bar and are fresh from their lectures at King's Inns.</P>

I say that after the lapse of a certain time the principles are applied there, as in ordinary cases, that a man should be allowed to get away with his fraud in the interest of the community.  The principle that underlies these Statutes of Limitation in the cases of fraud is because Statutes of Limitation are called Statutes of Repose.  That is the reason that even equity allows fraud to be condoned even if perpetrated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6, in Part I to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case in which agreement has been arrived at (whether before or after the passing of this Act) between the Revenue Commissioners, an inspector <Col N="281" /> of taxes or any person on their behalf respectively and any person charged with or assessed to or alleged to be liable to be charged with or assessed to income tax, surtax or excess profits duty in reference to the liability of such person to any such tax or duty or the amount or payment of any such tax or duty or in reference to any matter or thing connected with or incidental thereto every such agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This amendment again is so reasonable that its very reasonableness, I am afraid, destroys its chance of being accepted.  The amendment means this, that if a taxpayer makes an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners, or with the inspector of taxes, that agreement shall be binding.  That seems to me to be reasonable in every respect. Everybody knows that a taxpayer comes to the inspector of taxes and, in the same way as a man carrying on his ordinary business would make a business proposition, makes his arrangements. The inspector may say: &ldquo;You owe me so much,&rdquo; and the taxpayer may say: &ldquo;I owe you nothing,&rdquo; but eventually they come to an agreement. Neither side gets away with his demand.  A compromise is arrived at and is binding for both parties and never can be reopened except in the case of fraud.  I want to secure that any arrangement reached bona fide between a taxpayer and an inspector of taxes or the Revenue Commissioners or anyone on their behalf should be incapable of being repudiated.  As the law stands, irrespective of fraud or anything else, an inspector of taxes or the Revenue Commissioners can repudiate an honourable agreement arrived at with the taxpayer and reopen it years afterwards.  I think that is not just or right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously impossible to accept this amendment.  Everyone knows an inspector of taxes has no power to make anything in the nature of a settlement.  He can make an assessment according to law, and I think the Revenue Commissioners are <Col N="282" /> in the same position as regards assessments made by them.  Settlements <i>per se</i> have not been made.  Where the taxpayer, however, has made a full disclosure of his liabilities for the past years for which he has been not assessed, the Revenue Commissioners, in the light of the information given, have intimated that they are prepared to accept a definite sum in satisfaction of all duties and penalties up to a specified date, it has not been, and will not be, the practice to reopen such cases. That is a very different matter to what is proposed here in this amendment. As the amendment is worded it would debar a reopening in any case, and, accordingly, it is obviously impossible to accept it.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding any enactment, rule or law or practice to the contrary an appeal shall lie to the Circuit Court from any and every rule, order or decision of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax.</P>
      <P>I have ceased to expect the Minister to give any reason why amendments of this kind should not be given the consideration they deserve.  This amendment was partially discussed on the Courts of Justice Bill.  Its object is to provide that, in every case, there shall be an appeal from the Special Commissioners of Income Tax to the Circuit judge.  What is the objection to that amendment?  I suppose that, in 90 per cent. of the cases that come before the Special Commissioners, an appeal lies.  The general rule is that an appeal lies from the Special Commissioners to the Circuit judge.  Why should not that apply in every case? Perhaps the Minister would tell me why, before I develop the case further?</P>

      <P>I can and shall make the case.  Apart from the question of waste of time, I do not wish to go into the case fully because I developed these matters on the Courts of Justice Bill.  I shall, however, make the case fully but very briefly for the Minister. The Special Commissioners of Income Tax are civil servants.  They are part of the office of the Revenue Commissioners. They exercise quasi-judicial, if not judicial, functions of very vital import to the taxpayers. They perform a useful function and they do it well.  I make no reflection whatever on the Special Commissioners but I say it is better the taxpayer should be left under no sense of grievance.  The ordinary taxpayer knows that these two men who hear his appeal from the inspector of taxes who has assessed him are officials of the Revenue Commissioners.  My recollection is that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners or the solicitor to the Revenue Commissioners could be a Special Commissioner of Income Tax.  They do not, in fact or in practice, so act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is not. The important fact that underlines and emphasises the point I am making is that, to the ordinary taxpayer coming to make his case before the Special Commissioners, these men are civil servants, officials of the Revenue Commissioners, part of the Revenue Commissioners' staff and, consequently in the eyes of the taxpayer, may not be trusted to give him a fair deal. I have made quite clear that I think they do give a fair deal to the taxpayer, but I am speaking of people of whom I have considerably more experience than the Minister.  The ordinary litigant is suspicious to the last degree&mdash;suspicious even of the independent judiciary.  In every case of importance, an appeal does lie from the Special Commissioners to the Circuit judge.  Only a small residue of matters appears to lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Commissioners.  One of the matters is, I think, the question of reliefs. They are matters of some importance to the small taxpayer.  The smaller he is, the greater the importance of these matters to him.  I see no reason why, remembering that in matters of great importance&mdash;the amount of the assessment, the liability to be assessed and other matters of that kind&mdash;there is appeal, as of right, to the Circuit judge, exclusive jurisdiction should be given in minor matters to the Special Commissioners.  I think that that is due to oversight.  If I had adverted to that matter when I had any responsibility, I would have urged amendment of the law and I shall do so at the appropriate moment if the Minister is not prepared to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Commissioners are civil servants whose salaries are borne on the Vote of the Revenue Commissioners. They hold office at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council. They are hearing cases of vital importance to the taxpayers.  These facts are in themselves sufficient to cast doubt in the minds of the taxpayers. Even if that doubt be unreasoning and unreasonable, it ought to be removed.  It will conduce, in my opinion, to the respect taxpayers will have for the decisions of the Special Commissioners if they know that over <Col N="286" /> and above them there is a judicial tribunal in the fullest sense of the term to whom they may appeal in the event of their being of opinion that justice has been denied them by the Special Commissioners, whether they are right or wrong in that opinion.  I cannot see any reason why that appeal should not be given.  The last point I shall make is well known to the Minister.  It is better that this point should not be further developed. The Special Commissioners are exercising judicial functions.  So long as there is an appeal from them to the Circuit judge, there is a protection against a constitutional point being raised as to their jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Costello's attitude to this amendment.  He has made a statement and, if I heard it correctly, it is rather an extraordinary one.  He said that the reason the right of appeal in certain cases had not been given was because of an oversight.  There have been at least three instances in the financial statutes passed since 1924 which gave the right of appeal from the Revenue.  Commissioners to the Special Commissioners and on a point of law to the High Court but expressly ruled out the claim for rehearing by the Circuit judge.</P>

      <P>This particular section has, in any event, so far even as there have been four recent amendments specifically ruled out, the right of appeal from the Special Commissioners, except only on points of law to the High Court.  There have been four amendments of that description since 1924&mdash;two of them before Deputy Costello became Attorney-General and two of them after. I have cited the three earlier ones. Again, the Finance Act of 1930 provided expressly that the decision of the Special Commissioners in connection with an application under Section 4 should be final and conclusive. I think the House ought to understand what the present position is.  Of course the attempt is made here to prejudice the whole position by saying that the Special Commissioners are civil servants.  They are, and always have been, civil servants, by reason of the fact they have held their position under the tenure of civil servants, but they are as independent in the exercise of their functions as any member of the judiciary.  Not even Deputy Costello has ever said that there has been any attempt to influence them improperly in giving their decision. That, of course, is the essence of the matter&mdash;that they are a perfectly fair, just and impartial tribunal.  There is no reason to throw any suspicion on them.  The manner in which the Deputy tried to do it here this evening was to say that they were civil servants.  I have a high regard for the <Col N="288" /> probity, honour, uprightness and virtue of civil servants.  I have been tremendously impressed during the four years I have been in office by the manner in which civil servants try to do their duty independently of any consideration, without seeking to curry any favour with Ministers or anyone else and with a just regard to what is properly due to the taxpayer.  But apart altogether from the fact that they are members of this very honourable body, the Special Commissioners are particularly secured.  No person will dare to influence them.  They have a status by custom and law. They have been established by custom and law as a fair tribunal in this matter.  I am perfectly certain that no man of honour would occupy their position if he did not feel himself able to do justice between the Revenue Commissioners on the one hand and the taxpayers on the other.</P>
      <P>What is the position?  The present position broadly is this: that there is an appeal to the Special Commissioners against every assessment of income-tax.  The taxpayer, if he so desires, has the right to require that after the appeal there may be a rehearing by the Circuit judge.  The Revenue Commissioners have not that right.  They have to abide by the decision of the Special Commissioners.  The taxpayers or the Revenue Commissioners can require the Special Commissioners to state a case for the High Court on a point of law, but so far as any appeal to the Circuit Court is concerned, the taxpayer has a right to have his case reheard in the Circuit Court and the Revenue Commissioners have not.  As I have said already, this system has worked well for over 80 years.  Our predecessors, who brought in four new statutory provisions relating to applications and rehearing from the Special Commissioners, saw no reason for a change, and in my view no reason has been adduced to-night for making a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the Minister dragged it in himself.  He said that these men forming the Special Commissioners are an impartial and just tribunal.  I entirely agree.  I never said they were just and impartial, because it was not necessary to say so. To insist on it is an insult to these gentlemen, because it is an accepted fact that they are a just and impartial tribunal.  But the District Court is a just and impartial tribunal and there is an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court, and it is no reflection on the justice and impartiality of the District Court that there should be such an appeal.  The Circuit Court is a just and impartial tribunal, but there is an appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court, and it is no reflection on the justice and impartiality of the Circuit judges that there should be this appeal.  There is an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court, and that is no reflection on the impartiality and justice of the High Court.  Why the Minister should get up and use his clap-trap for the purpose of confusing the issue is capable of only one explanation, and that is that he has no reasonable argument to offer against this amendment. It is not the justice and impartiality of the Special Commissioners of which I complain.  I say it is good for any inferior tribunal to have an appeal to some higher tribunal, irrespective of to whom that appeal is to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite good for their morale and decisions.  It is a necessity for the taxpayer in this case.  It is not the justice or impartiality that I am complaining about.  But, like the District Court, they are not always right; like the Circuit Court they <Col N="290" /> are not always right.  Even the High Court has on frequent occasions been set right by the Supreme Court.  That is all I am asking in the amendment, that from a body, which is in fact a civil service body, just and impartial as all civil service bodies are, who have not always been right in their decisions, there should be an appeal to a judicial tribunal.  It is not merely proper that there should be such an appeal, but I think it is a constitutional right that there should be, in accordance with the Constitution.  That is what I am asking for in the amendment.  I do not care whether the appeal is to the Circuit judge in most cases or in all cases, so long as there is an appeal to some judicial tribunal to satisfy the taxpayers and give them confidence in the administration of the revenue laws, which they have not got at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down certain amendments to this section which have been declared out of order.  At the same time, I suppose I can mention some matters arising under the section.  This section is in many ways an extraordinary one.  As I have stated before, the duties imposed under this section run from 39 per cent. as high as 500 per cent. on various articles of glass.  The Minister stated that he hoped at the present price to do an export trade in glass, and that the price would not exceed the present price charged by more than 10 per cent.  I should like to ask the Minister what exactly the 10 per cent. excess means.  Is that calculated on the normal world price of foreign glass delivered in this country, packed in cases, because I want to see what <Col N="291" /> we are comparing the price with?  In other words, is the Minister taking the glass manufactured in this country at the factory as against the glass brought into this country and saying that the price will not exceed the price of the imported article by more than 10 per cent?  I am sure that the Minister when replying will clear that up.  If that is so, it seems extraordinary that protective duties are required for an article such as that, and at a price such as that, as high as 500 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the section to which I should like to draw attention&mdash;the extraordinary passion of the present Government for putting on tariffs on a whole host of articles that are not going to be manufactured, or are not likely to be manufactured in this country, in order to protect a limited range of articles.  Under the Emergency Duties Act, which I consider in some cases has been improperly used for putting on protective or revenue duties, the Government can put on a duty in five minutes.  Yet a whole range of articles is protected, and the commercial community, and the general public whom they serve, are put to the trouble and expense of applying for licences, permits, or quotas.  To show that the dread of the commercial community of quotas is well founded, I shall refer to one article which is very much before the public at the moment, namely, cement.  The commercial community had to go to the expense of getting auditors to certify their returns for cement and various quotas were made out and allotted.  Now, apparently, that has all gone by the board.  However, let that go by the board, too, because cement has nothing to do with glass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, and I am not belittling in any way the industry which has been started, the company are going to make sheet glass, rolled-plate, wire-drove plate, and some patterns of figured rolled-plate glass.  They are also going to do silvering and bevelling. That, as I am informed, is the entire range of the company's activities. If they like to extend their activities, which I do not object to in <Col N="292" /> any way, the Government can put on protective duties on the articles they are going to manufacture in five minutes.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this section.  The Government might as well describe the articles accurately.  Would the Minister say what is plate glass?  That is not a trap question.  What I am anxious about is to find out what he understands by plate glass, because that is a matter that will crop up in an aggravated form if the section, as at present worded, is passed.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in any of these sections of polished plate glass.  What, according to the Minister's idea, is coloured plate glass, or under what section does it come?  I will not say that these things are improperly described but I do say that they are unitelligible to people in the trade.  One of the reasons why my amendments have been ruled out of order is that I took the trade meaning of plate glass, and understood it to mean polished plate glass.  To illustrate the difficulties and the expense that the commercial community will be put to with no possible benefit that I can see to the company who are manufacturing glass, I would like to read for the House a list of the various kinds of glasses that the company are not manufacturing and have no intention of manufacturing: bent sheet glass of all kinds; bent polished plate glass of all kinds, coloured glass, all kinds; vitrolite or other opalescent, vita glass, polished plate glass, marbrite, marmoreen, prismatic, maximum, enamelled, glass domes, round and oval; armoured plate, clear or coloured. I suggest to the Minister that there is not the slightest intention on the part of the company to manufacture any one of these kinds of glasses.</P>
    <P>When I said that the company were about to manufacture certain patterns of figured rolled plate-glass, I made the Minister a present of an enormous range in doing so.  Would the Minister explain what is the difficulty in specifying that there is to be a protective duty of whatever size he considers necessary on sheet-glass and rolled plate-glass, wired if he likes, and figured rolled plate-glass?  The company, <Col N="293" /> of course, can do the silvering and the bevelling.  The Minister can put that in also although it is somewhat controversial.  Would the Minister say what is the difficulty in specifying plainly the articles that the company are going to manufacture? The list of glasses that I have read out will give Deputies some idea of the difficulties that confront people carrying on the glass trade in the way of asking for permits or getting licences for the importation of the big range of glasses that will not be manufactured here.  What possible competition can there be in the case of these glasses?</P>
    <P>I have referred to vitrolite or other opalescent glasses.  That is the raw material for those who are manufacturing what are known in the trade as splash packs which are put at the back of lavatory basins with perhaps a mirror on them.  What is the good in making difficulties for getting raw material for a particular trade?  Surely all these glasses that I have read out might be omitted from the section for the present? If the Government, or some company, liked to spend £250,000 in putting up polished plate-glass works they can put on a protective duty or a prohibitive tariff to encourage that class of manufacture and I will not complain.  We on this side consider that where an article is going to be made in this country, honestly and properly, those engaged in its manufacture are entitled to a protective duty.  What we do object to is this awful system of licences and permits on things that have nothing to do with a particular article, that confers no benefit on the country and only brings discredit on those engaged in the manufacture of that particular article. I would ask the Minister to deal with these points when he is replying.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wanted to get a reply to the points that he has raised he would have been well advised to have given some notice of his intention to raise them.  I could not follow all the Deputy's remarks, but I was able to do so sufficiently to say that he is obviously misinformed concerning the intentions of the company <Col N="294" /> which is going to manufacture glass in the Saorstát.  The company, I understand, propose to manufacture figured glass and roll glass as well as certain classes of vitrolite and of safety glass.  With regard to the armoured plate-glass. I presume, it is the same description of article otherwise described as reinforced glass, and, if so, the company propose to make reinforced glass.  They do not propose to make coloured glass, but we cannot exclude coloured glass from the scope of the duty because apparently ordinary plate-glass is coloured, and there would be some danger of evasion of duty if the definition of the duty were so drawn as to exclude from its scope coloured plate-glass.  Consequently, it is necessary to deal with that difficulty by means of a licensing provision.</P>
      <P>So far as ordinary coloured glass is concerned, licences will be issued on application.  There will be no restriction on its importation, and the sole reason why it is not possible to exclude it from the scope of the duty is the difficulty, with regard to the defination, which I have given.  So far as bent glass is concerned, there is not very much of it being imported.  The company do not propose to manufacture it.  We may, perhaps be able to frame an amendment to exclude bent glass from the scope of the duty. Apart from that, it is not desirable, I think, to alter the provision in the section.  If the Deputy looks into the matter he will find that the various suggestions that he has made would be inappropriate, having regard to the manufacturing programme of the company and the definition difficulties likely to arise.</P>

      <P>I must really controvert some of the statements made by <Col N="295" /> the Minister.  He is confusing armoured plate, clear or coloured, and reinforced, which is his own word, with what we in the trade call wired.  Now, wired, I imagine, is the same as what is described here in paragraph (a) as reinforced. Armoured plate, clear or coloured, is an entirely different substance. That is hardened by an electrolytic process, and is the raw material of some of the shop fitters.  I merely mention that, so far as I know, the company have not the slightest intention of manufacturing that; it is supplied in tremendous thicknesses. The Minister spoke about polished plate glass being coloured.  That is a thing I wish to question; I deny it is coloured.  I suppose the Minister knows what coloured plate glass is. For instance, the doors coming in here into this apartment have polished plate glass, and there is the faintest tinge of green possible in some of them.  Now, others are absolutely crystal clear.  I do not think, if the Minister considers the matter, that there would be the slightest difficulty in separating polished plate and some other sections &mdash;a whole lot of these&mdash;from the sections he is anxious to protect. Having accepted the principle, I am not going to ask the Minister to specify what he will accept and what he will not accept.  If he is prepared to look into this matter between now and the Report Stage, I am perfectly satisfied.</P>

      <P>I think we can meet the Deputy so far as bent glass is concerned. We were very much concerned to exclude coloured glass, if it were possible to do so, without opening an avenue for the evasion of the duty.  I do not think we will be able to get over the difficulty of coloured glass except by means of the licensing provisions. It is in respect of these two classes that the difficulty will arise.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that the plate-glass will exclude itself on the question of price, because polished plate is many times dearer than drawn sheets, and there is not the slightest danger that I can see. However, I do not want to enter into an argument with the Minister.  As <Col N="296" /> regards prismatic, enamelled glass domes, round and oval, surely you could cut those out?  However, we have now got down to arguing about details, and it would probably be better to postpone that.  I suggest to the Minister that as he has given way on bent glass, polished plate can be left out altogether.  Of course he will probably take powers to silver polished plate.  I expect he will want to exempt it, and very properly, because it is silvered in this country. There are certain others of these sections that are just as clear-cut, and it is not possible to have them confounded with the others.  However, I leave that to the Minister.</P>

    <P>This amendment is proposed for the convenience of cinema proprietors. The returns furnished to the Revenue Commissioners by proprietors who pay duty on the basis of certified returns are in respect of the week commencing with Sunday, and the adoption of a day in mid-week for the date of the first operation of an altered scale of rates of duty causes extra trouble and may lead in some cases to confusion.

Under these two amendments it is proposed not to bring the duty into operation until the 23rd August, instead of 1st July as originally anticipated and it is also proposed to reduce the statutory minimum for the live element in the entertainment from 50 per cent. to 35 per cent.  It will permit them to have greater flexibility in the arrangement of their programme, and will meet, I think, fairly satisfactorily, the new situation which has been created.</P>

      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> (1)  There shall be allowed in respect of beer brewed in Saorstát Eireann on and after the 6th day of October, 1936, the following rebate from the Excise duty now payable in respect thereof, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the case of beer brewed by a brewer for sale for every 32 gallons of beer of whatever original gravity charged with duty and delivered from the brewery, a rebate of one pound, or where the duty now payable in respect of thirty-two gallons of any beer so charged and delivered is less than two pounds four shillings, a rebate equal to the amount by which that duty exceeds the sum of one pounds four shillings; and so in proportion for any less quantity.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Excise drawback now payable on the exportation of any beer or on the deposit thereof in a warehouse for exportation from Saorstát Eireann as merchandise or for ship's stores shall unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that no rebate has been allowed in respect of that beer under this section be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the rebate allowable under this section in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall be deemed to have effect as from the 6th day of October, 1936.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Revenue Commissioners may make such regulations as they consider necessary for the purpose of carrying this section into effect, and in particular for the purpose of facilitating and controlling the calculation of the amount of the rebate to be allowed under this section and with respect to the method of computing the quantity of the beer in respect of which rebate is to be allowed.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this amendment is pretty well worn, because it has been brought forward in connection with Finance Bills here from year to year. It asks the Minister to see the reasonableness of agreeing to a reduction in the interests of the working class people of the country, the people who mainly consume beer of the light or the heavier forms.  From any angle I am quite sure that the Minister is conversant <Col N="301" /> with all the facts and figures which I could put before him to-night. Members of the licensed trade have been very active this year, as they have been in other years, in laying a full statement of the case before the Minister, both from the point of view of the heavy exactions made upon them because of the continuance of war time taxation in normal times, and the hardship that that is inflicting upon the country generally.  There are various view-points that ought to influence the Minister to give this matter his very favourable consideration.  First, from the point of view of employment, there has certainly been a great reduction in employment through the diminution of the drinking of beer in the country. The loss to the barley growers would be something in the region of 500,000 barrels per annum, caused by the decreased consumption owing to war prices at a time when we have not war conditions.  That carries in its train also, of course, a loss of employment in the distribution, and a loss to coopers and other people who have incidental employment in the manufacture and distribution of this native beverage.</P>
    <P>It cannot be that the Minister is influenced by financial reasons, because it has been clearly proven on the other side of the water that when they wanted to increase the revenue they did it by reduction of the taxes on beer to a reasonable figure.  There have been results to justify that.  When they maintain a high level of taxation they lose revenue in the long run.  It is estimated that if the concession sought in this amendment were conceded in regard to plain porter, as it is known here in Dublin, there will be an estimated loss of between £200,000 and £270,000 in a complete year.  This amendment deals only with the period from 6th October, which would be just about half a year.  But that estimated figure will have to be taken in relation to the absolute certainty of an increased consumption which I think it would be reasonable to assume would more than counteract or counterbalance any estimated loss.  I do not think, therefore, that the Minister would dream of objecting to this amendment from the point of view of loss of <Col N="302" /> revenue.  He certainly could not resist it from the point of view of the interest that the Government has and must have in trying to cope with the unemployment menace.  Any and every avenue ought to be explored to try to provide employment for our people.</P>
    <P>What then can be the Minister's idea in resisting this amendment, if he will resist it, which I hope he will not? There can only be one reason, and that is the fear of increased drunkenness among our people.  This is a matter which caused very serious discussion throughout the country during the régime of this Government and also of their predecessors.  It is a very thorny subject, and one that many Deputies are diffident about tackling, but I think it ought to be courageously faced up to.  We ought to ask ourselves if we are going to be a race of teetotallers, or if we are going to be a nation following on the lines that Russia and America found to be unsuitable for them and eventually had to abandon&mdash;the lines of total prohibition.  If there is going to be the drinking of a pint allowed in this country, it is not reasonable to expect that the working-class people of this State should be asked to have their drink at such a prohibitive cost in comparison to the price which must be paid for the same drink in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  Personally, I would be very sorry to see anything done here which would lead to increased drunkenness in the country, but I have not the least fear that the reduction sought for in this amendment would have that effect.  In fact, I believe it would lead to more careful and beneficial use of the beverages of beer and stout.</P>
    <P>Anybody conversant with working-class conditions knows it is unreasonable to suggest that beer and stout can be treated as luxuries in relation to working-class people.  Dockers and people of that kind engaged in very laborious occupations do a good deal of their work on the sustenance which they draw from stout and porter.  It is their main beverage, and in some cases their food.  If a man is confined to a limited expenditure in the week&mdash;as working-class people are, <Col N="303" /> owing to the wages they receive&mdash;the first thing he has got to do is to contribute what the household needs for its requirements during the week, and what is left is all the working man can hope to have for the enjoyment of his leisure hours.  From a study of this question, what I feel is happening is this: The working man finds he has a certain limited amount of money left after providing his wife with what is necessary for the week's budget, and he says: &ldquo;This is not going to last me all the week, so I might as well spend it all on Friday night.&rdquo;  Consequently, he has more pints than are good for him on Friday night and on Saturday. I suggest that if the drink were not quite so prohibitive in price he would be able to spread that money over the week, and have a pint or two per night, which would be a nourishment for him, instead of having it all on one night.  This is a very prosaic and common-place discussion on what is a very common-place topic, and one which ought to be faced up to.  I am inclined to believe that the Minister's idea in resisting a diminution in duties is not because of a fear that he would lose revenue&mdash;he knows he would not&mdash; and not, as I said, because he is ignoring the necessity for increased employment; I feel it is because of his fear that any reduction in beer duties is going inevitably to lead to increased drunkenness in our country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an inquiry into the statistics of the drink evil in the country in recent years will show that the major portion of the drunkenness cases tried by the district justices are not concerned with people who drink beer, who are mainly the working class people.  The higher percentage of cases causing investigation by the Gárdaí and the district justices comes from that section of the community who drink something more high-falutin and lofty&mdash;champagne, wines and whiskey.  I think it would be very well worth while inquiring into that matter, if that is the reason at the back of the Minister's mind for objecting to this reduction.  If he has not got it at the back of his mind it is at the back of the minds of a lot of very influential people <Col N="304" /> in this country who are trying to tie us down rigidly to the assumption that any opening of this door is going inevitably to lead to definite drunkenness. I do suggest that those pioneer methods are not necessary not desirable nor advisable to-day.  Pioneering methods call for muscular and robust tactics at the outset, but after that the pioneers do not continue those rough muscular tactics.  They adopt much less drastic methods, which are more suitable to the needs of the occasion. I suggest that it is not now necessary to adopt pioneering tactics in dealing with the drink menace in this country. I believe there is no greater danger amongst our Irish people of sitting back into excessive drinking than there is amongst any other people in the world.</P>
    <P>I do seriously suggest that the Minister should look calmly into this matter, and I think he ought to deal with it on very broad lines.  I feel that in various parts of this House, whether on the Government Benches, the Opposition Benches or the Labour Benches, there are very definite views on this question, and I should like to have recorded the views of the elected Deputies of this House on the question of beer duties.  I have carefully avoided dealing with spirit duties.  That is quite another question.  I am mainly concerned with duties on stout and porter.  I think it would be very desirable in the interests of the country's progress as a whole that a decision should be taken in this House&mdash;free from Party trammels.  As I said outside the House, we have plenty of expression given to views on the question.</P>
    <P>We have various contending Parties, each of them fanatical, perhaps, in their own points of view and with not a good deal of common-sense between them.  You do not get common-sense in extremes, and perhaps, sometimes, you do not get common-sense between extremes either.  I should like to have, for once, a free expression of opinion of the Deputies of this House on this matter and I think, if it would not be too much to ask the Minister to do so, he ought to allow this matter to <Col N="305" /> be tested by a free vote of the House. I do not think he need have much fear that his revenue would suffer by this reduction.  The estimated loss would be only about £250,000 for 12 months, and we are only asking for half of that.  I think that the increased consumption would counterbalance that.  At any rate, it would be surely worth the experiment for one half-year&mdash;from next October to next March&mdash;in order to see how it would work out.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is inclined to agree to the proposed reduction, I shall not ask for any vote of the House, but if he is inclined to be adamant on the matter I shall press it.  If he does not see his way to accept the proposal in the spirit in which I have moved it, I think he would be doing himself and the country a service by allowing a free vote of the Deputies of this House in order that we might see where we stand on the matter.  If he allows a free vote of the House, I shall be quite prepared to agree with the decision of the House; but I feel fairly certain that we would have a majority of supporters from both the Fianna Fáil and other Parties in favour of the proposal.  I think this is a perfectly fair and reasonable amendment. Its purpose is to reduce the price of the working-man's pint and it would enable him, when he is hospitably inclined, to treat his friend.  Correspondingly, there would be a similar reduction in the price of the pint of stout where stout is the favourite beverage, as it is in my part of the country and, indeed, in most parts of the country, I understand.  As a matter of fact, if it were known in Limerick that I was here advocating some reduction in the duty on porter and not advocating a reduction in the duty on stout, I am afraid I might not go home again.  Down there they consider porter too light and only use it for washing hearses.  I believe the Minister would be well warranted in giving the experiment a chance as from next October to the end of the next financial year.  As I have said, he will not suffer any loss and, although he will not gain much, I am certain that he will gain a little; and he will have the added advantage of being the first Minister to have the courage <Col N="306" /> to break away from this tradition which has been inflicted upon us and that has now reached the stage in which it ought to be broken away from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment standing in the name of Deputy Keyes.  With Deputy Keyes. I should like to see an expression of opinion given by Deputies from all parts of the House on this question. I think that the time has come when there should be some remission of wartime taxation on the drink of the common people of this State of ours. There will be, to certain sections, great benefit by the reduction.  It will be a relief to the worker in his weekly outlay of wages.  It is a necessity for a great many workers and, in fact, in some occupations people could not very well do without a little drink. Apart from that, it would provide an impetus to barely growing and would help generally in creating more employment.  Now, as against that, I suppose there will be objections to it by&mdash;I will not say the temperance people, but by, say, the total abstainers.  Now, total abstainers, in many cases, are intemperate themselves in that they are not at all temperate in their views as regard other people.  Of course, I do not say that they are all like that.  However, there will be objections to any remission of the present taxation on the ground that such remission would tend to increase drunkenness.  I do not think there is any fear of that whatsoever. I think that, even with the proposed reduction, the ordinary pint of stout or pint of porter will still be dear enough to prevent the ordinary man from drinking more than is good for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an objection in other quarters&mdash;and perhaps it needs a man as courageous as Deputy Keyes to venture to get up and speak against people of certain views&mdash;to the effect that any reduction in the price of drink will have a tendency to impair the general morality of the people. Now, I for one will always be against that point of view.  As I have said, I do not believe that a small remission of the beer duties will have any <Col N="307" /> effect whatsoever as regards drunkenness. I do not believe that a small or even a big reduction will have any effect as regards the general morality of the people.  One does not wish to go into that particular subject too deeply, but if we take a number of years, extending back to 50 years ago if you like, you will find that the tendency to certain classes of vice was not any greater when there was more drink.  In fact, there has been an increase in certain classes of vice where there has been the least consumption of drink.  I think it can be refuted definitely that the consumption of drink leads to vices other than drunkenness, if you like, and that it can also be refuted that there is less danger of drunkenness while drink is at a prohibitive price.  The proposed reduction is not very much and the danger, if there is any, will not be very great.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that, if that were the only argument against a reduction in the price of drink, it is a false argument.  I have always believed that you cannot cure vice by the infliction of taxation. Deputy Keyes, I think, said that the greatest drunkards are not to be found amongst the workers and that the workers are the people who can afford to spend least on drink.  I agree. With Deputy Keyes, I believe that the greatest drunkards are to be found amongst the people who have more money to spend, and, apart from that, it is well known that a man who is a drunkard will get drink no matter what the price or what taxation is put on.  If he is a confirmed drunkard he will beg, borrow or steal to get drink.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the ordinary individual who wants a drink of necessity, or who likes a drink, should not have it.  The majority of drinkers will be temperate in their drinking.  There was a time, perhaps, in this State when amusements were not as plentiful as they are now, and when drink was very cheap, when there was occasionally a tendency on the part of some people to drink a little too much.  That goes back nearly to the days of the Barmecides. <Col N="308" /> As far as I can see, there is no possibility of drink ever being as cheap again.  We will never go back to the days when the poor man's pint was 1½d.  As there is no possibility that drink will ever be as cheap, there will be no danger of drunkenness, and any argument to the contrary does not hold. I do not agree with those who are confirmed teetotallers, and who look with disfavour on anyone who takes a drink. I hope this discussion will go on for two days, and that all Deputies will give their views on the question.  I happen to be a total abstainer, but I do not agree with those total abstainers who see nothing good in those who drink with judgment, and do not take too much.  I do not think that point of view should be considered.  I do not agree with those who think there is danger to morality by a slight increase in the consumption of drink.  That argument can be refuted by anyone who takes the trouble to look up the records.</P>
    <P>Possibly what will cause the Minister most concern is the financial aspect.  I do not think he need have any great fears there.  It is almost certain, if there is a reduction in the duties, that There can be increased consumption without any danger of drunkenness. Any loss on the financial end will be more than made up, and while he might not look on a loss with equanimity for the first half-year, the loss will gradually diminish.  In the end I am not quite sure but there would be rather a gain than a loss to the Exchequer.  I do not see any argument that cannot be met by a better argument by those who are supporting this proposal.  Attempts have been made for a number of years to get a remission of these duties, and possibly every year helps a bit, and that we will get further away from the days when this huge incubus is necessary. I suggest that the time has now arrived for doing so, and I appeal to the Minister to take his courage in his hands and do it now.  I believe he has some of the ideals that I am trying to express in this regard.  I do not believe that the Minister really feels that eventually there will be any great loss to the Exchequer if a reduction <Col N="309" /> is made.  I urge Deputies to look on this matter as it ought to be looked on, in a calm and, I hope, intelligent way.  They should view the things that can be said for and against; on the one hand, the dangers that there might be if it could be proved that there would be dangers, and, on the other hand, the gain that there would be to many sections of the community if the Minister agrees to this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment moved by Deputy Keyes. I do not know whether we can hope that this year will be marked by the acceptance of the principle, that it is time to give some reduction in the enormous duties on beer, spirits and wine&mdash;particularly on beer.  We should be clear on this point, that there is not very much to be said for the view of persons who are absolutely opposed to any reduction in the duties, apart from whether the State could afford the reduction or not.  I refer to persons who take the view that any reduction, no matter how modest, is going to result in increased drunkenness.  I do not believe that it will.  I do not believe, in present circumstances, that price determines, to the same extent as it would years ago, whether there would be drunkenness or not.  The habits of the people and conditions generally have changed so much that price is not the same factor to-day that it was in the old days.  We are faced with this position, that over the last 12 years there has been a reduction, approximately, of 50 per cent. in the consumption not only of beer and spirits but wines.  That reduction has made itself felt in many ways.  The State has lost very considerable sums in revenue, and that revenue has had to be found in other directions.  It has also made itself felt in the employment that was given when the consumption was nearly double what it is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It affected the barely situation in this country.  I do not want to stress unduly, or to exaggerate, the importance of the use of barley in the manufacture of beer and spirits, but it is a big factor, and only last year we know the position in which we found ourselves, and the difficulty the Minister for Agriculture had in disposing <Col N="310" /> of the surplus barley.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister increased the admixture up to 50 per cent., it looked as if we would find ourselves at the end of the season with a surplus of from 100,000 to 150,000 barrels of barley.  In my opinion, if a reduction in the duties leads to increased consumption, I believe there could be that increased consumption without any abuse of the use of drink.  The habits of the people have changed considerably. In the old days we know that there was a fairly considerable amount of drunkenness, and that it was due to some extent, if not to a very large extent, to the conditions under which certain people had to live.  We know that for workmen&mdash;and I say workmen because, if you like, it applied particularly in their case&mdash;the only escape they had in many cases from miserable hovels of homes was into the nearest public house.  It may be said that that was going from the frying pan into the fire, but it was the fact.  In those days outside the cities there were no cinemas, theatres, plays or concerts to which people could go.  Even in country towns there were very few workmen's clubs into which they could turn to have a game of billiards or cards, so that for company sake, and not for drink, the only place where they could meet their comrades was in the public house.  Conditions are changed now, and people have a variety of ways of spending their spare time usefully after working hours.  I do not believe the modest reduction in the duties asked for would have the effect of increasing drunkenness.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, as I say, the State's point of view and one can see the difficulty, if you like, the hesitation, of the Minister for Finance in taking this step.  In that connection we have to remember what happened in Britain a few years ago.  The British Government, in an attempt to get more revenue, increased the duty by, I think, about 1d. per pint of beer, but they found that, far from getting an increased revenue, the consumption fell and I think in the following year they removed the increase.  I think I am correct in saying that the revenue from the reduced duty was almost equal to, if not greater than, that <Col N="311" /> which they had received after the imposition of the additional penny. Deputy Bennett in the course of his speech referred to the point of view of the person who is a strict teetotaller. These people, of course, are entitled to their views.  Many of them perhaps have genuine fears as to the effect of a reduction in beer and spirit duties but I do not think these fears are well-founded.  I think that, as I say, there is a necessity for a reduction.  I want to say here that I believe that, so far as certain classes of workers are concerned, a certain amount of beer or stout is not only not harmful but is positively good.  I remember in this House a very distinguished member of the House, now unfortunately dead, the late Sir James Craig, intervening in a debate somewhat similar to this.  I remember his stating in this House that as a medical man it was his opinion that for men engaged in heavy work such as dockers, flour mill workers and others of that description, provided they did not exceed two or three drinks, not only was beer not harmful but that in his opinion it was positively good.</P>
    <P>I suggest to members of the House that a reduction of a penny per pint on stout is not going to lead to drunkenness. At the same time it will lead I believe to increased consumption. If it did not, there would be no point in moving the amendment.  There has been down the years a steady decline in the revenue derived from this particular source.  There was a slight increase last year over the year before, but I think that even the Minister himself would not say that that is more than a temporary check to the downward trend.  Even from the point of view of stabilising the revenue at the low point to which it has now fallen, this is a matter which the Minister might consider purely from the business point of view.  I do not want to weary the House with arguments that have been made year after year here. There is hardly anything that one can say on this matter that has not been said before, but I should like to stress the point that I do not think there is <Col N="312" /> anything in the contention of people who say that a modest reduction in the price of beer would lead to increased drunkenness in this country. I do not believe that it would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Morrissey, I do not wish to weary the House with arguments that have been put forward in this House so often before on this subject.  I think that two years ago I moved an amendment similar in terms to the amendment which has now been moved by Deputy Keyes, and I put forward, in much greater detail than I propose to do now, the arguments in favour of this reduction.  They have been dealt with already by Deputy Keyes, Deputy Bennett and Deputy Morrissey, and it would be a waste of time if I were to go in detail into the arguments in favour of this reduction.  There are two angles from which the subject is regarded.  There is the angle of the Minister for Finance, who has to consider the possibility of a reduction in revenue as a result of the decrease in the duty that is asked for.  There is the angle also of teetotallers, who think that if a reduction is granted it will result in an increased consumption of intoxicating liquor.  I do not think that that argument should carry weight any longer in this country.  I think that, at the present time, there are few countries in the world that can be described as more sober than the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before me some figures showing the number of arrests for drunkenness in the Free State over a number of years.  If I wanted to play on words, I would describe the figures as staggering, having regard to the big reduction which they show.  I shall only go back as far as 1915.  The number of arrests in that year for drunkenness was 43,043.  In 1919 it had fallen to 15,339.  That may be described as a great argument in favour of the retention of high duties, but I think, in fact, the high duties had reached their peak in 1915.  In 1924 the number had fallen from 15,000 odd&mdash;the figure for 1919&mdash;to 6,000 odd. The figure was about the same in 1925, again 6,000 odd.  In 1934 the figure <Col N="313" /> had fallen to 3,400.  That is to say, that in the years between 1925 and 1934 the figure had fallen by 50 per cent.  There was a further fall of a couple of hundred in the following year, 1935, which is the latest year for which I have a figure.  Therefore the argument of people who advocate prohibition, if you like, or practically that, falls to the ground because there has been an extraordinary change, if I may say so, in the habits of the people of this country.  Even in the years during the war period, when money was abundant, and people could buy any quantity of drink they liked, the consumption of drink kept on falling. That simply meant that there was a change in the habits of the people and in the viewpoint of the people as regards drink and drunkenness.  I think the House need not pay any particular attention to the argument of the teetotaller or the prohibitionist that to reduce this duty would mean an increase in intemperance.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, porter and beer undoubtedly form a substantial article in what I might call the food of the working man.  I remember that in 1925, when the Intoxicating Liquor Commission was set up, the Government of the day brought over from England a certain witness. <Col N="314" /> I cannot remember his name&mdash;I have a bad memory for names&mdash;but he was a very eminent gentleman.  He had studied this question and had written a number of authoritative works on the question of the consumption of liquor.  During the war period he had been appointed by the Prime Minister to control the whole drink traffic in England, at a time when large numbers of people were working on munitions.  He was a man whose mental outlook was strongly in favour of temperance, but I do distinctly remember that he gave evidence at that Commission and he said that, in his view, no more valuable food could be given to a man who is doing heavy work&mdash;he instanced men working at the docks unloading ships&mdash;than a pint or, if you like, two pints of stout in the day with perhaps a bit of bread and cheese.  He said that beer, including in the word &ldquo;beer&rdquo; porter and stout, was a valuable article of food for the man who had to do a hard day's labour.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported, the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Thursday, 25th June, at 3 p.m.</P>
