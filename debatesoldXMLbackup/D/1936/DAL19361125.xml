      <P>Is not the Minister aware that in previous years when making an examination of the agricultural labourers' wages paid in different parts of the country it was customary, after an estimate was made and when all the returns were considered, to set aside the returns which showed a small figure, and to make a re-estimate based on the returns that showed a larger scale of wages?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the farmers of Kilworth, County <Col N="802" /> Cork, have been endeavouring to get a branch creamery of the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society erected in their parish for their convenience; that the farmers of the parish have to take their milk as far as five miles to the existing branch creameries; that the milk available for such a branch would be that of 900 cows and that the Mitchelstown Committee are demanding £12,000 before they will undertake the establishment of such a branch, and if he will have an inspector sent to inquire and report on the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that some persons interested in the establishment of a cream separating station at Kilworth interviewed the manager of Mitchelstown Co-operative Creamery and were informed that the Mitchelstown Society would give the matter consideration if a sufficient number of farmers in the Kilworth district agreed to subscribe three £1 shares per cow.  I understand also that the farmers concerned were to discuss the matter further with the Mitchelstown Committee but that they have not done so up to the present.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the Mitchelstown Society are demanding £12,000 before they would undertake the establishment of a branch creamery.  The usual arrangement is that farmers desiring creamery facilities take shares to cover the cost of the necessary buildings and equipment which, in the case of a separating station such as is proposed at Kilworth, would amount to about one-tenth of the sum mentioned.</P>
      <P>I do not think any useful purpose would be served by sending an inspector from my Department to inquire into and report on the project as I have no power to compel a creamery society to extend its operations.  The matter is one for arrangement between the farmers concerned and Mitchelstown Society.</P>

Both these schools are non-vested and as grants are not admissible for works of improvement to non-vested schools, my Department has not been able to accede to the request of the board of health in the matter.  A proposal is before my Department for the vesting of Kilmurry National School and for the improvement of the school premises. In connection with the scheme of improvements the question of the provision of a supply of drinking water for the pupils will be considered.  In the case of Farahy National School, there has been no application received <Col N="804" /> so far for the vesting of the school, but I will have the matter investigated.</P>

This is the normal practice of the Land Commission, and the question of selection and discrimination does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that it is the normal practice of the Land Commission, say, for the last two or three years, to issue annuity warrants to the sheriffs and county registrars where there are only six months' arrears due?  Is that usual?  Does the Minister say that that is the usual procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the usual procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that it is not the usual procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it is the practice now.  Is the Deputy trying to encourage people who are in arrears not to pay the arrears when they are due?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not suggesting any such thing.  There is no use, however, in giving a general answer of that kind to my question.  I know what the procedure is&mdash;I know it quite well&mdash;and I say that it has not been the practice to issue warrants where there are only six months' arrears due. Does the Land Commission intend to go on with that type of victimisation, and is it to be their practice that certain people should be selected against whom warrants are to be issued, even where there are only six months due, while other people, with two or three years of arrears, are to be left alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain people are not picked out, as the Deputy seems to suggest.  There is no discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, in reply to another question by the <Col N="808" /> Deputy, if the Deputy can give me proof that these things are happening, I will have the matter inquired into, but I am certainly not going to accept his word that they are happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál O Braonáin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that in some cases sheriffs' and county registrars' costs in land annuity collection cases have been increased as compared with last year's costs by 600 per cent.; if he will state under what authority such increases have been made, and to what fund these costs are eventually transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees payable to under-sheriffs and county registrars are fixed by the Under-Sheriffs' Fees Orders, 1926-1934.  There has been no variation in the costs payable by defaulting tenant purchasers where proceedings for recovery have been taken by way of civil bill.  On the 30th of July, 1935, the High Court decided that certain of the fees mentioned in the Under-Sheriffs' Fees Orders were not payable where proceedings were taken by the Land Commission under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933. Since the passing of the Land Act of 1936 sheriffs and county registrars are entitled to recover the same fees on warrants issued under Section 28 as they would be if proceedings had been taken by way of civil bill.</P>
      <P>Fees paid to under-sheriffs are retained by them and fees paid to county registrars are accounted for to the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  So that the fees, in some cases, have really been raised by 600 per cent. and have been pocketed by the under-sheriffs.  Is the Minister aware that, when the Act was passed, the plea of the Government, in connection with proceedings under Section 28, was that it was in order to avoid expense?  Now, however, the fees have been raised 600 per cent. and they are going into the pockets of the under-sheriffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. The fees have not been raised 600 per cent. but, as the Deputy knows, the <Col N="809" /> High Court decided that in connection with certain of the fees mentioned in the Under-Sheriffs' Fees Orders they were not entitled to recover under Section 28, and he also knows that the costs in these cases are much less now than when the Land Commission had to proceed by way of civil bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis does the Minister calculate percentages?  If fees that were once 1/7 are now 7/-, is not that 600 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the position of the sheriffs was that they could collect practically no fees, whereas the intention of the Oireachtas was that they should be able to collect the fees, and that difficulty was set right by the last Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the fees are less than they were when the thing could only be done by way of civil bill.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that acute congestion exists on the Ward Estate, townland of Kilscoghagh, Crossboyne, County Mayo, where there are ten tenants whose Poor Law Valuations are under £5 each; that the large grazing farm known as Gortanieran on that estate was retained for the relief of those tenants by the Irish Land Commission in 1923; that the said farm has been let in grazing to Messrs.  Mellett for the past 13 years, and if he will now state what steps, if any, are being taken to provide economic holdings for the tenants for whom that farm was retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A notice of intention to resume portion of the holding of Mark Mellet, in the townlands of Gortanieran and Kilscoghagh on the Ward estate, for the purpose of relieving congestion was gazetted under the provisions of Section 31 of the Land Act, <Col N="810" /> 1933, but a petition against resumption was presented by the tenant.  The hearing of this petition has been held up owing to difficulties of procedure arising out of a judicial decision concerning the powers of the Land Commission in regard to resumption under the Provisions of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1933.  The petition will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal <Col N="814" /> be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the cause of the fire which occurred during the night of Monday, the 5th day of October, 1936, at No. 164 Pearse Street and of the extension thereof to No. 163 Pearse Street, in the City of Dublin, and</P>
    <P>(b)  whether the said fire was either caused or rendered more destructive by negligence on the part of any person or persons, including negligence or unsafe methods in the carrying on of any business or in the user of any property, and, if so, the nature of such negligence or unsafe methods, and</P>
    <P>(c)  whether an adequate supply of water at a sufficient pressure was available for the extinguishing of the said fire, and whether the said fire was rendered more destructive by reason of the lack of provision of adequate measures for insuring the public safety on the part of any person or body of persons in relation to the management and control of other services, and</P>
    <P>(d)  the steps taken to extinguish the said fire and the efficiency of those steps, and if there was any lack of efficiency in relation to the extinguishing of the said fire, the nature and cause of such lack of efficiency, and</P>
    <P>(e)  the circumstances in which loss of life was occasioned by the said fire and the causes (including contributory causes) of such loss of life.</P>
    <P>An application has been received by me from the Corporation of Dublin asking me to hold a public inquiry in connection with the outbreak of fire last October at No. 164 Pearse Street, Dublin, a fire which resulted in the loss of three lives.  An inquiry under the Public Health Acts would be limited in scope.  As the matter is one of urgent public importance, a full investigation by a special tribunal is desirable.</P>

      <P>I am sure the public generally will appreciate the action of the Minister in holding this inquiry, but there is one item in the motion moved by the Minister to which I would wish to draw attention.  It is in line 11 of page 612, in paragraph (c), which reads &ldquo;reason of the lack of provision.&rdquo; That strikes me as prejudicing the issue.  Should it not read &ldquo;reason of any lack of provision&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inquire from the Minister whether in connection with the terms of this motion it would be possible for the next-of-kin of those who lost their lives in the fire, particularly in relation to paragraph (b) of the motion, to be represented, and, if so, whether the expenses provided in connection with this tribunal will be such as to enable the next-of-kin to be represented at the expense of the State?  These dependents have, as a result of the death of their breadwinners, been placed in very unfortunate circumstances.  Even such assistance as is being procured by way of public subscriptions for them is not of such a character as would enable them to meet the legal expenses incidental to their appearing before that tribunal. Does the Minister propose to assign counsel for the assistance of the relatives who desire to give evidence in connection with this unfortunate happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the corporation will be adequately represented at that inquiry by counsel for which the ratepayers of Dublin will pay.  In addition, firms interested in the matter will likewise be adequately represented so as to see that their interests will be properly looked after. The people who have particularly suffered in the matter of this fire are the people who have lost their bread-winners&mdash;the three members of the Dublin Fire Brigade.  The Minister indicated in advance that the Estimate he has brought in under Item No. 4 on the Order Paper is to meet certain expenses in connection with this tribunal.  In view of the importance of the matter and apart altogether from the terms of the motion before the House I think it is essential that <Col N="816" /> the most adequate provision would be made for supplying legal assistance to the dependents of the deceased so that they might have the proceedings of the tribunal watched very carefully from their point of view.  The Minister is aware that the circumstances of the dependents are such that the public have been moved to make certain financial provision for them, entirely in a voluntary way, in the absence of any State or municipal provision. The public have been making the type of provision that it is possible to make voluntarily, and that provision is not of the type that can be eaten into by legal expenses of the dependents at this inquiry.  I would ask that an assurance be given that funds from the municipality or the State would be made available to enable these dependents to be properly represented at the inquiry.</P>

      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Doyle, I have no objection to the change of the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; to &ldquo;any,&rdquo; if the House so desires.  I do not think that the wording as it stands does prejudge the issue in view of what has happened. As to the points raised by Deputies Norton and Mulcahy, I am informed that as far as our investigations have gone, at any rate, there does not seem to be any legal power in the Minister to provide funds for the purpose the Deputies suggest.  The Minister, I am informed, has no power to pay the expenses of legal assistance for the dependents of those who have lost their lives.  I do not know about the powers of the corporation in this matter but I have looked into the powers of the Department and I am informed by our advisers that the Minister has no legal power to do what the Deputies suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is raised by the Minister in</P>
      <P>(b)  whether the said fire was either caused or rendered more destructive by negligence on the part of any person or persons, including negligence or unsafe methods in the carrying on of any business or in the user of any property, and, if so, the nature of such negligence or unsafe methods, and</P>
      <P>That seems to imply that the firm in question will be asked to show that its methods were not unsafe, and presumably it will be sufficiently equipped with capital to come before the tribunal with the best legal assistance available, to show that so far as it was concerned there was no negligence.  Why should not the unfortunate next-of-kin of the men who lost their lives, and who are unable to meet the cost of providing legal expenses out of their resources, be met by the State, by the allocation of money for that purpose? On the one hand you will have a wealthy firm coming before the tribunal with all the legal assistance that it is possible to get, and, on the other hand, you will have a group of penniless next-of-kin coming before it, deprived of the same kind of assistance that this firm will undoubtedly employ.  I suggest to the Minister that it is possible to get through this House whatever piece of legislation is necessary to enable the next-of-kin in this unfortunate tragedy to come before the tribunal, at least on an equal standing as regards legal assistance, as the other persons who will appear before it.  If necessary, the adoption of this motion should be suspended until such time as the Minister can give these people the legal assistance that other elements appearing before the tribunal will undoubtedly have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that it would be possible to bring in a vote for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of any sum of money necessary to meet the costs of an inquiry of this kind.  I presume the costs would be about £100 or £150; they will not be an extravagant sum. The last paragraph in the motion: &ldquo;the circumstances in which loss of life was occasioned by the said fire and the causes (including contributory causes) of such loss of life&rdquo; raises a very important issue.  We know that the various municipalities have useful and efficient public services for fighting fires.  It is obvious that the fire in question caused a shock to everyone concerned with them, and for two reasons; first, the dangers, and secondly, the shock to the public conscience that no provision is available for the families of the deceased members of the brigade.  I think the Minister would be well advised to bring in an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in this case on a Vote, and also between now and the reassembly of the Dáil that he should consider what proposals his Department can make for compensating the families of the deceased.  It is not a credit to us that we should have public subscriptions for those who perform public services, who safeguard life and property, and who are prepared to take all risks, and always have done so.  Surely our statutory enactments should provide compensation in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I come here at the request of the Dublin Corporation.  I could have held the ordinary inquiry by an inspector of the Department of Local Government but, when we began to examine the possibility of getting all the evidence that might be necessary, we thought it would be much better to get the authority of the House to set up a special type of statutory tribunal authorised under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  Under the ordinary type of inquiry held by the Department of Local Government we would not have the power to force people if they were unwilling to come and give evidence.  That is why I came to the House to act.  We are anxious that everyone who can throw any light whatever on this unfortunate matter, and upon the loss of life consequent on the fire, should appear before the tribunal to give evidence.  It does not appear to us that it is the responsibility of the State to provide legal assistance for any of those for whom it is necessary, voluntarily or otherwise, to appear before the tribunal.  When this motion was first put before me I asked, if such a question was raised, whether we had authority, and I was told that, as the law stands, we have no legal authority to pay the expenses of anyone.  I understand the usual procedure in this House is that if an Estimate of this description is brought in, it has to be legalised, if it means a change in the law, by means of an amendment.  I may be wrong.  That is what I imagine should take place in this case.  There is no legal power at present, and the mere fact of passing an Estimate would not, probably, legalise payment, if the law was against giving the money, as afterwards the accounting officer would have to appear and account for it to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I may be wrong.  If it is the desire of the House that the State should bear the expense, while I do not suppose it would be a great sum, I would have to examine it again. I think it should be the responsibility of the local authority that asked for the inquiry and not of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather agree with the Minister that there ought to be legal power by which a local authority <Col N="820" /> that suggests that an inquiry should be held would be able to cover the cost of representation on behalf of the dependents in a case like this.  If the Minister says the law does not allow that, I think the House, as a whole, would agree that in this particular instance the State ought to provide the money as an indication of its mind that the dependents of those men should not bear the burden of such expense.  That should be done preparatory to the Minister making subsequently whatever change in the law may be necessary to put it into the power of local authorities in future to deal with cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the Minister looks back on the financial proceedings of this House for a number of years he will find many occasions on which Estimates were introduced for which there was no statutory authority beforehand.  The Estimate is introduced and then forms portion of a Finance Bill and is passed into law.  That gives the Minister the necessary statutory authority.  An Estimate can become legal by the mere process of the House.  If there is any doubt about the House being able to do it, there will be still more doubt about the corporation being able to do it. There you will have to have a separate Bill altogether, while here you need only make provision in your Estimate. I think the Minister is really sympathetic. We admit that the Government have met the corporation.  We merely suggest that the Minister should, logically and sympathetically, carry out the step he has already taken.  The relatives of those who have lost their lives are not in the position of private individuals, because it is quite possible that, at this inquiry, these unfortunate people may themselves be in the position, so to speak, of being on their trial to some extent.  That is implied in the terms of reference.  Therefore, I think that, for the sake of those who lost their lives, adequate counsel ought to be provided, and I am sure the Minister will meet the case.</P>

I am sure that all parts of the House will agree that these people should have the fullest possible legal assistance in putting forward their case.  I will put this matter to the corporation, who asked for the inquiry and whose responsibility it is primarily.  If they do not agree, I will bring the matter at some future date before the House.</P>

Might I also ask whether, under the terms of reference, evidence can be given or accepted that will enable either the corporation or the Government to take powers later on to prevent the storage of inflammable materials and explosives in the basement of tenement houses or, as in this case, in the basement of a shop over which there were a caretaker and his family living?</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the merits of the second point. If we started discussing that, we might get into matters that will be the subject of the inquiry.  With regard to the other matter about the auditor, I think the Deputy knows that nobody has any control over an auditor in his official acts when he is examining accounts.  He has statutory authority behind him and he is the interpreter of the statutes so far as his work of auditing is concerned.  If he makes a surcharge, it is within his province to do it.  Of course, the Minister then has to decide whether that surcharge should stand or be remitted.  I do not think there is any likelihood that any Minister would stand over a surcharge of the kind, if it were made.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main object of this Bill is to adapt to existing circumstances certain provisions of the Irish Marriage Acts regarding the appointment of licensing ministers of the Presbyterian Church and the licensing of Protestant Episcopalian Churches for the celebration of marriages.  The appointment of licensing ministers of the Presbyterian Church is governed by Section 7 of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, and the licensing of Protestant Episcopalian Churches by the 34th Section of the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law Amendment (Ireland) Act, 1870.  The appointment of the former and the licensing of the latter require the approval of the Lord Lieutenant, and it was assumed until recently that this power of approval had passed to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health by virtue of the Adaptation of Enactments Act No. 2 of 1922.  I have been advised, however, that such could only have been the case in the event of the issue of an Adaptation Order under Section 12 of that Act specifically adapting the relevant sections in the Marriage Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An order of the Executive Council adapting the provisions of the 7th Section of the Act of 1844 was issued on the 14th February, 1936, and all appointments of Presbyterian licensing ministers made after that date are quite in order.  Numerous appointments, however, were made between the date of the establishment of Saorstát Eireann and the date of that order and were approved by me or by my predecessors, and I have been advised that legislation is necessary to validate these appointments.  With regard to the other matter, that is the licensing of Protestant Episcopalian Churches, I may say that ten such churches have been licensed or relicensed for the celebration of marriages since the 6th December, 1922. In most cases my approval or the approval of my predecessors was endorsed <Col N="823" /> on the episcopal licence but in a few cases the formality was omitted. I have been advised that legislation is necessary to validate all licences granted since 6th December, 1922, and to remove any doubts which might exist as to the validity of marriages contracted in churches not validly approved since that date.  In regard to this matter, I have been approached by representatives of the Protestant Episcopalian Church who have pressed me to have the necessary legislation introduced as soon as possible.  I may say that the provisions of this Bill do not in any way cut across the provisions of the Irish Marriage Laws.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years extensive schemes for the improvement of housing, sanitary conditions and hospital services have been undertaken by local bodies. It is the established practice that expenditure on works of this nature is met by borrowing.  Otherwise it would be impossible for these bodies to finance schemes such as water supplies, sewerage works, the housing of the working classes, or to erect or improve <Col N="824" /> county institutions.  The powers of local bodies to raise loans are regulated by statutory provisions embodied in the Local Government, Public Health and Poor Law codes, and it is a condition of the exercise of such powers that the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health be first obtained.  Loans may be raised either from the Local Loans Fund which is under the control of the Minister for Finance, or from banks or other sources.  Where the amount proposed to be borrowed is advanced out of the Local Loans Fund, the consent of the Minister for Finance is required. In the case of urban authorities and county councils, borrowing powers may be exercised by means of an issue of stock in accordance with statutory regulations made for that purpose, and with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>Every loan for the financing of a permanent work is repayable over a fixed number of years and is secured by a mortgage given by the borrowing authority upon the fund or rate out of which the expenditure on the work is required by statute to be met.</P>
    <P>At the present time many public works are being undertaken by local bodies.  The House is well aware that the housing programme alone entails an outlay of several millions a year.  As development in this and other directions proceeds, there will be a continuous process of borrowing for many years to come, and one of the main purposes of this Bill is directed to securing greater safeguards for those who lend money to local bodies for the carrying out of public works.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that local bodies with very rare exceptions have a very good record for the repayment of borrowed moneys.  They have shown a willing disposition to co-operate with the Government in the initiation of works that will have a beneficial effect on the health of the whole population, and I feel confident that they have the ability and the energy to carry such works through successfully.  I would prefer, therefore, not to disturb by legislation or otherwise, the existing procedure for the securing of loans <Col N="825" /> advanced to local bodies, but in view of the magnitude of the capital expenditure involved I feel that additional powers are necessary to strengthen the position generally.  Recently an attempt was made by certain ratepayers in Listowel Urban District to repudiate all moneys borrowed by the local authority for a water supply and a housing scheme on grounds that the local authority was not properly constituted and that the amounts borrowed were in excess of the statutory limit.  The council whose validity was questioned functioned in the urban district for a period of six years without any challenge to their legal status. To permit the conduct of public affairs to be questioned after such a lapse of time would invest our whole local government administration with such an element of uncertainty that progress would be impossible.  As I have already indicated the full execution of the programme of works which local bodies have on hands will involve a very large capital expenditure.  When moneys are advanced for the carrying out of public works, whether by the State or by banks or other persons, the lenders should not be exposed to any risks in obtaining repayment of the sums advanced by reason of any challenge to the constitution of the authority to which the money was lent. This principle is expressly embodied in statutory regulations governing the exercise of borrowing powers by local bodies by means of an issue of stock. The regulations which have been in force as far back as 1892 provide as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A person taking or holding stock shall not be concerned to inquire or to make notice whether the creation or issue thereof was or was not within any statutory borrowing power of the urban authority, or otherwise in accordance with these regulations, or whether or not the urban authority or any meeting thereof was properly constituted or convened or whether or not the proceedings at any meeting of the urban authority were legal or regular, or to see to the application of any money raised by stock, or be <Col N="826" /> answerable for any loss or misapplication thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is essential in the public interest that a similar principle should be given statutory effect in respect of mortgage loans advanced to local bodies, and Section 2 of the Bill makes provision in this respect.  In addition to safeguarding the position of lenders the Bill will also afford protection to persons who have entered into or may enter into contracts with local bodies and have duly performed their parts of such contracts.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill deal respectively with the election of a particular member of a local authority, and the election of members of a local authority, and provide that such elections unless questioned within one year from the date on which the members come into office shall be deemed for all purposes to be valid.  Section 5 provides further that where the number of persons elected is less than the full number of members of the local authority, but not less than the number of members necessary to form a quorum, the validity of the constitution of the local authority following such election shall not be questioned after one year from the date on which the elected members come into office.</P>
    <P>Another important provision in the Bill is Section 9, dealing with the interpretation of Section 238 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878. That section governs the exercise of borrowing powers by sanitary authorities under the public health code.  In sub-section (2) of that section it is enacted that the sum borrowed shall not at any time exceed, with the balances of all the outstanding loans contracted by the sanitary authority under the Sanitary Acts in the whole twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed.  Originally the section applied to loans raised for housing, but subsequent enactments removed all such loans outside the limit, and the limitation imposed by the section now governs the exercise of borrowing powers for sanitary works.</P>
    <P>In the Listowel case to which I <Col N="827" /> referred the points at issue, viz., the validity of the constitution of the council and the question of borrowing in excess of the limit imposed by the Public Health Act of 1878, were recently decided in the High Court. The judge upheld the validity of the constitution of the council, but in regard to the interpretation of Section 238 (2) of the Act of 1878 he decided that the limitation imposed therein on the borrowing powers of sanitary authorities was intended to be dependent upon the net security that the local authority could offer and that the construction of the sub-section which was always observed by the Local Government Board is the correct one.  According to a note appended to Section 238 of the Act of 1878 in Vanston's Public Health, the Local Government Board interpreted &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; in sub-section (2) of that section to mean the assessable value for the purposes of a rate.  The note referred to is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Local Government Board interpret `net annual value' to mean the assessable value for the purpose of a rate, and reckon property subject to different rating, as under s. 226 of this Act and s. 62 of the Towns Improvement Act, 1854, at one-fourth only of its annual value. In the English Act the words are `assessable value for two years,' which are construed to mean twice the assessable value at any given time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Listowel case subsequently came before the Supreme Court.  The action of the plaintiffs was dismissed on the grounds that the proceedings could only have been brought before the court with the consent of the Attorney-General, which had not been sought.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill is inserted with the object of resolving the doubts which exist as to the limitation on borrowing powers of local authorities for sanitary purposes.  It validates the interpretation of Section 238 (2) of the Act of 1878 which my Department has adopted since it was set up.  I am satisfied that this interpretation is the <Col N="828" /> one which was intended by the Legislature when the 1878 Act was enacted. An examination of both the Irish and English codes relating to borrowing powers of local bodies bears out this statement.  The Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, repealed an earlier Act passed in 1874 relating to public health in Ireland.  The Act of 1874 greatly enlarged the powers of sanitary authorities in this country in regard to public health, and also made provision for a contribution from State funds towards the salaries of sanitary officers employed by local bodies for the carrying of the Act into execution.  The borrowing powers of local bodies for sanitary purposes were fixed by the Act of 1874 at twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which the money was borrowed.  This provision was in lieu of the provision contained in the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1871, which provided that the amount borrowed shall not at any time exceed in the whole the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable within the town in respect of which such money may be borrowed. The Act of 1874 therefore doubled the borrowing powers for sanitary purposes, and it will be noted that the expression &ldquo;assessable value of the premises assessable within the town in respect of which such money may be borrowed&rdquo; in the Act of 1871 was changed to &ldquo;twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed&rdquo; in the Act of 1874.</P>
    <P>The note in Vanston's Public Health, which I have already read, sets out that the limitation on borrowing by sanitary authorities in England was &ldquo;the assessable value for two years.&rdquo;  That limitation was embodied in the English Public Health Act of 1875, but that Act repealed the English Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874, which contained a similar provision in regard to borrowing by sanitary authorities in England.  The words contained in the English Act of 1874 were &ldquo;the asseasable value for two years of the premises assessable <Col N="829" /> within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed.&rdquo;  We have therefore a clear comparative view of the statutory provisions regulating the borrowing powers of sanitary authorities in this country and in England in the year 1874 when the borrowing powers of sanitary authorities were doubled in both countries. The provisions relating to Ireland were set out in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1874, and the provisions relating to England were set out in the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874. Both Acts passed through the British Parliament at the same time.  The Irish Act enacted that in lieu of &ldquo;the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable within the town in respect of which such money may be borrowed&rdquo; contained in the Act of 1871, the limitation on borrowing was to be &ldquo;twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed.&rdquo;  The English Act of 1874 enacted that in lieu of &ldquo;the assessable value for one year of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed&rdquo; contained in the English Local Government Act, 1858, the limitation or borrowing was to be &ldquo;the assessable value for two years of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The contrast between the provisions relating to borrowing in these two Acts places beyond question the intention of the Legislature in the Irish Act that the borrowing limit was to be &ldquo;twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed.&rdquo;  If assessable value were intended instead of net annual value, the statutory provision would have been in similar terms to that in the English Act of 1874.  The provisions relating to borrowing contained in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1874, were introduced by way of amendment in the Committee Stage of the Bill, and must, therefore, have received special consideration at that time.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1874, in regard to borrowing <Col N="830" /> were re-enacted in Section 238 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, with slight amendments.  I have examined a copy of the 1878 Bill as introduced into Parliament.  It is prefaced by a printed memorandum signed by the Vice-President of the Local Government Board in 1878 appended to the Bill.  This memorandum is of interest as showing the origin of the clauses in the Bill&mdash;whether taken from the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1874, or the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1871, or from the English Public Health Act, 1875.  In dealing with the clauses relating to borrowing powers, the memorandum states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Clauses 235 to 245.  These clauses re-enact existing provisions with some modifications, viz., the power to re-borrow is new, also the last paragraph of clause 236 relating to borrowing for private improvement expenses or for expenses in regard to which a part only of the urban district is liable.  Clause 241, authorising the appointment of receiver, the clauses 242 and 243, authorising the granting of rent charge for private improvement expenses, are also new.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Clause 236 of the Bill as introduced contained the regulations as to the exercise of borrowing powers.  The marginal note to the clause is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Regulations as to exercise of borrowing powers: Public Health (Ireland) Act, Section 45; Public Health (England) Act, Section 234.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The memorandum of the Vice-President referred to, read in conjunction with the reference in the marginal note to the origin of the clause, shows that paragraph (2) of Section 45 of the Irish Public Health Act of 1874, which contains the words &ldquo;twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district,&rdquo; was retained, and that the only modification made was the substitution of &ldquo;assessable value,&rdquo; being the words contained in sub-section (3) of Section 234 of the English Public Health Act of 1875, for &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; in paragraph (3) of Section 45 of the Irish Act of 1874, which dealt with the holding of public inquiries by the central authority <Col N="831" /> before giving sanction to borrowing by the sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>There is one further section in the Bill to which I desire to refer specially. It is Section 11, which deals with the interpretation of Section 3 of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921.  That Act was passed in the British Parliament to enable local authorities to obtain funds by way of temporary loans or overdrafts when it was almost impossible to collect revenue owing to the abnormal financial depression of that time.  The Act also applied to this country, and under its provisions local bodies are empowered, with the sanction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to obtain overdrafts for the purpose of providing temporarily for any current expenses that may be incurred by them in the execution or performance of any of the powers and duties, including the payment of sums due by them to meet the expenses of other authorities.  The Act was designed to meet the needs of local authorities who could not finance current expenses out of current revenue.</P>
    <P>Part of the current expenses which local authorities have to meet annually consists of the amounts due in respect of annual instalments of loans raised by them, and lest any doubt should arise as to whether the repayment of an annual instalment of principal of a loan can be met out of funds temporarily borrowed by way of overdraft, I think it advisable to make the position quite clear in this Bill.  I am anxious that borrowing for current expenses should not become a permanent feature of local administration, but for the present I am not disposed to make any alteration in the law.  There has been a decided improvement latterly in the revenue position of local bodies, and I expect that in the next few years the position will have improved so much further that they will be in a position to finance the local services without recourse to overdrafts, except for a short period at the commencement of each financial year.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill relate to matters of general administration. <Col N="832" /> Section 6 deals with borrowing for town halls; Section 7 removes the limitation on the rate in urban districts for the purposes of the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, and fixes the limit on that rate in towns not urban districts at 2/6 in the £; Section 8 amends Section 203 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, regarding the publication of advertisements in connection with the proposed compulsory acquisition of land and other rights; and Section 10 amplifies the procedure for the extension of urban districts.</P>

      <P>The House, I think&mdash;and this was the intention of the Minister&mdash;was meant to be lulled to a sense of security by the opening statement of the Minister.  Humanitarianism and piety breathed through the first couple of pages of the essay, but we might have suspected that there was something of a drastic nature&mdash;of a rather ruthless character&mdash;coming from the fact that the Minister was, more or less, seeking to shelter behind the general success of the housing policy.  That was, strictly speaking, not at all relevant to the Bill that we have before us&mdash;to what I may call the penal provisions of the Bill.  It was meant, as I say, to give a humanitarian flavour to the ruthless action that he is taking practically as regards one town.  He spoke in general terms, but, even if he had not mentioned the particular township in question, it would have been quite apparent that he might have entitled this the Listowel Bill, with a few other matters thrown in to give it an air of respectability, a general character.  It would be perhaps a mild way to describe the procedure as a grave impropriety in the circumstances; that is an exceedingly mild term to apply to the action taken by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to give a brief history of the case as it is before the courts.  It is quite true this came before the High Court and there it was decided that, without the Attorney-General, the matter could be gone on with, and it was gone on with. A decision was given by the learned judge in the High Court partly against the plaintiffs, who impugned the <Col N="833" /> authority of this particular body that is now being legalised or regularised by the Minister's action.  He decided to a certain extent, a slight extent perhaps, also in favour of the plaintiffs. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court did not go into the merits of the case at all, and I think the Minister will fully agree with that.  They decided the appeal on a purely technical point, namely, the point that the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General was absent and that it was necessary.  Therefore, the appeal was decided on that ground alone, not on the merits of the case. The case was described by the learned judge as of very considerable importance and of some difficulty.  On that ground, on a purely technical point, the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court.  The merits of the issue were not decided.  The plaintiffs in this case then applied for, and got, the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General so as to enable the action to be taken and so that the decision of the Supreme Court could be got.</P>
    <P>It is in the middle of that particular procedure that the Government now proceed to cut across the whole thing and make it impossible for those people, representing a large number of the ratepayers in Listowel, to test the legality of the whole business.  Surely the Minister will acknowledge that the propriety of action of that kind is gravely open to question?  It is also stated by those who object to the present Bill that it was indicated in this House by the ex-Attorney-General that no retrospective legislation would be introduced.  On these general grounds, and on the extraordinary line of action proposed by the Minister, I think the House ought carefully to weigh this Bill before it gives it a Second Reading. It practically decides this, that however illegally constituted a body may be that puts itself up to be a local authority, it shall be regarded as having been legally constituted and as being capable of legally exercising all the powers of a legally constituted body.  When it seems to be taking action that the ratepayers do not approve of, and they decide to question the whole authority of that body, they are to be deprived by this Bill <Col N="834" /> of the legal remedy that up to now was theirs.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy will consider the sweeping character of the statements in Sections 2 and 3, he will realise that nothing of a more thoroughgoing nature in the way of retrospective legislation could have been put before the House.  I am not going into the elaborate legal argument which the Minister has submitted as regards the later sections of the Bill.  As a layman, his learned statement had the effect of making me suspicious.  I wondered what all this elaborate legal argument coming from the Minister, not in a court of law, was for, if the Minister was really convinced that he was acting according to precedent, established practice or the view of the law up to the present.  I can assure him, as a layman listening to him learnedly expounding the law, that I could not avoid believing that the Minister was quite convinced that the law and the practice and the procedure in local government was the opposite to what he was trying to prove. Elaborate proof of that kind is extraordinarily suspicious and would not have been necessary on the part of the Minister had he really a good case.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking now for the Department of Local Government or the Commissioners; I am speaking on behalf of the unfortunate people of Listowel of all grades who have to foot this bill.  As a result of certain actions in the past, departmentally and locally, a very serious state of affairs has arisen in Listowel.  There are certain debts piled on the town which the towns people believe it will be impossible for them to meet.  You are ignoring what was done, ignoring the fact that it has not been shown there was any illegality on the part of the ratepayers, yet you are now going to saddle them with all that debt.  May I point out an excellent example that the Minister might follow?  I remember a couple of years ago a Bill was introduced by the present Ministers, seeking to wipe out a whole lot of arrears in connection with the payment of which there was no doubt about the law.  The present Ministers not merely introduced that Bill but took great credit for doing so.  I refer to the arrears of land annuities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> Why cannot the Minister divest himself of his ministerial character and assume a more humane character?  Why cannot the Minister try to realise the position of the people of Listowel and the debt they have to meet?  Why can he not realise that, as a result of certain circumstances not to any extent the fault of the local people, you have a situation in Listowel that requires careful looking into and sympathetic treatment?  The House, if it passes this Bill, is going to put an almost intolerable burden on the people there.  Many of them will probably not be able to meet the burden that will be put on them suddenly.  You have an exceptional situation.</P>
    <P>You are dealing, not with deliberate breaches of the law, but with a number of people who thought the position was quite clear.  The Minister may hold it was not quite clear.  There was one place where it could be determined, and that was the Supreme Court.  The Minister takes away that particular opportunity of having the matter settled.  I am entitled to say there was no breach of the law on the part of those who object now to the payment of these debts.  I think it is eminently a case for much more sympathetic treatment on the part of the Government than there is any evidence of in this Bill.  It is an entirely exceptional case.</P>
    <P>This is not a general Bill, but a particular Bill, and it is quite irrelevant to introduce fears, expressions of fear, that housing will be interfered with because the credit of local authorities will be undermined and that nobody would ever know whether he was on sound ground in lending money to local authorities.  This is not the normal case.  As the Minister knows perfectly well, it is entirely an abnormal case, and, being an abnormal case, it requires abnormal treatment.  Unless that may for many people amount to a catastrophe is to be avoided, the Government ought to face the fact that they must come to the assistance of the people in Listowel, where for the past six years the most extraordinary&mdash;from the point of view of its composition and its election&mdash;body was operating, a body about whose powers <Col N="836" /> and constitution the Minister had very grave doubts, judging by this Bill.  If he had not those doubts, why the sweeping provisions, provisions so sweeping as almost to take one's breath away, that we have in this Bill?</P>
    <P>It is not a general Bill and there is no danger of it becoming a precedent. If he is doubtful, if the Minister holds, for instance, that there is no doubt about the legality of the constitution of that body, I do not see any act of any local body, or of people presumed to constitute local bodies, that can be questioned.  Here were people who were not managers and who were not commissioners.  What were they?  Can the Minister not, for the moment, divest himself of his ministerial cloak and forget the legal learning he has given to us to-day, and put himself in the place of the unfortunate ratepayer in Listowel?  I think it is eminently a case for different treatment altogether. I do not intend to argue the grave doubts as to the utility of works and so on, but I think it is eminently a case in which the Government ought to come to the assistance of the people of Listowel, and not simply steam-roll a Bill like this through in order to come down on the ratepayers after a number of years.  Undoubtedly, if you pass this Bill, you will inflict severe material loss on them, and you will leave the whole community suffering from a grave sense of injustice.</P>

      <P>In the period during which I have been a member of the Dáil, and that period covers the whole of the Dáil's existence, I have occasionally seen some rather extraordinary measures brought before the House, but never in my experience have I seen anything like this Bill brought before the Dáil, and I doubt very much if the statute books of any parliament in the world would show any precedent for a measure of this type.  We are, at the moment, a Single Chamber Parliament, in which the majority which the Executive has can give effect to any type of measure, no matter how unjust towards any section of the community it may be. This, I say, is the type of measure that should not be brought before the Oireachtas when the Oireachtas consists <Col N="837" /> of only one Chamber.  I have no hesitation in saying that if we brought a measure of this type before the Oireachtas, nine or ten years ago, we would never have got it through the Seanad.  It is the very type of legislation to the passing of which the Seanad would refuse to be a party, and the only hope of getting a measure of that type passed is by steamrolling it by means of the Party Whip, and the Party Whip was not exercisable in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this Bill are directed towards validating the invalid, towards making lawful retrospectively things which were unlawful. I think it would be well that the Dáil should understand quite clearly what lies behind this measure.  The Minister purported to give the history of it and some reasons for bringing it forward. I intend to go more into detail.  The Bill is brought forward to deal with the situation in Listowel, and it is directed towards preventing certain ratepayers in the town of Listowel from exercising their legal rights.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, certain ratepayers in their individual capacity challenged the validity of the council that was in existence from 1928 to 1934.  The matter came before the High Court and a certain decision was given.  The Minister for Local Government, during the course of the proceedings in the High Court, came before the judge there and asked to be added as a defendant, and in the same motion in which he asked to be added as defendant, he asked that the action be stayed and the plaintiffs put out of court because, forsooth, the Attorney-General was not a plaintiff. In other words, the Minister deliberately came in, in the middle of the action, for the purpose of stopping the action completely, and with a view to preventing the issues raised in the action from being determined by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did not succeed at that stage. The judge refused to grant his application so far as staying the action was concerned and he eventually gave a decision which in some respects was against the plaintiffs and in some respects was for them.  At any rate, <Col N="838" /> both the plaintiffs, the ratepayers of Listowel, and the defendants, the Minister, the Board of Public Works and the commissioner carrying out the duties of the Urban Council of Listowel, all appealed and the appeal went to the Supreme Court.  As a preliminary point in the Supreme Court, the matter was raised which had been raised by the Minister in the High Court, that is, that the plaintiffs had no cause of action unless they acted merely as relators and that the Attorney-General should be the plaintiff. That contention was accepted by the Supreme Court and the plaintiffs were put out of court.  The Supreme Court was, therefore, prevented from going into a consideration of the matters that were at issue, the matters at issue being the validity of that council which operated in Listowel for six years and the question as to whether or not the borrowing powers of the council had been exceeded.</P>
    <P>That was the position and the plaintiffs at the time then took steps to rectify that technical error in the former proceedings.  They applied for, and got, the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General in order to start the proceedings again, so that they might have the opinion and the judgment of the Supreme Court on the questions raised. The Attorney-General granted his <i>fiat</i> and now the Minister comes in to prevent the Supreme Court giving that decision.  It is perfectly obvious why. It is obvious he is satisfied that the plaintiffs could maintain their claim. If he were not, we would not have this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Dáil a slight bit of the history of this case.  As most of the members of the Dáil are aware, the elections for these local authorities are held triennially.  They are held say in the years 1925, 1928, 1931, 1934, and so on.  In 1925, there was an election held in Listowel urban area and a properly constituted council was elected.  During the triennial period, however, that is before the period had expired in 1928, nine out of the 12 members of the council had ceased to take any part in the work of the council.  They had either resigned <Col N="839" /> or had been disqualified for nonattendance. I should say that the statutory number of members of the Listowel Urban Council is 12.  Nine out of the 12 had ceased to function, and the three remaining members continued to carry on the work of the council until the election in July, 1928.  The statutory quorum for the council of 12 is three, and up to that time, the three remaining members acted perfectly legally.  At any rate they were a quorum of the council, and for most matters&mdash;I will put it that way&mdash;they were enabled to function up to July, 1928.  As a matter of absolute fact, there were some important duties which they could not legally perform. From the time that the nine went out of office, which I think was about 1926 or 1927, from the time the number of councillors fell below six, no legal rate was struck in the town of Listowel, because the law provides that a rate made by a council of that kind must be signed by not less than six members of the council.  Apart from that, which is a very important matter, the three remaining members could have functioned as a quorum of the council up to July, 1928.</P>
    <P>What happened in July, 1928?  An election was declared in the ordinary way, a triennial election, and a strange thing occurred.  There was not a single person nominated for the council. There was not a single nomination received by the returning officer.  What did she do?  The returning officer, I should say, is the town clerk, who is a lady.  She then, acting in pursuance of some authority which she thought she had, declared the three former members of the council who had been carrying on the duties, though they had not been nominated, deemed to be re-elected.  That action, of course, was, to say the least of it, extremely doubtful.  I am not going to weary the House with legal arguments but there is a provision in statutory orders and in the law to deal with an occasion of that kind when it arises, but the way in which it was dealt with on that occasion is not the way to deal with it. At any rate, I should say that Section 2 of the Bill now shows that the Minister is satisfied that that action of the <Col N="840" /> returning officer in 1928 was not legal and that, at least, she did not constitute a valid council thereby.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>The High Court decided it was a valid council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You are afraid to allow that High Court decision to be tested in the Supreme Court.  That is why you put that section in the Bill.  If you hold that that was a right decision, why do you prevent the Supreme Court from finally deciding the matter, the Supreme Court which is the final legal authority in this country?  You are afraid to let the matter be decided by that court.  I may say that these members might have been a valid quorum up to July, 1928, but the position after July, 1928, was entirely different.  What had you then?  Even supposing that these three persons were validly re-elected, or deemed to be re-elected, as three members of the council, they did not form a council.  The council, by law, must consist of 12 members.  Surely these members did not form a quorum of the council?  How can you have a quorum of a body that was never formed?  Before you have a quorum you must, first of all, have the body of which it is to be the quorum.  There was no urban council elected for Listowel by the election of July, 1928, so that the three persons deemed to be re-elected were not a quorum because the body did not exist.  Be that as it may, the three persons who were elected proceeded to elect one of their members as chairman and to administer the affairs of Listowel as if they were a properly elected council.  That was in July, 1928.  Then began six years of, I suppose, the craziest administration that was ever inflicted on any unfortunate area.  The three persons who were elected are, ordinarily, very decent men but I do not know what possessed them in this instance, unless it was that they felt overburdened by the responsibility of having to administer the whole affairs of the council.  The administration fell on three shoulders instead of 12.  At any rate, they seemed to imagine that they were administering a metropolis and that there need be no limit to the <Col N="841" /> amount of expenditure on which they could embark, but the most amazing thing of it all is this:</P>
      <P>There was perhaps some excuse for these members because of the fact that there were only three of them to shoulder the burden of 12 persons. They might well have lost their heads on that account but the extraordinary thing is that everybody with whom they came in contact seemed to become as crazy as they themselves.  The Department of Local Government, engineers and everybody with whom they came in contact seemed to be carried away with them and sanctioned every bit of foolish expenditure and every wild-cat scheme on which they were prepared to embark.  If they had halted for a moment to reflect things might have been different, but once they started, the infection seemed to spread to the Department of Local Government and everybody else until the Department became worse than themselves.  There was a letter from the Department early on, a most extraordinary letter.  It is very long, and I will read only one portion of it.</P>

      <P>What is the date of the letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dated 29th June, 1929, to the Clerk of the Urban District Council, Listowel, from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the Deputy Minister then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was.  I am not questioning that.  I am giving the history in order to show what the Minister is doing now.  The letter says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the interests of the public health of the town it is imperative that a proper water supply should be provided.  Any renovation of the existing system would entail considerable expenditure, and would continue to involve a charge of £450 for pumping, and it seems to the Minister that it would in the end be more economical for the council to adopt the gravitation scheme now recommended by their engineer at a cost of approximately £9,600.  This scheme will ensure an adequate and pure supply of water, and the annual charges thereunder will, to a large <Col N="842" /> extent, be offset by the elimination of the charge of £450 a year for pumping already referred to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will come back to that in a minute. Listowel had at that time a water supply.  As will be seen from the Minister's letter, it was a pumping scheme.  It was, comparatively speaking, a fairly efficient water supply.  It was pointed out by several engineers that, with a moderate expenditure and a very little care it could be made quite a competent scheme and quite an efficient one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the medical officer of health say about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote you that if you like.  The report of the medical officer of health on the water supply from the pumping scheme was far better than the report on the Lacca scheme and far better than the report on the Bunglasha extension, in regard to which he told the Minister that apparently all his engineers thought was necessary for a water scheme was that it should be wet.  The Minister was told that in 1934, or at least it appears in the minutes of a meeting in 1934.  This is the report of the medical officer of health:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the information of the council I beg to report that all the waste and sillage water effluent from the Toor creamery flows down the dyke to Meenanare and joins one of the streams proposed by the engineer as a supplementary water supply for Listowel.  It seems to be a new idea in public health to utilise washings from a creamery for a public water supply, where such supply is to be used for human consumption.  Apparently, the only requisite, from the engineering point of view, is that the water should be wet, ignoring the quality as to purity, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the pumping supply was a fairly efficient scheme, and could have been made quite efficient at comparatively little cost.  But the triumvirate decided that this was not good enough for the Listowel metropolis, and they made up their minds that the town of Listowel would have a brand new water supply, which <Col N="843" /> would be a kind of memorial to their régime.  When the people of Listowel heard the first inkling of this scheme, well, first of all they could not believe it, because they heard that the new scheme was to come from a place called Lacca.  Lacca is not very far from Listowel.  Down the country, eight or nine miles mean nothing; everybody knows what is happening eight or nine miles away.  Of course, the people of Listowel knew well that the people of Lacca had not enough water for themselves, not to mind supplying the town of Listowel.  I need not say that they protested. Public meetings, memorials and so on were started to try to prevent the idiocy of embarking on this scheme. The people of Listowel had very good reason to be nervous about water schemes, because they were in this extraordinary position&mdash;and are up to this day&mdash;that they are paying for a water scheme started 40 years ago, which never supplied a drop of water to the town.  There was a water scheme started at one time in the nineties; the turbines ran for one minute, and no water came into the town of Listowel because the water refused to flow uphill.  The people of Listowel, therefore, have some reason to be doubtful about water supplies. When they heard about Lacca they thought it was too much of a joke to be paying for a second dud supply, and they protested very violently at the time.  It was no use.  The supply was forced on them, and the town of Listowel was saddled, as a start off, with a loan of £8,000.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of history behind this, and I should delay the House too long if I were to go into it. But there are some amazing things about this scheme, and not the least amazing is one thing which I came across here amongst the minutes of the council.  They wrote to the Department of Local Government very early on, asking for their advice as to an engineer.  This is a minute of the council, dated 11th September, 1928:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the proposition of the chairman&rdquo;&mdash;that is the chairman of the trio&mdash;&ldquo;resolved that we ask the <Col N="844" /> Department of Local Government and Public Health to recommend to this council an engineer for the purpose of examining Listowel Waterworks system and reporting as to the best means to be adopted towards improving the water supply to the town, and the probable cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we come to the minute of 12th November, 1928, which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Received letter from Department of Local Government and Public Health dated 17th October, No. S.64966/28, referring to the entry in the minutes of 17th September regarding the proposal for improving the water supply, stating that the Minister does not usually suggest the names of engineers, but suggested the names of Mr. P. McCarthy, Professor T. Purcell, Mr. E.M. Murphy, and Mr. B.M. Flynn. It was decided to employ Mr. Murphy to make an examination of the waterworks and furnish his report, and to ask him to inform the council what his charge will be for this work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently Mr. Murphy was duly notified of this.  He was appointed on 12th November; the earliest he could have known of it was 13th November. But the minutes of 19th November state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Murphy, engineer, Dublin, wrote stating that he would be in Listowel next week to complete his investigations in connection with the water supply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has always struck me as being very peculiar.  He was appointed on 12th November, and at the meeting on 19th November there is a letter from Mr. Murphy stating that he would be in Listowel next week to complete his investigation of the water supply. Obviously he must have been doing the job long before he was appointed.  That is the only construction one can read into that, and, as I say, it is a thing that struck me as being very peculiar indeed.</P>
    <P>In spite of protests the scheme was sanctioned by the Local Government Department, and the triumvirate were allowed to borrow to the tune of £8,000 to embark on this scheme.  All the protests that you could not get a <Col N="845" /> supply of water from a place where there was no water, were no use, and protests that any water, that might be supplied from the place where it was, was unfit for human consumption, were absolutely no use; and on that there was sent to the Department at the time a bacteriological report obtained by the ratepayers who had caused a sample of the Lacca water to be taken in order that they might substantiate their opposition to the scheme.  The report on the sample of water reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="&ldquo;Report on Sample" RHead="of Water Marked">
    <Title>&ldquo;Report on Sample of Water Marked.</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;This sample of water was taken by me from the well situated on the farm of Mr. John (Brown) McElligott, Lacca, at 7.30 p.m. on 3rd July, 1929, in the presence of Mr. McElligott and of Mr. J. Crowley, T.D.</P>
    <P>(Signed)</P>
    <P Just="Right">OSWALD G. TOUGH, A.M.INST., C.E.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sample had been sent on for bacteriological examination to Dublin, and the report is headed &ldquo;Department of Pathology, University College, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin.&rdquo;  The Minister challenged me about the report on the pumping scheme, and this is the report, in July, 1929, on a sample of the Lacca water by a bacteriologist here in Dublin who was sent a sample:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This water has a high bacterial content of organisms growing at blood heat and also at room temperature. <i>Bacillus Coli</i>, the presence of which is evidence of sewage contamination, is present in as little as 0.1 c.c. of the sample.  From the bacteriological point of view this water is bad and quite unsuitable for human consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say that, even in 0.1 cubic centimetres of the sample he found <i>bacillus coli</i>&mdash;a sure indication of sewage contamination.  It is but fair to say, however, that there is a note here which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;NOTE.&mdash;It must be observed that the water was collected on 3rd July. It did not arrive here and was not available for examination until the 6th July.  This would tend to give a less good result than a water <Col N="846" /> examined immediately after collection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At any rate, that was portion of the argument put up by the people of Listowel at the time&mdash;that the Lacca scheme was an unfit scheme; that the water was unfit for human consumption, and that it would require heavy expenditure on filtration before it could be made of use.  Well, the protest went in anyway and, as time went on and the scheme began to take shape, it became apparent that there was a great deal of truth in the protests that had been made.  It soon became apparent that it was necessary to add filter beds, at a further expenditure of about £1,000.  Then, as it was nearly completed, it was again discovered that the supply was entirely inadequate. So, the letter from the Minister was wrong on both points: wrong as to the suitability of the water without filtration, and wrong as to the supply.</P>
    <P>The position is now that the town of Listowel is saddled with a payment of £12,400 for the completed Lacca water scheme.  They have, indeed. been offered by the Minister a sum of £3,000 for the extension from Bunglasha to which I referred, where the water is wet&mdash;and that is all you can say about it&mdash;but they will get that £3,000 on condition that they pay £12,400 for the &ldquo;dud&rdquo; scheme that has been foisted on them. Now, the Lacca scheme, as I say, has been completed, and does the Minister's boast come true: that it is adequate?  He said that once that scheme was completed, the town, for the future, would be saved the expenditure on pumping which was an annual charge for the old scheme.  The position to-day is that, with the Lacca scheme completed, as it now is, Listowel gets water from that scheme when the weather is wet and, perhaps, for a few days afterwards.  There is an adequate supply from that scheme in wet weather; but when the weather is fine, the much-despised old pumping scheme has to be resorted to.  Accordingly, the Lacca scheme is a wet-weather scheme, but they have to resort back to the pumping scheme when they have fine weather in Listowel, and so the town is not relieved of further charges for pumping.</P>
    <P>Now, the Board of Works lent that money to the council, or rather to the <Col N="847" /> three people who represented themselves as being the Urban Council of Listowel.  Of course, the Board of Works acted, naturally, on the sanction that the Minister gave, first of all, to the triumvirate's application, but the main purpose of this Bill is to safeguard the Board of Works, to prevent the Board of Works from being fired out of court if this case went on to hearing before the Supreme Court.  I put it to the members of the House that in a case of this kind, where this scheme has been inflicted on the people of Listowel through, if you like, mismanagement down below in Listowel, but chiefly because of the mismanagement and the blundering of two Government Departments&mdash;the Board of Works, the lenders, and the Department of Local Government, the persons whose duty it is to inspect and to sanction&mdash;where such a thing occurs, it is unfair to the people of the locality that they should be made pay for departmental blunders.  Incidentally, if the Minister insists upon this, and if an adequate rate is put on the town of Listowel to enable the Board of Works to collect the shekels, well, then, it will be sufficient, I should say, to break the ratepayers of Listowel&mdash;or any of them that remain to be broken, because I can almost foresee them writing to the Minister and telling him: `Here you are; take our town.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In December, 1932, a further additional expenditure was embarked on, and a scheme for the erection of 104 houses for the working classes, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, was propounded, and a loan of £34,000 was sanctioned by the Minister. Now, a loan of that particular calibre, or under that designation, is not counted when you come to look at the limit of borrowing power of the council; and the attitude of the people of Listowel towards that particular loan has been always this: that even though they considered the scheme largely ill-advised&mdash;because the cost of the houses and the rents at which they would have to be set if they were to be in any sense economical <Col N="848" /> so that the capital could be repaid, would make it impossible to let the houses to the persons for whom such houses were primarily intended&mdash;even though the people of Listowel, as I say, considered the scheme ill-advised, at the same time they have always stated that they were prepared to shoulder the burden imposed on them by this scheme.  It was said so publicly on their behalf at the inquiry that the Minister caused to be held last July 12 months in Listowel, prior to his dismissal of the then council; and it has been their attitude since, as it is their attitude to-day, that they are prepared to shoulder the burden of the housing scheme, for what it is worth&mdash;they do not consider that it is an extremely good scheme&mdash;but at any rate, because of the purposes for which it was undertaken, they would shoulder that burden, but they certainly jib at having to pay for a second &ldquo;dud&rdquo; water supply.  Now, June, 1934, came along.  I should say, in this connection, that that régime, of course, lasted from 1928 to 1934, because there were no local elections in 1931, as there was a special Act passed providing that no local elections would be held anywhere in that year.  In 1934, however, a properly elected council took over the affairs of Listowel, and I remember the headlines at the same time in some of the Kerry papers, and some of the speeches that were made, when the council was elected.</P>
    <P>The council of Listowel was heralded as 100 per cent. republican.  What happened that republican council in Listowel?  After 12 months' existence under the Fianna Fáil Government, they were sacked.  The 100 per cent. republican council had, of course, to consider their position when they took over office and they found the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; was empty.  I should say this: that triumvirate during their term of office, even during the completion of this scheme, had not attempted to charge the necessary water rent.  These water schemes have been paid for in Listowel, not by the rates but by a water rent.  The triumvirate did not attempt to increase the water rents or to increase <Col N="849" /> the charges that would be necessary to pay for their loans and they were not forced to do it.  From 1931 to 1934 they did not increase the rents and they therefore did not incur any odium over increased rents. There was no attempt to collect from anybody.  When the new council came in they were told that there would be an objection to the rate on the ground that it would be invalid, for it would be invalid because of the invalidity of the loan, due to the invalidity of the council to whom the loan was made. The council put their case to the Minister on several occasions and they got peremptory orders to strike a rate which would provide for these repayments. Eventually they asked the Minister by resolution on, I think, the 4th December, 1934.  That resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That our clerk be instructed to inform the Department of Local Government and Public Health that while we, the Urban District Council of Listowel, are quite prepared to strike a rate adequate to meet all expenditure which is legally justifiable, we are entitled to know, for our own protection, as well as in the interests of the ratepayers, whether all the demands made on us are in strict accordance with the law, and accordingly to ask the Department of Local Government for replies to the following questions:&mdash; (1) to what amount is the borrowing power of the council limited by law; what is the principal sum due on foot of loans for which the council is now asked to make provision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They got a reply dated the 20th December, 1934.  That reply is fairly peremptory; it reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the acting Minister for Local Government and Public Health to refer to your letter of the 5th instant and queries enclosed. It is noted that the council are prepared to strike rates adequate to expenditure which is legally justifiable. The rates already struck for the current year are not adequate to their expenditure, and having failed in a most deliberate manner and with full knowledge of their <Col N="850" /> liabilities to make provision for meeting all their expenses they must now consider in what manner the deficit which will arise owing to insufficient rates is to be met.  I have to suggest that the council should address themselves to this question without delay.  Until it is definitely settled there can be no further loans advanced for any purpose.</P>
    <P>Under the Public Health Act of 1878 moneys borrowed for sanitary purposes shall not at any time exceed, with the balance of the outstanding loans contracted by the sanitary authority, twice the annual value of the premises assessable within the urban sanitary district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That might be taken to be an error by omission because an extremely important word is omitted from the concluding sentence.  The correct reading of the Act is &ldquo;twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the sanitary district.&rdquo;  It might have been an inadvertent omission but when we find the Minister coming along to-day in Section 9 of this Bill and providing for its interpretation here, for its reading into the Act, one has to be a little bit suspicious. One is inclined to think that there was a deliberate omission of the word &ldquo;net&rdquo;.  This is the reading that the Minister now wants us to take of Section 238 (2) of the Public Health Act, 1878.  He knows, in spite of all he has written to the council, that it is not the interpretation that has always been put on that section.  It is not the interpretation that Vanston put on Section 238.  That act was misquoted in that letter from the Department to the council to give them the impression that their predecessors had, in fact, the right to borrow up to the amount which they had borrowed, because it is perfectly clear that the triumvirate, again part of the infectious craziness, got the sanction of the Department.  They were allowed by the Department to borrow sums considerably in excess of the borrowing powers the council was limited to by law.  The Minister is now by Section 9 of this Bill giving retrospective sanction or&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;giving the force of law to the sanction there given <Col N="851" /> illegally by the Department of Local Government and Public Health allowing the triumvirate to exceed their limit of borrowing.  A further resolution passed by the council on January 4th, 1935, was to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, to enable us to ascertain our position, our solicitor be instructed to apply to the Department of Local Government and Public Health for the following information:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The statute or order under which our immediate predecessors are deemed to have been elected and to have functioned as the Urban District Council of Listowel.</P>
    <P>(2)  Particulars of the total amounts to which the borrowing powers of the council were limited by law in the years ending 31st March, 1929 to 1934, and the total borrowings due at the same dates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no reply to that.  The Department was beginning to think that the 100 per cent. republican council were not as nice boys as they should be; that they were beginning to ask awkward questions; and so the Minister began to look round to see how he could get rid of them.  He did duly get rid of them.  There was a letter of the 21st January, the effect of which was to invite the Minister to test the legality of the attitude of the then council and of these borrowings. I think that was a perfectly reasonable act.  In spite of the fact that they were 100 per cent. republican, as they called themselves, to that extent I say that was a reasonable demand.  It was reasonable to this extent, that there was no demand whatever that the Board of Works should not pursue the debt like any other lender if the loans were not being repaid.  If they were satisfied they could recover&mdash;the courts were there for the Board of Works to go after their money.  This was an invitation to them to do so.  The invitation was not accepted.  Instead, after a few months, during which there was correspondence with which I will not bother the House, an inquiry was ordered to be held.  That meant that the Minister had made up his mind <Col N="852" /> that he was going to dissolve the Listowel Council.  Therefore, he had to hold a statutory inquiry before doing so.  You know how these inquiries are held by officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>It was supposed to be held into the conduct of the Listowel Urban Council. I am not casting any reflection on the particular officer who held the inquiry, but any sensible member of the Dáil can imagine the position of a comparatively junior officer, or even of a fairly senior officer, of the Department holding an inquiry which is to a large extent to consider the acts of his own superiors, of his own Minister and of his own Department in connection with the affairs of the council.  What result could such an inquiry have?  Of course it had the result everyone expected and Listowel Council was duly dissolved.</P>
    <P>I will not go into that further, as Deputy O'Sullivan dealt with it, and I touched upon it previously.  Legal proceedings were instituted and should go to the courts.  The Minister, fearing the decision of the Supreme Court, and indeed I might say from the face of the Bill knowing what the decision of the Supreme Court was bound to be, brings forward this Bill.  He certainly takes no chances in it, because it makes provision for doing as thorough a job in the way of whitewashing as I have known.  No matter what act might have been committed by anybody, that act is now to be considered valid, and black is deemed to be white for 14 years from the 6th December, 1922.  I should like especially to know what the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Deputies for Kerry will be. There is only one of them in the House at the moment.  They must feel themselves in a very peculiar position if they give their support to this Bill. There are limits to Party allegiance. My view of the matter is that a Deputy has a prior obligation to his constituency and to his constituents than to any Party Whip.  Of course there are a few Deputies who can perhaps pat themselves on the back and thank God that Listowel will not be in the portion of Kerry for which they will be standing at the next election.  Deputy Crowley, Deputy Flynn and Deputy D. Daly are in that position.  They can <Col N="853" /> say to themselves: &ldquo;Well, Listowel be hanged.  I am not going to worry about Listowel.  I will obey the Party Whip.  Even if Listowel is in my constituency now I can afford to ignore that consideration because I am not going to look for its suffrages again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They may do that, but I think it would be a very contemptible thing for them to do, because until the next election they represent the people of Listowel in this House, just as they represent the people of Killarney or Castlemaine, and I put it to them that it is up to them, as Deputies representing the people of Listowel, to oppose by their voices and by their votes the carrying of this measure into law.  If they do otherwise they are untrue to the trust put upon them by the people of Listowel, by whom they were sent here to look after their interests.  Deputies McEllistrim and Kissane will be in the unfortunate position that they will be contesting North Kerry.  I put it to them that they will be in a very awkward position if they are a party to saddling the people of Listowel with this burden of £12,400 for a dud water supply.</P>

      <P>I am a very sympathetic person occasionally.  I could adopt the attitude of Deputy Crowley and of Deputy Flynn, and I could also wash my hands of the people of Listowel if I wished.  I am not doing so.  I will not stand for that portion of Kerry, but I say that while this legislation is directed at Listowel to-day, any other town in Ireland may be in the same position to-morrow.  Killarney may be in that position to-morrow.  I put it to members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who now represent Listowel, that the people of Killarney, or Cahirciveen or Kenmare, or maybe Ballydehob, will say those who support a measure of this kind, which is against the interests of the constituency, would do the same thing to-morrow.  If Deputy Flynn and Deputy Crowley support this measure, the people of Killarney or Castlemaine can feel with regard to them that they would do the same thing with these towns.  I think that <Col N="854" /> is a fair proposition.  This legislation is retrospective.  Retrospective legislation is obnoxious in many ways. There are certain occasions in which retrospective legislation can be justified, or at least an argument can be made for it.  We had such an argument put forward in this House nearly 12 months ago by Mr. Justice Maguire, who was then Attorney - General. He was speaking then on the Land Purchase (Guarantee Fund) Bill, 1935, and was replying to a speech by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. As reported in the Official Debates, Volume 59, column 2234, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not at all deny that the introduction of retrospective legislation is not a good practice, and I agree that it is one to be commended.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From the text there is obviously an omission of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; before &ldquo;commended.&rdquo;  Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Retrospective legislation, or legislation to clear up a doubt in past legislation, is, however, a step to be taken on the rarest of rare occasions.  It is only justified in exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There have been several instances of legislation dealing with very minor matters.  There have been in several finance measures sections introduced having retrospective effect, sections validating what had been the practice, sections introduced while cases were pending in the courts, dealing with the precise points at issue in the courts.  I accept whole-heartedly the principle that if by any chance individuals discover that they have certain rights under legislation and seek to have these rights vindicated in the courts, the Legislature should hesitate very much before it should interfere with these particular rights.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he quotes from Mr. Blythe when speaking on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in 1930, as reported in Volume 39, column 1376.  He quotes with approval what Mr. Blythe then said with regard to a retrospective <Col N="855" /> section, and the quotation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We act really before there is a final determination as to what the law is on the matter...  As a matter of fact, both here and in England legislation has had to be introduced with retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the present year's Finance Bill in Great Britain, pending a decision of the final court, a section was introduced because they feared that a decision might be given which would have upset the practice as it had existed for 40 or 50 years. Before the court had announced its decision at all, a section was introduced to continue the existing practice, if it proved to be necessary. You can get the most extraordinary results if the whole meaning of legislation is going to be revealed by some court decision, to be entirely contrary to what was intended and to what it was always believed to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The then Attorney-General quoted that speech with approval as showing that retrospective legislation is justifiable when it is brought in to validate what had been the practice; when as Mr. Blythe had put it, a decision of the court may upset the practice as it existed for 40 or 50 years.  What is the Minister doing in this Bill?  In Section 9 he is changing the practice and the interpretation as it has existed since the passing of the Act of 1878.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister quoted the decision of Mr. Justice Johnston against me with regard to the validity of the council; he told me that Mr. Justice Johnston had upheld the validity of the council.  I put it to him then&mdash;why was he afraid to allow the Supreme Court to give a final decision on the matter?  I put it to him that Mr. Justice Johnston in his decision upheld my contention here, that this was the interpretation of Section 238, paragraph 2, of the Public Health Act, 1878, during all the years, and that he followed Vanston's opinion in that.  So that what the Minister is doing by Section 9 is not to remove any doubts which may exist about the <Col N="856" /> interpretation, or to put right an interpretation of the courts which upset the interpretation that had always been held to be the correct one.  He is by Section 9 putting a new interpretation on Section 238 of the Public Health Act, 1878, and he is thereby very considerably extending the limit of borrowing of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The then Attorney-General in his speech on that occasion further said, as reported in column 2238, of Volume 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is only in exceptional circumstances such as those that a Government would, I think, come to the House and ask for retrospective effect to be given to clear up the position while a case was pending in the courts, to have retrospective effect given to the interpretation upon which it has been acting and which everybody must admit, who looks at the debates, was intended by this House should be contained in the legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was referring then I think to the Land Law Act, 1933.  Nobody can say that the Minister is endeavouring to establish the intention which the Legislature that passed the Act of 1878 had. He is changing the interpretation that has been put upon it since the passing of the Act and since the passing of the Local Government Act, 1898, for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 11 of the Bill he removes completely any check on the borrowing powers of local authorities.  Every Deputy and every ratepayer ought to consider their position under this. Deputies probably used to read &ldquo;penny dreadfuls&rdquo; when they were young&mdash; I used to read a considerable number. These used to be Wild West stories about the very hot gambling that went on in mining camps, etc.  I remember one of them which described a gentleman coming on with two big guns hanging on to him&mdash;&ldquo;the two-gun man&rdquo; he used to be called.  There was a game of poker going on and he asked, &ldquo;What is the limit&rdquo;?  The reply was, &ldquo;The limit is the roof,&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Take off the roof.&rdquo;  The Minister has taken off the roof as far as any limit to the borrowing powers of local authorities is concerned, because by <Col N="857" /> Section 11 all check on borrowing powers is done away with.</P>
    <P>Section 11 looks very innocuous.  It refers to an Act called the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921.  There is a section in that Act which provides that local authorities can borrow for current expenses during the year and the money so borrowed is repayable within the year. Borrowing under this particular Act is not to affect the borrowing limit of councils.  In other words, no matter how much you borrow under the Act, it does not count when ascertaining whether or not a loan has exceeded the borrowing powers.  The Act specifically lays down that it is to deal with current expenses.  The Minister is going to make &ldquo;current expenses&rdquo; mean the repayment of instalments on moneys borrowed in the past.  These are now to be interpreted as &ldquo;current expenses&rdquo;.  Furthermore, the Act is now to be so interpreted that you can, without reference to the limit of borrowing powers, borrow any sum to repay a former sum borrowed subject to the borrowing limits.  What, then, is the position?  A local authority reaches the limit of its borrowing powers and can borrow no further. They go to the Minister and, if he sanctions it, they can borrow the whole amount which they owe and which has counted, so far as their limit of borrowing is concerned, under the provisions of the 1921 Act, transfer it over to pay off their indebtedness, clear their sheet and start over again.  If that is not taking the roof off borrowing, I do not know what is.  That is the position which is being created under this Bill.  It violates everything which Mr. Justice Maguire, as Attorney-General, said would justify retrospective legislation.  Nothing the Minister has said and nothing on the face of the Bill justifies a measure of this kind.  There is no justification whatever for the new interpretation which the Minister wants to put on Section 238 of the Public Health Act and there is no justification&mdash;this is a matter that should be checked by Deputies&mdash;for giving to the Financial Provisions Act, 1931, the meaning the Minister now wants to give it&mdash;a meaning it never had up to the present.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this is a measure that <Col N="858" /> should never be brought before an Assembly through which it can be steamrolled by the majority.  It is being brought before a Single-Chamber Parliament.  It is the type of measure that we could never succeed in getting the Seanad to agree to in the past.  It includes many vicious principles and the House will be taking a grave responsibility if it gives it its approval.  Deputies will, if they approve of this Bill, be setting a precedent with regard to retrospective legislation which can be pointed to for any type of retrospective measure in the future.  Deputies on the Government Benches who are going to support this measure cannot grumble if, on another day, they find it pointed to, as against themselves.  I have said that the people of Listowel were prepared to face the repayment of any sums for which they were found legally liable.  I repeat that.  I go further and say that, even if they were found not legally liable for that sum of £34,000 which was borrowed by the triumvirate for the purpose of housing&mdash;even if that were found to be illegal&mdash;the ratepayers of Listowel would be prepared to shoulder the burden of repayment of that amount.  But it is not good enough to ask them to pay for a second water scheme, to place upon them responsibility for the sum of £12,400 for the Lacca water scheme in addition to about £6,000 spent on a water scheme in the 'nineties which never gave a drop of water to the town of Listowel.  The whole position can be easily rectified if the Minister acts fairly towards the ratepayers and has regard to the offer they have made. He can provide that the Central Fund shall bear the burden of the blunders of Government Departments and that it bears this sum of £12,400, releasing the ratepayers of Listowel from responsibility for it.  That is the sensible way out and the fair way out.  I ask the House to refuse to give this Bill a Second Reading until the Minister gives some assurance that he will take steps to provide that this sum of £12,400 will be borne by the Exchequer and not by the ratepayers of Listowel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Lynch that I have the interest of the people of Listowel as much at <Col N="859" /> heart as, or perhaps more than, he has.  I think I am entitled to use my intelligence as to whether or not I should vote for the Bill.  If I thought that, as Deputy Lynch said, this measure would impose an impossible burden on the ratepayers of Listowel, I should have no hesitation in voting against it.  But I consider that it is necessary to introduce this Bill and that it should have been introduced before now for the purpose of clearing up the rather difficult and lamentable situation which has obtained in Listowel for the past couple of years.  I am not concerned at all with what happened in the High Court, nor am I concerned with what might happen in the Supreme Court.  What I am concerned with is the welfare of the people of the town of Listowel.  I submit that, as long as the present position continued, there would be no future for the people of Listowel.  They actually do not know where they stand at the present time.  In my opinion, this Bill will go a long way towards clarifying the position and will provide a basis on which to bring about a settlement between the people of Listowel and the Local Government Department.  I listened to the speeches of my two colleagues on the opposite benches&mdash;Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Lynch&mdash;and while I admit that their speeches were eloquent and fairly well worded, they carried no conviction to me, nor would they carry conviction to anybody acquainted with the situation which led up to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch quoted at length from speeches made in this House by Mr. Justice Maguire when he was Attorney-General. But, like Deputy Lynch, I have no love whatever for retrospective legislation.  I do not like it, and I am sure that the majority of Deputies, if not all, do not like it.  I say that retrospective legislation should only be introduced in very extraordinary circumstances, but my submission to the House is that the circumstances which led up to the introduction of this Bill were very extraordinary indeed. I have said that the speeches of my two colleagues, Deputy Lynch and Deputy O'Sullivan, carry no conviction <Col N="860" /> to me as to the strength of their case.  I say that, because I know very well that this Bill is getting a Second Reading to-day, to rectify a situation left to us as a legacy by the Government in which they were Ministers. That is the irony of the thing; that is the whole joke, that these two Deputies were attacking a thing which happened during the period when they were Ministers of the Government then in office.  Deputy Lynch and Deputy O'Sullivan waxed very eloquent to-day as to what happened at that time, but surely they were in a much stronger position then, when they were members of the Government, than they are in to-day to rectify a situation that arose away back between 1928 and 1932.</P>
    <P>We are thankful to Deputy Lynch for giving us the history of this whole situation in Listowel.  It is not, therefore, necessary for me to go into it at any length.  Deputy Lynch, in the course of his long speech, gave the members of the House a fairly good idea of the situation that has existed in Listowel.  He mentioned that there was an election held in 1928.  Apparently, nobody in Listowel had any ambition to become a member of the new council.  The result was that the three members who stuck to the council were declared re-elected.  I think that a certain amount of credit is due to the three members who stuck it out. The amusing part of the whole thing is this, that while the legal position as to the constitution of the council might very well have been the subject of an inquiry, during the four years from 1928 to 1932 no inquiry whatever was held.  It surely should have been the duty of any responsible Minister in a Government responsible to the people for the handling of public moneys to institute such an inquiry, and to establish beyond all doubt that the urban authority in Listowel, composed of these three people, was legally constituted before consenting to do business with it.  But during those four years the then Government did not hesitate to do business with, as Deputy Lynch has described it, this triumvirate council, and, what is more, not alone did the then Minister for Local Government do business with that illegally constituted council, as we are now told it <Col N="861" /> was, but he was so convinced of its legal position, and so convinced of the validity of its actions, that he actually allowed the three individuals constituting the council to exceed the borrowing powers of the council.  So that not alone was the then Government prepared to do business with this triumvirate council, as Deputy Lynch has described it, but they were prepared, and, in fact, did give it power to raise money that Deputy Lynch now says the council was not entitled to get at all.  That is the extraordinary situation that we are faced with here, and that is the position that has necessitated the introduction of this extraordinary legislation.</P>
    <P>I have said before that I have a certain abhorrence of retrospective legislation, but I also say that there are special circumstances which justify it.  I look upon this Bill as a necessary evil.  It may well be asked why Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Lynch did not make some move to clarify the position that existed during the four years from 1928 to 1932.  They were then responsible Ministers in the Government of that time.  They were in office when the Lacca water scheme, to which Deputy Lynch has referred, was inaugurated, and, no matter what they may say now, they cannot divest themselves of a certain amount of responsibility for what happened. They cannot divest themselves of the greatest amount of responsibility for what happened then.  But they come to this House to-day and try to brand us as iniquitous and extraordinary people because we take upon ourselves the duty of trying to rectify the mistakes that they themselves were responsible for.  In other words, as Deputy Lynch has aptly put it, we are turning black into white, or trying to do it.</P>
    <P>I look upon this whole dispute between the people of Listowel and the Department of Local Government as the height of folly.  I look upon the litigation instituted recently by a certain group of individuals in Listowel as an attempt to embarrass the present Government.  This group of individuals purport to represent the people of Listowel, but, as I said before about Deputy Lynch and Deputy O'Sullivan, why did not those people institute this <Col N="862" /> litigation between 1928 and 1932?  They did not do so because, apparently, they did not want to embarrass the Government of that time.  They have no hesitation, however, in trying to embarrass the Government that is in office to-day. I am sure that is very much appreciated by the Opposition Deputies.  It is a fine thing, of course, for Deputies on the opposite side to take advantage of what may be looked upon by some people as an unpopular measure for the purpose of making Party capital out of it, but I think the people of the country are too well-informed and too well-up to be deceived by such conduct as that.</P>
    <P>I think the litigation that took place as regards the Urban Council of Listowel and the whole position there was very foolish, because it should occur to anyone that it is a very foolish thing to fly in the face of a Department of State.  Apparently, it was the intention to continue this litigation. As long as it went on the issue in Listowel would remain undecided, and the inhabitants of the town would be made the innocent victims of the whole thing.  Further, there is no guarantee that those people would be successful in the legal proceedings which they have instituted.  They are simply taking a chance, but they should remember that in continuing the litigation they were involving all the people in Listowel, because as long as the litigation went on the town of Listowel would be deprived of the benefit of all the grants that ordinarily accrue to the people of a town from Government Departments.  Because of this dispute, the position in Listowel, since 1932, has been that no Government grants have been given to the town. The people there have been unemployed and no Government schemes of any sort have been inaugurated there, the reason being that the people of Listowel were supposed to be at war with the Department of Local Government. As long as that state of war continued, no benefits, in the way of Government grants, would go to the town of Listowel.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that when this Bill becomes law, as I expect it will, he should go into <Col N="863" /> the whole position in the town of Listowel and take into account the fact that for the past three or four years, while this dispute was on, no grants have come to the people there, even though they had to contribute to revenue just the same as anybody else.  The people of Listowel were not in a position, as a result of this dispute, to take advantage of the Government's housing legislation. There was a good attempt made in 1932, when 104 houses were built.  But what has been the position?  Those 104 houses have been lying idle ever since, with the grass growing around the doors.  There was in or about £30,000 spent on the building of those houses.  I can say that houses are just as badly needed in Listowel as in any other town in the Saorstát, yet the 104 houses have been closed since 1932 and people have been condemned to live during all that period in unwholesome and insanitary houses, and in the face of that are we going to let the £30,000 go for nothing?  I will ask the Minister to transmit this suggestion to the Commissioner in Listowel, that when striking the rate he should have regard to the amount the people of the town have lost in the way of grants and things like that as a result of this dispute.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan suggested that the £9,000 borrowed should be wiped out by the Department.  Nothing would give me greater pleasure, as a representative of Listowel, if I could get an assurance from the Minister that the Government would be prepared to forego this sum.  If the Minister does not find himself in the position to forego this amount, or part of it, he should at least consider the question of funding this debt and extending the repayment of the amount borrowed in respect of those schemes to which Deputy Lynch has referred, over a number of years and, if necessary, hand part of the debt down to posterity. I am afraid that if the people of Listowel have to bear this burden, they will find it very crushing and it would be very unwise to put people out of business altogether.  I recommend the funding process to the Minister and I hope he will suggest that <Col N="864" /> to the commissioner.  I do not know whether it can be done in accordance with existing legislation, but even if it is necessary to introduce a Bill for the purpose, I do not see why it should not be done.  Such a course was followed in the case of the arrears of land annuities.  Deputies will remember that payments of arrears were stretched over a period and a similar funding process was introduced.  I think it has worked well and that it will work out very well in this case also.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill, when it becomes law, will clarify the position in Listowel and bring about better relations between the people there and the Local Government Department. It is time the whole dispute should end and that people should be given a chance of living their lives in their own way without extraordinary or unprecedented interruption of this kind.  I hope also that the 104 houses will be made available at the earliest moment to those anxious to become tenants.  I appeal to the Minister to be as generous as he possibly can in his treatment of this situation.  I hope he will not be in any way prejudiced by the actions that were brought to the courts against him or his Department. Speaking for myself, I regarded it as very foolish litigation which would tend to do no good.</P>

      <P>The situation that gave rise to this Bill has been described as extraordinary.  I think, in view of what we have heard this <Col N="865" /> evening and in view of what some of us have read in the local papers, the situation might be described as bewildering.  Deputy Kissane has stressed the necessity of clearing up the position in Listowel.  I quite agree, but I do not think that the method the Minister proposes is the best way to deal with the matter.  I am reminded of the fact that 12 months ago a Bill in which the Cork County Council, the principal local authority in Cork, had a very direct interest, was before the House, and the same principle that is the basis of this measure was also the basis of that one.  Speaking with an experience of several years in this House, I can say for myself and those associated with me that we have viewed retrospective legislation as a most objectionable thing, and if the Minister could divorce the retrospective provisions of this measure from the other provisions, I think we would be very glad.  If he is unable to do that, I am afraid I shall find myself in opposition to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into a whole lot of detail in connection with the matter.  I merely wish to supplement what has been said by something of what I have read in the local papers. Anybody who has read the local papers could not have been impressed with what was done in Listowel.  I think there ought to be, there must be and I hope there always will be, democratic control in local affairs.  I hope and I believe that it is possible to ensure that with democratic control there will be efficiency on the part of those in management.  I am afraid Deputy Lynch and Deputy O'Sullivan, both very influential members of this House, cannot acquit themselves entirely of responsibility.  I was not impressed with the deliberations of the new urban council that succeeded the old local authority in Listowel.  I think that with some display of tact the present very difficult position might have been avoided; if the successors of the alleged council that has been referred to here this evening had acted more tactfully, much trouble could have been avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should hesitate to seek the wide powers that he <Col N="866" /> asks for in this measure, because it is a line of action that is bound to create a good deal of opposition and that will engender a great deal of suspicion. Speaking in a general way of local administration, I think the people are entitled to more consideration. We had a pretty sharp reminder in the newspapers this morning as to what is possible.  What has been termed a bombshell has occurred in the local administration of Cork City.  The corporation there have been presented with a bill for £15,000 or £16,000, incurred by what has been confessed to be mismanagement, and confessed by somebody who is supposed to be one of the super-authorities on local government in this country.  Altogether because of the principle of retrospective legislation contained in this Bill, I think the measure is objectionable, and I ask the Minister to consider the matter&mdash; not to consider the problem that exists in Listowel, and which must, I think, be faced with a certain amount of compromise on all sides, in the manner indicated in this measure, but in some other way, and, before this Bill leaves the House, to revoke the retrospective provision that must always make a measure of the kind objectionable.</P>

      <P>It is common, according to the order and practice of this House, to debate retrospective legislation and, possibly it is rather late in the day now to raise one's voice against it because it is now rather the rule than the exception.  Retrospective legislation might possibly have something said in its favour if the Minister could show the House that there was some general evil which required the action of the Legislature to redress it, and required that some provision should be made to meet some financial difficulty which was general throughout the country.  As I understand it, Deputy Brennan has just ascertained from the Minister that that is the way in which he presents this case to the House.  This Bill is presented as a general Bill, but, as Deputy Brennan observed, every speaker who has discussed it up to the present has dealt <Col N="867" /> with it as a Bill affecting Listowel only.  I think the Minister ought to tell the House whether the problem is a general one or only a particular one.</P>

      <P>I am not a Kerryman, and I think the House is entitled to know from the Minister, before the Bill is put to the House, whether the problem is a general or a particular one, and if it is a general problem, what is the amount of liability involved and what is the position of local authorities throughout the Saorstát. We have a Bill here which certainly proposes to do things generally throughout the local authorities of the country of every kind apparently; to say that what they have done is to be valid whether it is within their powers or not; and to say that what they have done is to be valid whether they themselves are properly constituted or not.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there are any particular cases present to the mind of the Minister or his Department other than the Listowel case.  If there are not, why is this Bill not presented to this House as a Bill to impose on the urban district council of Listowel a charge of £12,000, which, under the existing law, they are not bound to bear?  If it were presented in that form, it certainly would require all the eloquence of the Minister and of any Deputy who might see fit to support him to induce the House to support it. If that is what it means, if it is a Bill to impose on Listowel a charge of something over £12,000 for which, under the existing law, they are not liable, it ought to be presented to the House and justified as such.  If, on the other hand, local authorities for years past have been invalidly constituted, if elections have been irregularly carried out, if contracts have been irregularly entered into and if the limits provided by law upon their borrowing powers and contractual powers have not been observed, before the House validates all these illegalities, it ought to have some idea of the scope of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in all the retrospective <Col N="868" /> Bills we have had there never has been one of such a sweeping character as this.  It has never been proposed to this House to make the acts of illegal bodies valid and to make them valid for a period of 14 years in the past.  This Bill is to be deemed to operate from 6th December, 1922, and the House is asked to do that without knowing what the problem is, if there is a problem, and, if there is no problem, why this Bill?  The other Deputies who have spoken on this Bill have gone into a good deal of detail with regard to the Listowel case.  If this is presented and justified as being necessary in order to meet the situation in Listowel, the situation is, as I have explained, to impose on that township a liability which under the law they are not presently bound to bear.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to certain legal proceedings brought by a large number of ratepayers in the town.  The proceedings, which were defended by the Minister in the courts, were heard at length by Mr. Justice Johnston, and were decided in at least one particular, contrary to the contention of the Minister and contrary to the law which this Bill seeks to establish.  The judge of the High Court only decided that case after he had held, in opposition to the submissions of the Minister, that the proceedings were validly constituted.</P>
    <P>An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, I think, by all parties concerned, in order that the situation which Deputy Kissane admits requires clarification should be determined, and all the expense of presenting that case to the Supreme Court was incurred by the Minister's Department, by the Commissioner administering the affairs of the township and by the plaintiffs. The whole matter was before the court, and the Minister sent his counsel into court to say that, although the matters were fully before the court, and a decision could be had, he wished the court, first, to determine the purely technical point as to whether the Attorney-General was formally a necessary party to the proceedings.  All the parties were put to the expense of debating that interesting but irrelevant question, so far as the affairs of Listowel <Col N="869" /> were concerned, for something like two or three days, and the Minister succeeded in his contention, with the result that all the money expended by the plaintiffs, by the Department, and by the Commissioner in the trial before Mr. Justice Johnston, and in preparing the case for the Supreme Court, became of no avail.</P>
    <P>It is not the only case in which the Minister has, if I may say so with respect, endeavoured to obstruct decisions being had in the courts on local government matters.  I could instance several that came within my personal knowledge, but I shall refer to only one.  Under the Housing Acts, a person whose property is compulsorily taken from him is given a right of appeal to the High Court against the order depriving him of his property. The Acts provide that rules should be made by the Minister prescribing the procedure under which that appeal is to be taken.  No rules have been made, though the first of these Acts is dated 1931, and the second is dated 1932, and there are later Acts.  The first case that came before the court was brought by a procedure known as summons, and the Minister sent presumably his counsel in to argue that the procedure was wrong, and that the case should have been brought by another procedure, <i>certiorari,</i> that the time for appeal has expired and that the proceedings should be dismissed on that point and the man appealing deprived of his appeal.  The court decided against him, and held that the proceedings were properly brought by summons, and the case proceeded and the man got relief, but only after the Minister had endeavoured to obstruct the decision of the court on the merits of the case.</P>
    <P>In the next case that came along&mdash; possibly the next man thought: &ldquo;I shall meet the Minister on his own ground&rdquo;&mdash;the proceedings were brought by <i>certiorari.</i>  When the case came into court the Minister appeared by his counsel, and the Minister's counsel argued that <i>certiorari</i> was not the proper form of procedure, that the proceedings should have been brought by summary summons and that, therefore, the defendant should be deprived of his remedy.  It was only when the <Col N="870" /> court decided that both forms of procedure were open to him that justice was done.  I could quote other instances where the Minister through his counsel in court has endeavoured to prevent justice being done.  This Listowel case is one and there are a number of cases under the Housing Acts.  I could elaborate that and I could show that the Department and the Minister, so far from seeking to have speedily determined cases in which the rights of parties are concerned&mdash;whether they be officials of local authorities, persons whose property is being acquired or ratepayers who believe that they have been made liable for heavy charges which they should not be called upon to bear&mdash;have met these cases with technical points in order to prevent the merits of the cases being dealt with. In the case which I have mentioned, it was the fault of the Minister that no appeal could be taken owing to absence of rules of procedure.</P>
    <P>This is not the time nor the place to make a general attack on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or on the administration of his Department, but I think that a Bill of this kind, entitled &ldquo;Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill&rdquo; justifies the observation that we have far too many Local Government Acts. Their number is legion.  We have thousands of Orders and we have dozens, if not hundreds, of Acts.  I do not think I am putting it too far when I say that despite all the efforts that have been made since the inception of the Free State to simplify local government, the present position is one practically of chaos and that no lawyer, either belonging to the Minister's Department or outside it, can confidently advise any local authority or any officer of a local authority, what their position, or his position, is with regard to rating powers, borrowing powers, terms of appointment, salaries, rates of superannuation or anything like that.  I do not think I am putting it too far when I say that is the situation.</P>

      <P>Instead of a situation like that being met by the Department's officers sitting back and saying: &ldquo;Now is the time to relieve local administration; now is the time to simplify this medley of powers going back to the Grand Jury Act; now is the time to provide the people with some definite code of local government law,&rdquo; this present Bill is a good example of what we are likely to get, what can only be called hand-to-mouth legislation.  Even to-night we heard Deputy Kissane stating that this is not the last Bill to redress the present situation and inviting the Minister to bring in another.  No doubt the Minister will do so; he will continue to introduce Bills until chaos and confusion become worse confounded.  However, we must look to the terms of the present Bill.</P>
      <P>I consider that the case of Listowel has been very unfairly met by the Minister, first, in the way in which he has met the case in the courts and, secondly, by bringing this Bill into the House to defeat proceedings which are already in existence because, I take it, it has been mentioned in the House already that those ratepayers who were dismissed from the court on a technical point made by the Minister after incurring much expense, have, with the approval of the Attorney-General and with the use of his name, come along and have started proceedings to have the matter determined by the Supreme Court.  It should be a principle, even in these days of facile legislation by one House, that once this House has expressed its views in the form of an Act, the interpretation of that Act should be for the courts and not for this House.  What do we find here?  We find here that this House is asked to put a particular construction on a statute of 1921 and a particular construction on a statute of 1878.  The provision in the statute of 1878, which is now to be amended, is one which has been administered for something like 60 years.  This is Section 238 of the Public Health Ireland Act of 1878, which provides a limit on the borrowing powers of sanitary authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a difference of opinion as to how that section has been <Col N="872" /> constructed in the past.  At any rate, the Minister must think that the construction which he now seeks to place upon it is not one which the courts would uphold.  It is one which Mr. Justice Johnston has rejected, and the judicial position at present is that the Minister's construction is not, and has not been, the meaning of that section. That is recognised in the very terms of the section in the Bill, because this House is asked to give a meaning to that section &ldquo;notwithstanding any judicial interpretation to the contrary,&rdquo; recognising that the courts have decided that this section does not and did not bear the meaning now to be given to it.  Surely that is bad enough, about as far as we can go, actually to reverse the decision given by the court as to the meaning of the section, but when we consider that Sir George Vanston, who for many years was Chief Officer of the Local Government Board and who is the author of standard works on local government, has given in his work an interpretation to the statute the same as Mr. Justice Johnston, and contrary to the interpretation which this section in the Bill seeks to give it, surely we are justified in saying that this is a case where the Minister is bringing in a provision to give a past interpretation to a section which has been administered for something like 60 years with a definite meaning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch has referred to an even more vicious principle in this Bill.  I take it that it is recognised that ratepayers are entitled to have it provided that the borrowing powers of local authorities shall be in some way limited, that a local authority shall have some limit beyond which it must not go in imposing liabilities on them. The provision which I have referred to provided for such a limit.  There are other provisions in it, of course. In 1921, owing to the exceptional expenditure of the time consequent on the war, a special provision was made enabling local authorities to borrow over and above the limits provided, for the purpose of meeting current expenditure. That is to say there was special expenditure for which they could borrow and which they could <Col N="873" /> repay within a limited time, in order, the idea was, that current expenditure should be repaid even if met by loan, by the people and within a short period of the time during which it was obtained and spent.  The House is now asked in Section 11 to take that section, permitting borrowing for current expenditure beyond the limit, and to extend the power of borrowing to cover the payment of instalments upon existing loans.  So that an urban council or other local authority, under this Bill, can borrow beyond the limit for any expenditure and re-borrow for the purpose of paying off the instalments on that loan.  That process can be indefinitely extended until there is no limit on the power of borrowing. It would be far more candid if the Minister were to bring in a short section to remove all restrictions on the borrowing powers of local authorities. The House would then know what it was doing and would not be confused by this glossary of a section of an Act of 1878.  It is unfair to ask the House blindfold to pass a Bill in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane has declared that if he thought this Bill were going to impose an impossible burden on the people of Listowel he would vote against it.  That was his opening remark&mdash;if he thought the burden was impossible for them to bear he would vote against it.  In his concluding remarks&mdash;I take it that perhaps he had his eye not upon this House but upon his constituency&mdash;he suggested to the Minister that he should fund the loan. Of course, the loan is already funded in the sense that it is payable over a period of years.  The Deputy suggested to the Minister that he should fund the loan, because he said the people would find it a crushing burden if they had to meet those charges. Truly they will find it a crushing burden, because this involves more than £12,000.  I understand that the entire rateable valuation of the town of Listowel is just something over £5,000.  It will be seen, therefore, what this burden is going to mean, together with the other big charges they have to bear for housing and other expenses.  I suggest to Deputy Kissane that there is little difference <Col N="874" /> between the crushing burden which he admits this Bill will impose upon the people of the town, and the impossible burden which would induce him to vote against the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The greater part of this debate has been carried on as if this were a matter affecting mainly or almost altogether the town of Listowel. If I thought that was so it would be rather impertinent on my part to express any opinion on the Bill before the House, but there seem to be such important principles in the Bill that it should interest and alarm Deputies in all parts of the House on account of the precedents that would be established if this Bill were to become law. I should like for a few minutes to draw the attention of the House away from the particular case of Listowel and the hardships that either the ratepayers of Listowel or the persons who acted&mdash; whether legally or not I do not know&mdash; as council for Listowel, may have to suffer unless the Minister takes some steps to relieve one side or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that strikes one on listening to this debate is that it is a very objectionable thing that the details of a lawsuit entered on the books of court should be subject to a debate in this House, but such a thing was inevitable when a Bill was brought before us which proposes to take from the purview of the court an action actually entered on its books.  It is very objectionable, when citizens claim under the laws of the land to have their rights in a particular matter determined, that those rights should be canvassed between Deputies of this House, but that is inevitable when a Bill is introduced which closes access to the courts against those who seek the help of the courts.  It has been admitted by all who spoke that retrospective legislation was justifiable only in very rare instances.  The rarest of the rare &mdash;I think those were the words of the former Attorney-General&mdash;who summed up the conditions which would render such legislation justifiable.  In the present instance the Minister has really not made any attempt to prove that the legislation he proposes is justifiable.  I read the terms of this Bill when I received it a few days ago, and I listened to the Minister speaking <Col N="875" /> on it for some ten minutes to-day, before I could realise that he was speaking on this Bill; I looked at the board several times to see whether the wrong number had been put up.  In his speech, for some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he was dealing with the needs for housing and so on, a moral lesson, with which we all agreed but which did not seem to have the slightest relation to the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable, as has been pointed out by the Deputy who has just spoken, that although the Bill apparently applies altogether to the case of Listowel it is framed in the most general terms.  As Deputy Lavery has pointed out it is framed not merely to cover irregularities of this kind which may have taken place during the last 14 years but to give immunity to similar irregularities which any group may succeed in committing in the future.  The Bill is not, in the ordinary sense, retrospective.  It is retrospective but it is also prospective. It provides that whenever a body of persons who are not lawfully constituted as a local authority, purport to act as if they were lawfully constituted as a local authority they commit those in whose names they act.  If they borrow money they commit those in whose names they act; if they make a contract they commit those in whose names they act to the fulfilment of that contract.  That seems to me to open the door to the most patent fraud and impropriety, not merely on the part of a person <i>bona fide</i> acting in a capacity in which he is not lawfully entitled to act, but on the part of a gang setting themselves up as a lawful authority and palming themselves off upon some innocent person.  It secures to any person the whole of his claim against the authority in the name of which this gang acted.  As far as the terms of the Bill go it seems to open the door to gangster enterprise in this country.  That may be checked by other means, but the Bill opens the door to a person acting in that illegal way, in the security that whatever actions he may take must be backed by the local authority in whose name he acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> I am not making any assumption as to whether this council was legal or not.  It is not for members of this House to decide that.  There is a proper authority to decide that, but the Minister endeavours to prevent that decision being made by the proper authority. This Bill proposes not merely retrospective legislation to protect people who acted in a <i>bona fide</i> capacity, but to give protection to those who act in an illegal way in the future, as well as to those who have done so in the past.  It is more objectionable even than retrospective legislation, as it is legislation which interferes with an action which is actually going on in the courts.  The courts are secured by the Constitution from interference, but we have the Minister coming in here before the court has an opportunity to give its decision&mdash;the opportunity to give it in the past having been taken away by the Minister's own action as a party in the courts&mdash;and asking the House by this Bill to prevent the court deciding who acted properly in the past and who acted illegally or improperly.  Citizens consider themselves entitled to make use of the laws of their country, but the Minister, with a political Party to support him here in the House, asks the House to deprive those people of their legitimate constitutional rights.  They have the right to appeal to the court. They have come to the court and made their appeal.  They have got the authority of the Attorney-General to make their appeal, but the Minister asks us to-day to decide that they cannot have that appeal; that they cannot have an opportunity of having a legal decision given by the courts of the land.  I know nothing which could bring the courts into greater contempt than such Bills as this.  The forestalling of a legal decision in a case which is not actually pending but might be brought, is likely to bring the courts into contempt, but I know of nothing which is more contemptuous of the courts of the land than interference with a case which is actually entered on the books of the court.  Individuals are punished for what is regarded as contempt of court, which is often little more than a matter of ill manners, but here we have the Government of <Col N="877" /> the country acting in this contemptuous way towards the courts. The whole debate this afternoon&mdash;a debate which necessarily followed on the introduction of this measure&mdash;has been in the greatest contempt of court in a general sense.</P>
    <P>Even, however, if one might admit that there were a case for dealing in some legislative way with the position of Listowel, the Minister has gone much further than is necessary in dealing with it.  He has not brought in a Bill to set right any blunders that have been made in Listowel&mdash;to clarify the situation, as Deputy Kissane said&mdash;but he has brought in a perfectly general Bill which has set right, possibly, a number of mischances in the past, of which we know nothing and about which the Minister has said nothing, but which also sets right a number of legal actions which may take place in the future.  It is often said that hard cases make bad law, but sometimes individual hard cases require to be relieved by legislation. It seems to me that, in his opening statement, in which the Minister avoided as far as possible the evil effects that this Bill purports to remedy, he has not made any case for bringing in such a Bill as this to remedy the hardships which, undoubtedly, have occurred in the town of Listowel.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch made a speech here this evening which some people construed as being a criticism of the last Administration.  There was no doubt whatever in anybody's mind, after Deputy Kissane's statement, as to what his opinion of the measure was and the necessity for it.  The fact is that during the period from 1928 down to 1932 no action was taken by any ratepayer in Listowel, as far as I know, in his own interest or in the interests of his fellow-ratepayers, to regularise a position which was open to any criticism.  Action has been <Col N="878" /> taken now, and the case has gone through two courts and is going through a third.  The Legislature enters, on the advice of a Department of State, to terminate that matter at a point where the final decision may be expected&mdash;at a point where most of the expense has already been incurred &mdash;and takes from the court the right which the court has of deciding an issue that is put before it by the citizens of the State.  Obviously, one or both of the persons engaged in the litigation in this matter have a cause of complaint.  It is unlikely that the Supreme Court would have made an order apportioning the costs to each side.  So far as the Department of State is concerned, I think the Minister will have to admit that entering into a proposal to the State and the Parliament to make a statutory enactment, after all the expense has been incurred, is a mistake.</P>
      <P>If we were to enter into it at all, we ought to have entered into it directly when the proceedings started and so have saved a very considerable amount of the costs that have been incurred.  So far as those ratepayers are concerned, at any rate, who have entered into this&mdash;and I do not know any of them nor have they approached me in connection with the matter, although I believe some publication in connection with it has been in the hands of some Deputies to-day, but I have not seen it&mdash;there is, in my mind, a cause of complaint on the part of those people that the Parliament is taking away from them the right that they have to go to court.  The Parliament has the power to do that, but it ought not to inflict an injustice, and no member of this Parliament should subscribe to the principle that the last word in law, or the last word in regulating or determining how the people are to do their business, should rest with a Department of State.  The Department of State should be under the law also, and it would be better for a Department of State that it should be so.  It would stop, at any rate, if it did nothing else, the continuous trek from different parts of the country when some little difficulty occurs asking to have a clause inserted to settle the question concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> Coming to the measure itself, it is rather a pity that there are so many Acts dealing with local government. This, the Minister tells us, is a general Bill.  I have gone through it very carefully, and, while the number of sections set out goes as far as 11, there are really only nine operative sections. The first section is a declaratory section, and the last is just a description of the measure.  Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5, unquestionably, have reference, and can only have reference, to Listowel in the present circumstances.  I will admit to the Minister at once that it is of general application and will cover other cases in the future, but there is no doubt about its affecting no other case than that of Listowel at the moment.  Sections 6, 7 and 8&mdash;Sections 6 and 7 anyhow&mdash;might be said to affect other districts, but they are largely concerned with Listowel.  It strikes me that some special effort will have to be made in the town of Listowel to meet this big expenditure of £12,000.  One of the possible means of doing so would be to get a town hall and to have it let for performances of one sort or another and so make it a source of revenue.  Section 7 is a rather important section.  I forget exactly the sum of money that a small local authority was entitled to raise for the purpose of meeting the expenses of its administration, but now the rate has been increased to 2/6 and there is very little doubt that that affects the present financial circumstances of the town of Listowel.</P>
    <P>Going on through the remainder of the sections, Section 9 can scarcely be divorced from Listowel.  Section 10 may possibly affect it, and certainly Section 11, which provides for a local authority borrowing money in order to repay a loan or the interest charges on a loan, or the principal of a loan, must have special reference to that body if the financial difficulties we have heard about are so pressing as they seem to be.  I thought that the most lame statement that was made here to-day was that made by Deputy Kissane, in which he said that we should fund this loan.  Looking at the loan of £12,000, the rate of interest on which, I presume, would be approximately 5 per <Col N="880" /> cent., I do not see any funding operation that can take place that will reduce the 5 per cent., and that is the major portion of it.  You might, possibly, if the loan is for 40 years, extend it to 60 years, and that would reduce the sinking fund charges, but only to a negligible extent, as far as the ultimate liability is concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider two points: one, that we will have a local government code so that we will not require to search through the various Acts that have been passed, or the indexes of each year to see whether or not a Local Government Bill has been passed in that year; and, secondly, that we will have one code of local government, that it will be carefully considered, and that the Minister will tell the local authorities and his Department that once it is drawn up no special circumstances that may arise will prompt him to introduce a Bill to amend it for the future. His own Department is probably as much in fault in that connection as the local authorities.  They were many years under alien Administration here and there were no continuous Local Government Acts coming along except those dealing with the political situation at the time.  There was, in the normal course, the Act of 1878 and there was the Act of 1898 dealing with larger matters.  I am speaking about general things; particular things, such as slaughter-houses, are altogether different and the peculiar circumstances of our modern situation would require something in that respect.  But so far as a code is concerned we should have one and be done with it.  It is unfair to say to people, as is implied by this Bill, that they may go to the courts and, when they do, they are to pay their own costs and have to bear their own expenses.  It is only fair to persons who have, in good faith, entered into litigation, that some consideration should be given for the costs they incurred in that litigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to this Bill is its general application.  There may be special circumstances, and undoubtedly special circumstances will arise from time to time which demand special treatment.  Apparently, at the moment Listowel is one of them.  Personally, <Col N="881" /> I do not know anything about Listowel.  I do not propose to discuss the Bill from the Listowel point of view, but I think it is unfair that a Bill brought in to deal with Listowel is going to be put into the position of a continuing enactment for all local authorities.  I say that because, first of all, it deprives the House of an opportunity of segregating those matters and discussing them on their merits.  That is a disadvantage in which members of the House ought not to be placed.  This Bill, as Deputy Rowlette pointed out, has retrospective and objectionable clauses, clauses which give the right to the local authorities in future, where they are illegally constituted, to have their acts legalised.  That is a point of view which nobody in this House would expect to have brought forward as a continuing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will, I am sure, tell the House that he never previously knew of an instance in which a Bill of this kind was required.  I am sure he does not anticipate any such trouble in the future as the trouble that has arisen in Listowel.  Surely the Minister will admit, and he must admit, that in the matter of Listowel there was a certain amount of remissness on the part of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  These Listowel people exceeded their borrowing powers.  That is quite apparent from the section of the Bill which proposes to validate the borrowings where their powers have been exceeded.  If Listowel exceeded its borrowing powers then the Department of Local Government is clearly responsible for the Department that allowed those people to do so.  The Minister shakes his head.  Surely the Minister does not anticipate another Listowel situation arising in any part of the country. If he does, this is not the way to deal with it, because this is a type of retrospective legislation dealing with a particular situation which has been allowed to develop over 12 or 14 years.  That is an extraordinary situation; and it should be allowed to develop in a particular way.  The Bill should be confined to that particular situation.  To have this as a continuing enactment is courting disaster.  We are setting out <Col N="882" /> here in several sections that although the local authority may be illegally constituted, unless steps are taken within a prescribed period it can continue to act and will continue to act as a legally constituted authority. That prescribed period is 12 months, and there is nothing to prevent that local authority within that period entering into contracts.  Within that period they may be brought into court and their action declared illegal.  But there is no provision for dealing with that.  Now, the main Bill is of general application and is a continuing enactment. To my mind, because of its being a continuing enactment, this is a most objectionable Bill, and for that reason we, on this side of the House, intend to oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Attorney-General will intervene at some stage of this discussion.  I should like if he would answer one categorical point.  The Attorney-General is sponsoring and approving in this House legislation designed to take from the litigant his remedy in law, when the litigant is already in court and when he has already become liable for substantial legal costs.  This Listowel business in comparison with the major principle is an insignificant matter.  This procedure which the Minister proposes to adopt in the Listowel case establishes what we regard as a most obnoxious principle.  The courts are there partly for the protection of the individual citizen against the Executive.  Is the individual going to be fixed with notice that whenever he invokes the courts to protect him from the Executive, the Executive will come to Dáil Eireann and secure the passage of legislation to defeat the citizen's remedy?  In that case, there is no use in any citizen ever appealing to the courts in defence of his statutory rights.  That is a matter which, I think, should appeal to the Minister himself but it should appeal, much more particularly, to the head of the legal profession in this country.  The Attorney-General as the head of the legal profession in this country has a peculiar responsibility to protect the legal rights of all citizens not only between one another but as between <Col N="883" /> the citizen and the State.  He has a peculiar autonomous position in many of his functions in which he is deliberately withdrawn from the authority of the Executive Council so that he will act as a thoroughly independent person between the citizen and the Executive.  This places him in a position of much responsibility.  And I say that the principle enshrined in this Bill strikes at that whole conception of his functions, and gravely jeopardises the system under which this statute proposes to work.  I think the House is entitled to ask the Attorney-General to answer this categorical question&mdash;does he in principle approve of the Executive coming to this House for legislation wherewith to short-circuit the current legislation without any compensation to the litigant and with the result of notifying citizens everywhere that there is no use in invoking the courts against the Executive because if citizens do invoke the courts, Dáil Eireann will be called into service for the purpose of short-circuiting them.</P>

      <P>I agree with some Deputies, and with Deputy Dillon, that it is not desirable to bring in legislation to take from a citizen or from a body of citizens any legal remedies they may have.  Generally, that is a principle upon which every Party is agreed.  I do not believe that there was anything <i>bona fide</i> behind the people who have been organising and instituting legal actions in this matter.  I believe that it was not for the good of the people of Listowel that actions were instituted.  On the contrary, they have had the very opposite effect on the town of Listowel, from my point of view as Minister for Public Health.  Deputy Cosgrave talked about a local government code. I agree with the Deputy that it would be an excellent thing to have the local government law codified, but it is a huge undertaking.  When he was head <Col N="884" /> of the Government he and his Party had the opportunity of doing it, but they did not do it.  It has not been done.  We started doing so some years ago but it will take some years more. It is a big job and it cannot be done in a year or two.  To my knowledge, one part has been in hands for nearly three years in order to try to put it into finished shape.  It will take years to do it.  I wish to goodness it was done, as matters of this kind would then probably be avoided and doubts and difficulties need not arise.  I hope it will be done during the term of office of this Government.  It would be to the satisfaction of everyone to have it done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Cosgrave was that the delay was in order to bring in legislation to end this case.  If there is anything I am really sorry for, it is that I did not come here to stop the malicious people who are doing the town and the people of Listowel infinite harm by blocking the excellent public health works that, through the agency of the Government, would have been gone on with for the people of Listowel.  I was astonished to hear the outrageous language, as I call it, used by Deputy Rowlette.  I thought he was a staid, sensible, commonsense man.  Something must have made him use that type of language without any foundation for it.  That is the awkward part. The only excuse is that he did not know what he was talking about. &ldquo;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,&rdquo; but the Deputy was not acting the part of the angel by intervening in this matter.  He looks a very sensible, solid and commonsense individual who would not act foolishly, especially when speaking as a Deputy. The only excuse is that he was speaking in ignorance when he talked about allowing gangsters and conspirators to constitute themselves a gangster authority.  I do not think any Government&mdash;certainly not this Government or any future Government&mdash;would allow that.  As far as the finances of local authorities are concerned there is always control by the Minister for Local Government, no matter who he is.  Surely this country and this House <Col N="885" /> in its wisdom will select some one who would not permit the foolishness that Deputy Rowlette described to be carried on.  That was something unworthy of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The legal authority is the local authority until its authority is questioned, and the local authority in this case acted for at least 14 years, if not for more, as such authority, and not one individual in the town of Listowel questioned its right through the law with regard to certain matters.  No matter what the local authority does, it is legally constituted if it does certain acts <i>bona fide.</i>  Whatever contract it makes with the public these contracts are binding.  We are only introducing the same element that has been the law for 40 years in regard to mortgage deeds and loans, as has been the case as regards stock and other matters.  I am inclined to get heated about this, but I do not know why I should, except for being disappointed with Deputy Rowlette, whom I always looked upon as a sound, reliable, commonsense individual. I was disappointed to hear him talk as he did on this matter.  He let himself go in a fashion that if he knew more he would not have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said he knew <Col N="886" /> nothing about Listowel.  I wish I could say the same.  I was not a month in office until I began to hear about Listowel and the horrible things going on there.  These things were going on in the period when Deputy Fionán Lynch was a Minister and a representative for County Kerry, and when he could have regularised matters.  The Deputy's Party allowed them to go on from week to week, from month to month and from year to year.  They allowed this illegal body that the Deputy now stands for, that he represents in the Dáil and that he spoke for as Minister, and it was left to me to wipe up the mess that he and his colleagues allowed.  That is what I am doing.  I am taking on the burden that they should have taken on their shoulders, of trying to put matters right.  It is a bad mess and there is nothing in it to the credit of the town of Listowel.  The ratepayers should have stepped in, and when they did not do so, the county council should have stepped in and put matters right.</P>
    <P>It is because there was not sufficient public spirit there to put matters right, not because there was an illegal body in existence, that I have to take the job in hands.  That is part of the job of a Minister.  This case is not a particularly agreeable one, and it was not one to deal with in a Party spirit as some Deputies did, because both Parties in Listowel are in this.  It is a ramp on the part of certain people in Listowel to try to get away without paying their just debts.  I am going to see that they pay every penny of what is properly due by them. Imagine this condition of affairs.  This council that was recognised by the last Government for four years, that was given loans and recognised as a legal body under the 1932 Act, and after that Act was passed, decided to go ahead with a housing scheme that was badly needed for the town.  I have the medical officer's report, which shows that there was not a town in the country that needed housing worse than Listowel.  There are 104 houses completed there for more than two years, but they are locked up, and not one of them could be let until this rotten, muddled financial situation that started under the patronage of <Col N="887" /> Deputy Lynch was cleared up by me. There are 104 houses there while people are living in the most horrible hovels in the town of Listowel.  These houses cannot be let because the contractor has not been paid&mdash;thousands of pounds are still due to him.</P>
    <P>Then there is the water scheme. You would imagine that the Government were responsible for the water scheme.  The Government, at the request of the local authority, sent down the names of five reputable consulting engineers and said to the local authority: &ldquo;These men act as consulting engineers; select any one of them.&rdquo; They selected one and he produced a scheme.  He happened to be, as I know for various reasons, a particular political friend of Deputy Fionán Lynch.  Now Deputy Lynch, because he wants to encourage and help the people of Listowel to get out of paying their debt for that scheme, says it is a rotten scheme.  We are not responsible for that.  It was the Local Government Department in Deputy Lynch's administration, and not in my administration, that passed that scheme and put it on the people of Listowel&mdash;at least accepted it.  They say that it is a rotten scheme.  I do not agree.  I do not agree that Deputy Lynch's administration in that respect was as bad even as he himself says now.</P>
    <P>I am trying to get the people of Listowel, especially the poorer people, out of the rotten mess into which a lot of intriguers have got them by holding up public administration in that town&mdash;some of them, at any rate, for mean Party and political purposes. We are not going to stand for that. We are going to see that the town of Listowel, as far as we can help it, gets clean, efficient administration and that the people who, in the main, want to meet their debts and obligations will get an opportunity to do so.  I am not qualified to go into long legal arguments.</P>

One Deputy, whom I am sure everyone regards as a legal man of very high standing, one of the highest in the profession&mdash; Deputy Lavery&mdash;purported to tell us what Vanston's view was with regard to borrowing powers, and my information is that Vanston's view was the very contrary to what Deputy Lavery told the House was his view.

      <P>That is why I do not want to get into the law too deeply. I am not as imprudent as the solid-looking gentleman opposite to whom I addressed some remarks a few moments ago.  They also talked about a charge of £12,000 on the local authority.  There is no such charge.  That was, I suppose, taken out of the printed circular that Deputy Cosgrave referred to, which, I am sure, Deputy Lynch and others in this House have got, sent out by these people who are doing infinite harm, as I said, to the ordinary townsfolk of Listowel by misrepresenting the whole case.  They talk of a charge of £12,000 <Col N="889" /> on the people of Listowel.  There is no such charge.  There is a loan of £30,000 for housing, which I was glad to hear Deputy Lynch say should be paid. The Government pay two-thirds of the cost of that loan.  They pay 66? per cent. in the case of slum clearance. This is a case of slum clearance.  Some of the worst slum conditions in the country are there.  People have been clamouring to get into these houses for two years and they will not be let because these people, with malicious intent, I believe, interfered.  Deputy Lynch knows better than I do, and I think if he were free he would probably agree that it is not with the highest motives they are interfering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for Deputy Lynch, but I can imagine what is at the back of his mind.  I see nothing improper in introducing a Bill of this kind to put right a rotten situation such as exists in Listowel.  The Bill is mainly directed at Listowel.  It is general in its application and in its construction, but the majority of the clauses deal with Listowel.  Deputy O'Sullivan talked of the unfortunate ratepayers of Listowel.  I agree with him.  The unfortunate ratepayers of the town, through supineness, have allowed these two or three people to do this.  Deputy Lynch knows that two or three people are responsible for all this trouble, all this blocking of progress&mdash;public health progress, housing progress, and waterworks progress in Listowel for the last seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said that it was necessary to come to the assistance of the people of Listowel.  We have been coming to their assistance, but we have been blocked&mdash;not by the elected authority&mdash;at every hand's turn since 1932 and the previous Government were also blocked in trying to construct a proper water scheme for Listowel. I was not long a Minister when I made an offer, which I thought was a very generous one, to Listowel. At that time I said, &ldquo;I will put it up to the Minister for Finance to give an additional free grant of £4,000 so that you can go ahead and put your water scheme right.&rdquo;  They did not <Col N="890" /> accept that offer.  The then elected body would have accepted it, but the clamour that was got up by interested parties frightened them into going out of business practically.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I need say any more.  Retrospective legislation is not a thing to blow your trumpet about, I suppose, but it is necessary from time to time in certain cases.  It was necessary during the régime of the last Government; it was necessary in our time in a few cases; and perhaps until the end of time in certain cases it may be found necessary.  There is nothing we need be ashamed of in the clauses of this Bill so far as retrospective legislation is concerned.  It mainly deals with the town of Listowel.  Local authorities all over the country&mdash;some of them of the same size, population and valuation as Listowel&mdash;have provided waterworks schemes and housing schemes in the past few years and have been able to meet their liabilities. They are no better off than is Listowel and they are meeting their liabilities regularly.  There is no great burden on them.  It would not be a great burden on Listowel to meet its liabilities in a legitimate way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke of the necessity for democratic control in local affairs.  That is what we wanted in Listowel.  In 1925, a council of 12 members was elected.  Nine of them dropped out.  The history of the matter was given us by Deputy Lynch earlier in the evening.  Three councillors carried on.  When the next election came on, nobody was nominated.  There was not sufficient civic spirit in the town to secure the nomination of a solitary person.  What were we to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Put in a commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not do that.  The town clerk got advice from her own lawyer.  That lawyer advised her to appoint the outgoing councillors.  She appointed the active members of the outgoing council and declared them elected.  We did not step in to interfere with the democratic rights of the council.  We did not want to take over the affairs of the council or to interfere in any way, good, bad <Col N="891" /> or indifferent.  The people of Listowel refused to accept their own civic responsibilities at that time.  In 1934, when a council was elected, they deliberately decided &mdash; the majority were republican of one brand or another&mdash;not to strike a rate which would enable them to meet their obligations to those who had lent them money.  They dishonoured the council and the ratepayers.  They would not strike a rate to pay their debts. Having urged them to do so, and having been met with an obstinate refusal, I had no option, if the affairs of the council were to be put right financially, but to wipe them out and put in somebody who would administer the affairs of the council properly until such time as the citizens of Listowel came to their senses.  I am not anxious to abolish any local authority.  That is never done by me except as a last resort.  It has never been done and will not be done by me.  So long as local people are prepared to shoulder their own burdens and carry on their affairs, as they are bound to do, according to law, they will not be interfered with by me, and no commissioner will be put in their place.  This mess and this difficult tangle which has been handed over to me is not the creation of the decent people of Listowel but is the creation of and is organised by mischief makers&mdash;people who want to make trouble for the town, for certain people in the town, and for the Government.  That being the case, I think that the Bill is justified in every section, and I ask the House to pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 22 to 24, Section 3 (2) to delete the brackets and words &ldquo;(otherwise than by reducing the height of such low water level below the height thereof stated in the said paragraph 6)&rdquo;, and in lines 27 and 28, to delete the brackets and words &ldquo;(subject to the restriction hereinbefore mentioned)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Both the Electricity Supply Board and the Dublin Corporation have requested that this amendment should be made. Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Bill, as introduced, provides for the giving of power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to vary, if both the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board agree, the low water level in the proposed reservoir, the low water level being set out in Section 6 of the scheduled agreement.</P>
      <P>That sub-section, however, provides that the Minister may not make an Order fixing levels below those stated in the agreement.  In other words, the water level can be varied only above the minimum stated in the agreement. Both the Electricity Supply Board and the corporation think it is desirable that the Minister should have power, if they both agree, to fix low levels, lower than those stated, in the scheduled agreement.  The idea, I think, is to fix a scale of monthly levels, some of which may be below the minimum levels stated in the agreement.  The lower levels, it appears, would be fixed in seasons in which rain might reasonably be expected to occur so that there would be little danger of any deficiency in the supply of water.  In the months when the rainfall is relatively lower, the levels in the reservoir would, on the other hand, be correspondingly higher so as to conserve the water supply.  The amendment is desired to effect the purpose I have stated.  There is no reason why the amendment should not be effected if both, parties concerned in the agreement desire it and particularly as the section provides that any variation in the levels requires the consent of both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any restriction on the low level or the high level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a low level fixed in the agreement between the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board.  The section provides that that low level may be varied by the Minister by order, if both the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board agree and the Minister concurs in the agreement. The section as it stands provides that any such Order cannot fix a lower low level than that at present set out in the agreement.  The corporation and the Electricity Supply Board desire to have that amended so that any low level may be fixed, the idea being to have a scale of monthly levels, some of which may be lower than that set out <Col N="897" /> in the agreement.  So far as the members of the Dáil are concerned, there is no reason why they should be concerned in this matter, because it is the two parties to the agreement who are concerned and if they agree there is no reason why we should not recognise the agreement.  If the reservoir were purely for the purposes of the Electricity Supply Board, we would leave the matter of fixing levels to the board; similarly, if the reservoir were being constructed purely for the purposes of the corporation, we would leave the matter of the levels to them.  It is really being built for a combined purpose and, therefore, what is provided is that the parties must agree before any variation takes place and the Minister must give his consent.  If they do agree amongst themselves there is no reason why the granting of their request should be withheld.</P>

      <P>I am talking about a particular matter.  What we are doing in this Bill is confirming an agreement which has been made and conferring on the two parties concerned certain powers to carry out the agreement.  In respect of this matter there is no particular reason on the grounds of public policy why the combined wishes of the two parties to the agreement should not be given effect to.  They could have drawn up any agreement they wished in this respect and it would not have meant any difference to the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the level of the water is vital to the success or the failure of the scheme.  It is vital from the point of view of the water-power to be derived and it is vital from the point of view of the water consumers in the City of Dublin.  Our object is to get a good scheme which will serve the purposes of the Electricity Supply Board and the consumers of water in the City of Dublin. I quite agree that in the absence of <Col N="898" /> the expert's report on this whole matter it is virtually impossible for members of the Dáil to form a reasoned opinion on the issues raised in regard to this or any other point in the Bill.  It is to be borne in mind that when the Shannon scheme was going through, all these questions relating to water levels arose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know what effect the level in the reservoir is going to have on the capacity of the Electricity Supply Board to use the water for the generating of electricity because we have never been shown the Meyer-Peter report.  We do not know what effect the level of the reservoir is going to have on the supplies which the corporation may require from time to time to assist the supplies of water already at their disposal because we have not had the Meyer-Peter report.  For some wholly incomprehensible reason the Minister refuses to let anybody in the House see the report.  This is a matter in which I have only a theoretical interest as a member of the House, but one would have imagined that the Minister would have set a value on the informed opinion of Deputy McGilligan, who spent years in steering similar legislation through the Oireachtas, and one would have imagined he would have been glad to show that report to Deputy McGilligan and any other Deputy who had expert knowledge in these matters so that he might know their opinions of the proposals in the Bill in the light of the expert's opinion.  That he steadfastly refused to do.</P>

      <P>Of course it has.  Our opinion on whether a discretion should be left with the corporation or the Electricity Supply Board to alter these levels is perfectly worthless in the absence of the Meyer-Peter report.  We have no expert advice to guide us as to whether we should agree to this discretion being granted to these bodies or not.  If the Minister came in here to-morrow and told us he proposed to give these bodies a discretion to reduce the contents of the reservoir to a teacupful of water and then added, &ldquo;The experts have said under certain circumstances this would be justifiable,&rdquo; there is nobody in the House competent to get up and deny it categorically, because he and he alone has seen the expert's report.  I take it the officials of the Department have given this matter consideration, and that the officials in the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board have also considered it; but it is a bad thing when legislation is going through, founded on an expert's report, that that should be withheld from Dáil Eireann.  The Minister has made no attempt to justify the course he has adopted in regard to this matter and he should tell us now, when he asks our consent for an alteration in the statutory water levels, why he declines to afford us the assistance to which we are entitled from a perusal of the report upon which this whole legislation is founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon does not seem to have the remotest idea of what the Bill is and I despair of ever being able to explain it to him.  So far as the report is concerned, that is the property of the corporation and the corporation did not think it necessary to present a copy of it to me. So far as the Electricity Supply Board are concerned, they also got a report from experts for experts and understandable only to experts, and it would be completely useless to Deputies of this House as a guidance on the question of whether this Bill should pass or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has nothing whatever to do with this Bill.  I think we were entitled to assume that the body set up for the purpose of operating a national electric <Col N="900" /> supply will see that whatever works are carried out will be sound from an engineering point of view.  The one thing we have to be satisfied with is that they are going to be sound from the financial point of view and sound from the point of view of national policy.  On that matter, I have given the fullest possible information in my possession to the Dáil and the Dáil is in a position to make up its mind without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>That is the only question that arises here.  If you want to get back to the position of 1925 when the Shannon scheme was designed, to abolish the Electricity Supply Board and to have the works constructed by the Government out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas, then a different situation would undoubtedly arise; but we do not want to get back to that position. The Electricity Supply Board has been set up by statute and given complete control of all those matters relating to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the House can, I think, have every confidence in that board in doing that work properly.  If it does not do that work properly, the remedy is a change in the personnel of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to enter into a debate at any time with Deputy Cosgrave on these engineering problems. It will at least be a source of amusement to those who know all about them.  Nothing that has been said by Deputy Dillon has the slightest relevance to the amendment I have moved.  Here is a reservoir being built.  If that reservoir were being built for electricity generation purposes only, we need not concern ourselves with the maintenance of any level.  We would say to the Electricity Supply Board: &ldquo;Use that reserve of water to generate electricity as you think fit and if you think fit to empty the reservoir at any particular time, that is your job&rdquo;; but, on the other hand, if the reservoir were being built for the maintenance of a public supply of water to the City of Dublin, it is obvious that the maintenance of water <Col N="902" /> in the reservoir is of importance to the corporation.  This particular reservoir is being built for both purposes, and, consequently, there must obviously be an agreement between the Electricity Supply Board and the Dublin Corporation that will bind the Electricity Supply Board to keep a certain volume of water there in any event, so that they will be in a position to carry out their contract to supply 20,000,000 gallons a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you are taking out of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Again, the Deputy has misunderstood the matter. The agreement which the Electricity Supply Board and the corporation made provides for the maintenance of certain water levels.  It is provided there that the water at various periods must not be allowed to fall below certain levels.  What the section as amended will provide is that if the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board agree that at certain periods of the year lower levels can be maintained, and if the Minister, having considered that agreement, is of opinion that it should be ratified, he can make an Order to give effect to the agreement; but before there can be any variation in levels, the corporation, on the one hand, and the Electricity Supply Board on the other, must agree to the alteration.  That appears to me to be a reasonable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained that the reason it is necessary to have that power is that at certain periods of the year, when the supply of water is adequate, when it is reasonable to assume that there will be plenty of rain, the maintenance of the level in the reservoir is not so important.  The water can be utilised as it comes in and, at such periods, it is agreed by the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board that a lower low level might be maintained, whereas at other periods of the year, when rainfall is scarce, it is necessary to maintain higher low levels so that the city's supply of water will be safeguarded. We are merely proposing by this amendment to do what the corporation and the Electricity Supply Board agree should be done to enable the <Col N="903" /> Minister to give effect to any agreement they may make on such matters, and it seems such a reasonable thing to do that I am surprised there was any discussion on it at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of any expense incurred in carrying into effect any Act of the present session to make provision for regulating the wages of agricultural workers, and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister if it is his intention to do anything with a view to assisting the farmers to pay a reasonable wage.  The Money Resolution should, in my opinion, contain provision for assisting in the payment of a living wage, if it is the policy of the Government to allow the present dislocation to continue in the agricultural industry.  The Minister's figures, supplied to us in debate on Second Reading, are very remarkable and show that a stage has been reached where the farmer really appears to be getting far less in proportion than the farm labourer.  The purpose of this Bill is to improve the position of the labourer and my submission is that, if it is true that the income of the farmer has materially deteriorated for the last four years, it is quite impossible to improve the position of the farm labourer out of the farmer's pocket.  We are back to the fundamental fact that no legislation of this House can extract blood from a turnip or water from a stone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My submission is that the farmers have not got the money.  In that connection I would direct the attention of the House again to the fact that the income of farmers in this country has dropped from £64,000,000 in 1929-30 to £40,000,000 in 1934-35.  One-third of their income has gone.  In 1929 the average wages obtaining in this country were something between 24/- and 25/-. The figures that, I think, the Minister gave us were that in 1926-27 the farmer was getting £93 per annum and the farm labourer was getting £66 per annum.  In 1934-35 the farmer was <Col N="906" /> getting £51 and the labourer £54.  The Minister then proceeded to make a calculation and he said that by making certain calculations he desired to alter that figure and to say that the farmer was getting about £66 and the labourer about £55.  Well, that represents a drop of about 30 per cent. in the income of the farmer between 1926-27 and 1934-35.  It represents a drop in the income of the labourer of approximately 18 per cent.  Over the same period the average cost-of-living figure, covering all the things that are taken into account when you are assessing the cost of living, dropped from 180 in 1926-27 to 154 in 1934-35.  If you take the increase in food alone, you find that it dropped from 174 to 137.  That is to say that the average cost of living for all things dropped 26 points, but the index figure for food alone dropped 37 points.</P>
    <P>The farmer naturally has to buy most of the things other than food which are mentioned in the cost-of-living index and, therefore, although the average cost-of-living figure appears to have fallen by 26 points, in fact when you realise the cost of food has dropped 37 points, it becomes apparent that the things the farmer has to buy have in fact dropped only slightly, so his effective cost of living for 1936 is very much the same as it was in 1926.  Nevertheless, his income has dropped by about 33 per cent. while the labourers' income has dropped 18 per cent.  So that the farmer instead of being better able to pay a living wage to-day is very much worse than he was seven or eight years ago.  Deputy Corry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy to point out that there is a growing practice of regarding the debate on a Money Resolution as an opportunity for resuming the Second Reading debate?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand.  The difficulty is that, if certain amendments in my name are carried, the Money Resolution must make financial provision for them.  The whole theory of labourers' wages and farmers' incomes is based on a pool of money. Out of that pool of money wages and profits must come.  The Minister explained in detail that the pool was such-and-such a figure some years ago and we answered that it has dropped by £24,000,000 since.  Our suggestion is now that if substantial justice is to be done to the agricultural community, including the agricultural labourer, that money will have to be put back into the pool before we can get out of it what will do substantial justice to all.</P>
      <P>When we made that case to the Minister, we pointed out that the pool had been depleted in a peculiarly severe way, that in respect of cattle as much as £10,000,000 had been taken out of it, to which Deputy Corry said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Do not ask the Government to put money <i>qua</i> money into the pool because what they are doing is that they are instituting new systems of agriculture which are putting back into the pool just as much as their policy is taking out.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He instanced wheat.  I am not going to circumvent your ruling, Sir, but you see the difficulty, that it depends on the pool how much there is to go round.  The Government's entire attitude has been: &ldquo;If we admit, as we must admit on our own figures, that the result of our own policy has been gravely to deplete the pool in certain respects, then we plead in extenuation that we have contributed something else to the pool to make up for the deficit.&rdquo;  Mind you, powerful propaganda is kept up to establish the truth of that contention, but when it comes to be examined you discover that the <Col N="908" /> Minister has managed, by the policy of the Government to which he belongs, to take out of the pool approximately £21,000,000, and to put back into it, by the increased value of wheat and beet, about £1,000,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with those years now; I will deal with 1936 in a minute.  Between those two years, £21,000,000 was taken out of the pool by the Minister's policy.  That is here in his own figures in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  I fully admit that he put in £600,000.  I specifically avoid referring to the cost of that to the community, because it does not come within strict relevancy to the Money Resolution.  I admit that in respect of sugar beet he put in £460,000 between those two years.  He increased the value of sugar beet from £360,000 to £820,000 between those two years to which I have referred.  That makes £1,000,000 out of £60,000,000; that represents about 2 per cent. of the entire pool.  Let us assume that he doubled that figure. Let us assume that he doubled the value of the wheat crop and doubled the value of the beet crop.  I do not think Deputy Corry will accuse me of being ungenerous in that estimate. Let us assume that he made the £1,000,000 into £2,000,000 in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to meet Deputy Corry let us say he made it £3,000,000. <Col N="909" /> That represents 6 per cent.  That is the fleabite which the Minister offers us as justification for the allegation that he can get out of the pool of agricultural profit at the present time a fair wage for the labourer.  Let us assume that he grows all the wheat that is consumed in this country.  Let us assume that he grows all the beet which is consumed in this country, as he is doing at the present time.  I still say that, with the current Government policy, there will have been so much taken out of the pool of agricultural profit that unless the Government comes directly to the aid of the farmer a fair wage cannot be got for the agricultural labourer.  It has to be borne in mind that the only source from which the pool of agricultural profit can be replenished is the produce of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would like the Deputy to relate the speech he is now making to the paying of any expenses that may be incurred in carrying this Act into effect.  It is for administration purposes that this money is required, not for paying the difference between what the Deputy calls an economic wage and a fair wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see, Sir.  Then the rules of procedure preclude me from suggesting that the Money Resolution should make that provision?  That ought to be done by a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the position.  The Deputy may not, as he is aware, put down an amendment which would involve a charge.  Precedent allows him, on the Money Resolution, to ask the Minister to make provision for the purpose of the amendment which he obviously has in mind but which he cannot move later.  The Deputy is entitled to ask that the grant be increased.  Although such request might be outside the scope of the Money Resolution the Chair will hear the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble I am in&mdash;that my amendment is not a complete amendment, because it is impossible for me to move an additional charge on the Exchequer.  Therefore, <Col N="910" /> we have got the principle that this pool, which we admit must be supplemented if a fair wage is to be got out of it for the labourer, is, in fact, filled out of the price of agricultural produce.  Now, at first glance, it might appear that the wages pool was filled out of the entire price ruling for agricultural produce.  But that is not true, because the wages pool and the profit pool consist of the surplus remaining over after agricultural produce has been produced and overhead charges paid.  For instance, if you feed a pig that is agricultural produce. You might buy the pig as a bonham for 25/-, and sell it as a fat pig for £5.  You might think you had a profit of £3 15s. but, of course, you have no profit until the merchant's bill for the feeding stuff has been paid, and you have no criterion whereby to judge of the wage you can pay the man who looks after the pig until you have ascertained what was the cost of the raw material which went into the producing of the fat pig.  The same applies to a crop of oats which you used a mowing machine to reap.  The same applies to a field of turnips which you used a plough to open up. All those costs must be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer recently directed my attention to the fact that certain wages were fixed in 1917&mdash;25/-, 22/6 and 20/-for labourers over 21 years of age, and he said that the pool out of which they had to pay that was made up of wheat and rye, the price of which was then fixed by Government Acts at 2/2 a stone, which represents 43/4 a barrel.  Now, he said the fixed price of wheat is 24/6, although the millers are giving us 27/6 and we hope to get 28/-, but there is a big difference even between 28/- and 43/4.  He said at that time oats were worth 2/- a stone, or 28/3 a barrel, and now they are worth about 12/6.  Recently there has been a little increase in the price. That depends on the artificial scarcity which the Minister is creating by keeping the maize-meal mixture at 50 per cent.  We do not know to what the price of oats is going up, or what contribution it will make to the pool out of which those wages will have to be paid.  The farmer went on to point out that in 1917 barley was contributing <Col N="911" /> 1/11½ per stone, or 31/6 a barrel to the pool.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that price affect this Money Resolution; even as amended to meet the Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in so far as I can argue that that was contributing to the wages pool.  There is only one other item I propose to mention.  He mentioned that his fat cattle were then contributing 67/- per cwt. to the pool out of which he paid his labourers' wages, and they are now worth 23/-.  At that time he was deemed to be giving a fair share of those profits to the labourer if he was giving him 25/-.  He says now, on the present prices, and with the average agricultural wage at present being 21/9, the obvious purpose of this Act is to raise that wage substantially&mdash; or certainly it ought to be its object &mdash;and how can it be raised substantially, assuming that the figures of 1917 were fair, unless the Government provides money to bridge the gap? Now, Deputies of the Labour Benches made strong speeches on the principle of this Bill.  Now comes the time for them to tell us where they expect the money to come from to make up that difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am for the Bill. I am for the Bill on condition that the Government will make up the difference between a fair wage for those agricultural labourers and a wage that the farmer can pay.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does Deputy Corish propose to get 30/- out of a farmer for his labourer if the farmer himself is earning no more than 29/-?  There is <Col N="912" /> no other method of getting it under the present circumstances than that of the Minister making a contribution out of the Exchequer.  A sum of £20,000,000 has been taken out of the fund from which these wages must come.  That £20,000,000 must be put back before a fair wage can be paid to the agricultural labourer.  On the Second Reading, I urged one method by which the thing could be done, but that has been rejected and now there is only one other method, and that is that the Exchequer should put the money there&mdash;and, if it is going to put it there, now is the time to do it. If it is not going to do it, then it is up to the Minister to tell us how he proposes to meet the dilemma of paying a fair wage to the agricultural labourer if the men who employ him have not got the money to pay him. There is no escape from that dilemma. Deputy Corish says that he has made himself perfectly clear.  To this categorical question, I ask an answer: How does this House propose to get a fair wage for an agricultural labourer out of a farmer who is not able to pay him that wage, unless the Exchequer makes up the difference?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to deal, Sir, with a few of the statements made by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon completely ignores the position in which we found agriculture when we came into office.  The position of agriculture then was very clearly exemplified in a resolution that was proposed at a meeting of his local council, by a member of the Party opposite here in the Dáil, calling on the then Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister for Lands, not to look for any annuities and to grant a moratorium on account of the depressed prices of agricultural produce <Col N="913" /> in the year 1929.  That resolution was proposed, at the meeting of his local council, by Deputy Carey, who represented my constituency in the Dáil at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the farmers are £20,000,000 worse off now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the position in 1929&mdash;that the farmers in my constituency, under the then Government, were completely unable to meet their annuities or the charges that were on them.  Anybody looking at the value of agricultural produce in those years, will realise that that position had worsened considerably up to 1932, and it is only within the last three or four years that the farmers are recovering from that position.  It is true that they have had to change completely their methods of farming in order to recover from that position.  Let us take an instance of Deputy Dillon's own figures for 1934 and compare them with the figures for 1936.  Last year the farmers grew over 250,000 acres of wheat.  That was practically £2,500,000 for wheat as compared with his figures, and the value of beet has gone up also. My figures for beet are close on £900,000 this year.</P>

On the Second Reading of this Bill all this matter was thrashed out.  They then tried to create a smoke-screen to justify themselves in not voting on the Bill.  The Party opposite are afraid to say that the farmer should pay more wages to the labourers.  That is through their fear of losing farmer votes.  They are afraid to vote against the Bill for fear of losing labour votes. The Party opposite are trying to trim in this Bill.  It is a particularly difficult <Col N="918" /> Bill for them.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Party opposite are afraid to compel the farmers to pay a better wage.  This is all a political stunt and they are trying to cover up their tricks.  In 1929, when prices were better, there were farmers who paid 17/- a week and less to their labourers. We say that they should pay more. Deputy Dillon is afraid to say so because he is afraid to lose their support. I would like to see the Party opposite displaying, on Bills like this, a little bit of courage.  Let them vote for or against the Bill and let them not try to please everybody.  Deputy Dillon condemns subsidies, but he is now in favour of subsidies for agricultural wages.  He says there must be money made available by the Exchequer to pay a better agricultural wage to the labourer.  All this thing was gone into fully on the Second Reading and there is no necessity to go into it again.  The Deputy talks about the farmers' income being down by £24,000,000 though it has been pointed out that it has gone up by £10,000,000 in the last two years.  There is no reason why we should have Second Reading speeches on this motion.  There is no use in Deputy Dillon going into those figures and talking about 67/- for beef and 42/-for barley, and so on.  He says he has been given those figures by a friend; but how they were made up I do not know.  If this Resolution is passed, the Minister could put £4,000,000 into the funds or put nothing at all so far as the Resolution is concerned. If the Deputy wanted to argue out the point he should argue it out on his own amendment.  This Money Resolution would enable me to pay £3,000,000 to £4,000,000.</P>

      <P>On this side of the House we will support the Bill.  The farmers are not against it.  I am a farmer and I am not afraid to support it.  I recognise that agricultural labourers are not getting enough <Col N="920" /> money.  I would like to see them getting a good living.  I employ men and pay them 18/-, but I give them other allowances to make up their income.  If I have to give them more money the position will be that I will have to employ less men.  I would like to see labouring men getting enough to live on, and I believe that no man can support a family on less than 30/- a week.  I am not a bit ashamed to support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister charged us with trying to draw a red herring across the track, by alleging that the farmers were not in the position to pay what we think is a fair wage. We are held up to public odium as a type of snap politicians.  I want to quote shortly a statement made by the Bishop of Ross who, I suppose, is not a politician in the controversial sense of the word.  He said that the population was at present decreasing and he attributed that to two reasons &mdash;a falling marriage rate and emigration&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said his Lordship, &ldquo;arise from economic conditions.  No man will enter the marriage state unless he has a reasonable prospect of being able to support a wife and family in frugal comfort.  I can see no possibility of the small farmer, and much less the agricultural labourer, being able to do this, as long as the present economic conditions prevail.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The wages of farm labourers are wretched in the extreme, but, wretched as they are, it is beyond the power of the ordinary farmer to pay them, much less to increase them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either that is true or it is not.  The Bishop of Ross says it is true, and he attributes it to two causes.  Deputy Corry says it is cheap politics because I put it that way deliberately.  I say that the wages are wretched.  I say, with the Bishop of Ross, wretched as they are, farmers cannot afford to pay more much less increase them.  What escape does Deputy Corish suggest out of that dilemma?  I say that if we were living in normal times it would be economically sound to put <Col N="921" /> money from the Treasury into a subsidy of this kind.  But I say that we are not living in normal circumstances, and that we are faced with the situation that the Bishop of Ross describes. What is Deputy Corish's method of dealing with the dilemma?  Does he say that farmers are sweaters; that they could pay their labourers more but are depriving them of the money? Does the Minister say that the farmers are sweating the labourers, or that they are able to pay more but are too mean to do so; or, does he agree with the Bishop of Ross, that while the wages are wretched the farmers are not in the position to pay them much less increase the amount?  What position does he take up?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer that.  I stated here already that in 1925, when farmers were supposed to be better off than they are now, there were working farmers paying labourers much less than 17/-.  Certainly, they should have been able to pay more then because the majority were paying over 20/-, and many over 25/-.  Those paying under 17/- should certainly have been able to pay more.  In operating this Bill there will be no subsidy, and I ask the Party opposite to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; without any trimming.</P>

      <P>And the Minister takes it, therefore, that there is no necessity to assist farmers in any way to pay satisfactory wages to agricultural labourers.  If that is so, taking the figures provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, farmers in Kildare and Kerry have to make up out of their present incomes the 6/- a week that wages have fallen in these two counties since 1931, in Wicklow they have to make up 4/-; and in Meath, Louth, and Wexford 3/6.  If the Minister is able to suggest that any amelioration is going to occur in the farmers' condition that will put them in that position, it will be very interesting to hear the Minister arguing the details with regard to the farmers of Kildare and Kerry and showing that they are in a position to restore to the agricultural labourers the 6/- a week cut which has taken place in the wages of these labourers since 1931.</P>

He would maintain that the rate of wages obtained five years ago was not extravagant. Does the Minister intend that this Bill should restore that 6/- to the Kerry labourers?  If he does, where is it going to come from?  Does the Minister maintain that the farmers of Kerry are sweating their labourers, or does he maintain that they are giving them as much as they can afford?  If he accepts that latter contention, where are they going to get the 6/-that he insists they must pay over and above what they are paying at present? There is no use in the Minister trying to avoid that difficulty.  It is an absolutely essential difficulty in the Bill, or else the Bill is the purest fraud designed to do nothing for the labourer except pay him lip service.</P>

      <P>We are asked by the Minister to vote for or against this Bill without any trimming.  I should like to know if there were such a lot of trimmers in this country before as there are on the benches opposite.  I am very sorry that the Minister is taking up this attitude and that we have had such high tempers to-night on the opposite side in connection with this Bill.  Everyone in the House will agree that the Bill is overdue, but I am sorry that the Bill is coming at such a time when the farmers are in such a sorry plight owing to the policy of the present Government.  We all agree that agricultural workers should be paid a decent wage and we know that a great lot of farmers are paying decent wages to their workers.  Deputy Corry stated that the farmers are recovering. The Deputy is a member of the Cork County Council and he knows that that council carried forward last year £90,000 in rates which they could not collect.  He knows that the &ldquo;flying squad&rdquo; is still in Fermoy <Col N="925" /> trying to collect the annuities from the farmers.  He talks about the wages paid to the agricultural workers in England. You cannot compare the method of farming in England with the method of farming in this country and the prices paid for agricultural produce. There is no use in talking about beet and wheat.  We know that the farmers in England get a good profit from the cattle that they feed and that they get a good price for other agricultural produce.  What do the farmers in this country get for any other produce except beet or wheat, and what would they get for these if they were not subsidised?</P>
      <P>The farmers are now asked to pay increased wages to their workers.  It is only right that the workers should be paid a decent wage.  Deputy Corry and the Minister say that there should not be any subsidy paid under this Bill.  There has been no objection to the subsidy paid for the growing of beet and wheat to help the farmers to get along while the economic war is on.  Subsidies are being paid in these cases.  Why should not the subsidy campaign be now extended to the agricultural workers?  It is the only way of getting over the difficulty at the present time&mdash;that the Minister should subsidise the agricultural workers' wages and not ask the farmers to pay all the increase in the wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to move my amendment in the form in which it appears on the Order Paper but perhaps, Sir, you would permit me to raise the point on the section at this stage.  Under the definition section of the Bill it is provided that &ldquo;the expression `agricultural worker' means a person employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship whose work under such contract is or includes work in agriculture, but does not include a person, whose work under any such contract is or includes <Col N="926" /> domestic service.&rdquo; I take strong exception to the last portion of that section, because it seems to me to provide a very convenient way out of the provisions of this Bill for persons who might be unscrupulous enough to avail of the loophole provided by the Minister in this very wide definition which he has drawn.  I can concede, of course, that it is not the intention to bring a domestic servant within the scope of the section, or to bring a domestic servant's standard of remuneration within the scope of a Bill designed primarily to regulate the conditions of agricultural workers.  But it seems to me that under this section, as drafted, it is possible for an agricultural employer to plead, in support of his contention that an employee is outside the scope of the Bill, and that his wages, consequently, may not be regulated by the provisions of the Bill, that the person concerned performs domestic service.  If, therefore, it can be shown by such agricultural employer that any particular employee performs domestic service, that person seems to me to go outside the scope of the Bill.  It may, therefore, be advantageous for agricultural employers to employ their workers, indoor, perhaps, or even outdoor for some portion of their time on domestic work and in that way evade completely the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I hardly imagine that the Minister contemplates leaving so wide a loophole for evasion under the Bill.  I should like to suggest to him that that definition section should be tightened in such a way as to make it impossible for any person to ride completely outside the scope of the Bill by resorting to a subterfuge of that kind.  I suggest to the Minister that the section might be amended to make clear that it does not include &ldquo;a female person whose work under any such contract is or includes domestic service,&rdquo; but it seems to be contrary to the whole spirit of the Bill that, if you employ a person on domestic work, you can, by reason of the fact, have that person excluded from the regulatory provisions of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that Deputy Norton has raised, I suggest to the <Col N="927" /> Minister that there is very grave doubt as to what exactly an agricultural labourer is.  I have been told by a friend who recently had dealings with a national health insurance inspector who was checking over his national health insurance cards, that this inspector told him that if you employed a man for draining, ditching or, I think, growing vegetables in a market garden, this work did not come within the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labour.&rdquo;  If that be the case for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, presumably whatever definition is accepted there will be accepted here.  In my own experience, I never had any difficulty of that kind at all. I have never stamped an unemployment insurance card for a man working exclusively on my farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to unemployment insurance or national health insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment insurance. As the Minister knows, the national health insurance inspector very often gives advice on unemployment insurance, although it is not his primary duty.  I have never stamped an unemployment insurance card for a man working exclusively on the farm. If he had to do jobs of another kind he would, of course, get his unemployment insurance card stamped but not while working on the farm.  I have had men digging drains and ditching and I have never stamped an unemployment card for them and have never heard it suggested that I should.  I mention the matter now because whatever definition is accepted for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Acts is certain to be extended to this Act.  Therefore, I suggest that a very close examination should be made of the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; in respect of national health insurance and unemployment insurance and, if any obscurity exists, a fresh definition should be incorporated in this section which would expressly deal with any obscurity that has arisen in respect of the other two bodies of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point made by Deputy Norton.  I do not know that the <Col N="928" /> Deputy's suggestion to insert the words &ldquo;female worker&rdquo; would fully cover the point.  I agree with him that the sub-section, as drafted, is rather loose.  I should also like to point out that there are scattered throughout the country a number of farmers&mdash;bachelors, childless widowers and others&mdash;who employ agricultural labourers and do not employ any female labour.  In these cases, a certain amount of the domestic work, if not all, is done by the agricultural labourer.  If a farmer of that type wanted to evade this section he could easily do so.  I can see the difficulty of providing against that, but I think the Minister should look into the matter because there are many farms on which the domestic work is done by male labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest an amendment to be brought up on Report Stage.  On account of the order of business, we may have to take the Report Stage to-morrow.  I agree with Deputy Norton and Deputy Morrissey that the Bill might be evaded&mdash;and evaded with the connivance of the employee.  There is always a danger in Bills of this kind, that an employee desirous of getting work may agree to take a shilling or two less than the sum fixed.  In this case, he might connive at being regarded as a domestic servant merely because he does some small duty in the house, such as lighting the fire in the morning.  I had intended, in order to get over that difficulty, to change the two words &ldquo;or includes&rdquo; in line 19 to &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.  The provision would then read: &ldquo;agricultural worker... does not include a person whose work under any such contract is mainly domestic service&rdquo;.  The board would have to be satisfied&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the Minister who decides whether a man is an agricultural labourer or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You are quite right in that.  The Minister would have to be satisfied that the class of people being excluded were mainly engaged in domestic service.  The type of person who would be excluded would be the girl doing most of the domestic <Col N="929" /> work but who might milk cows, in addition, or do small jobs outside.  I think the amendment I have suggested would cover that case and make evasion in the other case, in the manner I described, impossible.  With regard to what Deputy Dillon said, I am not sure what exactly was the difficulty.  Perhaps it was National Health Insurance that caused the difficulty. Under this Bill, we shall have, so far as we can, to define farmers and farm labourers and, for all practical purposes, the labourer working for the farmer will be a farm labourer under the Bill.  I do not think there will be any difficulty, whether these men are ditching or shoring.  If they are carpenters or masons, it will, of course, be a different matter.  But if they are doing work peculiar to a farm, such as making ditches or draining, they will be regarded as farm labourers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing on the Order Paper in the name of this Party:</P>
      <P>Having regard to the wholly inadequate rates of benefit originally provided for unemployed persons under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and to the fact that during the last two years the retail prices of commodities normally used in working-class homes have been raised substantially, this House requests the Executive Council to introduce proposals for amending the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 and 1935, with a view to providing from State funds adequate maintenance for all persons unable to obtain remunerative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this motion is to bring to the notice of the House the inadequate rates of benefit which are provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, and to direct the attention of the House to the fact that, whatever value these rates had from the standpoint of their purchasing power in 1933, that purchasing <Col N="932" /> power has since shrunken by reason of the increase in the cost of living in the meantime.  At the same time, the object of the motion is to ask the House, in view of these considerations, which make a human appeal to Deputies of all Parties, that the Executive Council should be requested to introduce amending legislation so as to raise substantially the present utterly inadequate rates of benefit provided under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>
    <P>When the Unemployment Assistance Act was passing through the House in 1933, we then complained that the rates of benefit provided under it were utterly inadequate, but if these rates were inadequate to the circumstances of 1933, and inadequate having regard to the cost of living datum line in 1933, they are still more inadequate now. In 1933, when passing the main Act, the House fixed certain maximum rates of benefit, varying in county boroughs from 9/- per week, payable to a man with no dependents, to a maximum of 20/- per week to a man with a wife and five dependent children.  In urban towns the rates for the same classes varied from 7/- per week to 15/- per week, and in other areas, which included rural areas and large-sized towns, towns with a population of 6,900, for instance, the rates of benefit for the same classes varied from 6/- per week to 12/6 per week.  At that time it was possible, under the terms of the Act as then passed by the Oireachtas, to have the first 2/- of means excluded in the calculation of the claimant's right to get the rates of benefit which I have just quoted.  Since then, for economy reasons, the Government have introduced an Amending Act, the purpose of which was to save money to the Exchequer.  That was done by the simple expedient of disregarding not 2/-, but only 1/-, which meant, in effect, a substantial reduction, so far as the claimants were concerned, in the scales of benefit which they were then receiving.  However, a combination of that latter factor, of certain portions of the means being excluded, with the maximum rates of benefit which I have quoted, gives the House some picture of the State's benevolence as conceived by the Legislature in 1933.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> When we passed this Act in that year the cost-of-living index figure, as ascertained by the Department of Industry and Commerce, showed that the food index figure was 129, an increase of 29 points on the datum line of 100 which was taken as the basis of calculation for July, 1934.  In August, 1936, three years afterwards, the last month for which figures in respect of the cost-of-living index figure are available, we find that the food index had risen from 129 to 145, an increase in food prices alone of 12½ per cent. In that respect one has got to bear in mind that the extent of the increase does not give even an adequate picture of the real increase, because the cost-of-living index figure is measured by standards so rigid that it is not possible to import into it a calculation of the fluctuations in that figure of the precise circumstances in respect of each individual family.  But, at all events, assuming that in 1933 we regarded the maximum benefits of 20/-, 17/- and 12/6 as something that ought to be paid, having regard to the living standards of that time, I think that we are now, as a matter of the merest equity, entitled to say that these figures have lost their purchasing power considerably since they were introduced in that year, and that the least the State ought to recognise is that these rates of benefit ought to be adjusted to the extent that their purchasing power has shrunk in recent years.</P>
    <P>But, as I have said, the cost-of-living index figure cannot be regarded as a true index of the standard of living in working-class homes, nor can it give a proper picture of the effect of rises in the cost of living in respect of particular commodities in the homes of unemployed members of the community. In the case of an unemployed man there are certain staple articles of diet upon which he is obliged to depend in very large measure.  He is not able to consume, by reason of his impoverished economic condition, the wide range of commodities which enter into the compilation of the cost-of-living index figure. He is obliged to discard, because of his economic circumstances, many of the commodities which are used to test <Col N="934" /> price movements, and instead is thrown back on certain articles of food which, in main, can be bought by him at lesser prices than those at which other articles can be purchased. Thus, we find that in the case of an unemployed man there are certain articles, such as flour, bread, butter and coal, which necessarily absorb the greatest portion of his income, and it is on these articles that the bulk of his income is spent, not merely because these articles are essential, but because in his economic condition they are regarded as staple articles of food for his family.</P>
    <P>If we look at the fluctuations in the prices of these articles since the House passed the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933, we get a picture which shows that, far from the cost-of-living index figure for food having risen only by 12½ per cent., the actual increase, particularly in respect of these commodities, is substantially higher than that revealed by an examination of the official cost-of-living index figure.  Take, for example, flour.  In August, 1933, household flour could be purchased at 28/- or 29/- a sack.  The present price of flour is approximately 40/-.  The price of flour, therefore, has increased by 12/- a sack since the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed.  That represents an increase of 38 per cent. in the price of flour in the three years 1933-1936.  To the extent that flour is a staple article of food in the domestic budget of an unemployed man, he is paying a substantial portion of his income away in purchasing a commodity that has increased much beyond the level of the ordinary articles which comprise the cost-of-living index figure.  If we take bread, another staple article of food in the working-class budget, we find that in 1933 the value of the 4lb.-loaf was approximately 7½d.  Now we have an Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce fixing the price of the same loaf at 9½d.  That is an increase of 2d. between 1933 and 1936.  In that case we find the cost of bread to the unemployed man, and to the employed man as well, has increased by 27 per cent. as compared with the figure ruling when the House passed the Unemployment Assistance Act in 1933.</P>

      <Col N="935" /> In respect of coal, the price in 1933 was approximately 35/- a ton for a consumable quality of household coal. The price to-day is approximately 45/-, an increase of 28 per cent. as compared with the figure obtaining in 1933.  Take, then, flour, bread and coal&mdash;three important articles in the budget of the working-class family, and particularly important in the budget of an unemployed man's family.  We find that the cost of these commodities has risen from 27 per cent. over the 1933 figure in the case of bread, to 38 per cent. over the 1933 figure in the case of flour. If we go over some other articles which are normally consumed in working-class homes, although some of them may now seem to be a luxury in the home of an unemployed man, having regard to the price and the low rates of benefit provided, we find that sugar shows an increase over the 1933 figure, that tea shows an increase, that milk shows an increase and that bacon and butter show an increase; so that, in respect of that important range of articles of food which plays an important part in the domestic economy of working-class homes, we find there have been substantial increases in the price of all these staple articles to-day as compared with the position when the House passed the Act three years ago.</P>
    <P>In the face of this incontrovertible evidence of a substantial increase in the cost of living, and in face of the fact that that increase must necessarily mean considerable suffering, considerable pinching, considerable belt-tightening in the homes of unemployed people, I think the House will readily realise that there is a substantial case for increasing the rates of benefit provided in the 1933 Act.  But the House could usefully employ a few minutes of its time considering whether&mdash;seeing the State accepts responsibility for providing work or maintenance, or at least that spokesmen on behalf of the Government Party have claimed that the State does now accept responsibility for providing work or maintenance&mdash;the scales of maintenance provided are such as are sufficient to maintain unemployed people in a state of bodily efficiency, even though a <Col N="936" /> strong case could be made for every human being enjoying a standard of physical comfort much above that which is necessary to maintain one in mere physical health.</P>
    <P>The present scales of unemployment assistance condemn a man in Dublin to try to maintain himself, his wife and five children on an income of 20/-. If the man happens to live in the town of Naas or in the town of Athy he is expected to keep himself, his wife and five children on a maximum benefit of 12/6 a week.  If the Minister were to examine the figures relating to the percentage of persons who receive the maximum rates of benefit, he would find that considerable numbers of people fail to obtain the maximum rates because of the particularly stringent regulations which have been devised for measuring income, regulations which place a fantastic valuation on the most trivial form of income or property.  I have said that these maximum rates vary from 12/6 to 20/- a week.  If the State claims that these rates of benefit are adequate, then the State ought to be prepared to show those who are the recipients how it is possible for them, on such low scales, to maintain a healthy physical existence.</P>
    <P>In 1933 a very responsible body, the British Medical Association, without any political bias, without any social bias, and concerned in the matter purely from the standpoint of physical well-being, set up a committee to examine the cost of providing food for the working classes so as barely to maintain health.  The committee consisted of very eminent people in the medical profession and, after a most microscopic and impartial examination of the needs of a working-class man and his family, they issued a report and in that report, which was subscribed to by very eminent people, it was declared that the minimum cost of food to maintain that type of family in the minimum state of health was 5/10½ a week in respect of an adult man, 4/11 a week in the case of an adult woman; in the case of a child of 12 the committee reported that 5/4 a week was necessary; in the case of a child of nine that 4/2 was necessary <Col N="937" /> and in the case of a child of six that 3/4½ was necessary.</P>
    <P>When one examines the combined cost of maintaining a man, his wife and three children on frugal fare, designed only to provide physical health, one finds that £1 3s. 8d. is necessary.  That was in 1933 in Great Britain, where the cost-of-living index figure is lower than here and where resort to substitute foods is easier than it is here.  We have a responsible organisation such as the British Medical Association declaring, with the reputation of the many eminent people who comprise the committee and the association, that it was necessary for two adults and three children to have £1 3s. 8d. per week spent on food, in order barely to maintain them in health.  If that were the figure for 1933 in Britain or here, it must inevitably be revised in an upward direction by reason of the change in the cost-of-living index figures which has taken place in the meantime.  If this association found that that expenditure was necessary to purchase the minimum quantity of food to maintain health for a working-class family in Great Britain in 1933, one may be sure, by a comparison of the index figures in both countries and by such experience as one may have of both countries, that it would have required a greater expenditure of money to provide the same articles of food here.</P>
    <P>If we assume, however, for the sake of convenience, that what applied there in the matter of purchasing power applies equally here, we get a picture from a responsible organisation such as that that the minimum expenditure on food for a working-class family in 1933, consisting of a man, his wife and three children, was £1 3s. 8d., and we get some picture of how inadequate the present unemployment assistance rates are.  Then, when we have finished reflecting on the big discrepancy between the rates of benefit provided here and the cost of maintaining a minimum standard of health as ascertained by the British Medical Association, we must remember that that estimate of expenditure was in respect of food alone.  Working-class families must pay rent; they must buy <Col N="938" /> clothes; they must buy fuel; they must obtain light; there are school books to be paid for; there is medicine to be purchased from time to time; recreation has to be obtained, to say nothing whatever of the necessity of occasionally renewing articles of furniture and domestic utensils.  If we make allowance for items of expenditure under these heads, particularly in respect of rent, clothing, fuel and light, I should think the cost of maintaining a minimum standard of health and a minimum standard of comfort would be not less than 45/- a week, but here, under our Unemployment Assistance Act, workers are expected to be able to exist and to obtain those articles which are necessary for human existance on scales of benefit which would not purchase a fraction of the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>We offer to the family, which the British Medical Association said would require £1 3s. 8d., 17/6 in Dublin; in an urban town with a population of 7,000 or over, 13/6, and in towns with a population of less than 7,000, 12/-per week.  A body of eminent medical men prescribed as necessary the expenditure of 23/8 on food to maintain a minimum standard of health, and our reply to that is to offer 12/-to the same family to purchase, not only food, but to pay rent and buy clothes, fuel, light and the other necessaries of life which will readily occur to the minds of Deputies.  I cannot imagine on what possible standard the Government can justify the continuance of these low rates of benefit, and can seek to defend these rates as capable of providing a reasonable standard of life for working-class families.</P>
    <P>If we look at official records, it will be found that the cost of maintaining a person in a hospital, that is, the cost of providing provisions and such other ancillary things as one might receive in a hospital, varies from 6/-per week in County Waterford to 11/1 per week in County Meath.  If one were to assume that, perhaps, there might be a little luxury provided for a patient in a hospital, and that that standard could not be accepted as something approaching the normal <Col N="939" /> standard of a working-class family, we can move on to the county homes, where, I think, everybody will agree a standard of luxury is not very much in evidence.  Taking the rates which are necessary for the maintenance of persons in county homes, we find that they vary from 4/2 per week in Waterford to 6/3 in Cavan, so that even though hospitals might buy food in large quantities and receive specially low tenders from contractors in order to obtain contracts, and even though county homes can purchase foodstuffs in the same way, whether you judge it on the basis of maintenance in a hospital or in a county home, the expenditure on the supply of provisions varies from 6/- to 11/1 per week in the case of hospitals, to from 4/2 to 6/3 in the case of county homes.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister will attempt to say that there is any extravagance in the provision of food in county homes.  If we take it that the county home standard, appallingly low though that is, is a standard by which we can test the cost of maintaining bodily health&mdash;and the figures, let me say, bear a striking resemblance to the figures published by the British Medical Association &mdash; we find that even that standard is much above the standards made available to unemployed people under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  For instance, in Cavan, where it costs 6/3 per week to provide food for patients in county homes&mdash;two adults costing 12/6 per week, and that expenditure is purely in respect of foodstuffs supplied to the patient&mdash;if there were a family consisting of two adults and three children, and the breadwinner was unemployed, he would be expected to provide food and clothing, pay rent, purchase fuel and obtain light, for himself, his wife and his three children for seven days each week for the sum of 12/6 per week.  The State recognises the necessity for the expenditure of 12/6 per week to maintain two adults in the county home, and it expects a family consisting of a man, his wife and three children, to purchase the same foodstuffs&mdash;because the State dare not expect them to purchase less&mdash;and to provide food, <Col N="940" /> clothing and shelter on the same insignificant sum of 12/6.  There is the addition that three children must be provided for out of the 12/6 received in the form of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I say that comparisons of that kind, and the day-to-day experience of Deputies, their day-to-day and week-to week contact with unemployed persons, must convince the House, if the House were free to express its mind freely on this matter, that there is an urgent need for an upward revision of the present rates of unemployment assistance benefit.  The plight of those who are endeavouring to exist on these inadequate scales is appalling.  Any Deputy who has any contact with the unfortunate people who are trying to maintain themselves on these inadequate rates of benefit knows only too well the harrowing stories which they tell, stories which reveal that they are unable to purchase the barest necessities of life on the inadequate pittance which the State makes available for them.  I think many Deputies are familiar with the complaints made by recipients of unemployment assistance, that the largest portion of their expenditure is spent in paying rent in order to obtain shelter for themselves and their dependents.  I think Deputy Harris is very familiar with the position in Athy.  There the maximum rate of unemployment assistance is 12/6, and there are not many who get even 12/6.  The urban council there rightly dealt with the slums, which were a disgrace to the town, and, as a result of a number of slum clearance schemes, were able to eradicate the slums and to erect new houses to which these unfortunate slum dwellers were transferred. The economic rent of each of the houses erected would probably be in the vicinity of 8/- per week, perhaps 8/6 per week, but because of the subvention for housing in the case of slum clearance schemes, the houses were let at 3/10 each.</P>
    <P>If Deputies dwell just for a moment on the position of an unemployed man with a wife and five children in Athy, receiving a sum of 12/6 per week in the form of unemployment assistance <Col N="941" /> paying 3/10 a week to the local authority for a house, and trying to maintain seven people for seven days on the balance of 8/8, I think the House will have no hesitation in realising that the plight of that unfortunate family, which has to provide, food, clothing, fuel, light and all other items of domestic expenditure for seven persons out of a sum of 8/8 per week, reveals a picture of the most harrowing poverty.  If each member of that family were to obtain three meals per day, it would mean that 21 meals would have to be provided per day.  If they were to spend 1d. per person for each meal, it would mean that they would have to spend 1/9 per day or 12/3 per week.  I do not think anybody will attempt to suggest that there is sufficient nutriment in a meal costing 1d., particularly for adults or growing children.  Yet if the family were to spend even 1d. per meal&mdash;and the House can get some picture of the meal one would get for 1d. in face of the rising cost of living &mdash; the family would have spent 12/3 per week on meals alone.  But the family are not allowed 12/3 per week to spend on meals.  They are only allowed 8/8, approximately two-thirds of the figure of the expenditure that would be incurred if 1d. were spent on each meal.  The result is that the family is permitted only to spend two-thirds of 1d. per meal for each member of the family.  That is a picture of the prosperity that is available for those who are endeavouring to exist on the inadequate rates of benefit provided by the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Then we have got to remember that clothing, light, school books and all the other necessary items of expenditure have to be met so that the family cannot spend even two-thirds of 1d. per meal for each member of the family.</P>
    <P>I think I have said sufficient on this matter to convince the House that not merely do the present rates of benefit disclose that they are incapable of providing even a minimum standard of existence for recipients of unemployment assistance, but they disclose, in addition, that in respect to those who are compelled to exist on such rates, they are suffering not only impoverishment, but hunger and malnutrition <Col N="942" /> of the grossest kind.  I doubt if any Deputy in the House would hesitate to listen to a demand on any section of the population to remedy hunger and privation where such conditions were known to exist amongst large sections of the community.  I think from the figures I have quoted &mdash;and those figures will be supplemented by others from Deputies who will speak in support of the motion&mdash; that the rates of unemployment assistance will not protect unemployed workers and their families from hunger and from the grossest forms of malnutrition.  The motion which I have submitted&mdash;I hope in a non-contentious way&mdash;seeks to apply a remedy to the problem and to the evil with which it deals.  I hope that Deputies, realising their responsibility to the weak and destitute section of the community, will vote for the motion, and instruct the Executive Council to introduce legislation providing for a substantial increase in the present rates.</P>

      <P>I think it desirable that I should intervene in the debate at this stage in order to prevent any other Deputy following the same line that Deputy Norton adopted, because it is quite clear from the nature of the speech which he has delivered in advocating his motion, and from the nature of the statistics and other information which he gave to the House, that he has a complete misconception or, at any rate, pretends to have a complete misconception, of the purposes which the unemployment assistance scheme is intended to serve.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was not introduced for the purpose of determining the amount of money that would be required by a family in any part of Ireland to maintain itself in each week of the year. The unemployment assistance scheme was designed to give a contribution, within the limits that the resources of the State would permit, to each unemployed person, to enable him to maintain himself during temporary unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have never described the rates of unemployment assistance payable as capable of maintaining any unemployed person for a protracted period.  Deputy Norton has spoken as if those unemployed persons who are in receipt of unemployment assistance never got work at all, as if they had to exist upon the amount of money provided by the Unemployment Assistance Act all the year round, one week after another. The fact, as I have frequently pointed out to the House, is that of the persons who are unemployed in urban areas on any one day, 25 per cent. will be in employment again within a fortnight, and the great majority of them will have found employment within eight weeks.  Examination of the history of individual applicants in relation to employment and unemployment has shown that to be the case. The number of persons who are unemployed for protracted periods, for half a year or a whole year at a time, is a very small minority of the total number of persons drawing unemployment assistance in urban areas.  I am excluding from the number of unemployed for the purposes of that calculation certain classes of unemployed persons&mdash;or persons who are at any rate described as unemployed &mdash;living in rural areas, that is, the sons of small farmers and the like, living with their fathers on their fathers' farms.  Those persons are statutorily entitled to describe themselves as unemployed, but in fact they are not unemployed in the ordinary sense of the term, nor are they likely to suffer the physical consequences of unemployment which urban workers suffer.  This unemployment assistance scheme was introduced not because we thought it was possible for this State, out of its resources, to provide for every unemployed family every week a sum of money sufficient to maintain it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; but for the purpose of supplementing from State funds whatever other means they had, trusting that their periods of unemployment <Col N="944" /> would be short, and that in any event the other measures adopted by the State to provide employment would become operative.  There is, however, one limit, and one limit only, to the amount we can provide, and that is the sum which the taxpayers of this country contribute for this service.  The Unemployment Assistance Act of last year cost £1,600,000. That is a large sum of money.  It requires a large number of various taxes, bearing upon all sections of the people, to raise that sum.  The minimum increase which would have to be made in order to effect the minimum increase in the various rates of unemployment assistance payable to unemployed persons would involve a substantial amount of new taxation. Deputy Norton and Deputy Morrissey are, of course, in the happy position that they can come to the Dáil demanding increased expenditure on this service, while at the same time reserving the right to vote against the measures designed to bring in the money to enable the cost of the service to be met.</P>

In addition to this £1,600,000 which is being paid each year in respect of unemployment assistance, the State is providing almost £200,000 for the provision of free beef; a sum of £90,000 for free milk which is distributed to the children of unemployed persons, and there are grants for the provision of school meals.  The children attending over 500 schools in this country are provided with meals.  In 1934 an Act was adopted which enabled local authorities to provide unemployed persons with allotments of land for the purpose of growing their own vegetables, and in addition, in this year we have provided a sum of almost £2,500,000 for the financing of relief schemes for the purpose of giving employment.</P>

Firstly, the unemployment assistance scheme is not intended to provide adequate maintenance for unemployed persons all the year round, nor are the rates of assistance set out in the Schedule to the Act deemed to be the amounts required to enable families of the dimensions stated to maintain themselves.  Secondly, it is, in any event, only part of a much wider scheme, the main design of which is to put persons into employment and enable them to get wages sufficient to maintain themselves on a decent standard, and to make some provision for the day when they may become unemployed for some temporary period.  We have succeeded in putting into employment many thousands of people who had no hope of that employment some years ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton sought to support on two grounds his contention that the Unemployment Assistance Act should be amended to provide for higher rates of assistance; first, that <Col N="948" /> the rates fixed by the Act were too low in any event; secondly, that since the Act was passed there has been an increased cost of living.  Deputy Norton made most unserupulous use of the figures relating to the cost-of-living index supplied to him by my Department. It is not fair to compare the figures for May of one year with those for November of another year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did nothing of the kind.  There are seasonal fluctuations in the cost of food, and in studying statistics one must compare like with like.  The total increase in the cost of living between 1934 and 1936 is 4 per cent.  Even the figure for 1936, however, represents a decrease on that of 1932.  The cost of living in 1931-32 was higher than it is now, although there has been an increase in the past two years&mdash;an increase, however, which was much less in this country than in Great Britain.  The cost-of-living index in this country rose less than in Great Britain, but if we were to attempt to reflect that increase of 4.4 per cent. in the scales of unemployment assistance, it would not be possible to do so.  I take it that Deputies will agree that the smallest increase which could be contemplated in any of the 66 rates of unemployment assistance would be 6d. per week, and yet in the great majority of cases an increase of 6d. per week would be a greater proportionate increase than any increase in the cost of living that has taken place since the Act came into operation. I do not say that the rates of unemployment assistance set out in the schedule to the Act must be maintained unchanged for all time.  Circumstances may necessitate their variation from time to time, but there certainly is no ground as yet for an increase in the rates of unemployment assistance on the basis that the cost of living has risen.  In any event, we must take into account, not only the provision that has been made, under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, for the payment of relief, but also the provision that has been made in each year for other analogous services, and the <Col N="949" /> provision for analogous services I wish to mention is the Vote for the financing of relief works.</P>
      <P>It is much better that people should get a standard rate of wages for working than that they should be in receipt of unemployment assistance, and I hope that it will be possible in every year to increase the provision for the financing of relief works and to correspondingly reduce the provision for the financing of unemployment assistance schemes.  To the extent that that can be done, it will reflect the success which attends the various efforts adopted by the Government to promote that change.  Deputy Norton also, in regard to the cost-of-living index, stated his opinion that the index figure published by my Department was not a true reflex of the position in respect of working-class families.  I agree with him, but I agree with him for an entirely different reason.  In considering the cost of providing food for the families of unemployed persons, one must take into account the provision that has been made for the supply of free beef and milk and other free services at the State's expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let us take the position in regard to the future.  I understand that the public works which have been sanctioned in respect of the provision made in this year's Estimate to date, will involve a total cost of very nearly £1,500,000, and that sum is out of all proportion to any provision that was made in previous years for providing work for the unemployed, although the actual number of unemployed persons is less.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey, of course, can easily dispose of arguments by saying &ldquo;bosh,&rdquo; but he cannot dispose of them by counter arguments. Every available index which is there, every index to which economists would turn who wanted to find out the real <Col N="950" /> economic position in any country, points to a considerable improvement here.  There are many more people employed here.  As I have said, despite the greatly increased provision of money for the relief of the unemployed by way of relief and other schemes, there are more employed and fewer unemployed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That bears out my contention that although the amount provided is very much greater than in previous years, the number of unemployed is much fewer.  With regard to the provision of public works for the relief of unemployment, I think it is humanly impossible to devise any scheme of public works which would provide in each district the exact amount of work required to provide for all the unemployed in that district.  In any scheme devised by human beings for the relief of unemployment by means of the provision of public works there are bound to be gaps against which it is necessary to provide some safeguard such as the Unemployment Assistance Act, and that is all that the Unemployment Assistance Act was designed to be&mdash;a third line of defence against destitution, if we may call it so.  We aimed, first of all, to promote industrial development; to take every opportunity that was open to us to avail of our industrial potentialities so that our people would get, to whatever extent was possible, employment&mdash;permanent employment&mdash;in the production of the goods needed by themselves.  We aimed also to effect such changes in <Col N="951" /> the form of agricultural production as would make our agricultural policy sound and capable of maintaining a greater population on the land.  In both of these respects we have succeeded.  There are 50,000 more people permanently employed in industry and agriculture to-day than there were in 1931, and the progress which it was hoped to make in both these spheres is by no means completed. There is still sufficient scope for development both in industry and agriculture to provide employment for at least as many more, apart altogether from any changes in conditions which may occur in consequence of world revival or the reaction of world events upon our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, however, and while these long-term plans of employment were being worked out, we endeavoured to provide in every area schemes of public work which would provide for the immediate needs of the unemployed. The provision which has been made in each year in which this Government was in office exceeded the provisions made in all the ten years that our predecessors were in office.  I think that these schemes of public works were of great benefit to the countryside because, not merely did they lessen the immediate hardships of the unemployed, but they provided useful works in the areas affected, an increase in the national capital, and an improvement in the national estate.  There were, however, inevitably, gaps in that scheme of public works in each year, and against the possibility of these occurring this Unemployment Assistance Act was enacted, and that Act was intended to provide merely the maximum amounts that we thought the State could afford in order to supplement whatever other resources unemployed persons had during those temporary periods of unemployment. We did not attempt to fix amounts which would represent a reasonable standard of maintenance for the unemployed.  In fact, I made it as clear as words could make it, when introducing that Act, that the obligation of local authorities to relieve destitution and hardship in their areas was not being removed in the <Col N="952" /> slightest, and that if in any area or particular case the local authorities thought that the provision made under the Unemployment Assistance Act was inadequate, they had an obligation to supplement it, and a number of local authorities are, in fact, doing that. Remember, the local authorities are, in fact, doing it.</P>
    <P>My answer, therefore, to Deputy Norton's speech is, first, that the amount which is being provided for unemployment assistance represents the maximum amount which we think can be afforded by the people of this country under the present circumstances: that is the sum which the taxpayers of this country can contribute; secondly that it is only part of a much larger sum which is provided under various headings for the relief of unemployment. The total amount which has been provided to deal with unemployment is very little short of £5,000,000 this year and the provision of £5,000,000 by the people of this country for that one service is, in my opinion, a very great achievement, and represents a considerable burden of taxation, a burden to which Deputies in this House have frequently taken exception.  Thirdly, there has not been such an increase in the cost of living since the Act came into operation in August, 1934, as would justify an increase in the rates at this time.  The minimum increase in the rates would be 6d. a week and for the great majority an increase of 6d. a week would be a greater proportionate increase than the increase in the cost of living. Fourthly, Deputy Norton described his motion as offering a remedy for the position of the unemployed.  It does nothing of the kind.  If Deputy Norton wanted to provide a remedy for unemployed persons he should have supplemented his motion with a paragraph in which he would set out the direct taxation which would produce the amount involved.  So far as I know he is against direct taxation.  I do not know what particular increase in taxes the Deputy is prepared to support in order to meet the sum that he is advocating for unemployment assistance.  In this House we had him opposing an income-tax Vote.</P>

Will the Minister deny that many of the necessaries of life consumed in the working-class homes have gone up in price since 1932?  If the Minister contradicts that then I want to tell him that the figures as to these increases which I have in my hand are perfectly true.  These give an absolutely correct statement of the facts and they show that the cost of all these commodities consumed in the working-class homes have gone up very much.  Not once in his speech did the Minister direct his attention to that aspect of the situation. In addition to what the Minister has said about taxation, I wish to add that the Labour Party are themselves largely to blame for all sorts of taxation that the people have to bear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like at the outset to congratulate the Minister on his complete and absolute recovery from his recent illness.  The Minister was in his best form to-night.  Sometimes it is not easy to listen to the Minister when he seems to get a very thick wall behind himself and the absolute truth.  But on the whole one must admire the attempts which the Minister makes to put a good face on a bad case.  He is, perhaps, the only one on the opposite side who will get up and vigorously present a case whether right or wrong; at all events he can do it more successfully than any other Minister.  He wound up his speech by asking Deputy Norton to suggest to him what taxation it was that he was prepared to approve of in order to provide the funds needed to provide adequate rates of benefit for the unemployed.  Would the Minister tell the House what increases of taxation he had in mind when he with his colleagues of the Party opposite prepared the famous plan which was to provide employment for every person in this State?  The Minister is trying to get away from the promises made, not only by himself, but by the President and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They sought, and I am sorry to say got, the votes of the working classes and many of the unemployed in this country by very definite and specific promises from which the Minister and his Party are now running away.  The first was to provide employment for every person in this country willing and able to work and to provide that employment within a short time.  The President told us five years ago that if there had been a Christian Government in this country there would, in fact, be no unemployment. The Minister for Industry and Commerce had a plan by which a few industries would absorb 86,041 of the unemployed of this country.  He actually went further and said that we would not have sufficient people in this country to fill the jobs that would be available and that we would have to send to America and bring back those who emigrated during the previous Administration.  Under the present Administration&mdash;but not due to any action by the present Administration&mdash;<Col N="955" /> the people can no longer go to America.  Therefore they are emigrating in thousands to the country with which we are supposed to be at war. A Deputy on the Government Benches appears to disagree with this.  Perhaps the Deputy is going to deny it.  But the fact is that a great many of the Deputy's constituents had to cross to the other side of the water to Great Britain.  If there were as heavy a tax per head on human beings as there is on cattle imports to Great Britain in the last few years the British Government would have reaped quite a substantial amount in taxes from our people.  Does the Deputy on the other side of the House, who shows signs of disagreement, know that it is estimated that between 40,000 and 50,000 of our boys and girls emigrated to Great Britain last year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that there are fewer unemployed now than in 1932.  He cannot be so ignorant of the situation as to believe that. There are Deputies on the opposite benches who are in closer touch with the actual position than the Minister, and I defy any Deputy in any Party, and particularly in the Labour Party, to stand up and say that there are fewer unemployed now than in 1932, notwithstanding the thousands that have gone to Great Britain, and the thousands, that the Minister boasts, have been put into employment.  In one breath the Minister says there are fewer unemployed now than in 1932 but, in the next breath, he talks of the millions that the Government had provided to deal with unemployment.  Notwithstanding all the social services and all the relief schemes we have this motion brought forward by men who know the position.  The Minister knows quite well that he has not been able to deal with the problem, and that he has not been able to arrest it.  He knows quite well that there are more people than ever unemployed to-day. <Col N="957" /> There is no doubt about it.  The Minister spoke of 6d. a week on the insurance rates being more than enough to cover the increased cost of living in the last three years.  Does anybody else conversant with conditions in the country subscribe to that statement? Take one item alone, flour, which three years ago could be purchased for 1/6 a stone, and for which the poor people are paying 2/6 to-day.  Will the Minister concede at least one stone of flour to an unemployed man's family every week?  That would more than justify the minimum increase of 6d. which he spoke of.  There is no use talking about 4.2 per cent. to the average unemployed man.  The Minister and his Party cannot get away from the fact that they promised to provide employment. At the second election, when they began to doubt their ability to provide employment for all, they qualified it by promising full employment or maintenance. Every member of the Party, from the President down, did that but, to-night it was stated that they never promised full maintenance.  Each and every Deputy on the Government Benches did so.  The Minister talked about the resources of the country and he boasted of the millions &mdash; up to £5,000,000, he said&mdash;that this Government had provided for social services and for the unemployed.  Is not that boast the greatest proof of the failure of the promises made by the President and the Ministers?  If the Minister had provided work there would be no necessity for £2,500,000 for relief work and £1,200,000 for unemployment assistance. It is because the Government failed in their fundamental duty to provide work for these people in their own country that we are compelled to impose taxation to raise that money, and that is why Deputy Norton is compelled to bring this motion.</P>

      <P>Not a bit nasty as far as I am concerned.  There are two aspects of the Adrigole incident.  This much is clear, that neither the Deputy nor any member of his Party inside or outside the House was very much concerned about Adrigole or about the victims there when it happened.  I could quote cases that I know of personally, but I am not going to do so. As the Minister said I do not want to harrow the feelings of the House.  I could do so easily without departing in the slightest from the absolute truth. There is very little use in producing facts or figures or trying to make any case whatever to a man who after five years in office, and who is primarily charged with responsibility for the unemployed getting employment, gets up and tells that he has practically solved the problem; that there are more people in employment and fewer unemployed than when he took office. Even the most loyal member of his Party who is conversant with conditions in the constituencies would not subscribe to that.  Even the Minister himself does not believe it.  He knows that that is not the position.  The Minister will always go to extraordinary lengths to bolster up his case.  I could go into many aspects of this question, but I prefer to keep to the main points, and to contrast to the <Col N="959" /> House the Minister's promises and his performances&mdash;and the performances of those on the Front Benches if they were present.  Every person who has at heart not only the welfare of the unemployed, but the welfare of the country as a whole, would prefer to see these men in employment.  The Minister spoke about different schemes and the use that is going to be made of relief schemes.  What does that mean?  It means three days' work weekly for certain men and two days for others.  What does it mean in my constituency?  Some men who were getting unemployment assistance went out for three days' work last week, and others went out for two days.  They are deprived of unemployment assistance now and will not get the first wages for another month.  They are to live on the wind for a month without wages or unemployment assistance. Does the Minister consider that substituting 15/- a week with three days' hard work, for 12/6 unemployment assistance, is meeting the problem?  I do not expect that the Minister could be as close to this question as ordinary Deputies.  It would be utterly impossible for him, particularly for a Miniister who has such a tremendous task as the present Minister has, and with such a huge Department to look after. Those who are making this case are in daily touch with the people affected. I had no fewer than 50 of these men with me on Monday last about their position, and the statements I have made are the absolute truth.  I say without hesitation that there are more people unemployed in my constituency now, and with less hope of getting employment, than in 1932 or even 1934.</P>

      <P>I refuse to think that the Minister is so ignorant of the situation as one would be inclined to believe from the statement he made to-night.  Everyone will admit that the case made by Deputy Norton is unanswerable, and one would never think that the Minister would take up the attitude he took up.  Notwithstanding the figures quoted by Deputy Norton, the Minister said the increase in the cost of living would not be more than 6d. a week.  Anyone conversant <Col N="960" /> with the situation would have to admit that in one article of food alone, flour, the increase would be considerably more than 6d.  Within recent months coal has gone up by at least 5/- a ton. The price of butter, the price of tea, sugar and other articles of food have gone up since these rates were fixed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that when he was introducing the Bill to enable him to pay unemployment assistance he never suggested that it was meant to provide a reasonable standard of maintenance.  I am quite prepared to admit that that statement was made on the introduction of the Bill but, at the same time, I think we are entitled to assume that when the Bill was introduced he agreed to pay an amount per week which, in his opinion, and in the opinion of the Government, would be the absolute minimum upon which a man and his family could exist.  At the time, of course, we criticised the amount, and I think that the Minister should now reconsider the amount given in the light of the fact that it can be proved conclusively that the cost of living has increased considerably since the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very weil to quote certain figures and certain statistics.  It has been often stated that figures can be made to prove anything, and there is very little use in quoting statistics to the ordinary workingman or person in the country who is, day after day, confronted with the fact that the necessaries of life have been increasing in price within recent years.  The Minister suggested that Deputy Norton was making certain wild statements and that he was misrepresenting the position. I suggest to the Minister that nobody has misrepresented the position, or tried to misrepresent the position, more than he has done.  In the first place, he has told us the Government last year paid out in unemployment assistance the sum of £1,600,000, and led us to infer from the language which he used that in this year the sum would be something equivalent to that.  On top of that, he said, the Government were putting up £2,500,000 to provide work at standard rates.  I think the Minister will <Col N="961" /> admit that that statement is a rather extravagant one.  I am prepared to accept the figure of £1,600,000 as being the amount given to the unemployed last year, but I am not going to accept the statement that the Government, on top of that, are giving £2,500,000 this year towards the relief of unemployment. I suggest to the Minister that the extra amount given by the Government this year is in the vicinity of £800,000; that the balance of that £2,500,000 is being taken from the local authorities and the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  When the Minister for Finance submitted his Budget this year a large number of Deputies asked questions as to how this £2,500,000 was to be expended.  I think everybody inferred, not alone from the answers given by the Minister to the various questions asked in this connection, but also from the figures submitted in the Budget statement, that the local authorities were expected to put up one-third of the cost of any unemployment scheme carried out in their area.  A great number of Deputies looked upon that as being reasonable. Some Deputies indeed suggested that local authorities should not be asked to put up so much.</P>
    <P>But the position has changed considerably so far as local authorities are concerned since that statement was made, because any grant given for the relief of unemployment, in the various urban areas at least, in recent months has been given only on the distinct understanding that 50 per cent. of it will be put up by the local authorities. That, to my mind, is doing something to which the House did not agree during the Budget debates.  Not alone do the Government insist on 50 per cent. of the money being put up towards any work being done in a district in which a grant is given, but they limit the number of years for which the loan can be raised in order that that grant may be supplemented.  The various local authorities have been told that they will be permitted to raise a loan only for a period of three years. In consequence of representations made by certain local authorities, in some cases they are permitted to raise a loan for a period of five years.  I submit that that is placing too heavy <Col N="962" /> a burden upon the backs of the local ratepayers.  A substantial loan repayable within a period of from three to five years places too great a burden on the backs of local ratepayers over a short number of years.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a mean way, as far as the Government are concerned, of relieving unemployment.  They get a certain amount of kudos out of the fact that they are putting up certain moneys for grants notwithstanding the fact that the local authorities are bearing half the expense, and that at least half the amount that the Government are putting up is taken from the pockets of the unemployed.  In that connection, the Minister has stated that there are a greater number of people employed now than in the years prior to 1933 or 1934 and that at least 25 per cent. of the people drawing unemployment assistance get work inside periods of one month.  I certainly do not know where the Minister got that information.</P>

      <P>Let us take the system that prevails as far as the expenditure of this unemployment grant is concerned. The Board of Works have brought into operation what is known as the rotary or rotation system. Under that system, the local authority are notified that they will receive a certain amount of money provided they will put up a similar amount.  Notwithstanding the fact that the local authority put up an amount equal to the grant from the Government, the local authority have no control, good, bad or indifferent, over the expenditure of that money, in so far as the employment of men is concerned.  I suggest to the Minister that, in view of the fact that the local authority are putting up as much as the Government, they should have some say as to who should be <Col N="963" /> employed to do this particular work. The local authority get their engineer or surveyor, as the case may be, to submit a certain scheme and give an estimate for that scheme.  It will be very hard to get the surveyor or engineer to keep inside the estimate submitted unless the local authority are permitted to have more control over the particular work being done.</P>
      <P>The Minister also suggested in connection with these schemes that men are getting work at standard rates.  I submit that here again the Minister is not in touch with the actual situation. For instance, in the rural parts of the country men are being paid again at the much complained of rate of 24/-per week.  When we raised here a couple of years ago the question of only paying 24/- per week, we were told that the 24/- was being paid to men who were doing work similar to that being done by agricultural labourers, such as making ditches, drainage work, and things of that kind.  We contended on that occasion that even that work should be paid for at a higher rate. Now, during the progress of the latest schemes subsidised to the extent of 50 per cent. by the Government, these men are doing quarry work for which county council workers are being paid at least 6/- more in the county I represent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can accuse me of undue precipitancy in this matter.  On the 31st October, I put down a question to the Minister to which he will find a reference in Volume 59 of the Official Debates, column 237.  The reply I then got&mdash;this was about 12 months ago&mdash; was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Proposals for the amendment of the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme in relation to the class of teacher referred to by the Deputy are at present under consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 10th December &mdash; more than a month afterwards &mdash; I repeated my question and the Minister repeated his answer.  He had nothing to add to what he said in October.  Perhaps I was too optimistic in hoping that, owing to the Department's interest in this matter, it would be quickly cleared up.  It was quite obvious, however, by that time that no progress had been made.  I repeated my question to-day. Not only has no progress been made, but it seems to me that the movement is in a definitely backward direction. There were no hints of insuperable obstacles in the two previous answers which I received.  After 12 months' consideration by the Minister's Department and whatever other Department is concerned, we are now told that the Minister is not in a position to say when the proposed amendments will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from the two previous answers that it was admitted that these amendments were desirable.  I think that anybody who knows the particulars of the scheme will agree that they are desirable.  Apparently, the consideration of these amendments must wait until certain other conditions are fulfilled.  The Minister mentioned the completion of an actuarial investigation.  He did not know when it would be completed.  He could not say when the consideration of it by his Department and, I presume, by the Department of Finance would be over.  Anybody who thought that 12 months ago this problem was nearing solution must realise that it is now pushed back considerably by the Minister's answer to-day.  It is for that reason I raise the matter on the <Col N="966" /> Adjournment.  Not merely has there been no advance on the part of the Government, but there has been evidence of restrogression, and we are not now in as happy a position as we were before.  I can understand, to some extent, though I do not condone, a certain amount of interference by another Department anxious to delay anything that might seem to involve State expenditure.  On the 10th December, when I repeated my question, I put another question to the Minister.  I asked him what were the contributions made heretofore by the State to the Secondary Teachers Pension Fund year by year.  There, at least, the Minister's answer was quite definite.  For the year ended 31st July, 1930, the State contributions were nil; for the year ended 31st July, 1931, they were nil, and for the years 1932, 1933 and 1934 they were nil.  Yet, if the Minister will forgive my saying so, I have a strong suspicion that it is the Minister for Finance&mdash;who has been so generous in his contribution to this scheme&mdash;who is afraid that if three or four teachers are treated with justice the State finances will be put in jeopardy.  That such is the case is almost incredible.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about our system of education, in matters of principle and in matters of practice, it works remarkably well.  We have luckily avoided many of the difficulties and catastrophes&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;that other countries have had to face owing to the rival claims of the State and other parties.  We have reached a very happy solution by which the interests of the State, the interests of the private individual, the interests of the Church and the interests of the private schools have been reconciled. Anybody who knows the history of education in Europe for the last 100 years will realise how fortunate that is.  It is exceedingly important that that machine should work as smoothly as possible.  The relevance of these remarks is that the contented working of the scheme on the part of the teachers will depend on the security of pension rights, if not of tenure.  The existence of private schools and their rights removes the teacher from the ordinary category of public servants. <Col N="967" /> He may be doing the work which the State requires to be done but he is not, as the Minister knows, an employee of the State.  Even during efficiency and good conduct, under the present system he does not enjoy the same security of tenure as the ordinary civil servant.</P>
    <P>What I suggest to the Minister is this: There are a few grains of sand, and this is one of them, interfering with the smooth working of that scheme at present, and I ask him not to delay until Tibb's Eve, as he almost suggested to-day, consideration of amendment of these rules so far as a few individual teachers are concerned. I think it is correct to say&mdash;it was inevitable that it should be so&mdash;that the Minister has already had to amend-the rules in some respects.  Anybody will quite understand the exceedingly complicated nature of these particular rules.  I was quite well aware of the complication at one time myself, and I have no doubt that the Minister is quite well aware of the complication. At present you have anomalies, and, not merely anomalies, but injustices. You have the extraordinary provision that a teacher, under a certain age, may be absent from the scheme for ten years and return to it, and yet not lose his right to enter into membership of the scheme again, with the right to a particular pension.  You have the unfortunate man who has reached, say, the age of 49 years.  For two years he has been absent from a school, and because he is then over 50 years he cannot re-enter the scheme although he may have had as long service as anybody else.  Simply because he has reached a certain age, and has been a couple of years out of a school, he cannot re-enter the scheme. Now, that hits a special type of teacher remarkably hard, and it is most unfair, as I think the Minister will admit, when we have a pension scheme that that particular class should not be catered for.</P>
    <P>I am not conversant with the actual figures.  I do not know exactly what it would cost, not the State but the scheme, but surely the Department of Finance could be got to withdraw its opposition to this slight amendment of <Col N="968" /> the scheme if this is their only objection. It involves very little.  It certainly does not involve a sum that could be expected to bring about the bankruptcy of the scheme.  You have the extraordinary position that whereas a man who is over 50 may be retired by the Department, or may not get his incremental reports and practically be dismissed as inefficient, he can get a pension, but a man who is in the unfortunate position of the person I have indicated, will not be eligible for a pension, no matter how efficient he is.  He may have lost his position through no fault of his own.  It may be due to a reorganisation of the staff of the school in which he was engaged. I ask the House to remember that a man at that particular age may find it extremely difficult to get a position again.  He may find himself at the age of 52 or 54&mdash;and there are cases of the kind&mdash;in which he has neither a job nor a pension, and under the present rules he cannot get a pension.</P>
    <P>I find it extremely difficult to believe that the Minister himself is quite unresponsive to the claims of a case like that, and I am sorry that he finds it necessary, or, perhaps I should say that the Department of Finance has found it necessary, to put almost a veto on this particular matter.  I cannot believe that the Minister himself has put a veto on it, but does he think it is necessary to wait until this actuarial report is at hand?  I am quite convinced that so far as this is concerned, it will not affect the finances of the scheme to any appreciable extent.  So far as the particular amendments that I have in view go, the actuarial report cannot affect the matter one way or another.  It was not the excuse that was put up&mdash;at least the Minister did not put up any such excuse&mdash;12 months ago.  He put it up to-day.  I suggest to him that it was an excuse, an excuse for the fact that we are to-day no further advanced than we were 12 months ago.  Twelve months ago I asked him when he expected to get the actuarial report and was told it was in hands, but the Minister could not tell me when it would be ready.  To-day I am told it is in hands but the Minister does not know when it will be ready.  I put it <Col N="969" /> to him that that is not a fair way to deal with the particular cases that call for amendment so far as these rules are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no one better suited to justify that point of view to the Dáil when he held office than Deputy O'Sullivan.  He was quite an adept at explaining to the House the difficulties which arose in connection with matters relating to educational administration in which financial issues were involved.  Undoubtedly, there has been a long delay in this matter, and I can only say again that the Department of Education is not entirely to blame.  The position is that when the scheme was brought in it was understood to be, as all such schemes are understood to be, of an experimental character.  It was decided in fact, with regard to the State's contribution that that matter should be left over until after the first quinquennial valuation and the actuarial report thereon had been received.  Now the position is that the report has not yet been received.  The matter has been in the hands of the actuary for some time.  He has been looking for further information, and his final report is not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that since the <Col N="970" /> amendment which it is sought to make involves only a small number of persons, so far as we know, and a comparatively small expenditure, why should we not go ahead and not wait for this actuarial report?  The Deputy has referred to the fact that we have already amended the scheme.  We have amended the scheme in bringing in a class of teachers&mdash;preparatory college teachers&mdash;who, obviously, should have been included in it.  They have come in as teachers paying their contributions, but there has been no departure in that matter from the principles of the scheme.  If, however, we are going to make an amendment with regard to teachers who are disemployed, by way of making extra provision for them, it can be claimed, I think, that we are interfering with the actuarial basis of the scheme.  Even though the amount involved may be small, nevertheless, the financial basis of the scheme would be interfered with in a certain way. It would be interfered with in this way, that we will not know until we receive the actuarial report whether or not the funds of the scheme are actuarially sound at the present time.  If it were found that the scheme was not actuarially sound and we had amended it before receiving the report to give a concession to a certain class of teachers, two questions would arise.  The first question would be whether we might not as well have given the concession in a number of other directions; why should we confine the concession to the particular class to which the Deputy refers?  The second point that would arise is why should we make a concession now when it is possible&mdash;I have no means of knowing whether it is probable or not &mdash;that a State contribution more than was anticipated may have to be made in order to make the original scheme actuarially sound.</P>
    <P>We have no means of knowing whether the fund is actuarially sound or not and I am not in a position to make any amendment of consequence until that report is received.  I could make an amendment which would not worsen the position of these teachers, which would make it clear that they <Col N="971" /> would still be entitled to come into the scheme if they found employment and which would lengthen the period, but I do not consider that concession to be of much importance.  I shall try to get a decision on the matter as soon as possible, but I fear it will be quite impossible to make an amendment which will be satisfactory to the class the Deputy has in mind until we have <Col N="972" /> received the actuarial report.  I do not think there is any other point.</P>

      <P>Owing to the fact that it cannot be stated how many of the persons affected by the Employment Period Orders would have continued to receive unemployment assistance and how long they would have continued to receive it if such Orders were not in operation it is not possible to say to what extent these Orders affected expenditure on unemployment assistance. I can state that in the period from the 3rd February, 1936, to the 7th September the number of persons registered decreased by 79,332 or about 50 per cent. of the total live register whereas the total number of persons refused payment of assistance by reason of the Employment Period Orders operating during that period was only 40,297.  These figures indicate considerable expansion of opportunity for employment in which no doubt the persons affected by the Employment Period Orders participated and to that extent would not have been in receipt of unemployment assistance even if those Orders had not been in force.</P>
