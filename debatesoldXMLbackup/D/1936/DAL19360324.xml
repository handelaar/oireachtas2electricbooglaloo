      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that at the present time the prices being asked by manufacturers of these goods in Ireland are so high that almost all galvanised buckets and baths being sold in the country are imported, and that the duty is being paid on them, and that they are being bought cheaper by the retailers in that way than they could buy them from the producers in Saorstát Eireann? In the light of that, will the Minister remove the duty, which <Col N="10" /> has no protective value now, and which has become merely a revenue duty; or, failing that, will he compel the manufacturers here to bring down their prices to a level which will have the effect of recovering this trade for the Irish producers?</P>

I am sure that 99 per cent. of the people here are aware of that.  I want pressure to be brought on the producers in Saorstát Eireann to force them to bring down their prices to a level that would serve to recover the trade for Irish producers; or else the Minister should take the tariff off, because it has ceased to be a protective tariff and has now become a purely revenue tariff.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Courts of Referees are constituted under the powers conferred by Section 13 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and the Regulations (Statutory Rules and Orders, 1921, No. 594) made thereunder.  These regulations provide, <i>inter-alia</i>, that &ldquo;the claimant may be represented at the sitting of the court by any person, not being counsel or solicitor, authorised by him.&rdquo;  These courts, so constituted, were adopted by Section 21 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, for the purpose of that Act. Courts of Referees consist of one or more members chosen to represent employers with an equal number of persons chosen to represent workers, together with an independent chairman who, in almost every case, is a lawyer. It will, therefore, be seen that claimants' interests are adequately safeguarded.  Moreover the functions of these courts are to consider and to make recommendations to an insurance officer or an unemployment assistance officer, as the case may be, on the cases referred to them.  They do not make binding decisions.  I do not consider that any further legal assistance is necessary and do not propose to provide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, will he permit an outside authority to provide legal assistance for claimants?  Is the Minister not aware that, even to-day, there is much protest in our city against the methods adopted to disqualify claimants on the grounds that they are not genuinely seeking work, and is he aware that they want somebody to give a judgment on what is meant by &ldquo;not genuinely seeking work&rdquo;?  Cases have been brought to the notice of every member of this House, where applicants have applied to a dozen employers in one week and have then been told by the board that they are not genuinely seeking work, and have been disqualified from <Col N="12" /> benefits.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, concurrently with the examination of the import prices of coal by a Special Committee, he proposes to send a request to the Prices Commission asking them to keep under review and investigation whether unreasonably high retail prices for coal are being charged throughout the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at present propose to refer this matter to the Prices Commission for investigation; but this action will be taken if at any time I am satisfied that circumstances warrant that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the export price of coal from Great Britain to the Free State in February of this year was only something less than 2/- above the price in February of last year, and that the import price of coal for the month of February into the Free State was only 4/- over the import price of ordinary household coal as compared with last year.  Taking the price of bellmen's coal as a criterion, the cost of bellmen's coal in February this year is 7/- above what the price was last year.  If the Minister does not consider it necessary to get the Prices Commission to investigate the matter, will he say what is the reason for the great increase in the price charged for coal here when he takes into consideration the nature of the increase in the case of import prices of coal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a separate question.  In any event, this Special Committee is being established <Col N="24" /> to look after coal prices and all questions relating to supply and quality.  Therefore, I think we should let the Committee get to work before taking the matter out of their hands again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that this Special Committee is being set up to investigate and to keep a watch and a check on the export prices of coal from Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It also has the function of hearing and dealing with any complaints that may be referred to it by the retailers or the consumers of coal in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the hearing of complaints, the Minister's published statement refers entirely to the quality and import price of coal. When the Minister is setting up a committee to investigate that, and when the realises that the price of the coal that he is setting up the committee to examine, is only something less than 2/- higher in February this year than it was in February last year, does he not consider that great watchfulness is required in regard to the additional price charged for coal once it gets into the Free State? Does he not recognise how necessary that is, particularly when it is borne in mind that following a 2/- rise in the export price from Great Britain there is a rise of 7/- in the price of the coal that is sold here to a particular class.  That, in itself, is indicative of the fact that the increased price charged to other people is still more.  Will the Minister say why he is so concerned to watch the rise of the price from the British side and not concerned at all to watch the unnecessary rise in the price of coal once it has come in here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee, as I have already explained to the Deputy and as I propose to explain again in answer to the next question, has a dual function: one is the function which it will carry out in conjunction with the representatives of the British collieries relating to the import prices of supply and quality; and the other is the function which it will exercise alone <Col N="25" /> when it will deal with any complaints that may be addressed to it by the buyers of coal in this country concerning price or quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Risteárd Ua Maolchatha Risteárd Ua Maolchatha">
      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he proposes to set up a committee consisting of representatives of coal consumers, coal merchants, and direct importers of coal to deal with any aspect of the prices and the quality of imported coal; and, if so, if he will state the number of members of the committee, and the number of these representing (1) the consumers, (2) the merchants, and (3) the direct importers, and the manner in which representatives of (1) the consumers, (2) the merchants, and (3) the direct importers will be selected, and the terms of reference of the committee; and if he will state whether it is the intention of the committee to publish periodical reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed in connection with the recent agreement made between the Saorstát Government and the British Government relating to trade between this country and the United Kingdom that the price of United Kingdom coals shall be the subject of examination and settlement by representatives of the merchants, direct importers, and consumers in the Saorstát and of the British collieries supplying the Saorstát market.  One representative of each of these interests has been appointed on the Saorstát side, and it is proposed, in addition, that these three Saorstát representatives should act as a committee to receive and examine complaints on the part of buyers and users of coal in the Saorstát regarding price, quality, and availability of supplies of coal.  The function of the committee would be to report to my Department as to whether such complaints are well founded.  The representatives on the Saorstat's side have been selected by me.  It is not contemplated that periodical reports should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the statement issued from his Department and published in the newspapers on the 19th March states that these three gentlemen will also <Col N="26" /> act as a committee to investigate any complaints which may be made as regards the quality, import prices or supplies of coal.  Am I to understand from his statement now that the terms of reference of that committee have been extended, and that the committee will have power to investigate whether the prices that are charged to consumers of coal here in relation to the import prices of coal are reasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have the obligation of considering any complaints of that kind that may be addressed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And that, in so far as objections are taken by people to the prices that they are being asked to pay for coal now, these objections should be represented to this committee in future, and not to the Prices Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only power that there is for taking action for the regulation of prices is under the Control of Prices Act.  If it appears from the complaints received from the committee that it is evident that there is a necessity to bring the machinery of that Act into operation, then the necessary steps to that end will be taken; but this special committee will have no power to fix or regulate coal prices.  The only power to take action of that kind is that provided in the Control of Prices Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the Minister's statement that this committee was set up to keep a check and a watch on export prices is a pure blind? Surely the Minister does not consider that a committee of three, one being a representative of the importers, another a representative of gas works, and the third the Chairman of the Prices Commission, is a suitable committee to investigate whether the importers of coal into this country are making excessive profits on the coal delivered to the people here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Controller of Prices is in existence, and there is a statutory function imposed on him to investigate prices whenever a complaint is made to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Controller of Prices sitting down in an abnormal situation in regard to coal profits at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Controller of Prices acts whenever a complaint is made to him and he did act when complaints were made to him.  I think myself that those who are trying to make political propaganda out of coal prices have their hypocrisy demonstrated by the fact that they have failed to put forward a single case for investigation by the Controller of Prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deny that the export price of coal from Great Britain in February this year was only something less than 2/- above the export price for British coal to this country in February of this year, while at the same time the bellmen to-day are paying 7/- a ton more for their coal&mdash;that is in February of this year&mdash;than they were paying in February of last year, and that that increase goes on to the people who buy their coal in small quantities from the bellmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Deputy wants to continue talking about the matter so as to avoid taking the steps that are open to him to take, namely, to make a complaint and have the matter fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

Is de'n aois seo ár n-armáil &mdash;comh fada is a théigheann&mdash;agus ár lón lámhaigh, ach níl ár ndóithín díobh againn.

Ach d'aimhdheoin go raibh sé 'na pholasaí shocruighthe againn an fearas sin do sholáthar, tá curtha siar againn, arís agus arís eile, an dara Bataire Howitzer do cheannach chun gleasadh na dara briogáide do chríochnú.  Rud eile, socruigheadh cheana ar an ngádh atá le cúltaiscí ár ndóithín de lón lámhaigh throm, ach ní raibh an cómh-aontú céadna ann i dtaobh na tréimhse aimsire 'na mbunófaí na cúltaiscí sin.  Ins an meastachán seo, dá bhrígh sin, tá iarracht dhá déanamh na h-easnaimh sin do shlánú, leis na gunnaí atá riachtanach chun críochnú na dara briogáide de'n Airtléireacht, agus leis na cúltaiscí de'n lón lámhaigh throm atá ar iarraidh, do sholáthar chómh tapaidh agus is féidir é.</P>

Go deimbin. níl sé ar ár gcumas an chéad nidh do leigheas acht táimíd tar éis an dara nidh d'infhiúchadh go géar.

I rith na bliana seo caithte ar thrí ócáidí móra taisbeánadh go soiléir don phobal a éifeachtúlacht agus atá an t-Arm.  Ba í Stailc Bhóthar-Iompair Atha Cliath i míosa tosaigh na bliana 1935 (míle naoi gcéad a cúig triochad) an chéad ócáid. Ar fhógra ghairid agus gan aon <Col N="43" /> ullmhúchán roimh-ré, glaodhadh ar Chór Iompair an Airm feithiclí dóthanacha do sholáthar agus d'oibriú chun na seirbhísí iompair atá riachtanach do shaol tráchtála Atha Cliath do coinneáil suas.  Go ceann dhá mhí nó mar sin, bhí an tseirbhís sin ar fáil ag an gCór gur iomparadh dhá mhilliún, céad agus naoi míle ochtód, sé chéad agus cúig paisnéirí triochad (2,189,635), agus gur taistealadh céad agus ocht míle ceathrachad, sé chéad agus seacht míle slighe caogad (148,657); agus d'aimhdheoin nár deinadh a gcuid laraí ar dtúis chun paisnéirí d'iompar, do chóilíonadar an dualgas sin gan oiread agus díobháil chuirp amháin agus gan ach tionóiscí suaracha dá gcárraí.  Ní beag mar theistas ar a gcúirtéiseacht agus a stuamdhacht fé choinghíollacha deacra, a bhfuil ráidhte cheana ins na páipéir nuaidheachta.</P>
    <P>Ba é an &ldquo;Tattoo&rdquo; a bhí ann i Meán Fóghmhair seo caithte an dara h-ócáid mhór 'na dtugadh caoi don phobal an t-Arm d'fheiscint ag gníomhú.  Ní h-aon chuid de ghnáth-fheidhmeanna an Airm na taisbeántaisí seo agus ní ach go h-annamh a cuirtear a leithéidí ar siúbhal mar gheall ar an ndianullmhúchán a ghabhann leo roimh-ré. Gan trácht i n-aon chor ortha mar thóicheastail, nílid gan tairbhe ón dtaobh míleata féin.  Taisbeánaid a áilneacht is a bhíonn an dril mhíleata nuair a deintear í le cruinneas rithime agus go bhfíoghruightear patrúin shamhaltánacha tríthe.  Tástálann siad oilteacht na saighdiúirí agus cuireann siad 'na luighe ortha an sprid fhoirinne sin ar a mbíonn &ldquo;morale&rdquo; Airm bunuithe.  Is leor mar fhiadhnaise ar éifeachtúlacht an Airm ar an ócáid sin an líon daoine (105,000) do bhí i láthair ag an Taisbeántas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two questions which I want to ask the Minister for Defence on this Estimate. He has referred in his statement to the necessity for building up warlike stores, but really I find it hard to believe that any adequate case can be made&mdash;certainly there has been no attempt to make it so far&mdash;to justify an increase of £71,475 in the annual expenditure for warlike stores.  This House is asked to supply, under sub-head P, of this Estimate, £160,683 for the purchase of warlike stores.  If the country were in a state of unrivalled prosperity, and the Minister came to the House and said that the prestige of certain parts of the Army required that elaborate stores of ammunition should be accumulated, and that he was prepared to recommend an expenditure of this kind, it might be worthy of consideration; but, when we are told by various other Ministers that desirable amenities must be foregone because they are not prepared to ask the Treasury for money, it seems to me a perfectly astonishing course that we should be asked to spend in this year £110,261 on ammunition, apart from the other warlike stores that are included under sub-head P.  What is all the ammunition for?  What are we going to do with it?  Are we going to store it? My recollection, from my experience on the Committee of Public Accounts, has been that wastage has continually occurred in connection with Army stores.  Stuff has been put into cellars and arsenals and store rooms of one kind or another in different parts of the country, and has so deteriorated that it had to be disposed of eventually for a tithe of what it originally cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> I should like to ask the Minister this question also.  Where is it proposed to purchase this ammunition, or is it proposed to manufacture it here?  I understand that the Minister purposes establishing a munition factory in this country, but the form of the Estimate suggests that in the current financial year he is going to go into the market and buy the ammunition referred to in his Estimate. If that be true where is he going to buy it?  That is one question I want to ask him.  The second is in connection with the other warlike stores referred to in sub-head P&mdash;guns and carriages, armoured cars and miscellaneous warlike stores.  What country of origin is going to supply these items?  That is a very important question. I have no doubt some patriots on the Fianna Fáil back benches will be going down the country and saying that we have purchased the machinery wherewith to blast the base, brutal and bloody Saxon out of existence, and then we will discover that all the materials are coming from Sheffield. Where are the aeroplanes which the Minister intends purchasing going to come from?  Are they American aeroplanes or are they British aeroplanes or are they continental aeroplanes? When he comes to answer that question I should be glad if he would tell us what inquiries were made as to the most modern types of aeroplanes available.  I understand that both in regard to military aeroplanes, and machine guns, to which he also referred in his statement, recent research has produced very striking advances.  Those are highly technical questions, and one would expect that the Minister would inform us that he had set up some committee of responsible Army officers who would give him expert advice on these problems. I understand that the most modern machine gun is of Czecho Slovakian manufacture.  I understand that the most effective military aeroplane of the bombing class is at present avail able from British manufacturers. When the Minister refers to the two military aeroplanes which he has added to the equipment of the Army he does not tell us what is their <Col N="46" /> nature.  Are they bombing planes or are they survey planes or what is their nature?  For what purpose does he intend to use them?</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister, in a desire to make a gesture towards the language movement, undertook what appeared to be for him a heavy burden in reading his statement here to-day from an Irish text.  The net result of that performance is that his introductory statement on the Estimate contains no information at all. I think that is a pity.  I am all in favour of making every gesture that can be reasonably made in order to promote the Irish language, but I do not think that the occasion of introducing a very important Estimate of this character should be spoilt by an attempt to introduce it in a language which the Minister clearly does not know, and in which he finds the greatest possible difficulty in expressing himself.  It denies to the House information which it ought to have.  Some general observations have been made in the course of his statement with reference to the Volunteer Force.  We learned that a number of volunteers who enrolled have since withdrawn, but that on the whole the Minister is not dissatisfied with the general progress of the Volunteer Force, and that he now is of opinion that the ultimate safety of the territory of Saorstát Eireann depends upon the Volunteer Force, which is going to become the mainstay of our national defence in time to come.  One finds it hard to choose a suitable word to describe all this, but it is all great nonsense, because the Minister knows as well as I do that the armed forces at the disposal of our Government, with the equipment they have, would have no more chance of defending this country against a European power with a desire to attack it than the Minister would have of defending the country single handed.</P>
    <P>That does not by any means mean that the Army is not a very valuable asset to this country.  It is something of which we ought to be proud; something of which, in my opinion, we have every reason to be proud; something <Col N="47" /> which we ought to do our utmost to keep up to the highest pitch of efficiency, but when we set our minds to keeping it up to the highest pitch of efficiency we should have present to our minds, in my submission, the primary purpose for which we require the Army at all. To my mind there are two purposes for which this House can reasonably maintain and support an Army in this country.  One is because it is essential that, in the event of civil disturbances of any kind, the elected Government of the people would have at their disposal an effective weapon in the last extremity to assert the supreme authority of the legitimately elected Government of the country; and secondly, that there should be at all times the highly-trained nucleus of an army which would, in times of national emergency, serve as the officers and trainers of a larger body if the full national resources had to be mobilised in any particular circumstances. To tell the House that the future defence of this country depends on the Volunteer Force is to my mind the purest nonsense, and, when we come to examine that question of the Volunteer Force, I think the time has come to ask ourselves whether the Volunteer Force is in fact an asset at all.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to make out from these Estimates what annual sum the Minister expects to be liable for in respect of the Volunteer force.  The only sub-heads which I can find as referring directly to the Volunteer force are sub-heads Y. (3) and Y. (4), and they, taken together, represent a sum of only £3,800.  In view of the fact that the Minister speaks of recruiting an additional 5,000 men in the coming year, I assume that there is concealed somewhere in this Estimate a reference to some other expenses.  I do not know whether sub-head M., which provides for clothing and equipment, makes allowance for Volunteer uniforms as well as for regular Army uniforms, but I do submit that the Volunteer force as at present constituted is not worth what it is costing us.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out already, when <Col N="48" /> the proposal was first brought before the House for a Volunteer force, it was introduced with a good deal of high-falutin, and we were told that the Volunteer force was a great gesture of conciliation on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was going to provide a platform upon which men unhappily divided in the past would be provided with an opportunity of joining hands in the common service of the State in the future.  We were told that the second and third line Volunteers were to provide a platform on which those parted in the past would have an opportunity of coming together again.  Then, of course, at a very early date, it became perfectly clear that the second and third line Volunteers were a blind and virtually do not exist at all.  The whole force consists practically of first-line Volunteers who were children in arms, or at school, when the civil strife was proceeding in this country, so that that justification for the institution of the Volunteers fell to the ground the moment the force took shape.</P>
    <P>The second justification for their establishment was that they would provide a great fighting force to defend the coasts of this country. When you look at the equipment that is available to our fighting forces, it becomes manifest to every reasonable man that for the purpose of meeting external aggression from a formidable military power, which would have at its disposal sufficient naval accommodation to approach our shores at all, our Army would not be in a position to make any serious resistance; nor do I think it would be possible for any Minister for Defence in any Government in this country to build up an army which would offer serious resistance to any external power of such dimensions as would command a fleet adequate to reach our shores at all.  I think any Minister who sought to build up an army designed to resist external aggression of that character would be a fool, and an irresponsible fool, so that, of course, that justification for maintaining the Volunteer force is absurd on the face of it.</P>
    <P>The third and main justification is <Col N="49" /> that it provides a useful training ground for young people.  I deny that, I do not think it is a useful thing to train the entire juvenile population of this country in the use of arms.  Every dictator-ridden country in the world at the present time believes in conscription.  They believe it is a good thing to introduce every young man in the country to militarism.  They think it a good thing to mould his mind along lines of militarism.  I do not; I think it is a disaster for any country the youth of which begins to believe that militarism and militaristic organisation is the ideal towards which every patriotic man should aspire.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the reason why it is not in the Estimate may be brought before the House.  There may be envisaged certain organisations which are more appropriately affiliated with political parties.  It would be highly improper for any responsible Minister for Defence to set on foot a national force on lines strictly analogous to those of an association which, of its very nature, is political in its character.  Certain associations will spring to Deputy Davin's mind.  I think the Minister would do very wrong if he attempted to draw an analogy between the force he would <Col N="50" /> be justified in establishing and any such force as those which Deputy Davin and I may think of, but I do believe the Minister did strike on something in connection with the Volunteer Force which he might be much better employed in developing than in developing the thesis that the Volunteer Force was to act as an effective defence force for this country. That is the interest which he has displayed in Sokol and gymnastic exercises of that kind.  If the Volunteer Force in this country become a force for the physical training, completely disassociated from militaristic activities, of the young people of this country, under the patronage and direction of the Department of Defence, it might be a very useful organisation and it might serve a very useful purpose generally.  There does not seem to me to be any necessity whatever for imparting the militaristic flavour in order to maintain its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the absurd situation at the present time that with the military training made available by the army authorities to the Volunteers, the Volunteers are quite unable to deport themselves in a way which compares reasonably with the regular Army on public occasions.  We could not expect them to bear arms with the same efficiency and address as the regular soldiers of the Army, and I doubt if I do the Minister an injustice when I suggest that, as a result of his realisation of the fact that the Volunteer Force was quite incompetent to bear military arms, with any appearance of efficiency, instead of realising that be ought not to furnish them with arms at all, he requires the Army, which was quite capable of bearing arms, as arms should be borne, to carry them much as the Volunteers carried them, in order to conceal the inability of the Volunteers to carry out the martial exercises which the Minister required them to carry out on the parade occasion. I think regular soldiers should be allowed to carry arms and should demonstrate their capacity to carry them as soldiers should. I think it is indeed a pity that their efficiency and smartness should be deliberately degraded <Col N="51" /> on a number of occasions in order to cover up the unavoidable inefficiency in military exercises of a body like the Volunteer Force.</P>
    <P>Now, let me touch on another aspect of this problem that is not going to be popular with many elements who come to consider it, but is, nevertheless, one in respect of which I ask the Minister for a very explicit statement when he is dealing in reply with this Estimate.  Forces which are organised along militaristic lines in this and every other country have found it necessary, where these bodies of men were brought together under military conditions, to impart certain instructions in hygiene of a character that is not familiar to the average young man or youth in rural Ireland.  If one of the results of enrolling tens of thousands of young fellows in the Volunteer Force, and bringing them on rare occasions to rallies at certain centres in the country is to make available to them, and in fact to force upon them, certain instruction in hygiene, which may be necessary when dealing with the regular Army, which has to be provided, not because every man in the regular Army requires it, but because certain individuals require it, and it is necessary to make it available to all in order that it will reach certain individuals who, in fact, do require it, I think that is a great mistake. It is an unpleasant duty for me to refer to a matter of this kind, and I feel bound to elaborate it for a moment lest any misapprehension should be created in the public mind.</P>
    <P>Everybody who has given any thought to the matter knows that certain instruction in hygiene is given in the regular Army.  To those who only take a superficial view that suggests that the entire personnel of the regular Army requires hygienic warning and hygienic advice of that kind.  Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.  But, it has been the experience of medical officers in most armies in the world that, in order to get information to those individual members of an army who require such advice and remonstrance, the only <Col N="52" /> effective way of doing it is to make it available to all.  Otherwise, if you adopt a selective scheme with a view of seeking to give it only to those who actually require it, it might happen that one individual or two or more will not get the instruction and the therapeutic guidance necessary, thus becoming a source of infection to the whole body of the men in the camp or in the barracks.  That is an evil which is no doubt deplored by the Minister and by every high officer in the Army, but is recognised as a necessary evil to avoid greater evils.</P>
    <P>What I deplore is the possibility that that necessity for universal instruction should be extended to the whole Volunteer force, and that, having imparted instruction of that character to the entire personnel of the Volunteer force, that that personnel should be returned to the country.  I am not in the position to say it is being done, but I am asking the Minister to inform the House fully as to his attitude in regard to that matter, and to inform us whether the same instruction is being afforded to the Volunteer force as is being afforded to the regular Army; whether, in his opinion, it is necessary; and, if it is necessary, will not a greater evil accrue from information of that character being disseminated wildly throughout the country by impressionable youths who only attend short periods of training and who carry away from that training only a very hazy and, possibly, inadequate understanding of the entire volume of instruction that they may have obtained during the period in which they were in camp?</P>
    <P>I should like to join, however, with the Minister in his expression of cordial congratulation to the regular Army on their performance at the tattoo which, I think, reflected great credit on the Army, and which was a source of legitimate price to the citizens of the country at large.  It is no new thing for all sides of the House to be afforded an opportunity of congratulating the Army on their equestrian successes, and I think we can with confidence hope they will be continued to the credit of the country, as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>So far as the regular Army is concerned, <Col N="53" /> it is noteworthy and gratifying to everybody concerned with the welfare of the country to observe the high standard of efficiency and the sound military spirit which pervades all ranks.  It is a source of infinite gratification to both sides of the House, I have no doubt, that we have succeeded in establishing in this country a military spirit, founded on no aggressive or bellicose foundation, but on the sound constitutional theory that the Army is the servant of the people and accepts the orders of the people through the elected Government of the people.  Possibly, with the passage of this year, it will be no longer necessary to comment with gratification upon that aspect of affairs, because it will become so well-established, has become so well-established, that it is no longer a reason for expressing congratulation. But we have been some time developing out of a period of flux and obscurity, and during that time the Army has been a model to various other branches of the public life of the country in its understanding and effective discharge of the duties and responsibilities cast upon it.  May it long continue so.  I should be grateful if the Minister could see his way to deal with the specific points I have raised on the Estimate introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time, so far as I can recollect, that we have had an explanation of policy, if we can regard this document that has been issued as such, and it brings up the question which I put to the Minister a couple of years ago as to the advice on which this Volunteer force was established, whether it was upon expert army advice or otherwise.  If my recollection is correct, the Minister's reply was to the effect that it was Government policy.  The only information that we got about it other than what is in this document is in the returns that have been published in the Estimates showing a very large increase in the cost of the Army during the last few years.  On page 304 of the Estimates, we find that the sum required is £1,529,987.  It is a very big sum.  It is a sum which over a period of years came in for very considerable criticism from various political and non-political parties in the State.  I wonder was it honest criticism?  Certainly, if it was, it must also be added that it was innocent criticism if we include the Ministerial Bench as having any responsibility for it.  The Army Estimates have gone up in the last couple of years to the extent of £300,000 to £400,000 a year.  That is the increase in the Army costs.  We are entitled to know whether or not the Army machine has improved and whether we are getting value for the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only indication of policy one sees, so far as the Minister's statement is concerned, is in the purchase of more munitions, an increase in the artillery by a battery of Howitzers, and an increase in the gun section-that is an increase in the heavy machine-gun section and in the light gun section. The increase in the cost of munitions in the current year is a pretty considerable one if they are meant as stores, to be piled up and to be kept in stock.  The House ought to be told how long the life of such munitions is estimated to be.  If my recollection is right, a short time ago there was an <Col N="55" /> explosion in the Magazine Fort of some old munitions that had been left there. Generally speaking, stocks of munitions are expensive articles.  I presume the same thing might be added with regard to the maintenance of the 18-pounders and the other sections of the artillery that are indicated in the report.</P>
    <P>However, to come down closer to business, it has been freely rumoured throughout this country that men who have had Army service here have left the Army, have joined the British Army, and that they are very welcome in the British Army when they have been given good training here.  If that be so, we have been at expense providing well-made material for other armies.  I think if that is so the Minister ought to have some information on it.  The question arises at once as to whether it was desirable to get rid of men who had cost so much to make them efficient soldiers.  What was at the back of it?  Was it necessary to get rid of them to make way for others, or is there to be no such thing in this country as the professional soldier?  If the small army we have got is to be regarded as a means of expanding in times of necessity or stress, how much weaker will it be by reason of the loss of the men in question?</P>
    <P>What has the Minister's experience been regarding the Volunteer force, no matter how high have been certain representations that have been made in connection with an institution of that sort?  Some 20 to 25 years ago this force went by the name of the militia.  The general impression regarding the militia was that a member of the militia could not compare with a regular soldier.  It could not be expected that a man with a week's or a fortnight's drill in the year could be put on the same par with the man subject to military discipline from one end of the year to the other.  The question is how far this new body is costing money to get together.  Will the Minister tell us whether military cars go around and collect volunteers during the evening and then bring them home at night?  If that is so, it is an expensive method.  In fact, the cost of the volunteers and reserves as set <Col N="56" /> out in the final pages of the Estimates amounts to £152,278.  For the last year it is up by something like £5,000.  Will the Minister assure the House in respect of that particular service that it is efficient to the extent of the extra £5,000?  Another thing to which I should like to draw attention is the item in the Estimates for clothing. This is down somewhat considerably&mdash; £47,000 against £110,000 for last year.</P>
    <P>On Easter Sunday last year there was a parade of soldiers through the city. It was a very wet day, and those men so engaged must have been drenched. I wonder, in respect of that particular experience, whether the Minister has thought fit to provide the men with waterproof cloaks or capes, such as are worn on the Continent?  I was informed&mdash;I do not know whether it is true&mdash;that some of the men were sent to their stations many miles in railway carriages without any change of clothing.  If that be so, they were certainly inviting colds and other indispositions from which even soldiers possibly may not be immune. The parade on that particular occasion occupied some hours.  It has been stated in some Press publications that we do not often see the Army on parade, but I hope that we are not going to become accustomed to parades of the Army for political purposes.  It would, however, be useful and serviceable if there were more frequent parades of the Army, and it is to be hoped that steps would be taken in connection with those parades to see that it would not be extra work on the men and, if it should so happen that the weather was bad, some provision should be made for their comfort when the parades are over.</P>
    <P>There is one other item in the Estimates which appears to me to be small.  I do not know whether it provides for what it appears to me to make provision for.  I see that, under the heading of Animals and Forage, for the purchase of horses there is a figure of £2,610.  It is something over what was provided last year.  If it means anything in connection with jumping horses, I have again to raise the question that if the Army is having the advantages that it has, and is in a position to produce well-trained <Col N="57" /> animals and that good prices are offered for these animals, there is no earthly reason why they should not be sold, and the Army can purchase others.  There are other activities which, if there were profits, the Army might enter into; these would be of service to the Army itself and to the members thereof.  There are occasions upon which, I am told, fairly big prices have been offered for our Army horses.  Why I would like to see these horses sold is that there are others who sell Irish horses which have not got the same good character, and I hate to learn of a horse being sold out of this country which is not sound.  There are Army horses for which good prices would be paid, and they would be sound.</P>
    <P>Mention was made in the course of the Minister's statement about two occasions upon which the Army popularised itself during the year.  I do not think it was absolutely necessary to mention those two occasions.  The tattoo was certainly a great success, and it reflected great credit upon the Army.  An outstanding feature was the fine spirit that was shown, the efficiency of the troops, and so on. Mentioning those things brings us to the point that we seem to be always having to praise something that we have got ourselves.  Other countries have armies and they do certain things and the governments of those countries do not think it necessary, in the case of a report such as this, to mention the matter.  The Minister mentioned that 148,000 miles were covered by the Army in a period of two months during the transport trouble.  That amounted to about 2,500 miles a day.  There were 25 cars engaged, and it worked out at merely 100 miles for each car a day. That is not a very big performance.  I feel quite sure if the Army were called upon to work day and night upon a job like that they would do it.</P>
    <P>Why those things have got to be said now is because of the different line taken up a few years ago in connection with this institution.  It would be well for all political parties in this State to realise that whatever there are of State institutions in this country, the people who decry or belittle them are not those who are acting in the best <Col N="58" /> interests of the State.  If less of that had happened years ago, there would be less necessity now to bring into bold relief the admiration and the joy certain people feel when they see those national institutions in operation.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the carefully-laboured, long-drawn-out and boring statement in ungrammatical and badly-pronounced Civil Service Irish with which the Minister introduced this Estimate was for the purpose of mystifying members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who could not understand it and were, therefore, left in the dark as to the absence of any Government policy with regard to national defence.  We are, presumably, discussing only the Estimate for the coming year.  In other countries it is usual for the Minister responsible for national defence to give a general outline as to the strategic and defensive position of the country generally. That was omitted by our Minister to day.  The only piece of information in that connection we have to go on was the pledge which was given last year by President de Valera that this country, under no circumstances, would be used as a base for hostile operations against Great Britain.  He claimed to speak, not only on behalf of his Government, but he claimed, also, to speak on behalf of future Governments. That, of course, was inaccurate. He made that statement gratuitously and he got no thanks from the British for making that statement. The reason why he got no thanks from the British was because the British were fully aware that it had no value whatsoever, that the defence forces of this country are quite inadequate and quite incapable of preventing this country being used as a base of operations either against Great Britain or against any other country when it comes to a time of war.  The pledge given by the President last year is not worth considering and was not paid attention to by the British Government or by the British public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some rumours and statements in the Press as to the possibility of our country taking up seriously the question of national <Col N="59" /> defence.  The people of Ireland are living in a fool's paradise.  Every other country in Europe has to pay very large sums of money every year to cope with the problem of national defence.  We are only a Protectorate. We are in the same position with regard to Great Britain as the Sultan of Zanzibar, or some other vassal State of the Empire.  We do not pretend to defend our own coasts.  It is admitted that our strategic position is more important to Great Britain than the position of Belgium is to France and, naturally, Great Britain will be entitled to see that the defence is adequate for her own protection just as, I presume, the French Government are satisfied that the defences of Belgium are adequate in case of war and the attempted invasion of that country.  But the people of this country are living in a fool's paradise.  They are spending less on national defence than any other country in Europe&mdash;far less&mdash;and they are relying upon the protection of the British Fleet and the British Air Force, and the sooner the people of this country realise that they are a protected State the better.</P>
    <P>I think there is no reason at all why we should not make a beginning in the protection of our coasts.  It was written down in the Treaty, which, of course, has been broken on both sides &mdash;at any rate, in spirit, both by the British and the present Government of the Saorstát&mdash;that certain conferences were to take place with regard to the coastal defence of this country.  One conference was held, I understand, which was a washout.  The British suggested that we should buy an £8,000,000 battleship, which was to be run by the British Navy at our expense; which was hardly a reasonable suggestion.  From that day onwards no further attempt has been made to deal with the problem of settling or co-ordinating the defences of the two islands, and it has been left entirely in the hands of the British. At the present time we are sending over hundreds, if not thousands, of young men to the British Army, the British Navy and the British Air Force.  I myself have given letters of <Col N="60" /> introduction to well over 100 young men for admission into the British Air Force and other Air Forces across the water, and I see no reason to be ashamed of so doing, seeing that they have not got the opportunities here in Ireland of learning to become aviators. I see no reason why I should be ashamed of helping them to get positions in foreign Air Forces, seeing that they do not get facilities at home.  We are exporting man-power and also, on the horns of our cattle, about £5,000,000 a year as an Imperial contribution. Surely it would be better that that money, by agreement between the two Governments, should be spent in Ireland and that, not only our man-power, but also our finances, should be used at home.  I think it would be a most reasonable suggestion, in any settlement which may be arrived at between the two countries, that, in taking over at any rate a partial defence of our coasts, we should have the facilities available by association with the British Forces and that our own man-power should be kept at home.</P>
    <P>We are only playing with defence in this Estimate here before us.  We are not dealing with the main problem. Even, as I say, the pledge of the President, that this country would not be used as a base in case of hostilities, is not worth considering.  Certainly, it is a strange thing that an allegedly patriotic Government should completely ignore and shelve the problem of the defence of our coasts and leave it pusillanimously to another country. The people of this country have fought in every army in the world for other countries, and yet are apparently incapable of defending their own country.  It must be remembered that the small items here before us must be taken in conjunction with another Estimate, and that is, the Estimate for Public Works, because there are very large sums under the Estimate for Public Works which, although technically under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Finance or his Parliamentary Secretary, are part of the policy of the Ministry of Defence.  There are very large sums being spent this year on reconditioning Army premises, including, I notice, a sum of £53,000 <Col N="61" /> for a magazine.  The main items of the Army Vote, however, show little change except for the increase in the buying of ammunition.  Every other country in Europe has enormously increased its defence estimates during the last six months&mdash;practically doubled them.  We, being a protected country, do not need to increase ours. The changes from last year are really only incidental and have no very great significance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general position of the Army, I would say that I have heard from many professional soldiers and from impartial observers that there is an increasing slackness in the ranks of the Army.  Even those who watched the parades noticed a regrettable deterioration in the smartness of the Army as compared with previous years and, although Deputies here in this House, on both sides of the House, are fond of paying compliments to the Army, I must say that I do not pay compliments to them for their general condition at the present time. There has been a general deterioration during the last two years in respect of discipline and in respect of smartness.  The jumping team have undoubtedly brought honour and distinction upon our country both in the Old World and in the New World, but if the people knew of the meanness with which the members of the jumping team are treated by the Ministry of Finance there would be a public outcry. The members of the jumping team, which undoubtedly has brought distinction upon the Irish Army and also advertised Irish horse-flesh in different parts of the world, have been deliberately put at a disadvantage as compared with their colleagues in all other international jumping teams by a refusal of the elementary funds required to uphold their station and to uphold the dignity of their position in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister.  I know the Minister is innocent.  A similar situation existed under his predecessor. It is the fault of the Civil Service and of the Civil Service regulations of the Department of Finance, which deliberately placed our jumping team at a disadvantage as compared <Col N="62" /> with the jumping teams of other countries.  That is a scandal and a very mean scandal.  Perhaps the Minister will, at some time use certain pressure, if he has any influence with the Ministry of Finance, to see that this state of affairs will come to an end.  It is not necessary for me to go into details.  The details are too unpleasant.  If the Minister wants to find them out, he can do so easily. This is a pretty example of bureaucracy gone mad, and the sooner it is remedied the better.</P>

      <P>There is one item on which I should like to get some information.  The expenditure on war-like stores for the coming year is estimated at £160,000.  Under sub-head (B) we find that a sum of £110,000 will be utilised for the purchase of ammunition, as part of that item of £160,000. Certain other types of war-equipment will also be purchased.  I understood that, for a considerable time, the Executive Council had under consideration the question of establishing a factory here for the manufacture of ammunition and such other stores of that type as might be required.  A very substantial sum will be spent during the coming year on the purchase of war-like stores of various descriptions, and expenditure of this type is likely to go on from year to year.  I should like to know if any close consideration is being given to the question of establishing a munition factory here, and whether it would not be possible, by utilising the skill and craftsmanship of our own people, to provide for our defence force the ammunition which, I take it, we are compelled to buy from Great Britain, even during the period of an economic war.  Perhaps the Minister would say, if this matter has been under consideration, to what stage that consideration has advanced, and whether there is any prospect that steps will be taken at an early date to establish a munition factory for the manufacture of ammunition which we are at present compelled to buy outside the country.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon is an authority on everything under the sun, and he pontificated on a number of things, including my Irish accent.  I do not know how to reason with him.  He says that the Army, as it stands, has no chance of defending the country, that the Volunteer force is not worth the money it is costing, that the Army could not offer any serious resistance to an external power, and he goes on to state his opinion of the hygienic instruction given to the Army.  I do not know what authority Deputy Dillon has to speak as a military expert.  I am prepared to take, as against Deputy <Col N="64" /> Dillon's advice, the advice of the experts I have in regard to the hygienic instruction which should be given to the ranks of the Army and in regard to a number of other matters.  In regard to the reserve of ammunition, I am prepared to take the advice of the military experts as against Deputy Dillon's advice.  He asked where our munitions were bought.  Our munitions are bought each year where they can be obtained best and cheapest.  Last year, so far as I remember, our purchases were spread over five or six countries. I admit that it is from England we have, up to the present, purchased most of our standard ammunition but, last year, we made purchases from Sweden, France, and Czecho Slovakia as well.  Generally speaking, when we want munitions of any sort we go where we can get them best and cheapest. As regards Deputy Norton's question, we hope to be making at home 303 and .45 ammunition before long.  At the moment we have an Inter-Departmental Committee in negotiation with a couple of firms to see which of them will give us the best price to erect a munition factory on a site which has already been selected.</P>

      <P>No, nor in Wexford either.  Deputy Cosgrave said that the Army was costing a very big sum of money, and he wanted to know if the Army machine had improved.  My belief is that it has.  I think that, for the additional £250,000 that we are spending on the Volunteer force, we have added greatly to the military strength of the Nation.  I would not say for a minute that we can guard our shores against invasion from a superior foreign power.  Very few countries can guard their shores in that way to-day, but I certainly say this: that if the people of this country are determined to resist invasion by any foreign power and if they have at their service a well <Col N="65" /> trained regular army forming the nucleus for the much larger war time army that might be filled up by reserves, such as volunteers, I would certainly say any foreign country that wanted to invade this country would think twice about it.  They might succeed in making a landing, but they might be very glad to get out as the British were.</P>
      <P>All that we are trying to do in regard to the volunteers and the regular army is to provide the people with the best army that they can afford.  If the Department of Defence were given £5,000,000 or £10,000,000 a year, we might have a very much bigger regular army than we have at the moment, but having to keep, as we are, within our financial resources, I think we are giving the country the best military machine that it could possibly get out of the funds at our disposal.  I think that the volunteers will form a very valuable reserve in time of national emergency.  The sum of money that has been spent on them is only £250,000, and that has been spent in training about 10,000 of them. In my opinion it is money that has been well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to an explosion in a magazine.  It was really not an explosion in military stores at all.  This was stuff that, normally, should have been kept either in charge of the police force or in dumps.  It was old sporting ammunition left over by the British years ago.  It should have been destroyed otherwise than by allowing it to explode in a magazine.  Deputy Cosgrave said that the volunteers were not on a par with regular soldiers.  I grant you that, as a military fighting machine, you cannot compare part-time soldiers, such as volunteers are, with the members of the regular army.  As a matter of fact every country in the world, outside the conscriptionist countries, seems to agree that there is a very big military advantage in having reserves such as a Volunteer force. In England, for instance, they have some hundreds of thousands of young men organised in the territorials, a force almost exactly similar to the <Col N="66" /> volunteers here.  In the United States you also have hundreds of thousands of young men organised in territorial units.  You have the same thing in Canada.  As a matter of fact, in every country outside the purely conscriptionist countries you have forces which are on all fours with our Volunteer force.</P>
    <P>If a country wants soldiers at all, I think it is an excellent thing that young men, who cannot serve their country on a whole-time basis in peace times, should be given an opportunity to train so that their services may be effective in time of national emergency.  Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of the equitation school.  He wanted to know why we were not selling some of our prize-winning horses if we could get a good price for them.  I am against any policy such as that. I think that horses that have proved themselves to be good jumping horses should be retained.  As a matter of fact, in the past couple of years, we have refused some very good offers for some of our prize-winning horses. I think the horses that prove themselves to be good jumpers in the equitation school should be retained in the teams that are sent abroad to represent this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde put himself forward as a military expert.  He said that he could not compliment the Army on its discipline or smartness, and that in his opinion there was a general deterioration.  All that I can say to an expert like Deputy Esmonde is that I do not agree with him, and neither do the military experts that I have advising me.  They maintain that the standard of discipline and smartness has been gradually growing over a number of years, and that it is better now than ever it was before.  These, I think, were the only points that were made on the Vote.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if there is any possibility of the No. 1 Army Band being permitted to tour the country again as it used some years ago in the time of his predecessor? I think if enquiries were made it would be found that these tours, which were so well supported <Col N="67" /> and enjoyed by the people, paid for themselves.  I think that the people throughout the country should be given the privilege of hearing the No. 1 Army Band as well as the people in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy MacEoin I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; I had not an opportunity of discussing with Deputy MacEoin what line exactly he was going to take or why he wished this Estimate to be referred back, but I am satisfied that it should be reconsidered as a protest against the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934. The Estimate provides for an increase of £225,909.  As set out in the explanatory note, £211,500 of that amount is accounted for as being in respect of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.  I do not quite know what is meant by the first paragraph in the explanatory note, &ldquo;The increase under this sub-head is due to provision being made for more than 2,000 new pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will tell us that these 2,000 pensions are going to fall on the finances for the coming year. If he does surely he is joking, because at the rate of progress of the Advisory Committee, as they are called officially, since they started duty, it would take them something like 50 years to deal with the number of applications they have.  It would certainly be a very big number of years before anything like the extra £250,000 would fall on the taxpayers. I am afraid the extra sum is put in here merely to attempt to stifle some of the complaints that are being made by applicants, who have been pressing and pressing from every quarter, to have their claims dealt with, and so far have failed.  It is common knowledge that the rate at which the applications are being dealt with is extremely unsatisfactory.  I am sure there is no Deputy who has not been approached by various applicants in connection with their cases, every one of whom has had grievous complaints to make about the board.  One cannot believe all the complaints that are made, but Deputies are fair game for hearing complaints, and there is no doubt that they could not be so general if there was not some really <Col N="71" /> good foundation for at least portion of them.  The way I looked at the Military Service Pensions Act was this.  However one might have looked at it when it was brought before the House, whether one opposed it or supported it, the moment it was passed through this and the other House, it got the sanction of the Oireachtas and was placed on the Statute Book.  Then certain persons immediately got certain rights and became entitled to those rights.</P>
    <P>When, as I say, the Act was placed on the Statute Book, I understood that the aim of the Oireachtas was to place both parties to the civil war on exactly the same footing&mdash;persons who took part in the civil war on the side of the present Government and those who, at the time, were members of the National Army and fought for the State and for the Provisional Government. I think that is an ordinary, intelligent reading of the purpose of the Act.  I am satisfied that if the Act were administered in that spirit&mdash; namely, if the men who applied under the 1934 Act, persons who were friends of the Minister himself, were treated as well as those who claimed under the 1924 Act, in other words, if the two sets of applicants were treated on an equal footing&mdash;this House would have done a very good day's work in passing the Act, because I believe that there is nothing that would tend more to end the bitterness created by the civil war, than that all the old pre-Truce volunteers, who took different sides in the civil war, should now find themselves treated on exactly similar terms.  I believe that is the ideal that every member of the House should aim at and wish to have fulfilled, no matter what side he took in the 1922 trouble.  I believe it is especially the duty of every Deputy who was himself a pre-Truce volunteer to see, as far as he can do so, that the 1934 Act will be administered just as generously as the 1924 Act was administered.</P>
    <P>It is not to-day or yesterday I took that view of the 1934 Military Service Pensions Act.  I took that view of the Act from the moment it had <Col N="72" /> passed through this House.  The very moment that I saw that the late Humphrey Murphy was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee, I made it my business to see him in connection with the administration of the Act.  I gave him, as far as I could, as one member of the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act, my experience of the administration of that Act, especially with regard to the administration of certain matters which, if there was to be fair treatment of new applicants, would have to be dealt with on the same basis as that on which we had dealt with certain parties under the 1924 Act. Perhaps I have not made that quite clear.  Every pre-Truce man will remember that after the 1916 period&mdash; and both Acts commence to operate as from that period&mdash;there were two or three years of comparative inactivity.  Now, there is provision in both Acts for considering service during that period, so that undoubtedly there are certain persons who are entitled to get pensions for that period.  It was particularly to that period that I addressed myself when I was speaking to the late Humphrey Murphy, and I told him how we dealt with it under the 1924 Act.  He agreed with me that our manner of dealing with it appeared to be an extremely fair way of dealing with a period for which, otherwise, nobody could possibly qualify.</P>
    <P>The Act covers service during that period but if you define active service literally there may be very few persons indeed who could show any activity whatever, apart from being in jail or on hunger-strike, and that in itself could hardly be called active service.  There would be very few indeed who could claim to have had active service during that period.  I told him that we dealt with such cases in this way: where we found a 1916 man who had attended Volunteer parades for that inactive period, we took into account the fact that he had been a 1916 man, and we assumed that if there had been any activity in the comparatively quiet period between 1916 and 1919 he would have been one of the persons on active service. <Col N="73" /> Therefore, we carried forward for him his 1916 service into that inactive period.  Then we came on to the men who were particularly active against the Black-and-Tans and who came into prominence in 1920 and 1921.  We said that if these men had been members of the Volunteers in 1917, 1918, and the early part of 1919, their service should be carried back into that inactive period.  I say that is only fair.  Since there is a provision in the Acts for taking service during that period into consideration, I think that was a fair way of treating applicants who claimed to have served during that period.  I regret, however, judging by many of the cases about which I have heard, that the Act has not been administered from that angle.</P>
    <P>I have heard of several men, 1916 men, men who underwent penal servitude in 1917 and who became extremely active in the 1920-21 period, who have been cut out completely for that period.  Who, in the name of heaven, could have given active service during that period if such a type of person is excluded?  I think it is regrettable that the Minister does not see to it that the Act is administered more generously.  It may seem a very strange circumstance that it should fall upon me to stand up here and champion the cases of persons against whom I have been fighting.  I fought, and fought pretty hard against them but when that fight was over, it was over with me, and since the country, as I understand it, by the election of 1932, gave its benediction, if one might say so, to the activities of the irregulars in 1922, I hold that both sides in the civil war should be treated equally. If the Act continues to be administered as it is being administered at the moment, the men who were against the State in 1922 will continue to feel that they have a grievance and that they have not got fair play <i>vis-a-vis</i> men who were fighting for the State at the time.  I have had a letter, amongst others, from some persons in America. I think it is a letter which has been circulated to probably every Deputy in the House.  It is a letter from Sean Oglaigh na h-Eireann, New York, and it is signed by Frank MacCabe and Simon Egan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> One of the names is quite familiar to me.  He is a man quite well-known to me because he fought, as a sergeant, in my company during the Rising. These men are now proceeding with the organisation of the old I.R.A. men in America.  They have a plan which they have put forward.  I do not say that everything that they claim is justified or that everything they ask for could be granted.  They want a board set up to deal with the American applicants alone.  I am afraid that would only extend the lack of co-ordination that already exists between the earlier Pensions Act of 1924 and the present Act, and would cause a greater lack of co-ordination between the set of persons dealt with under this Act and the previous Act. In my view the same board should treat with the applicants both in Ireland and America, and in that way the applications would be fairly expeditiously examined.  In this letter it is stated that the old I.R.A. in America did a fair amount of sifting.  They have wiped out a number of applicants and, eventually, sent forward about 300.  These 300 men seem to have a good case, in my view.  There is no doubt about the case of Frank McCabe. He was in America during the civil war, and comes under that portion of the Act which deals with those who took no part in the civil war.  It is a pity that something is not done to get the cases of some of those men dealt with expeditiously.  If sworn affidavits were taken from them before the Free State Consul and their cases put on the files I think it would be advisable.  It is hard lines that those men who gave good service at one period, and are now far away from this country, should have anything like a feeling that they are being abandoned by their friends at home.  As soon as provision is made for that I think it should be acted upon.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Vote on Account I suggested to the Minister for Finance at the time that the board dealing with this Act was wrong, and that he should set up completely new machinery in order to deal with applicants under the 1934 Act on the same basis as those dealt with under the 1924 Act.  I told him that, as far <Col N="75" /> as I was concerned, if he brought a proposal before the House to set up a board consisting of an independent chairman and two pre-Truce men who took his side in the civil war, I would support him; because I think that is the only way you can give these applicants fair-play.  That is the only way you can give these applicants equal treatment with their comrades who were dealt with under the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>The board, as constituted, as everybody knows, consists of a judge of the Circuit Court, which is all right.  The Minister has then two nominees, two pre-Truce men, and I think he could let the board rest at that.  I see no reason whatever for having civil servants on a board of that kind.  I think it is wrong.  The training of civil servants is directed, if I may say so without offence, towards cheeseparing. Civil servants on a board of that kind will be there purely and simply for the purpose of cutting down pensions or excluding persons from pensions. There were no civil servants on the board under the 1924 Act.  I think it would be desirable to have on the board under the present Act people who would not make any difference between sets of pensioners, and I commend that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>To discuss legislation is not allowable on an Estimate, but since the section of the Act of 1934 with which we are concerned is an administrative section I think it is necessary that I should advocate this change.  You cannot get the Act of 1934 administered in the same way as the Act of 1924 unless you change your board and have one similar to the board that acted under the Act of 1924.  As that has not been done, and because of the slowness with which cases are dealt with, and because the pensioners, to my mind, are not all getting what they are entitled to under the Act, I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with quite a lot of what Deputy Lynch has said.  But I think if he were in a position to go over the awards made under the 1924 Act he would find they were not quite <Col N="76" /> as generous as he seems to think.  He would find that at least over half the men who got pensions did not get anything for the period up to 1919.  If he had an opportunity of going over the awards he would find that in or about the same proportion, and in exactly the same type of case as he has put forward, to-day, the awards were more or less the same as under the 1924 Act. My definite advice to the referee was that he should treat them on all-fours. I think, from what I have seen, and I have examined quite a number of cases, it is quite certain that there is one thing in which every claimant for a pension would agree with Deputy Lynch, and that is that he should have got more.  There was no pension claimant who would not agree with that.  If Deputy Lynch had the duty of making these awards, I think he would find he could not have been more generous than the referee or the present board have been.  There was a definite set of rules laid down as to service and all the rest of it.  These were taken over by the new board and operated strictly.  In every case that is similar to this question of military service pensions you will be bound to have a lot of differences of opinion as between one man and another.  There is no sort of standard yardstick as you have in the measurement of space or of time.  It is all a question of the opinion of the referee and of the board. I am convinced myself, from the cases which I have examined, that the refree and the board are doing their best within the law to give every applicant the right to which the 1924 Act entitled him.  If any applicant thinks he has a grievance, the referee is giving him the right of appeal against the award.  If he has anything further to say and wants to get his case reheard, it can be done.  But finally a settlement has to be come to, and on rehearing according to the Act the referee has the power to make a decision which is binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever, including myself.  The referee has the statutory authority for coming to a decision as to the amount of pension that is to be awarded to any applicant.  I am convinced, <Col N="77" /> from what I have seen of the referee that he is a fair-minded man, and gives everybody everything to which he is entitled under the Act.  My advice to him when he was appointed was to make sure that the pensions under the 1934 Act would be as generous as they were under the 1924 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point which Deputy Lynch raised, and that was the U.S.A. applications.  One of the big difficulties in dealing both with applicants here at home and applicants abroad has been that the referee did not get the co-operation from old I.R.A. bodies that he should have got if they wanted to get things speeded up.  Under the Act the referee has to take into consideration the rank held by the applicant&mdash;the rank element being based on the rank held on either one of two critical dates, that is 11th July, 1921, or 2nd July, 1922. The referee has found that several applications were made for the same rank on the same date.  He cannot award the rank to the first applicant, because, if the first applicant came along and convinced him that he was really the man who held that rank on that date in the unit in question, there might come along a second applicant who would be equally positive that he held it.  The only thing the referee could do in a case like that was to ask the old I.R.A. officers in the various areas to agree as to the names of the officers who held the various ranks on each of the two critical dates.  It is a simple matter for all the old brigade officers in a brigade in Kerry or any place else to come together and write out a list, saying:&ldquo;The following are the names of the men who held the various ranks in this brigade on 11th July, 1921,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The following are the names of the men who held the various ranks in this brigade on 2nd July, 1922.&rdquo;  If that were done it would speed up the work of the referee enormously.  Notwithstanding all those difficulties, however the referee and the board are getting on much more rapidly than the board got on under the 1924 Act, and I believe that when those records come in they will be able to go ahead five or six if not ten times as fast as they are <Col N="78" /> going at the present time.  They have had the utmost difficulty in getting those lists of the ranks.  In the case of many areas that are complaining, the fault lies not with the referee and the board but with the local old I.R.A. officers who cannot get together and agree upon the lists.  I only hope that one result of this debate will be that the old I.R.A. officers will provide the referee with an agreed list of their ranks on the two critical dates.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is in regard to the people who are in the United States and the people who are in Canada and Australia and all over the world.  I got a circular&mdash;I think every member of the Dáil got it&mdash;from a certain group of old I.R.A. men in New York, who wanted to have a pensions board set up for New York alone.  If a pensions board were set up for New York it might deal with New York and surrounding districts, but San Francisco is as far from New York as New York is from Dublin, so the people in San Francisco would say that a pensions board should be set up for them, and we would end up by having one in every large city in the world.  It cannot be done in that way; the only way in which it can be done is by correspondence.  Quite recently the referee issued a circular to every applicant who resides overseas, setting out in detail what he was to do; telling him to give the names of the officers who would be communicated with, and all that sort of thing.  I believe that a number of those applications will be dealt with within the next couple of months, and that if people have any idea that those across the seas have been forgotten they will be disabused of that idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>All that the referee does is to deal with certificates.  A person applies to the referee for a certificate that he has a certain number of years' service, and on production of that certificate to the Department <Col N="79" /> of Defence the applicant gets a pension.  I think I know what Deputy Cosgrave has in mind.  The referee has tried to deal with applicants according to their need.  Where the ranks of the brigade have been supplied, and where everything is clear so that the referee can arrive at his decision, he takes into account as far as he can the circumstances of the applicants, and those who are in need are dealt with first.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £113,512 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1937, chun Costaisí Oifig an Aire Oideachais, maraon le costaisí Riaracháin, Cigireachta, etc.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £113,512 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education, including the costs of Administration, Inspection, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>£4,599,994&mdash;is é sin iomlán glan an mheastacháin costais le h-aghaidh seirbhísí oideachais, ó Vóta 45 go Vóta 50 (agus iad sin san áireamh) do bhliadhain a 1936-37; agus tá an tsuim sin £111,046 níos mó ná suim bhliadhna a 1931-32.  Na Vótaí do Mheadhon-Oideachas agus do Cheárd-Oideachas is príomh-adhbhar do'n mhéadughadh sin.  Suim an Vóta do Mheadhon-Oideachas, tá sí £79,575 níos mó ná mar bhí i 1931-32.  Fáth mór le sin líon na scoláirí aitheanta le h - aghaidh Deontas Ceanntraithe bheith ag méadughadh gach bliadhain, agus, freisin, méadughadh buan bheith ag teacht ar líon na múinteóir a gcuirtear breis bhliadhantamhail le n-a dtuarastal. Maidir le Vóta an Cheárd-Oideachais, tá sé £63,142 níos mó ná <Col N="80" /> mar bhí i mbliadhain a 1931-32.  Is é is príomh-ádhbhar do sin na Deóntais Bhliadhantamhla do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais bheith ag dul i méid; óir, má théigheann an deóntas áiteamhail ó na rátaí ós cionn na minima do shocair Acht an Ghairm-Oideachais, 1930, ghnítear cuid de'n Stát-deóntas do mhéadughadh dá réir sin.  Rud eile, tá méadughadh buan ag teacht ar na díolaidheachta do-ghnítear le Coistí Áiteamhla mar gheall ar phinsiona nó tabhartais agus mar gheall ar iasachta do réir Acht an Ghairm-Oideachais, 1930; agus caithfear glacadh le sin mar ghnáth-mhéadughadh.</P>
    <P>Ar an taobh eile, tá meastachán chostas an Bhun-Oideachais £32,765 níos lugha ná meastachán bhliadhna a 1931-32.</P>
    <P>An meastachán le h-aghaidh seirbhísí oideachais, ó Vóta 45 go Vóta 50 (agus iad sin san áireamh), tá sé £33,155 níos mó ná meastachán bhliadhna a 1935-36.  I gcás an Vóta le h-aghaidh Oifig an Aire, tá sé £6,985 níos mó.  Is é rud is príomh-adhbhar do sin an costas (mar aon le bonus) a bhainfeas le h-eagrughadh áirithe atáthar ag brath a dhéanamh ar fhoirinn Bhrainnse an Bhun-Oideachais. Tá meastachán chostas an Bhun-Oideachais £11,323 níos lugha ná mar bhí sé anuraidh.  Níl costas na gColáiste Oileamhna chomh mór agus bhí sé, agus meastar go mbeidh laghadughadh eile, fós, ar líon na macléighinn i gColáistí Oileamhna na bhFear.  Le n-a chois sin, tá laghadughadh ar an gcostas a bhaineas le tuarastail na n-Oide Scoile agus le Deóntais Cheanntsraithe.  De thaobh amháin, tháinig an laghadughadh sin de bharr gan múinteóirí áirithe neamhriachtanacha bheith ann ó cuireadh cuid de na scoltacha le chéile; agus de thaobh eile, tháinig sé de bharr a dheacrachta agus bhí sé meastachán beacht do thabhairt, i mbliadhain a 1935-36, do chostas an scála leasuighthe tháinig i bhfeidhm, do'n chéad uair, sa bhliadhain sin.  Maidir leis an líon le h-aghaidh aois liúntas, tá sé £15,500 níos mó ná mar bhí sé.  Costas é seo atá ag síor-mhéadughadh ar siocair pinsiona de réir tuarastal beag bheith ag dul i n-éag agus pinsiona do réir tuarastal is mó ná iad sin bheith ag teacht chun íocaidheachta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Meastachán chostas an Mheadhon-Oideachais do bhliadhain a 1936-37, tá sé £28,005 níos mó ná mar bhí meastachán 1935-36.  Mar gheall ar a thuilleadh páistí bheith ag freastal na scoltach, tá £10,800 de bhreis sa mheastachán le h-aghaidh Deóntas Ceanntsraithe.  Nidh eile atá níos mó ná bhí sé an deóntas do Scoltacha Gaedhilge agus do Scoltacha Dhá-Theangacha, óir tá méadughadh tar éis teacht ar líon na scoltach sin agus ar líon na scoláire bhíos ortha.  Tá costas na mbreiseanna tuarastal £11,500 níos mó ná mar bhí, agus is iad seo na príomh-neithe is adhbhar do sin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  an ghnáth-bhreis tuarastal sa bhliadhain de réir na scála;</P>
    <P>(2)  a thuilleadh scoláire aitheanta bheith ann, agus, dá réir sin, a thuilleadh múinteóir a bhfuil na breiseanna dlighte dóibh;</P>
    <P>(3)  a thuilleadh múinteóir bheith ann a bhfuil an bhreis speisialta dlighte dóibh mar gheall ar theagasc tré Ghaedhilge.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an £12,623 de mhéadughadh atá ar an Vóta do Cheárd-Oideachas, is cóir a chuimhniughadh gur bh'éigean suim mheasardha airgid do chur leis na deóntais do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais mar gheall ar na deóntais áiteamhla ó na rátaí bheith os cionn na minima do shocair Acht an Ghairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Is beag nach ionann an meastachán do Eólaidheacht a's Ealadhain agus an méid do vótáileadh le n-a aghaidh sin anuraidh.</P>
    <P>I gcompráid le Vóta 1935-36, tá an meastachán do Scoltacha Ceartúcháin agus Scoltacha Saothair £3,631 níos lugha.  Is é an fáth is mó atá leis an athrughadh nach bhfuil, le tamall de bhliadhanta, a oiread páiste ar na scoltacha sin agus bhíodh, agus gur cóir, dá réir sin, an Deóntas Ceanntsraithe do laghadughadh.</P>

      <P>Tá líon na ndaltai sa gcúigeadh rang agus sna ranganna níos aoirde ná sin sna Scoltacha Náisiúnta ag dul i méid fós mar a bhí bliadhanta eile roimhe seo.  Céad agus cúig mhíle déag, cúig chéad agus <Col N="82" /> seachtmhó (115,570) líon na ndaltaí a bhí sna ranganna sin ar an 30adh Meitheamh, 1935, i gcomparáid le céad agus ceithre mhíle déag, ocht gcéad a hocht is fiche (114,828) ar an 30adh Meitheamh, 1934.  Trí mhíle ochtmhód, sé chéad agus trí daltaí c a o g a i d (83,653) a bhí sna ranganna sin sa mbliadhain 1926-27.  Is léir dá bhrígh sin go bhfuil an aois ina bhfágann daltaí an scoil ag árdú do réir a chéile 'chuile bhliadhain ó 1926 de bharr lánfheidhmiú an Achta Freastal Scoile. Do réir na bhfigiúirí maidir le tinnreamh le h-aghaidh na scoil-bhliadhna 1934-35, is léir, 'á nglacadh san iomlán, gur oibrigh an tAcht go h-éifeachtach i rith na bliadhna.  Tháinig laigheadú beag ar na figiúirí i gcomórtas le figiúirí na bliadhna roimhe sin&mdash;0.2 ins an tinnreamh fé'n gcéad a rinne iomlán na ndaltaí scoile, agus 0.3 ins an tinnreamh fé'n gcéad a rinne na daltaí (ó 6 go 14 bliadhna d'aois) le n-a mbaineann an t-Acht.  Cuimhnightear, ámh, gurb iad an tinnreamh fé'n gcéad a rinne iomlán na ndaltaí scoile agus an tinnreamh fé'n gcéad a rinne na daltaí (ó 6 go 14 bliadhna d'aois) le n-a mbaineann an t-Acht sa mbliadhain 1933-34 na tinnrimh is aoirde dá bhfuil aon chunntas ágainn ortha.</P>
      <P>Sa bhliadhain 1934-5 rug Cathair Phortláirge an chraobh léithe ar aon Chonndae nó Chonndae-Bhuirg eile maidir le tinnreamh daltaí le n-a mbaineann an t-Acht.  Bhí an tinnreamh a b'aoirde fé'n gcéad aca, eadhon, 88.1%.  I n-a dhiaidh sin tháinig Cathair Chorcaighe (an áit a b'aoirde tinnreamh sa bhliadhain 1932-3 agus sa bhliadhain 1933-4) le 87.9%, Conndae Chorcaighe le 86.2%, Conndae Chiarraighe le 86.1%, Conndae Lughmhaidhe le 86%, agus Conndae Cheatharlach agus Conndae Laoighise le 85.9% an ceann.  I seacht gcinn de Chonndaethe nó de ChonndaeBhuirgí, tháinig árdú ar an tinnreamh fé'n gcéad&mdash;i bhfichid ceann aca tháinig ísliú beag air i gcomórtas leis an bhliadhain roimhe sin; agus, i dtrí cinn aca, ní tháinig athrú ar bith ar an scéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ins an bhliadhain airgeadais 1934-5, tugadh £153,181 mar dheóntaisí chun tighthe scoile do thógáil, nó do mhéadú, nó do chóiriú.  Agus i mbliadhna táthar ar intinn suim na <Col N="83" /> ndeóntas le h-aghaidh na h-oibre sin do mhéadú go dtí £200,000.  Le cois an deóntas do mhéadú le h-aghaidh tógáil agus cóiriú tighthe scoile, táthar tar éis glacadh le pleananna nua chun scoilsheomraí de riail-standard áirithe do chur ar fagháil i n-a mbeidh breis fairsinge do na daltaí agus fós comhgar níos fearr le h-aghaidh scomraí clóca.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tighthe maithe scoile a chur ar fagháil i n-ionad na sean-teach scoile ins na ceanntair tuaithe, tá an obair ag dul chun cinn chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.  Ach leigeadh an obair chomh fada sin ar gcúl roimh an bhliadhain 1922 agus nach féidir an riaráiste a thárla a ghlanadh i n-am ghoirid.  Fé láthair tá cóir réasúnta scol ins na cathracha agus ins na bailte móra i gcoitchinne; ach tá beagán baile fé'n dtuaith ann agus níl a gcuid tighthe scoile chomh fairsing nó chomh feileamhnach agus ba chóir dóibh a bheith.  Tá réidhteach 'á dhéanamh fá láthair chun tighthe nua scoile do thógáil ins na h-áiteacha sin gan ró-mhoill.  I dtaobh na scol i gConndae-Bhuirg Bhaile Átha Cliath, is cóir a rádh, ámh, gur neamh-ionann go mór an scéal annsin agus an scéal i n-áit ar bith eile.  Na tighthe nua comhnuidhe atá dá dtógáil fé choimirce Bhárdas na Cathrach agus Chomhluchtaí eile fé ndear é sin.  Mar gheall ar na tighthe nua sin ní bheidh a oiread páistí ag freastal na scol i lár na cathrach agus bhéadh gan iad.  Tá cuid de na scoltachaí sin agus caithfear bail agus ath-chóiriú a chur ortha chun na seomraí a dhéanamh níos fairsinge agus níos feileamhnaighe.  Ach caithfear san am chéadna gan a leigint ar dearmad go mbeidh a lán daoine ag dul a chomhnuidhe amach fé imeall na cathrach; agus caithfear a bheith faithchilleach gan costas a dhéanamh a d'fhéadfadh gan bheith riachtanach amach annseo maidir le tighthe nua scoile a chur 'á dtógáil i lár na cathrach, nó maidir le feabhsú na dtighthe scoile atá annsin fé láthair.</P>
    <P>On ladh Abrán, 1933, tugadh céad agus cúig mhíle púnt (£105,000) san iomlán mar dheontaisí chun Scoltacha Náisiúnta i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath do thógáil agus d'fheabhsú.  I gcás sé cinn de na deontaisí sin tógadh scoltacha nua, agus i gcás ceithre cinn <Col N="84" /> eile aca rinneadh scoltacha d'athchóiriú nó do mhéadú go mór.  Tá trí cinn de na scoltacha nua tógtha agus críochnuighthe; tá an obair ar siubhal i gceithre cinn eile; agus is gearr go dtosnófar ar an obair sna ceithre cinn eile atá fágtha.</P>
    <P>Tá pleananna leagtha amach le scoltacha nua do thógáil i gCroimghlinn a meastar a chosnóchas ó ochtmhódh míle púnt (£80,000) go nócha míle púnt (£90,000) agus scoltacha i North Lotts a meastar a chosnóchas cúig míle déag púnt (£15,000).</P>
    <P>Tá beartuighthe freisin scoltacha nua do thógáil i seacht bparáistí sa gCathair, agus ba cheart go mbeadh cuid mhór den obair déanta as seo go ceann bliadhna go leith.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil furmhór na dtighthe sásamhail, tá a lán le déanamh fós sul a mbeidh na tighthe scoile i gceart. Tá cuid díobh ró-shean agus i riocht tuitim as a chéile, cuid aca suidhte ar láthair atá mí-fholláin, cuid aca gan a ndóthain soluis ionnta agus seomraí gan bheith sáthach mór i gcuid eile; agus 'na theannta sin tá a lán scol ann a mbíonn beirt nó triúr oidí ag múineadh in aon tseomra amháin.  Tá roinnt mhaith scol ann ina bhfuil seantroscán caithte agus droch-fheisteas eile.  Is deacair do na h-oidí múineadh agus oileamhaint mar ba chóir a thabhairt do na páistí ins na scoltacha úd.</P>
    <P>Ní déantar cuid mhaith de na tighthe scoile do dheisiú agus do mhaisiú go tráthamhail.  Tá a lán bainisteoirí ann atá an-dúthrachtach san rud so, ach tá cuid mhaith dhíobh ann agus deallruigheann sé gur cuma leo cé an chuma atá ar na scoltacha atá fé na gcúram.</P>
    <P>Is mór an moladh a bheirtear do na mná riaghalta as ucht an chaoi a gcoinnighthear seomraí na scoltacha clochair i gcomhnuidhe.  Bíonn cuid mhór de scoltacha Bráthar beagnach chomh slachtmhar leo, agus bíonn an chuid is mó de na scoltacha atá fá bhan-oidí slachtmhar deismear freisin. Ach ní mór an moladh atá ag gabháil dá lán de na hoidí eile as an tslacht agus an tigheas a chleachtas siad, agus ní deagh-shompla do na páistí é. Féadfaí a lán a dhéanamh leis na scoltacha a choinneál glan agus le miondeisiú a dhéanamh gan costas ar bith ach na hoidí agus na daltaí bheith ag <Col N="85" /> cabhrú le na chéile san obair seo. Bíonn páipéir scaptha fá'n urlár agus fá'n gclós go minic, agus ní múintear do na páistí nach ceart iad a chaitheamh uatha mar sin.  Is minic freisin nach nglantar na ballaí go maith ar maidin sul a dtosnuighthear ar obair an lae.</P>
    <P>Cé go dtugtar aire mhaith do théitheadh na scoltacha i gcoitchinne i gcaoi go mbíonn na seomraí te compóirteach, tá roinnt scoltacha ann a bhíos fuar anróiteach san nGeimhreadh. Amannta is ar na similéir nó na grátaí a bhíos an locht i gcaoi gur suas an similéar a théigheas an chuid is mó den teas.  Tá roinnt mhaith seomraí móra taobh le gráta amháin, agus na daltaí a bhíos ar an dtaoibh i bhfad ón teine bíd préachta leis an bhfuacht, agus is minic gurab iad na páistí is óige agus is laige ar an scoil iad.  I n-áiteacha ní adhantar an teine sáthach luath ar maidin agus leigtear as í ró luath san tráthnóna.  I néindigh leis sin ní bhíonn aon teine ina lán scoltacha go dtí lá Samhna agus éirighthear aisti ar fad i ndeire an Mhárta, agus deir cuid de na cigirí go mbíonn an tinnreamh íseal ins na scoltacha so mar gheall air sin i ndeire an Earraigh agus i ndeire an Fhoghmhair. Tá sé de dhualgas ar Bhainisteoirí freisin féachaint chuige go mbeidh cumhdaigh theine i scoltachaibh fé n-a gcúram 'na mbeidh páistí fé bhun seacht mbliadhan d'aois.</P>
    <P>Is iomdha gearán a ghnítear i dtaoibh na gcúltighthe.  Is minic a bhíos siad go fliuch salach, agus droch-chaoi ar an gcabhas ag dul chucha.  Ní follmhuighthear na claiseanna go hiondual.  Deirtear uaireannta gur deacair duine d'fhagháil leis an obair sin a dhéanamh. Ach is tearc scoil a gcuirtear cré thirim go laetheamhail ins na claiseanna áit nach bhfuil cóir uisce ann, agus is minic a bhíos boladh bréan ag éirghe uatha san Samhradh, agus is mór an chontabhairt don lucht scoile an chaoi a mbíonn siad.  Ins na bailte móra agus áit ar bith a mbíonn cóir uisce ann is beag cúis gearáin a cloistear faoi na cúltighthe.</P>
    <P>Is léir ó chunntaisí na gcigirí go gcuireann na hoidí i gcoitchinne spéis na gcuid oibre agus go ndéanann siad a ndícheall le oileamhaint mhaith a thabhairt do na páistí.  Taobh amuigh <Col N="86" /> de cheachta múinid béasa maithe agus prionsabail deagh-iomchair agus Críostaidheachta dhóibh.  Caithid dúthracht leis na páistí a chur i n-oireamhaint don saoghal atá rómpa.  Ní hionann sin is a rádh nach bhfuil oidí ann atá failightheach 'na ndualgaisí.  Tá oidí ann nach gcuireann mórán suime i n-oileamhaint na ndaltaí agus nách ndéanann a gcuid múinteorachta ach ar nós cuma liom ó ló go ló.  Tá oidí eile ann agus cé nach bhfuilid chomh neamartach sin, ní bhaineann siad toradh mar ba chóir as a gcuid oibre toisc nach ndéanaid ullmhú cruinn agus machtnamh ar na ceachta roimh ré. Tá oidí eile ann agus tagann meath ar a gclisteacht múinteorachta agus ar a gcuid eolais toisc nach leanaid ar aon chúrsa léighinn tar éis fágáil na gcoláistí dhóibh.</P>
    <P>Is féidir a rádh go bhfuil cáilidheacht furmhór na múinteoirí sásamhail cé is moite den chúigeadh cuid nó mar sin de na hoidí nach bhfuil aon cháilidheacht san nGaedhilg aca: sean-oidí an chuid is mó díobhtha so.  Tá eolas ar an nGaedhilg ag dul i méid i measc na múinteoirí do réir mar atá na daoine óga ag teacht amach as na coláistí: ach tá sé le tabhairt fé deara go bhfuil cuid de na hoidí a bhfuil an teastas dá-theangach aca, go bhfuil siad ag cailleamhaint a gcuid Gaedhilge ceal cleachtuighthe agus staidéir.  Ach tá a lán oidí ann agus cé go bhfuil colas maith ar an nGaedhilg aca, tugaid cuairt ar an nGaedhealtacht beagnach gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Le roinnt blian anuas bhí cúrsaí gearáin ann fé'n gclár scoile.  Cuireadh i leith an chláir go raibh ualach róthrom ar na múinteoirí agus nach raibh caoi aca leis an nGaedhilg a mhúineadh mar ba chóir.  Tugadh cluas don ghearán sin agus cinneadh ar an gclár d'éadtromú i gcaoi go laghdóchthaí cúrsa an Bhéarla agus go gcuirfí Eolas ar Nadúr agus ar Mhatamaitic i leathtaoibh i bhfurmhór na scol a raibh na hádhbhair seo riachtanach go dtí seo.  Bheadh cosc ar an mBéarla i rang na naoidheanán áit ar bith a mbeadh eolas maith (an teastas dá-theangach, cur i gcás) ag an oide.  Ní bheadh an Béarla oibliogáideach san gcéad rang feasta, agus bhéadh cúrsa níos simplidhe san mBéarla ins na ranga eile, go dtí nach mbeadh leabhra ní <Col N="87" /> ba dheacra le léigheadh san sémhadh rang ná mar bhí dhá léigheadh de ghnáth san gceathramhadh rang roimhe seo.  An t-am a sábháilfí mar sin bheadh ar na hoidí é a thabhairt do mhúineadh na Gaedhilge.</P>
    <P>Níorbh' fhéidir an toradh a thiocfas as an gclár nua a mheas le cinnteacht, go ceann roinnt blian, ach sé tuairim na gcigirí go dtiocfaidh feabhas mór ar mhúineadh na Gaedhilge dá bhárr.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but he has been good enough to supply me with a copy of his statement, of which half is in English and half in Irish.  There are a number of paragraphs in this which the Minister is not reading.  May I take it that the Minister has amended his statement as he is reading it, or am I to take it that the statement before me is a correct version of what the Minister desires to say on the Estimate?</P>

      <P>The statement was given to the Deputy to enable him to follow the speech.  I think the English translation covers in full all the points I have raised.  In certain cases, owing to the fact that the statement is somewhat long, I have not mentioned some of the less significant points.</P>

      <P>On the page the Minister is reading in Irish he has omitted a paragraph from his statement which appears in my copy of the statement. After the words &ldquo;do mhúineadh na Gaedhilge,&rdquo; appears the paragraph beginning &ldquo;Cuireadh amach imlitir do bhainisteoirí.&rdquo;  The Minister has hopped that paragraph beginning with the words &ldquo;Cuireadh amach imlitir do bhainisteoirí&rdquo;.</P>

Deirtear go bhfuiltear in áiteacha ar theorainn na Gaedhealtachta ag iarraidh an Béarla a choinneáil siar chun an dá phúnt a thuilleamh.  Deir duine de na cigirí: &ldquo;Má leanann na daoine ar an bhfuadar atá fútha leathnóchaidh an Ghaedhealtacht&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I desire to inquire whether the paragraph beginning with the words &ldquo;Cuireadh amach imlitir do bhainisteoirí&rdquo; is going to be reproduced in the Official Reports or not, because, if it is, it ought to be read out in this House.  The Minister should not abbreviate a written statement and then hand the statement <i>in extenso</i> to be incorporated in the Official Reports.  My submission is that it is by courtesy the House permits the Minister to read his statement, but it is on the clear understanding that everything in the statement is read, and that everything which is going into the Official Reports is in fact being read by the Minister. There is a paragraph in the copy of the statement before me, which I believe the Minister to be reading, which the Minister has not read out to the House.  I ask him, therefore, to see that that paragraph is elided from the Official Reports.</P>

      <P>So far as the point of order is concerned, what a Minister or a Deputy says is what will go into the Official Reports. Whether the Minister chooses to read <i>in extenso</i> or in an abbreviated form what he has before him lies with the Minister.  It is as a matter of courtesy that he has given the Deputy a copy of what he proposes to say.</P>

      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the Chair to the fact that in the written statement appear passages which were not read out to the House and steps should be taken to see that these paragraphs do not appear in the Official Reports.  It would be extremely difficult for me to direct the attention of the Chair on next Tuesday to the fact that the Minister for Education did not say something which is in the Official Reports.  The Chair would say: &ldquo;I cannot possibly remember what the Minister said.&rdquo;  The Chair takes the point.  Therefore, I am directing the attention of the Chair to what appears to me to be an attempt to insert in the Official Reports something which has not been communicated orally to the House.</P>

      <P>It is well known to every Deputy that when the Minister speaks in Irish his observations may not be taken down <i>verbatim</i> by each of the official reporters and the well-established practice of the House is that the Minister is subsequently consulted as to what in fact he said.  We all know that the manuscript he holds in his hands will be handed to the official reporters and incorporated <i>en globo</i> in the Official Reports.  I now allege that at least one paragraph in the manuscript in his hands has not been communicated orally to the House, and I therefore object to the omitted paragraph being inserted in the Official Reports.</P>

      <P>Deir na cigirí i gcoitchinne nach bhfuil aon amhras ná gur tugadh céim mhaith chun tosaigh i múineadh na Gaedhilge san nGalltacht, agus gurab iad na &ldquo;Nótaí do Mhúinteoirí&rdquo; agus éadtromú an chláir fá deara sin, agus molann siad dúthracht agus deagh-thoil no n-oidí i gcoitchinne.  Ach má tá feabhas ar an nGaedhilg, an chaoi a múintear í agus <Col N="90" /> an chaoi a labhartar í i gcuid mhaith de na scoltacha, níl sí, ámhthach, ach ina h-adhbhar léighinn san gcuid is mó de na scoltacha go fóill i n-áit a bheith á labhairt ag aos óg taobh amuigh den scoil, ar an mbóthar chuig an scoil agus ar an bhfaithche imeartha; agus an fhaid is amhlaidh tá sí, ní féidir a rádh go bhfuil sí ag breith treise ar an mBéarla.  Agus ins na scoltacha a mbíonn furmhór na n-ádhbhar á múineadh tré Ghaedhilg is minic nach í an Ghaedhilg a bhíos le cloisint agus na páistí ag súgradh leo féin.</P>
      <P>Tá tuilleadh oidí ag baint feidhme as drámaí mar mhódh múinte na teangan.  Cuireann na páistí suim san ngnó so agus bíonn toradh air dá réir.</P>
      <P>Deir Roinn-Chigire san nGalltacht&mdash;&ldquo;Tríd is tríd chítear do sna cigirí go bhfuil spiorad níos fearr agus a thuilleadh misnigh ag teacht ag oidí agus ag daltaí i dtaobh na Gaedhilge&mdash; go bhfuil sórt breacadh an lae ann i gceart fé dheire i saoghal na mbun-scol.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tá cuid de na cigirí ámhthach gan bheith ró-shásta le múineadh na Gaedhilge i ranga na Naoidheanán.</P>
      <P>An chomhairle oifigeamhail a bhaineas leis an nGaedhilg d'úsáid mar chóir mhúinte tá sí curtha síos go mion agus go cruinn san imlitir a cuireadh amach i Mí na Samhna, 1931.  Moltar do'n oide gnáth-theanga an ranga a dhéanamh de'n Ghaedhilg i dtosach agus í d'úsáid taobh amuigh de'n teagasc san mion-chainnt a bhaineas le órduighthe, le teachtaireachta beaga, le comhairle, le smacht, &amp;rl., sul a mbainfí feidhm aisi mar theanga an teagaisc.</P>
      <P>Is fíor, ámhthach, go dtugann oidí amannta iarracht ar na h-ádhbhair a mhúineadh tré Ghaedhilg agus gan a ndóthain eolais ar an nGaedhilg ag na páistí.  Cuireadh i leith na gcigirí go mbíonn siad ag gríosadh na n-oidí chun gabháil do'n mhúineadh tré Ghaedhilg áit nach ceart, ach ní dócha go bhfuil bun leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé baramhail na geigirí tré chéile go bhfuil an líon seol a múintear an chuid is mó de na h-ádhbhair léighinn tré Ghaedhilg ag dul i méid diaidh ar ndiaidh.  &ldquo;Maidir le múineadh tré Ghaedhilg,&rdquo; arsa cigire, &ldquo;tríd is tríd <Col N="91" /> bhí an oiread á dhéanamh i bhfurmhór na scol as do b'fhéidir agus bhí na h-oidí fonnmhar i gcoitchinne.&rdquo;  Tá ceanntracha ann a múintear gach ádhbhar tré Ghaedhilg san gcúigeadh cuid nó mar sin de na scoltacha, ach tá ceanntracha eile ann nách mbítear ag múineadh na n-ádhbhar uile tré Ghaedhilg ach i bhfó-scoil go fóill. Ach tá roinnt mhaith scol i ngach ceanntar a bhfuil cuid de'n teagasc á thabhairt tré Ghaedhilg agus an méid sin á leathnú amach gach bliain. San mBreac-Ghaedhealtacht is mó a bhfuil an dul chun cinn ann.  Tá na cigirí sásta go mbíonn toradh maith leis an teagasc tré Ghaedhilg i gcoitchinne, go mbíonn na páistí i ndon an teagasc do leanamhaint go réidh, agus go mbíonn for-fhás intleachta le mothú de thairbhe na h-oibre.</P>
    <P>Ní mór bheith ag cuimhneamh nach féidir bheith ag súil le caighdeán chomh h-árd san mBéarla is a bhí roinnt blian ó shoin.  Mar sin féin múintear an Béarla le h-éifeacht, cé nach múintear an aithriseoracht agus an ghramadach go tuigseanach ina lán scol, agus ní deantar cóimhcheangal idir gramadach na Gaedhilge agus gramadach an Bhéarla.  I gcuid de na scoltacha claoidhtear an iomarca le léigheadh ós árd ins na hárd-ranga i n-ionad na páistí a chur ag tóruigheacht eolais agus smaointe dóibh féin as na leabhraibh.</P>
    <P>Tá scríobhadh an Bhéarla go maith i gcoitchinne cé gur minic go mbíonn dearmhad litrighthe ro-fhairsing sna h-aistí.  Amannta cuirtear na páistí ag scríobhadh ar ádhbhar leamh comónta, agus is annamh a músgailtear samhlaidheacht an pháiste mar ba chóir.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar éadtromú an chláir ní múintear Ailgéabar nó Céimseata de ghnáth ach ins na scoltacha móra do bhuachaillí, agus bhíonn toradh réasúnta maith leis an teagasc i gcoitchinne.</P>
    <P>Múintear an uimhridheacht go sásamhail nó go cuibheasach sásamhail i bhfurmhór na scol.  Tá sé de locht ar an dteagasc i gcuid mhaith scoltacha fós go mbítear ag brath rómhór ar mhianach na dtéacs-leabhar agus go mbíonn an teagasc rótheibidhe <Col N="92" /> agus ró-dheigilte amach ó shaoghal na scoláirí.</P>
    <P>Is beag athrú a tháinig ar thoradh an tsaothair ins na h-ádhbair léighinn eile ó scríodhadh an tuarascabháil deiridh.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt do scéim an dá phúnt, do céad-chuireadh an Scéim seo ar bun sa scoil-bhliadhain 1933-34, agus bhí ar bun arís i gcóir na scoil-bhliadhna 1934-35.</P>
    <P>Ar a shon nach bhfuil ach breis bheag ar dhá bhliadhain ó deineadh an Scéim do chur ós chomhair an phobhail, ní misde a rádh go bhfuil athrughadh tuisciona maidir le labhairt na teangain tagaithe dá barr chun an phobail ins na ceanntracha Gaedhealacha, agus go bhfuil toradh fighanta cheana féin le feidhm na Scéime sin (dá ghiorracht é ó tosnuigheadh lei) chun an Ghaedhilg do chur fé mheas agus í choimeád mar bheo-theangain ins na h-áiteanna Fíor-Ghaedhealacha agus í chur dá labhairt ath-uair i n-áiteanna 'na raibh an Béarla ag gabháil nó gabhtha lastuas di go dtí so.  Tá áiteanna 'na raibh an Béarla le cloisint chomh coitchiannta leis an Ghaedhilg dá bhliadhain ó soin, go bhfuil an Béarla curtha ar ceal anois ionnta agus áiteanna eile gur fánach an uair go dtí le goirid a cloistí an teanga Ghaedhilge ach ó bhéalaibh na sean-daoine, agus anois tá an Ghaedhilg á h-úsáid go coitchiannta mar ghnáth-urlabhra 'na lán tighthe.</P>
    <P>Tá de thoradh na Scéime seo i 12 Scoil-cheanntracha, a áirmhigheadh go dtí so mar Ghaedhealtacht, go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg dá labhairt coitchiannta anois i dtighthe na nadaoine agus go bhfuil sí ag an aos óg ag teacht ar scoil an chéad lá dhóibh.  Áirmhightear anois na scoil-cheanntracha sin mar Ceanntracha Fíor-Ghaedhealacha fé Riaghail 121 de'n Chórus.  Tá ceithre cinn des na scoil-cheanntracha san i dTír Chonaill; ceithre cinn díobh i gConndae na Gaillimhe, trí cinn díobh i gConndae Chiarraighe agus ceann amháin i gConndae Phortláirge.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn comparáid do dhéanamh idir an scéal mar a bhí bliadhain ó shoin agus mar atá anois seo an méid páistí gur tuilleadh an deontas ortha i n-aghaidh na scoil-bhliadhna sin, 1933-34:</P>

    <P>Chífear gur tuilleadh an deontas ar 1,248 páistí bhreise 1934-35 seachas mar ar tuilleadh i 1933-34, agus go bhfuil níos mó ná 10,000 páiste i gceist i mbliadhna.</P>
    <P>Is cúis mhór imnidhe dúinn an oiread sin fear a bheith tréineálta mar oidí ins na bliadhanta deireannacha seo agus gan obair sheasmhach le fagháil aca go fóill ins na Scoltachaí Náisiúnta.  Mar gheall ar sin, laigheaduigheadh líon na mac léighinn i gColáistí na bhFear sa bhliadhain 1935; agus déanfar laigheadú is mó ná sin má meastar é bheith riachtanach chun an scéal do léigheas.</P>
    <P>Tá athrú tábhachtach amháin déanta ar an modh iontrála go dtí an Coláiste Oileamhna ó tugadh na meastacháin isteach anuiridh.  'Séard ba chúis leis seo go bhfuil líon na n-iarrthóirí a thagas isteach ar chomórtas oscailte ag dul i méid ó bhliain go bliain le roinnt bhlianta anuas agus go bhfuil na h-iarrthóirí féin ag dul i bhfeabhas freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá de thoradh air seo anois gur leor ann féin an scrúdú oscailte seo i dteannta scéime na gColáistí Ullmhúcháin leis an méid iarrthóirí a bhéas ag teastáil in aghaidh na bliana chun na háiteacha nach mbeidh curtha in áirithe do Chéimidhthe Ollscoile, do Oidí Conganta Neamh-oilte, etc., a líonadh, agus an scéal mar sin ní bheidh gádh feasta le scéim na Scoláiroidí.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Scrúdú Comórtais Oscailte le gabháil isteach ins na Coláistí Oileamhna agus leis an Scrúdú i gcóir cáilíochta mar Oide Conganta neamh-oilte agus mar fó-Mháighistreás Conganta, 'séard atá sa scrúdú ar a dtugtar &ldquo;Scrúdú Iontrála na gColáistí Oileamhna,&rdquo; scrúdú um Cháisc agus scrúdú na hArd-Teistiméireachta i Mí Mheithimh.</P>
    <P>Táthar sásta i mbliana freisin le méid agus le feabhas na n-iarrathóir a chuireas isteach ar an scrúdú seo.  Is dócha gur toisc an deacracht a bhaineas le posta fháil le cúpla bliain <Col N="94" /> anuas a tháinig laghdú ar an méid fear a chuir isteach ar an scrúdú sa mbliain 1935.  Maidir leis an scéal seo tá fógra tugtha nach mbeidh ach uimhir bheag áit ins na Coláistí Oileamhna sa gcomórtas oscailte bheas ann i Meadhon Foghmhair na bliana 1936 do fheara.</P>
    <P>Leantar i gCurriculum na gColáistí Oileamhna de'n chúrsa a leagadh amach sa gClár nua a tugadh isteach i dtús an tSéisiúin 1932-33.  Is thríd an nGaedhilg a tugtar an teagasc, thríd is thríd, agus 'sí an Ghaedhilg an teanga a labhartar ins na Coláistí go léir, cé's moite de chúpla adhbhar i gColáiste amháin, áit a bhfuil cor neaghnáthach ar an scéal, agus tá súil againn gur cor sealadach é sin.</P>
    <P>I gcás na mac léighinn ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin fritheadh caighdeán an-árd i scrúduighthe na h-Árd-Teistiméireachta agus na Meán-Teistiméireachta ó 1929 go 1934, agus fritheadh an t-árd-chaighheán céadna sa bhliadhain 1935.  Is fiú tagairt a dhéanamh do'n nidh seo; as na 853 de mhic léighinn ó na Coláistí sin a chuaidh faoi Scrúdú Árd-Teistiméireachta na Meán-Scol i rith na sé mbliadhan seo caithte, d'éirigh le 99% díobh pas do ghnóthú, agus d'éirigh le ós cionn 95% díobh pas le h-onóracha do ghnóthú.  Is breágh ion-mholta an toradh é sin.</P>
    <P>Tugadh míniú cheana nuair a bhíodh na meastacháin seo dá bpléidhe ar na scéimeanna speisialta atá i bhfeidhm chun cabhruighthe le mic léighinn bhochta ó'n bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht chun dul le múinteoireacht.</P>
    <P>De thoradh na Scéimeanna seo tá méadú maith tagtha ar an líon iarrthóirí ó na ceanntair sin a chuireas isteach ar an scrúdú le cúpla blian anuas.  Sa mbliain 1935 chuir 360 iarrthóir ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht isteach ar an Scrúdú Iontrála, i gcomparáid le 100 duine chuir isteach ar Scrúdú na bliana 1931.</P>
    <P>B'aoirde meán-chaighdeán na bhfreagraí a thug na hiarrathóirí ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht ag an Scrúdú Iontrála sa mbliain 1935 ná i n-aon bhliain roimhe sin; d'éirigh le 55% an marc cáilíochta a bhaint amach i gcomparáid le 51% sa mbliain 1934 agus le 42% sa mbliain 1933.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Tá an meadhon-tinnreamh ag Scrúduighthe Teastais na mBun-Scol beagáinín fá bhun 11,000 fós, agus tá meadhon-uimhir na bpas beagáinín fá bhun 8,000.  B'iad na neithe ba shásamhla dár bhain le scrúdú na bliadhna 1935 gur mhó de na mic léighinn gur éirigh leo ná sa mbliadhain 1934, cé gur lugha an méid scoláirí a bhí istigh air, agus nach bhféadfaí aon locht d'fhagháil ar an gcuma a ndearnadh an mharcáil, ach amháin i gcorr-chás.  Ach tá an gnáth-thinnreamh gan bheith chómh sásamhail fós agus ba mhaith le duine.  Coimeádann an Príomh-Chómhchoiste (de chigirí agus de mhúinteoirí) caighdeán na marcála fá riaghail, agus ní raibh an oiread céadna teachtaidhthe ar an gcoiste sin agus bhí bliadhanta roimhe seo.</P>

Tá scéimeanna á gcur ar bun i gConntae Chill Dara agus i gConntae Chill Mhanntain, i dtreo go mbeidh scoláireachtaí á n-oibriú ag 26 Cómhairleacha den 31 Chómhairle atá ann ar fad.  Is iad na cúig conntaethe seo leanas na conntaethe nach mbeidh scéimeanna scoláireachta á n-oibriú aca: Conntae Cheatharlach, Conntae an Chláir, Conntae Luimnigh, Conntae na Midhe agus Conntae Phortláirge.</P>
    <P>Bhí 1,590 iomaidhtheoir fá scrúdú sa mbliadhain 1935, i gcomparáid le 1,371 sa mbliadhain 1934, ach thuit an méid ar éirigh leo marc cáilidheachta na scoláireachta do bhaint amach ó 597 go dtí 496.</P>
    <P>Bhí cúig ath-chomhare seascad (65 ath-chomhare) i gcoinne tuarascbhála a rinneadh faoi chigireacht ghenearálta ar obair oidí fá leith.  Bhí naoi gcinn de chruinnighthe ag an mBord Ath-Chomhairc le breith a thabhairt ar na cásanna seo.</P>
    <P>Meán-oideachas.&mdash;Insan scoil-bhliadhain 1934-35 bhí 319 meadhon-scoil ag obair fá'n Roinn, agus 33,499 scoláire ar na rollaí aca.  Is breis de 5 scoil agus de 1,115 scoláire é sin ar uimhreacha na bliadhna 1933-34, agus bhí 3 <Col N="96" /> scoil agus 1,418 scoláire de bhreis ag an mbliadhain sin ar an mbliadhain a ghabh roimpi.  Tá éifeacht sna huimhreacha sin, mar teasbáineann siad an dul ar aghaidh atá á dhéanamh i gcúrsaí Meadhon-Oideachais agus an forfhás atá air le roinnt bhliadhan anuas.</P>
    <P>Is cúrsaí imnidhe don Roinn, ámhthach, go bhfuil scoltacha ann go bhfuil fonn ar lucht scoltacha an iomarca ainmneacha do chur ar na rollaí i gcuid de na ranga, go mór mór na bun-ranga, le tamall anuas.  Do rinneadh iarracht ar é sin do leigheas le cigireacht agus le riarachán, agus cuireadh riaghail nua i Riaghlacha na bliadhna 1934-35 ina gcuirtear i dtuigsint nach measann an Roinn gur leor an fhoireann múinteoireachta chun obair na scoile do dhéanamh má bhíonn oiread san scoláirí in aon rang agus nach féidir an teagasc do dhéanamh go héifeachtamhail.</P>
    <P>Foirgnithe.&mdash;Tá furmhór mór na dtighthe sgoile go breágh fairsing áirgeamhail.  I ngeall ar líon na ndaltaí do bheith ag dul i méid tá roinnt mhaith sgol arbh éigin foirgnithe nuadha a thóigeáil ionnta le cúpla bliadhain anuas, agus is mór an chreideamhaint do lucht ceannais na sgol sin an chaoi a ndeárnadh an obair.</P>
    <P>Gléas agus fearras.&mdash;Maidir le gléas agus fearras is mó cloistear clamhsán faoi na trí hádhbhair seo ná faoi ádhbhair ar bith eile&mdash;Stair, Tíreolaidheacht, Tráchtáil.  Tá roinnt mhaith sgoltach gan na fearaistí riachtanacha ionnta leis na hádhbhair sin do theagasg sa cheart&mdash;iliomad léarsgáileann, cairteacha, trodáin, &amp;rl.</P>
    <P>Leabhra agus leabharlanna.&mdash;Do réir a chéile tá lucht stiúrtha na sgol ag glacadh leis an mbaramhail gur mór amach an chabhair don teagasg leabharlann mhaith de leabhraí creideamhnacha ughdarásacha bheith ar fagháil i ngach sgoil, agus is ar éigin má tá sgoil ar bith anois gan iarraidh éigin bheith déanta ar leabharlann a chur le chéile innte.</P>
    <P>I gcuid de na sgoltacha ceaptar gurbh am amudha an t-am a chaithfeadh daltaí ar léightheóireacht ghinearálta, agus uime sin ní spreagtar iad chun feidhm cheart do bhaint as an leabharlainn, agus ní tugtar dóthain ama dóibh le sin a dheanamh, ach tá <Col N="97" /> sgoltacha den chineál sin ag dul i dteirce i n-aghaidh na bliadhna.</P>
    <P>An Ghaedhilg.&mdash;Tá an Ghaedhilg ag breith léi ó bhliadhain go bliadhain, ach tá dhá ní a mbudh deacair do mhúinteoirí agus do dhaltaí nár tóigeadh le Gaedhilge a dtabhairt leo sa cheart&mdash;an fhoghraidheacht agus dúthchas na teangadh.  Tá an fhoghraidheacht ag feabhsú go mór ach tá puinntí áithride ina mbíonn sí lochtach ar uairibh go fóill.  Is fíor go dtéigheann a lán de na múinteoirí'un na Gaedhealtachta gach bliadhain agus go mbíonn a bheag nó a mhór de chainnteoirí dúthchais i gcuid de na sgoltacha.  Ach do réir chosamhlachta níor tugadh aghaidh i gceart ar dheacrachtaí na foghraidheachta go dtí seo.  Is beag sgoil 'na mbíonn <i>r chaol</i> sa gceart aca, ná <i>ng</i>, ná <i>ch</i> ná na leithreacha dúbalta (ll, nn), agus is minic na múinteoirí féin gach uile phioc chomh faillightheach leis na daltaí.  Daltaí a tóigeadh le Béarla ní thabharfaidh siad na fuaimeanna sin leo go deo gan an-chuid teagaisg agus taithighe.  Bheirtear fá deara, freisin, go mbíonn an Ghaedhilg lag tanaidhe agus dul an Bhéarla uirthe ina lán de na sgoltacha.</P>
    <P>Níor mhór a thuigsint go mbíonn dúthchas ar leith ag gabháil le gach teangaidh agus dá réir sin go bhfuil a bhealach nádúrtha féin ag an nGaedhilgeoir le oidheam nó smaoineadh a chur i dtuigsint.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir teacht ar an mbealach nádúrtha sin gan tréimhse réasúnta fada a chaitheamh san nGaedhealtacht agus san am gcéadna staidéar doimhin a dhéanamh ar litridheacht na Gaedhilge, go háithrid ar na leabhraí atá sgríobhtha ag cainnteoirí dúthchais an lae indiú.</P>
    <P>Tá nós ag teacht chun cinn i gcuid de na sgoltacha .i. socrú a dhéanamh chun sgata maith de na daltaí a chur 'un na Gaedhealtachta gach bliadhain. Ba bhreágh an sgéal dá leathnuigheadh an nós sin amach ar na sgoltacha uilig, nó dá bhféadfaí gluaiseacht mhór a bhunú a mbéadh ina chuspóir aice an t-aos óg a chur tamall chuig an nGaedhealtacht sul má fhágann siad na meadhon-sgoltacha.  Chuirfeadh sé sin an chloch mhullaigh ar an obair ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tá ag éirghe go maith leis na lánchúrsaí, agus ag na Sgrúduighthe i Mí</P>

    <P>Bhí méadú, freisin, ar an líon páipéar a freagruigheadh i nGaedhilge.</P>
    <P>Le roinnt bhliadhain anuas tá sé de ghnás ag cuid mhaith de na scoltacha drámaí Gaedhilge do thabhairt do na mic léighinn chun staidéar do dhéanamh ortha agus iad do léiriú, agus bhí a leithéid sin de dheaghthoradh ar an obair sin gur cheap an Roinn cigire sealadach chun timthireacht do dhéanamh agus chun treoir do thabhairt do bhainisteoirí agus do mhúinteoirí.  Thug sé congnamh dhóibh chun cluichí feileamhnacha do thoghadh agus chun na deacreachtaí a bhain leis an léiriú do réidhteach.</P>
    <P>Ná hábhair léighinn. &mdash; Do réir chosamhlachta is beag dúthracht a caithtear le foghraidheacht na nuadhtheangthach, Frainncis agus Gearmáinis ins na sgoltacha, agus is beag de na teangthacha sin a léightear taobh amuigh de'n téacs a bhíos dá léigheamh san ranng.</P>
    <P>Ghníthear obair mhaith san Matamaitic i sgoltacha na mbuachaillí agus tá ag méadú ar an líon daltaí as na sgoltacha sin a thóigeas an Cúrsa Onórach san Árd-Teistiméireacht.  I sgoltacha sin na gcailíní is beag athrú a tháinig de bharr na ngearr-chúrsaú san méid a bhaineas le modha múinte ná leis an méid oibre a ghníthear.  I gcuid mhaith de na sgoltacha sin séard a ghníthear ná leanamhaint den lán-chúrsa san rang agus annsin tóigeann na daltaí páipéar an ghearr-chúrsa san sgrúdú.</P>
    <P>Múintear an Stair agus an Tíreolaidheacht go maith i bhfromhór mór <Col N="99" /> na sgoltach.  Is minic, ámhthach, a gheibhtear amach ins na sgrúduighthe go mbíonn freagraí de ghlainmheabhair ag na daltaí sa Stair, agus is minic a chuirid féin giotaí beaga isteach a theasbáineas nach dtuigeann siad ar chor ar bith an stuif a bhíos de ghlain-mheabhair aca.  I gcás na Tíreolaidheachta sé an taobh Matamaiticeach de'n ádhbhar is lugha a ndéantar cúram de ins na sgoltacha.</P>
    <P>Tá bail an-mhaith ar theagasg na Laidne agus na Gréigise i gcuid de na sgoltacha.  Is beag sgoil, ámhthach in a gcaithtear dúthracht mar budh cheart le Stair na Gréige ná le Stair na Róimhe, agus is annamh baintear an fheidhm cheart as an Stair ná as an litridheacht le saoghal na ndaoine san am sin do léiriú do na daltaí.  Tá roinnt sgoltach nár thoisigh ar an Laidin go dtí le goirid; táid sin ag dul ar aghaidh go maith, ach amháin go luightear ro-mhór ar Ghramadaigh agus ar Cheapadóireacht ionnta agus ní deintear dóthain den Laidin a léigheamh.</P>
    <P>Do réir chéadchodáin is mó de na cailíní ná de na buachaillí a thóigeas Eolaidheacht mar ádhbhar ins na sgoltacha.  Formhór mór na gcailíní a thóigeas Eolaidheacht sé an Fearachas Tighe a thógaid, agus dár ndóigh sin mar is ceart é.  Tá sé le tabhairt fá deara ar an obair ins na sgoltacha agus ar an bhfreagairt ins na sgrúduighthe go bhfuil faillighe dá dhéanamh le goirid anuas san saothar praitieeamhail.</P>
    <P>Cé go múintear ceol go maith ina lán de na sgoltacha, go háithrid ins na Clochair, is beag dalta a thóigeas an Ceol mar ádhbhar ins na sgrúduighthe sgríobhtha.  An beagán a tóigeas e eirigheann go rí-mhaith leo.</P>
    <P>Tá an Roinn ag cuimhneamh le tamall ar athchóiriú do dhéanamh ar Chlár Oibre na Meadhon-Scol i gcaoi agus gur mhóide an rogha ádhbhar a bheadh ag na scoltacha, agus chun na Riaghalacha i gcoitchinne do shimpliú. Dála an scéil sin, do mhol an Roinn, i Mí Nodlag, 1935, neithe áirithe chun an clár do leasú, do Chumainn éagsamhla bainisteoirí agus múinteoirí, agus do hiarradh ortha a dtuairimí ina dtaoibh sin do chur in iúl.</P>
    <P>Ceárd Oideachas. &mdash;Tháinig a thuillcadh fáis agus éifeachta san Oideachas <Col N="100" /> leanúnach agus sa Cheárd-Oideachas ins an tSeisiún seo caithte 1934-5. Foscladh scoltachaí nua i n-áiteacha, agus i n-áiteacha eile rinneadh méadú ar na scoltachaí a bhí ann cheana. Cuireadh a thuilleadh múinteóir i geionn teagaisc&mdash;rud a b'éigean a dhéanamh le riar do'n fhás a tháinig ar na ranganna.  Ceannuigheadh a thuilleadh feistis agus oirnéise scoile le h-aghaidh na scoltach san do réir mar bhí riachtanach.  D'aindeoin a bhfuiltear a chur 'á dtógáil de scoltachaí nua, tá ceanntair ann gan aon scoil de'n chineál fós, agus tá na daoine ag iarraidh ar na Coistí GairmOideachais scoltachaí do chur ar fagháil ionnta.  Tá tuigsint ag an bpobal i gcoitchinne anois ar a thábhachtaighe atá sé scéim ceart CeárdOideachais agus Oideachais leanúnaigh a bheith ar fagháil agus tá tuigsint aca freisin ar an sochar a thig as dóibh siúd atá ar lorg oibre agus do na daoine atá ag obair cheana.  Tá iarraidh níos mó ag teacht ar an oideachas seo ins na ceanntair tuaithe; agus is maith céillidhe an obair atá dhá déanamh ag furmhór na gCoiste tuaithe leis an riachtanas a fhreastal.  Furmhór na gCoiste, tá siad díbhfeirgeach dlúthasamhail; cuireann siad an tsuim cheart ins an obair atá faoi n-a stiúir, agus ní mór leó airgead do caitheamh ar scéimeanna a chuirfeadh an t-oideachas chun cinn mar ba cheart.</P>
    <P>De ghnáth, bheir na Coistí seo roinnt mhaith fhial de scoláireachtaí chun na Gaedhealtachta, agus bheir a lán aca scoláireachtaí uatha chun na Scoltacha Comhnuighthe le h-aghaidh Tioghbhais. I gConndae na Gaillimhe agus i gConndae Luimnigh, tá scéimeanna scoláireacht ann chun mic léighinn tuaithe a chur chuig Ceárd-scoltacha na gCathrach, an áit a mbíonn áiseanna agus gléasaí nach mbéadh sa bhaile aca.  Obair an-tábhachtach í sin, agus ba chóir féachaint le n-a leitheid a dhéanamh i n-áiteacha eile.  I gConndae Chille Dara agus ins an Trian Theas de Thiobrad Árann cuireadh mic léighinn as ceanntair chúil chuig scoltacha ina bhfaigheadh siad oideachas ní b'aoirde ná b'fhéidir a thabhairt sa bhaile dóibh.  I gConndae Mhuigh Eó rinneadh a thairgsint le déidheanaighe go gcuirfidhe ceithre scoláireachtaí ar bun chun congnamh do thabhairt do na mic <Col N="101" /> léighinn ins na scoltacha le dul le printíseacht i n-obair innealltóireacht gluaisteáin; agus i gConndaethe eile, freisin, bhíothas ag lorg eolais fá scéimeanna de'n tsaghas chéadna.</P>
    <P>Ins na Conndae-bhuirgí agus ins na bailte móra tá eagar maith curtha ar na Cúrsaí leanúnacha.  Na Scéimeanna Oideachais atá ceaptha ins na h-áiteacha san, fágann siad cuid mhór cúrsáí ag na mic léighinn le rogha a bhaint asta; agus bíonn na cúrsaí sin orreamhnach do'n Cheanntar, maidir le h-oideachas i gcoitchinne agus le h-oideachas Tionnscalach.  Mar gheall ar Chúrsaí Leanúnacha atá oireamhnach a bheith curtha ar fagháil ins na cathracha, agus fós mar gheall ar na scoltacha nua a cuireadh ar bun, tá líon na mac léighinn ag méadú go mór mar is léir ó na figiúirí le h-aghaidh na bliadhna 1934-35.</P>
    <P>Ta scoltacha i mórán áiteacha, agus mar gheall ar iad bheith ró-bheag agus mar gheall ar laighead na múinteóir, ní féidir go leór cúrsa oireamhnach bheith ionnta.  Ins na ceanntair tuaithe go mór atá sin amhlaidh, ach tá furmhór na gCoiste Gairm-Oideachais ag brath féacháil leis an deacracht sin a réidhteach.  Is maith an comhartha a lán tairgsint bheith déanta ag na Coistí chun scoltacha dhá sheomra nó scoltacha thrí seomra a chur ar fagháil i n-áiteacha tuaithe. Is deacair múinteóirí oilte foirbhthe d'fhagháil chun Tuaith-Eolaidheacht agus ádhbhair eile de'n chineál sin do mhúineadh.  Ar an adhbhar sin tá cúrsaí curtha ar bun ag an Roinn chun múinteóirí d'oileamhaint ins na h-adhbhair léighinn sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí leanúnacha a bhíonn ar siubhal i rith an lae, tá ag éirghe go maith leo.  Ins na scoltacha nua sa Chaisleán Nua agus i n-Ospidéal Ghleann Áine i gCo.  Luimnighe, cuireadh ar bun cúrsaí a d'oirfeadh go speisialta do'n tuaith; agus cuireadh píosaí talaimh ar fagháil chun cleachtadh na h-oibre féin a thabhairt do na mic léighinn mar aon leis an gcleachtadh sa tsaotharlainn agus leis an teagase eile a bhí le fagháil ins na ranga ar chúrsaí Tuaith-eolaidheachta. An clár oibre atá i bhfeidhm sa scoil nua a foscladh i mBuidheachair, an seisiún seo caithte, tá sé curtha i n-oireamhaint go speisialta do'n tuaith, freisin.  Bhain na mic léighinn <Col N="102" /> úsáid mhaith as an bpíosa talaimh atá ag gabháil leis an scoil chun glasraí agus barraí gráin do chur ar fagháil. I nDún Seachlainn tugadh teagasc i gcoinneáil éanlaithe agus i gcoinneáil beach&mdash;rud a chuir go mór le h-éifeacht an chúrsa le h-aghaidh na tuaithe.  Tá roinnt mhaith talaimh ag an scoil seo, agus tá cáil ag éirghe uirthi mar gheall ar an méid cineál barr a baintear de'n talamh san.  An scoil atá i n-Ath Fhirdiadh i gCo.  Lughmhaidh, tá sí ag obair go maith agus bíonn mic léighinn go leor le fagháil aici.</P>
    <P>Roimhe seo níor bh'fhuras cailíní fhagháil le freastal a dhéanamh ar na ranganna lán-aimsire i rith an lae le h-aghaidh cúrsaí Tioghbhais; ach tá an deacracht sin ag imtheacht do réir a chéile.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag tabhairt isteach modhanna nua chun cabhruighthe leis na mic léighinn ins na scoltacha is fearr eagar. I dtéarma na Cásca sa bhliadhain 1934-5, rinneadh a leithéid seo i gCeárd-Scoil Ráth Maonais.  Na mic léighinn a raibh an t-árd-chúrsa leanúnach i dTráchtáil ar siubhal aca, thug na múinteóirí leo iad go bhfaca siad an obair a bhí ar siubhal i gcuid de na foirgnimh mhóra Tionnscail agus Tráchtála.  Tugadh iad chuig na h-áiteacha so leanas:&mdash;Scéala Eireann, Messrs.  Willwood, Messrs. Jacob and Co., an t-Irish Independent, Monarchain Tobac Mhessrs.  Wills', agus Monarchain Gallúnaigh Mhessrs. Lever. Is mór a chuidigheas cuairteanna mar sin le tréineáil na scoláire; agus, aon áit ar féidir é, is ceart cuairteanna de'n chineál a chur ar bun&mdash;go h-áirighthe i n-ionaid i n-a bhfuil aon tionnscal tábhachtach ar bun.</P>
    <P>De thoradh socruighthe a rinneadh leis an Príomh-Oide i Scoil na Tráchtála i gCathair Chorcaighe, tugadh buidheanta de na mic léighínn as an scoil sin ar cuairt chun na leabharlainne.</P>
    <P>Ins na cathracha agus ins na bailte móra is fiú suim a chur i n-oibriú na mBureau Feadhmanais; óir, do réir na dtuarascabháil atá ar fagháil, tá méadú ag teacht gach bliadhain ar an méid postaí atá le fagháil ag scoláirí oilte thríid an meadhon san.  Deir eigire amháin go bhfuil &ldquo;obair antábhachtach dá déanamh sa tslighe seo i gConndae Choreaighe.&rdquo; I n-a lán áiteach i n-ar cuireadh gluaiseachtaí <Col N="103" /> tionnscalacha ar bun, bhí na Príomh-Oifigigh Feidhmiúcháin agus na h-Ard-Mhaighistrí ar na daoine ba mhó a chuir suim sna gluaiseachtaí sin agus a ba mhó a thug congnamh uatha.</P>
    <P>Is léir ó thuarascabhála na gcigirí gur hárduigheadh caighdeán an teagaisg i rith an tSeisiuin 1934-35, go háirithe sna Ranganna leanúna lae. Cuirtear ina leith seo múinteoirí níos fearr cáilíocht agus oileamhaint a bheith á gceapadh, an chóir scoile agus saoráidí na scoile go generálta a bheith níos fearr, na múinteoirí a bheith níos cúramaighe ag ullamhú na hoibre, agus na daltaí a bheith ag freastal níos féilteamhla.  Tá tagairt déanta ag na cigirí go léir dó seo.  Ní amháin sna bailte móra ach sna hionaid níos lugha ná sin mar atá le fáil i gContae Chorcaighe, i gContae Mhuigheó agus i gContae Shligigh níorbh annamh na daltaí go léir i láthair an lá bhí an cigire ar cuairt ann, agus is iomdha áit a raibh meán-tinnreamh de 90% agus os a chionn sin ann ar feadh an tSeisiuin.  Gríosann an freastal riaghalta fiú an gnáth-mhúinteoir chun breis dúthrachta a chaitheamh leis an obair.</P>
    <P>Tá tuarascabháil ghenarálta ann go bhfuil múinteoireacht mhaith éifeachtach dhá dhéanamh sna hábhair obair láimhe sna ranganna lae agus sna ranganna tráthnóna.</P>
    <P>An teagase a tugadh i dTigheas bhí sé go maith éifeachtach arís.</P>
    <P>Sna scoltacha fá'n dtuaith ní tugtar dóthain aire do chócaireacht ar theine mhóna.  Ba cheart gach dícheall a dhéanamh chun a mholadh do na daltaí teine mhóna a úsáid le haghaidh cócaireachta, go háirithe sna ceanntracha ina ndeintear bunáite na cócaireachta sa mbaile ar theine mhóna.</P>
    <P>Sa mbeagán scoltacha a bhfuil múinteoirí cáilighthe re tuaitheoluíocht ionnta, múineadh an t-ábhar sin go maith.  Is léir ó'n difridheacht atá idir an obair a deintear in áiteacha seachas a chéile nach foláir giota maith talmhan a úsáid le haghaidh curadóireachta.</P>
    <P>De thoradh na gCúrsaí Samhraidh a chuir an Roinn ar bun tá an ghleacaidheacht anois ar churriculum furmhór na scol leanúna lae.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas&mdash;cidh mall&mdash;ag teacht ar obair na Gaedhilge i scéimeanna Oideachais Ghairme Beatha.  Bhí sé sin <Col N="104" /> le tabhairt fá deara go minic i geaitheamh an tSeisiuin 1934-35.</P>
    <P>Tá toradh cinnte le feiceál cheana ar an rialachán atá i bhfeidhm nach mór do mhúinteoirí Tráchtála, Eoluíochta, Tighis agus Ealadhna labhairt na Gaedhilge a bhieth go maith aca sara bhféadfar iad a bhuan-cheapadh ina bpostanna.</P>
    <P>Deir na Cigirí ina dtuarascabhála gur léir go bhfuil labhairt na Gaedhilge lasmuigh den mhúinteoireacht ag dul ar aghaidh.  I gcuid de na scoltacha lasmuigh den Ghaedhealtacht ní labhrann na daltaí ach an Ghaedhilg nuair a bhíd ag súgradh ag sos an mheadhoin lae.  Dúthracht agus dul 'un cinn na múinteoirí a thug an deaghobair seo chun críche.  Tá go leór múinteoirí eile ann a bhfuil a ndóthain Gaedhilge aca le bheith páirteach sa ngluaiseacht seo, ach nach bhfaca fós gur breágh an modh múinte é seo taobh amuigh d'obair na scoile agus gur féidir an-dul ar aghaidh a dhéanamh ar an dóigh seo.</P>
    <P>Is beag Scéim Oideachais Ghairme Beatha anois ann nach bhfuil feidhm dá baint as an nGaedhilg innti maidir le saoghal agus caitheamh aimsire na ndaltaí.</P>
    <P>Tugann furmhór na gCoistí Oideachais Ghairme Beatha roinnt mhaith scoláireachtaí Gaedhealtachta.  De thoradh na scoláreacht seo chaith ós cionn 450 dalta mí sa nGaedhealtacht i rith an tSamhraidh 1935.  Is mór an rath ar na Scéimeanna na Scoláireachtaí Gaedhealtachta, mar cuireann siad cainteoirí Gaedhilge ar fáil don aos óg agus is mór is fiú gach cainteoir aca sin ina cheanntar féin leis an nGaedhilg a chur ar aghaidh i gcúrsaí saoghail na ndaoine.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí na Meastacháin dá gcur ós comhair an Tighe agam anuraidh dubhras gur cuireadh Buan-Choiste Scoile ar bun chun comhairle a thabhairt maidir le Scoil Ealadhna na hArd-Chathrach. Ina theanta sin rinne an Coiste infhiúcadh cúramach ar na curricula atá ag Scoltacha Ealadhna tíortha eile agus ar riachtanaisí na tíre seo i gcúrsaí Oideachais Ealadhna. Nuair a bhí na fiosrúcháin sin críochnuighthe ag an gCoiste chuireadar Tuarascabháil fá mo bhráid dhá mholadh ath-chóirin iomlán a dhéanamh ar Scoil Ealadhna na hArd-Chathrach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> Deirtear sa Tuarascabháil gurb é tuairim chinnte an Choiste go raibh sé thar am scoil don náisiún in ionad scoil don chathair a dhénamh den Scoil Ealadhna, agus nár mhór, chun go bhféadfaí an fheidhm cheart a bhaint as an Scoil, Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealadhna a dhéanamh de a bhéarfadh teastais amach i gceithre príomhscoltacha:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Gréasa i dTionnscal,</P>
    <P>(b)  Péintéireacht,</P>
    <P>(c)  Snoigheadóireacht,</P>
    <P>(d)  Rionnaidheacht agus Maisiú.</P>
    <P>Mholadar na trí scoil tosaigh a ghléasadh amach láithreach ach gan an Scoil Rionnaidheachta agus Maisighte a ghléasadh go mbeadh eolas de bharr taithighe againn ó na trí cinn eile.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Coiste freisin an Coláiste nua Ealadhna do chur fá stiúradh an Ard-mháistír atá anois ann, agus ollamh agus príomh-chongantóir a bheith ag gach ceann de na ceithre scoltacha.  Moladh post lán-aimsire a dhéanamh de phost an Ollamhan le Gréasa agus dualgaisí leasárdmháistir a chur air ina theanta sin. Postanna páirt-aimsire a bheadh cead ag hollamhain eile agus bheadh ag na gach Ollamh aca leanamhaint dá shaothar tuistigheachta féin i gcaoi go mbeadh aige mar mhúinteoir úghdarás Ealadhna nach mbíodh ag na Máistirí Ealadhna a ceaptaí roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Ta glactha agam leis na molta seo agus tá obair an ath-chóirighthe ar siubhal dá réir.  Táthar ag súil go mbeidh an chéad Scoil díobh seo ag obair i nDeire Foghmhair, 1936, agus go mbeidh prospectus an Choláiste nua le fáil fá Bhealtaine.  Cúrsa trí mblian a bhéas ann le haghaidh an Teastais.  Ní mór d'iarrthóirí na cúrsaí teagaise a fhreastal go féilteamhail agus na Scrúduighthe ceanntseisiúin riachtanacha a sheasamh sara bhfuighid an Teastas.</P>
    <P>Tá an Coiste ag gabháil anois do scrúdú nithe eile bhaineas leis an gColáiste Náisiúnta Ealadhna a chomhghléasadh.  Táthar le iarrachtaí a dhéanamh le ceangal a dhéanamh idir an teagase a tugtar ins na scoltacha eile Ealadhna sa tSaorstát, agus chun oileamhaint a sholáthar i geúrsaí Ealadhna a dhéanfas maitheas d'obair na Meadhon-Scol agus na gCeárd-Scol.</P>
    <P>An Coiste Eadar-roinne a bhí ag <Col N="106" /> gabháil do cheist Aois fágála na Scoile a árdú thugadar tuarascabháil d'aon aonta uatha. Toise go raibh achmaireacht den tuarascabhail seo ar na páipéirí nuachta cheana ní gádh dom an mion-eolas a thabhairt annseo.</P>
    <P>'Se tuairim a bhí ag an gCoiste tar éis an scéil go léir a bhreithniú nach ceart acis fágála na scoile a árdú thar mar is gádh i láthair na huaire go fóill, ach amháin i gcúpla ceanntar a bheadh oireamhnach chun triail a bhaint asta ar dtús.  Chuige sin táthar tar éis roimh-fhiosruighthe a dhéanamh agus nuair a bhéas gach ullamhú riachtanach déanta cuirfear na trialacha a mhol an Coiste i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Scoileanna Ceartughcháin agus Scoileanna Saothair.&mdash;Tá 54 de na scoltacha seo ann: 2 Scoil Cheartughcháin (ceann aca do bhuachaillí agus ceann eile do chailíní); 32 Scoil Saothair (11 cheann do bhuachaillí sinnsir agus 5 cinn do bhuachaillí sóisir deich mbliadhan nó fá n-a bhun); 35 scoil do chailíní, agus scoil measctha (do chailíní agus do bhuachaillí sóisir).</P>
    <P>Bhí 81 duine ar coimeád sna Scoltacha Ceartughcháin i ndeire na scoilbhliadhna 1934, agus 96 sa mbliadhain 1935&mdash;sin 15 duine de bhreis.  Do cuireadh níos mó daoine isteach ionnta sa mbliadhain 1935, freisin; cuireadh 28 isteach sa mbliadhain 1934 agus 45 sa mbliadhain 1935.  A mhalairt sin de thuarascabháil atá ar na Scoltacha Saothair; do thuit an méid a cuireadh isteach ó 748 sa mbliadhain 1934 go 681 sa mbliadhain 1935; agus do thuit an méid a bhí ar coimeád ó 6,420 go 6,227 sna bliadhanta céadna.  Sé an fáth is mó a gcuirtear daoine isteach sna scoltacha sin go mbíonn siad dealbh bocht agus nach mbíonn aoinne aca thabharfadh aire dhóibh; ach do réir deallraimh tá uimhir na ndaoine a cuirtear isteach toisc coir do bheith déanta aca ag dul i méid.</P>
    <P>Múintear ádhbhair den Eolaidheacht Tighis i scoltacha na gcailíní; múintear feirméaracht agus gáirneoireacht agus ceárda éagsamhla do na buachaillí; agus déantar gach iarracht an obair oireamhnach do sholáthar do na daltaí chun a mbeatha do thuilleamh nuair bítear á scaoileadh as an scoil.</P>
    <P>Tá an Coimisiún a cuireadh ar bun go luath sa mbliadhain 1934 chun Córas na Scol Ceartughcháin agus na Scol Saothair d'infhiúchadh, tá sé ag cóiriú <Col N="107" /> a thuarascabhála fá láthair, agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh an tuarascabháil sin ar fagháil gan ró-mhoill.</P>
    <P>An Músaeum Náisiúnta.&mdash;D'éirigh go maith agus go han-rathamhail le obair an Mhúsaeum Náisiúnta i rith na bliadhna atá fá léir-mheas againn.  Ní hamháin go raibh rath ar obair an ghnáth-dhíoghlama, agus ar an athchóiriú a rinneadh ar an gcóras oibre, agus ar an iarracht atá á dhéanamh chun obair an Mhúsaeum do chongbháil ar chóimhchéim leis an obair a atá ar siubhal ag náisiuin eile, ach d'éirigh go rathmhar leis an obair a chuir an Músaeum ar bun ar fud na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Tá aidhmeanna móra beartuighthe ag Oifig na n-Oibreacha Puiblidhe chun Teach ionadaidhe an Rí do chur i gcóir chun cuid de na rudaí d'oirfeadh don teach sin d'aistriú ón Músaeum agus do chur i gcoimeád ann&mdash;rud a d'fhóirfeadh go mór ar an gcumhangracht slighe atá sa teach atá i Sráid Chill Dara.</P>
    <P>Tiocfaidh de thoradh ar an aistriú sin gur féidir na teasbáintaisí do leagadh amach i seomraí do réir Ré, chun go bhféadfar an fhorbairt a tháinig ar an gcultúr ó ré go ré den stair d'fheicsint go soiléir, in ionad na rudaí do chur ar teasbáint do réir feidhme nó úsáide, mar do-ghnítí roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Do frítheadh a lán rudaí do Roinn na Sean-iarsmaí Eireannacha, agus do frítheadh rudaí, freisin, don Roinn Ealadhan agus Tionnscail agus do Roinn na Luibh agus na mBeothach go raibh fáilte rómpa.  Tháinig an bhreis deontas-i-gcabhair do vótáil an tOireachtas an bhliain airgeadais seo caithte, tháinig sé díreach in am chun an Músaeum do chur ag feidhmiú ar an gcuma bhí ceaptha dhó.</P>
    <P>Na tochaltáin mhóra do rinneadh go healadhanta agus go riaghalta in áiteanna éagsamhla ar fud na tíre fá'n Mion-Scéim Fóithne ar Dhíomhaointeas b'iad ba bhuan le furmhór na rudaí a fuarthas do Roinn na Seaniarsmaí Eireannacha.  Tá cóir bhailiughcháin na sean-iarsmaí sin ag dul i bhfeabhas ó ló go ló, agus is é an díograis saothair agus an cúram atá á dhéanamh ag lucht stiúrtha an Mhúsaeum díobh is fáth leis an bhfeabhas sin, mar is ar éigin is féidir <Col N="108" /> a rádh go bhfaghtar iarsma ar bith anois nach bhfaghann siad eolas ina thaoibh.</P>
    <P>Agus admhuigheann siad go buidheach beannachtach gur mór ar fad an congnamh a gheibheann siad ó na Gárdaí Síothchána.  Ní mór a admháil, freisin, go bhfaghthar cuid mhaith de na sean iarsmaí tré aireachas na n-innealltóirí atá ag obair do Bhórd Soláthair an leictreachais.</P>
    <P>Do frítheadh a lán luibh-iarsmaí, freisin, do Roinn na Luibh agus na mBeothach.</P>
    <P>Tar éis an cnuasach d'ath-chóiriú b'é an rud ba mhó spéis ar fad b'fhéidir, ná oscailt na rannóige seo ina bhfuil na hiarsmaí ó ghluaiseacht Saoirseachta na hEireann.  Is féidir do dhuine tuairim na ndaoine ar an rannóig seo do mheas ón méid mhóir díobh a théigheas ann chun na hiarsmaí d'fheicsint.  Tá an cnuasach so ag dul i méid ó ló go ló, agus ní foláir breis slighe do dhéanamh dho. Rinneadh slighe dho i Roinn na SeanIarsmaí Eireannacha, ach ó's cosamhail go leanfar de chur leis táthar ag súil go bhfaghfar áit do i dteach éigin níos oireamhnaighe i mball éigin eile den chathair.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a rinneadh i rith na bliadhna a bhfuil mór-thábhacht ann is eadh an obair a rinne Coiste Taighdthe na Ré Ceathardha in Eirinn.  Tá an coiste sin ag obair ar dhluth-chómhar leis an Músaeum Náisiúnta.  Thárla go dtáinig portaigh áirithe i seilbh an Mhúsaeum le déidheannaighe, agus do rinneadh bun de na rudaí a frítheadh sna portaigh sin.  Do rinneadh mionchuardach i ndachad éigin ionad seandálaidheachta agus i gcúig cinn fhichead ionaid tlachteolaidheachta agus seanluibheolaidheachta chun ádhbhar d'fhagháil le taithbheach do dhéanamh ar pháilín planndaí ionnus go bhféadfaí scéim mhuinighneach chroiniceach do cheapadh le n-a bhfaghfaí eolus ar na cora a tháinig ar aoráid, ar luibheanna, ar thlacht agus ar chúrsaí seandálaidheachta na tíre le linn gach ré dá dtáinig ó árd-ré an leac-oighridh anuas.</P>

      <P>Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais, is ar éigin is gábha a rádh go dtugadh eolus iomlán ar gach Roinn <Col N="109" /> de Mhúsaeum do na fiosruightheoirí iomadamhla a tháinig ann; agus, i gcaoi agus go neartóchtaí ar chomhar an Mhúsaeum leis na scoltacha, do chuir an Roinn cearcalach amach go dtí Ard-Mháigistrí agus Bainisteoirí na Scol 'ghá iarraidh ortha caoi a cheapadh do na leanbhaí chun cuairt do thabhairt ar an Músaeum Náisiúnta agus ar thighthe eile den tsórt chéadna in Ath Cliath ina mbeadh eolus le fagháil aca.</P>
      <P>De bharr saothair Bhrainnse na bhFoillsiúchán tá uimhir na leabhar Gaedhilge, idir théics-leabhair agus leabhair léightheóireachta, ag dul i méid go tapaidh.  Tá téics-leabhair ar áireamh, ar Ailgéabar, ar Chéimseatain, ar Cheól, ar Stair agus ar Thíreoluíocht na hEireann, ar Stair na hEorpa, ar Fhuagháil, ar Laidin, ar Ghréigis, agus ar Thuatheoluíocht, foillsighthe fé scéim na Roinne cheana féin, agus táthar ag ullmhú téics-leabhair ar Fhisic, ar Ghramadach agus Ceapadóireacht na Laidne agus na Gréigise, ar Ghramadach na Nua-Ghaedhilge, ar Chéimseatain Choimhóirnidhtheach, ar Cheól, ar Eolaidheacht, agus tuilleadh leabhar at Stair na hEireann, leabhair ar theagase creidimh agus ar chruthughadh an chreidimh agus eagráin scoile do théics-leabhair Laidne agus Gréigise.</P>
      <P>Táthar ag dul ar aghaidh go seasmhach le leabhra Gaedhilge seachas na téics-leabhair.</P>
      <P>Tá suas le 1,000 scríbhinní i mbuncheapadóireacht breithnighthe ag an Roinn Oideachais ó cuireadh an scéim seo ar bun i 1926; agus do chuir an Roinn níos mó ná dhá chéad leabhar dá n-aistriú.</P>
      <P>Bhí cuid mhaith den bhun-adhbhar neamh-oireamhnach agus b'eigean é do chur ar ais chun na n-ughdar; ach is cóir a rádh nár diúltuigheadh d'aon scríbhinn agus nár glacadh le haon scríbhinn gan léirmheas fhagháil air ó bheirt ar a laighead; agus gur léigh triúr nó ceathrar cuid mhaith aca sul a tugadh breith ortha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do chuir an Roinn trí iomaidheachta i n-aistriú go Gaedhilge ar bun; agus do bronnadh duaiseanna ar na haistriúcháin a b'fhearr; agus bhí sé de thoradh ar na hiomaideachta sin go raibh sé ar a chumas na Roinne tuilleadh leabhar do chur dá n-aistriú go hiomlán.  Tá 240 láimhscríbhinní ar <Col N="110" /> láimh ag an Roinn fé láthair.  Díobh siúd tá 130 ag na clódóirí agus 110 dá n-ullamhughadh do na clódóirí.</P>
    <P>Rudaí eile atá déanta fén Scéim: a iarraidh ar scríbhneoirí Gaedhilge comh-oibriughadh leis an Roinn chun leabhair bheaga a bheadh oireamhnach do leanbhaí óga do chur ar fagháil. Foillsigheadh ocht geinn déag de na leabhair beaga so go dtí seo, tá tuilleadh aca á n-ullmhughadh. Tugadh duais £20 ar an gcnuasacht is fearr de Shean-fhocla is de Shean-Ranna Chonnacht.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas ar an Roinn gur féidir a rádh go bhfuil méadughadh ag teacht i n-aghaidh an lae ar an uimhir léightheoirí, ní amháin ins na scoileanna, ach i measc na ndaoine i gcoitchinne.  Díoladh breis agus 250,000 cóip de sna leabhra a foillsigheadh fén Scéim.  Is mó i bhfad an méid leabhar Gaedhilge a léightear in sna scoileanna, go mór mór in sna Meádhon-Scoileanna ná mar léightí cúig bliadhain ó shoin. Mar adubhrathas cheana, is féidir le múinteoirí mórán do dhéanamh chun suim na scoláirí do mhúscailt i léightheoireacht na Gaedhilge, agus tá a lán 'a dhéanamh san.  Tugadh roinnt leabhar i n-aisce anuiridh do lucht ceannais na mbun-scoil sa nGaedhealtacht agus tá súil ag an Aire go gcuirfidh na scoláirí sin spéis mhór i litridheacht na Gaedhilge nuair bheidh a gcuid scolaidheachta thart.  Cuirfidh an obair seo atá ar siubhal ag an Roinn Oideachais a coin d'adhbhar léightheoireachta ar fagháil do'n phobal.</P>
    <P>Is cuibhe tagairt do dhéanamh annso don obair atá tá dhéanamh ag an gCoiste Téarmuidheachta do chuir an Roinn ar bun.  Tá sé leabhrán foillsighthe cheana de bharr saothair an Choiste'na bhfuil aistriughadh déanta go Gaedhilg ar théarmaí teicniceacha a bhaineann le Stair agus Tíreolaidheacht; Gramadach agus Litridheacht; Eoluidheacht; Ceol, agus Tráchtáil. Táthar ag súil go bhfoillseochar ar ball tuilleadh leabhar den tsórt céadna, 'na mbeidh téarmaí cluichí, gleacaidheachta, dlí, dochtúireacht, agus rl.  Tá an chéad leabhrán (Stair agus Tíreoluíocht) as cló le tamall, agus táthar chun é mhéadughadh go mór agus é ath-chur amach 'n-a dhá leabhrán, ceann do Stair agus ceann do Thíreoluíocht. Tá an ceann nua fé Stair ar fagháil anois.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Minister expects congratulations on a record long-distance run, but is there any legislative assembly in the world, and I do not exclude darkest Africa, in which a Minister would get up and address the House for two hours in the certain knowledge that not three Deputies out of the whole House understood a word that he said?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me add to that, that heretofore, when this performance has been gone through, the Minister has circulated a translation of what he proposed to say.  On this occasion a piebald document has been placed at my disposal, the first five pages of which are in English, the next ten pages of which are in Irish; that is followed by 12 pages in English.  There are then five pages in Irish, one page in English, followed by two pages in Irish; there are then 21 pages in English, and then there are three pages in Irish.  That in itself does not constitute a very helpful document, but when the Minister proceeded to read this document for the edification of the House, I discovered that he was hopping long paragraphs.  I do not mind hopping with him in English or Irish, but if I am required to translate from English into Irish and then catch the Minister hopping, it is more than I can do, and I do not believe the Chair knows, or the official reporters know, or this House knows, what part of this document the Minister has read and what part he has not read&mdash;and I do not think even the Minister knows. There has been no method, no system. I have no doubt he has arranged with somebody to follow him carefully and draw a pencil through the parts he <Col N="112" /> hopped over.  I say that such a procedure is reducing this House to a farce and should not be allowed.  I directed the Minister's attention to the situation at an early stage in his speech and he gave me to understand that he had translated such parts of the speech as he thought necessary to translate, and that he had not bothered to circulate a translation of the rest of it.  The House must judge of that conduct, but I think it is deplorable.</P>
      <P>Now, there is a long part of his speech devoted to some kind of report that he has received from the inspectors on the subject of teaching through the medium of Irish in the primary schools.  No translation of his observations in that regard has been furnished to the Opposition, and how far he has dealt in his statement with the only, or the principal, grievance arising from that, I am not in a position to say.  I direct the attention of the House, however, to words used by the Minister on the 4th April, 1935, when speaking on this Estimate last year; and in that connection I direct the attention of the House to the fact that when the Minister replies to the debate on his Estimate he replies in English&mdash;the plain fact being that he could not reply in Irish. That is the plain and unadulterated fact.  I know, and everybody in the House knows, that every official in the Department of Education has had a hand in the preparation of that speech, and it is trotted out here now as the Minister's patriotic contribution and the Gaelic League will go into rhapsodies over it.  We all know, however, that when the Minister has to reply, impromptu, to a debate, he would no more be able to compose a document of that kind standing on his feet than he could fly.  Everybody in the House knows that, and everybody here knows that this codology is gone on with for the purpose of fooling a few innocents up and down the country.  However, the Minister, speaking in English at the conclusion of the debate a year ago, used the following language (Col. 2009, Vol. 55, Official Debates):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is agreed, I think, by all who are interested in education that a position can be reached within a comparatively short time when all <Col N="113" /> the work in all the schools, where the teachers are capable of doing work through Irish and the pupils have sufficient knowledge of it to enable them to follow the work and profit by it, can be done through Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I ask the House to note that, on that occasion, the Minister deliberately said that one of the essential conditions of teaching through the medium of Irish is that the pupils have sufficient knowledge of it to enable them to follow the work and profit by it.  The same Minister, however, who tells us that, has ordained in all the primary schools in this country, except certain specially excepted schools in the City of Dublin, that the infant class will be taught exclusively through the medium of Irish: the fact being that you have infant children who have never heard a word of Irish in their lives walking into a class room for the first time in their lives, separated from their family circle for the first time in their lives, and being addressed by a stranger, who is supposed to familiarise the children with their new conditions, in a language which the children do not understand.</P>
    <P>If I suggested to the Deputies in this House that the children of Dublin should be sent to the primary schools and there addressed exclusively in Greek or Armenian, there would be an outcry.  People would be amazed.  But to a child speaking English as his native language, Armenian is no more remote from that childs native language than is the Irish language, and the result of that is that Irish is becoming, in this country, something closely approximating to a scourge and a symbol of tyranny.  It is a source of amazement to me, Sir, that everything that Fianna Fáil put their hands to seems to wither and turn to corruption.  I remember the time when anyone who was interested in Irish was an enthusiast for it.  Anyone who spoke Irish or who learned Irish was proud to display his knowledge; anxious to spread the language and anxious to inspire in his neighbours the enthusiasm he himself felt.  Can any rational man say now that everyone who speaks Irish in this country is an <Col N="114" /> enthusiast?  Would it not be much truer to say that the majority of people speaking Irish in this country now are job-hunters, trusting to God that they will steal an advantage, by being able to say &ldquo;Go mbeannuigh Dia dhuit,&rdquo; over a better man who cannot say it?  Does any sane man in this country believe that you can save the Irish language through the instrumentality of the place-hunters who are at present disgracing the Irish movement?  Everybody who loves the Irish language, or who has any regard for it, knows perfectly well that, far from preserving the language and encouraging it, such persons as I refer to are calculated to bring it into odium and contempt, and the fact is that those people who did give hard work and enthusiasm to the language are beginning almost to be ashamed to admit that they are language enthusiasts, because language enthusiasm to-day brings one into the strange company of those who consider job enthusiasm and language enthusiasm to be synonymous.</P>
    <P>I believe we ought to revive the language in this country.  I sometimes doubt now whether the thing is possible. I think so much damage has been done in the last three or four years that it is possible that the language is done for and that we will never revive it.  Still, however, I believe it is worth trying for, and the only way we can hope to revive the language, as I have often pointed out before in this House and in the country, is to make people want the language, and unless you can make them want the language the language is dead.  You cannot, however, make the people of this country want anything by forcing it down their throats against their will, and the vast majority of parents in this country do not want their infant children bewildered and bemused in the infant standards by being addressed in a language that they do not understand. The vast majority of rational people in this country revolt from a suggestion that infant children going into the schools should be instructed exclusively through the medium of a language not one syllable of which they understand.  I have always hoped that by teaching Irish in the schools <Col N="115" /> we might eventually arrive at a stage when instruction might be profitably imparted to children through the medium of Irish in the higher classes. I did suggest to the Minister on a previous occasion that he ought to take his courage in his hands and strike out on a bold new course and reduce the age of compulsory attendance in national schools to 13 and start at least on the business of providing free secondary education to the people of this country.  One might reasonably hope that if children were taught Irish and the elements of education through the medium of a language which they understood, up to 13 years of age, they would be able to imbibe higher education in a secondary school during their fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth years, through the medium of the Irish language.  Unless they were able effectively to absorb general education through the language, I say it is a crime against the young people of this country to be attempting to educate them through the medium of Irish. Until you have first brought the child up to a standard of proficiency in which it can profitably receive the education offered to it through the medium of Irish, it is a crime to deprive it of the education to which it is entitled, and to leave it semi-ignorant because it is unable to derive the benefit that it ought to derive from the education provided for it, that education being offered to it in a language which it imperfectly understands and very frequently by teachers who are imperfectly qualified to impart education to that child through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>We have been told that so many teachers possess the Ard-teastas.  I have got the Ard-teastas, and I would like to see myself teaching a class of children through the medium of Irish. There is not an experienced teacher, or an individual in this House, who is closely acquainted with primary education who will seriously maintain that more than six out of ten teachers in this country are qualified to impart instruction in the primary schools through the medium of Irish as it ought to be imparted, and I challenge the suggestion that there is more than <Col N="116" /> 40 per cent. of the children in the sixth standard, outside the Gaeltacht, who are competent to derive the fullest measure of benefit that they ought to derive from the education that is offered to them through the medium of Irish.  I venture to assert that there is not a single infant child, outside those who are born in Irish-speaking households in the Gaeltacht or Galltacht, and there are such households in the Galltacht, who can get any benefit whatever from instruction imparted through the medium of Irish in the infant classes.  I say it is an outrage on the children of this country that a system of dragooning those in the infant classes in a language not one syllable of which they understand, should be continued.</P>
    <P>Every rational man in this country outside the Minister's Department has the same view, but up to six months ago no one outside this House had the courage to come out and say so. At last, certain individuals have had the courage to come out and say so frankly, and on an occasion which the Minister will remember he heard, I think to his astonishment, the present system of imparting Irish to the children described as making martyrs of the young people of this generation for the purpose of preserving the Irish language.  The tragedy of it is that the martyrs are being made and that no advantage is accruing from their martyrdom.  The children are being denied the education which they ought to get, and far from helping or promoting the language, the language is withering under the system that is existing.  Now, on the subject of primary schools, in my opinion a clear and unanswerable case, which the Minister for Education has never attempted to answer, can be made at least in regard to the infant classes.</P>
    <P>I come now to the secondary schools, and there I am satisfied that a large number of children are being grossly victimised by being required to accept instruction through the medium of Irish when they are not able themselves adequately to absorb it because they do not know Irish well enough. I know the stock reply is that the schools that are called A.1 schools, that is schools where all the instruction is given through the medium of <Col N="117" /> Irish, have the highest percentage of marks, the highest percentage of honours and the highest percentage of passes in the examinations.  But the Minister does not tell this House that there is a different standard of marking for the pupils in the schools where all subjects are taught through the medium of Irish from the standard which obtains for the pupils of schools where subjects are taught through the language which the children understand. Though the Minister admits the following fact, it is not always adverted to.  The fact is this: that there is a bonus of so many marks per cent. for any pupil who answers his paper through the medium of Irish, whether he answers it well or ill, and so there can be no valid comparison made between the results coming out of what are described as A.1 schools and the schools run primarily not for propaganda purposes but for the purpose of educating the children committed to their care.</P>
    <P>Is it not an astonishing thing that a time should come in this country when the language movement could be associated in the minds of the people with the deprivation of children of the education which they ought to be given to equip them for the battle of life? How can any man be so obscurantist as not to realise that that is building up in the country a vested hatred of the Irish language which will some day make impossible the task of the Irish revival altogether.  How can anybody who had experience of the language movement, say, 15 years ago, and sees what the language movement is to-day, not realise that what has happened in the last five or ten years has gravely prejudiced the struggle for the revival of the Irish language instead of helping it?  It has turned what was a hopeful struggle, which had every prospect of success, into a detestable imposition which is making those who ought to be fighting for the language grow to hate it.</P>
    <P>I asked on a previous occasion in this House whether the Minister would take counsel with the teachers and with the parents as to their attitude on these several questions which concern the teaching through the medium of Irish.  The Minister said that he was in constant touch with the inspectors <Col N="118" /> and that he had no reason to apprehend from their reports that there was anything amiss.  He also, I think, said that he was in sufficiently close touch with the teaching profession up and down through the country to enable him to say that there was no dissatisfaction there, but the strange thing is that it was after that statement by the Minister that the teachers' resolutions began to appear, and that certain men and women had the courage to come out and say what was in their minds.  They had the courage that certain Deputies in this House have not got.  The Minister, when pressed to consult the parents, took up, I think, the following attitude.  I do not wish to do him an injustice, and I hope he will correct me if my paraphrase of what he said is unfair or inaccurate.  I think he said that he did not think he was bound to consult the parents; that the parents had little or nothing to say to the programme; and that he did not see his way to consult the parents' wishes in regard to the programme at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should be permitted to repeat what I did say. I have not by me the actual words that I used on that occasion, but, from recollection, what I did say was that there was no machinery by which the wishes of the parents could be consulted: that the parents were represented through certain people on the commission which drew up the primary schools' programme.  In the statement to which the Deputy alludes, I pointed out that the parents were fully represented in Dáil Eireann and that Dáil Eireann in that way represented the parents' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to learn from the Minister that he does recognise the right of the parents to have a voice in the arrangement of the programme, and that their opinion should carry weight, and very substantial weight with him.  I entirely agree with that view, and I very much doubt if the Minister seriously believes that the present dispensation in the Department of Education meets with the approval of the parents of children attending primary and secondary schools.  I do not think it does, and <Col N="119" /> I think the Minister ought to take the earliest opportunity to find out whether it does or not.  I pressed this matter on the Minister again and again for this reason, that he will find it extremely difficult to get anyone to speak his mind clearly, frankly and honestly, so long as it is believed that the Minister has fixed his mind in a certain way.  People have learned during the last few years that if you are in a vulnerable position the thing to do is to keep on the right side of the Government, or you will get a stab, as it is popularly described.  Of course, the truth is that the great majority of Deputies in Fianna Fáil would not dare to speak the truth, because they have a kind of pious hope that the Gaelic League has in it a good many extremists, and that if they vex the Gaelic League some of the boys would give them a stab in their respective constituencies.  They have to clutch at any straw to keep them floating in the electoral world. The more precarious their seats become in this House, the more daring they are on the subject of compulsory Irish, because they are afraid of the extremists' views, and it is always safe when dealing with the Left Wing supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party to hold yourself out as an irreconcilable Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Gaels are very valuable persons to keep with them. Not knowing &ldquo;B&rdquo; from a bull's foot about the educational problem themselves, so long as they remain in the Fianna Fáil Party they will take good care to be on the right side.  From all parts of the House the Minister got urgent requests for nothing more than this: an inquiry into the situation as it is at the present time; a clear indication from the Department of Education that they have no vested interest in the matter and are simply desirous of implementing the most effective policy for the regeneration of Irish, but that they do not nail the flag irreconcilably to any particular mast, except that they want the most effective scheme devised which will have the goodwill of the largest section of the community at its command. If the question could be approached in that way, I believe <Col N="120" /> that valuable work can be done to set the Irish language on a much more secure foundation than it rests on at the present time.  I feel profoundly that unless that is done we are going to allow the language to perish under our eyes.  It will masquerade for a few more years as a passport to Government and public appointments. Mind you, it is only masquerading as a passport, and people are getting public appointments on account of having a competent knowledge of Irish who do not know as much Irish as I do Greek.  But they use it for the purpose of getting jobs, and so long as it is held out to be an essential qualification for getting jobs, it might continue to survive in an attenuated form, until the country gets sick of the whole business and scraps it.</P>
    <P>That is something I want to avoid, because if the country revolts against the Irish language, particularly in the present position of the language, it will shatter the whole thing.  If the Irish language is shattered in our time, no succeeding generation will ever be able to revive it as a living language.  It will put us to the pin of our collars to save it, and if we fail, as we know that we are failing at the present time, no succeeding generation will be able to revive it.  It sometimes terrifies me when I realise the amount of ignorance, narrowmindedness and futility, as represented by the Fianna Fáil Party, which stands between the country and success in this matter.  It appals me. Still I do not despair.  It may be possible to undermine these things, to get them out of the way, and to drive some light into the minds of the less obtuse members of that Party, by making them realise that it is absolutely impossible for any political Party to make a political issue of Irish and save the language.  If the Irish language is to be made a political issue either by the Gaels, by Fianna Fáil, or any other of the narrow minded pests that afflict this country, it will mean its hopeless and irrevocable destruction.  There is only one hope for the language, and that is to make it a common platform on which persons of all points of view can co-operate for a common end. <Col N="121" /> That is not done at the present time. There is no hope of it being done as long as the language is used as a kind of weapon in the hands of one or two political parties.  There is no hope of it being done as long as the Department of Education takes up the position that they hold a certain view, that it is treachery to the country and a betrayal of the cause for anyone to hold a different view.  That is the present attitude, and that is the attitude that is killing the Irish language movement at the present time. I hope and pray that before this year is over there will be a change from that attitude, and then we may get some useful work done.</P>
    <P>I referred on several previous occasions to the conditions obtaining in the reformatories and industrial schools.  I noticed with alarm from the Minister's statement to-day that the population of the reformatories is rising and that admissions to these institutions are increasing.  I thought the Minister would have paused a moment when he came to that part of his statement, to tell us what in his opinion was the cause of the increase in juvenile crime.  The House should remember that a committal to a reformatory means that a child is regarded as not being amenable to any other form of correction.  No child is sent to a reformatory except for some grave misdemeanour.  It must be as grave as a child or a youth can be guilty of, or has proved incorrigible. In the course of his statement the Minister said that the numbers under detention in reformatories at the end of the school year showed an increase of 15.  I thought there was only one reformatory in this country, but the Minister referred to reformatories. There was a reformatory somewhere in the midlands and another at Glencree.  Then Glencree was closed and only the one in the Midlands remained.  I understood that it was the intention to remove the reformatory from the Midlands to Glencree so as to make the place in the midlands available to the Land Commission for division amongst local farmers.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to know what is the present situation.  The numbers under detention show an increase from 81 in <Col N="122" /> 1934 to 96 in 1935.  Admissions also show an increase from 28 in 1934 to 45 in 1935.  That reveals a very undesirable state of affairs, one to which the Minister might advert.  I know the reply the Minister will make&mdash;that he has nothing to do with the committal of children to industrial schools or reformatories and that they only come under his jurisdiction after they have been committed.  Then when you go to ask the Minister for Justice he says &ldquo;I have nothing to do with that; that is a question coming within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education and you must address your question to him.&rdquo;  However, for the sake of convenience, I think the Minister might take steps to ascertain from the Department of Justice its views as to the reason for the increase in the number of admissions to reformatories.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke last year hopefully about a Commission which he had set up.  I raised in this House, two or three years ago, the circumstances obtaining in the House of Detention in Summerhill which I consider to be a gross scandal.  I have said so here on three separate occasions and I now desire to repeat it with emphasis.  When I first directed the attention of the Minister to it he went down, inspected the place, came back, and said it looked lovely.  However, he announced his intention of setting up a Commission to inquire into conditions in the Industrial Schools, Reformatories and House of Detention.  That Commission of Inquiry has been sitting, sitting, and it is apparently going to continue to sit.  It must be 18 months since that Commission was set up.  We are informed that there is yet no report and, while we are waiting for the report, the Minister feels it is beyond his capacity to take any steps to deal with the conditions in Summerhill. The conditions in Summerhill are extremely bad in my opinion.  I do not know what they are recently.  I have not been there for two or three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>And you know all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite recognise that Deputy Brady cannot imagine <Col N="123" /> being inside a penal institution of any kind in this country except in the capacity of a convict.  That is not my position.  Those who are more accustomed to responsibility in public life recognise that we have to enter such institutions in a capacity other than that of a pauper or a convict. The Deputy will learn that when he has a little more experience as a public man.  I have not been in the House of Detention for about three years.  On the last occasion I was there, it was by courtesy of the Minister himself and then the conditions obtaining were very bad indeed.  I have described them in this House before.  When I was last there, I think there were 15 children there ranging in age from 16 down to three.  There was one child of three there.  That child was being removed from one industrial school to another. He was not in any sense there as a result of any misdemeanour because a child of three cannot very well commit a misdemeanour.  He was solely there in transit from one industrial school to another, to which he was being committed because of his being an orphan or for some reason of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These children were assembled in one large room, a sort of playroom, and their play extended, as far as I could find out, from early morning until they went to bed at night.  It does not seem to me to be a suitable arrangement, apart from anything else, to have young children of very tender years spending the whole day long in the same room with older children of 13 or 14 years who are on their way to industrial schools for stern corrective treatment as a result of having been convicted by the courts of offences of varying gravity.  I drew the Minister's attention to this before, and I am not aware whether he has introduced any reform into the organisation of this establishment or not.  If he has not it is a very great scandal.  I invite Deputies who have children of their own to ask themselves the question, would they willingly allow a child of theirs of three or four years of age to sit down and spend its day in the company of, or playing with, precocious <Col N="124" /> youngsters taken off the streets of Dublin who had been convicted in the children's courts of offences of varying gravity&mdash;some of a very abnormal kind?  I say it is monstrous to put the children of the poor into an establishment of that kind.  They should be sent to an establishment designed for their careful protection and proper attention, no matter how short a time they are to be there.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the situation obtaining at Summerhill is one that should not have been allowed to await the report of any commission.  I do not consider that the conditions obtaining in industrial schools or in the reformatories are sufficiently urgent to make interim action necessary.  Improvements may, no doubt, ultimately be necessary but I am satisfied there is no urgent situation arising.  There is, however, in Summerhill and I put it to the Minister that a certain principle should underlie every punitive action by the State against a child.</P>
    <P>If the State makes up its mind that the duty devolves upon it to remove a child from the family circle, it is the duty of the State to provide that child with the most ideal surroundings that the State can provide for it.  Let the State provide the most ideal surroundings that it is within the capacity of the State to give, and I have no hesitation in saying that they will be worse for any child than the surroundings of the least desirable family in which one can leave a child.  If you remove a child from the family circle, you take an enormous responsibility on your shoulders.  The State has no right to take a child away from its father or mother, without exerting itself to the utmost of its capacity to compensate that child for what it cannot restore to it&mdash;and that is the family influence.  It is peculiarly aggravating in a country such as ours, where all sections of political thought are liberal and even radical, that the children of the poor should be treated in that way, because there is no inclination on the part of any Deputy in this House, I believe, to tolerate treatment for the children of the poor that they would consider unsuitable for the children of the rich.  I challenge Deputy Mrs. <Col N="125" /> Concannon, Deputy Miss Pearse or any other Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party interested in social work, to go down to Summerhill and let each of them ask himself or herself the question, would he or she wish somebody in whom he or she was interested by some blood tie, to be incarcerated in a place of that kind although that child may be only there for a week?  Most of them are only there for a week; it is only in an exceptional case that they are kept longer.</P>
    <P>I do not want to create a false impression.  The place of detention is not a dirty place.  The man in charge is not an undesirable person. On the contrary I believe him to be a thoroughly respectable, decent man, doing his best with the resources at his disposal, but I do say that to incarcerate children of tender years in an old house in Summerhill, standing between two tenement houses, for a period of a week without providing any adequate educational diversion for them, is most undesirable.  One has to qualify everything one says in this regard in order that one may not paint a picture that is not true.  A strong argument can be made against providing any educational facilities because the Minister may say &ldquo;These children are only there for a week. They have not settled down; how can they imbibe any education within that week?&rdquo;  I do not care whether they imbibe any education or not.  I say the general psychological effect on the children of providing suitable instruction is good, if you impart to them some simple lesson, whatever it is, to give them a regulated and reasonable day, instead of leaving them sitting in a room all day long, doing nothing but getting into mischief.  Certainly, I know that no reasonable provision was made for the proper occupation of the children during the days they were waiting between one court and another.  I can put the burden of my complaint netly, by saying that in my opinion the situation in Summerhill demands interim action; and that it is so undesirable that the Minister should not wait for the report of the Commission sitting under the chairmanship of Mr. Cussen to deal with the position that pertains there.  I <Col N="126" /> contrast that with the industrial schools and the reformatory schools which is not sufficient to justify demanding interim action and which can wait until the report is in the Minister's hands.</P>
    <P>I was rebuked last year by the Minister for repeating a suggestion that I made the year before and which I am going to repeat again.  If suggestions that I make are not carried out I will go on repeating them, year after year, and if we have the pleasure of sitting here for the next 25 years so long as the present Minister continues in office he will hear these suggestions. The suggestion to which I refer deals with central schools.  At the present time throughout rural Ireland, particularly in the congested areas, you have innumerable inadequate schools. But it is very difficult to justify the erection of what would be a proper school in the outlying districts where the roll would be very small.  Instead of a school you could erect a good shelter in that area, and provide for a bus to call at that shelter at what would normally be the school hours. You could there collect the children and bring them, say, a distance of two miles into the central school.  You could provide that the central school should cater for the requirements of the children within a circuit of three miles, arranging the transport of the children from the shelters, which would be erected on the sites, or convenient to the sites of the old schools which were being abandoned in exchange for the new central schools. That proposal has a variety of advantages. First, it gets over the difficulty of building adequate schools in sparsely populated districts.  Secondly, it makes it possible, by building economies to build a really decent school and to provide the kind of accommodation we would wish the children to have.  Thirdly, it gives facilities for providing, what we all wish to provide, if finances and other considerations will allow, some kind of a substantial or nutritious meal for children attending national schools, particularly in the winter months.  There is the further advantage that it makes it possible for a group of teachers to live reasonably approximate to one <Col N="127" /> another, and it affords, instead of the small and cheerless hovels which they had been attending the opportunity for providing a more or less academic centre in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to that on one occasion was: &ldquo;Get me a manager and I shall experiment with the scheme.&rdquo;  Of course unless you are interested in a proposal, and want to try it out yourself, you will never get anybody else interested.  If the Minister is going to put his feet on the mantelpiece in Marlborough Street and wait for a manager to come in and take them down nothing is going to happen.  I once sent a manager to the Minister.  I took my feet off the mantelpiece and got a manager on the hop as he was going up to ask for a grant for a new school.  I said that I got the Minister to say he would experiment when the first manager came to him, and I added that he would build the first school and pay the piper, as it was an experiment that he wanted to carry out.  I think the Minister then said he was not prepared to pay all the expenses.  I want to put this question to him: Does he consider it advisable to make an experiment along the lines I suggested in the rural districts?  If so, will he say now, in order to put the matter beyond doubt, whether he is prepared to build two or three central schools in the country when the first two or three managers approach him, or when the local circumstances would be suitable with a view to getting such schools built?</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister would have to make arrangements for setting up a bus service to bring the children in, and he would have to nurse the scheme at the beginning to see how it would work out.  I am convinced from what is going on in the counties like Kerry, Mayo, Donegal and Galway that such a scheme would be a great blessing from the point of view of the children of the country and would be a great addition to the academic atmosphere which ought to pervade rural education in this country and particularly in the congested areas.  But not only would it be an advantage in providing something like an academic atmosphere, <Col N="128" /> it would also provide the ground system upon which we could have a system of providing one substantial or nutritious meal for the children of the poorer classes attending schools of that kind.</P>
    <P>One last point I want to make.  As far as I can see, we are spending money, I think, upon further sluaighte and in providing a new army instead of providing school books for the children of the country.  It is rather a strange discovery.  The next time the Minister goes out and inspects a sluagh and reviews them on parade perhaps he will remember that they march off with the school books of the children of this country under their capes, and I ask him to ask himself which is the best value, the school books or the sluaighte.  I am all for school books.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear a little more&mdash;I am very interested in this&mdash;of the histories of Irish counties.  We provided a sinecure for Father O'Flanagan to write the histories of the Irish counties.  We provided him with £750 a year and want to see if that money is well spent.  But having provided him with £750 a year for writing histories which nobody wants, and for which, as far as I am aware, he has no qualification at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not desire to pursue the matter.  I know of no qualifications existing; none has ever been brought before this House.  I condemn unreservedly the Minister who put this work in hand.  I did so when it was first propounded: I now do so again, and I would desire to direct the attention of the House to the fact that we have not only committed ourselves to writing those histories but we are also going to translate them into Irish. None of them has emerged to-day, and I am not aware that any of them is available.  In addition to writing them &mdash;and in my submission nobody wants them&mdash;we are now going to translate them into Irish under another subhead of the Vote.  I desire to renew my objection to those publications.  I desire to say that I consider those publications unsuitable for any purpose connected with the Department of Education; that they ought not to be made available in the Irish language; that they ought not to be put upon the programmes of the schools; and that, if that is not the intention of the Minister, the duty is upon him to explain to this House how he can justify an expenditure, not only of £750 per annum on those publications, but a further expenditure under subhead B (2) for their translation into the Irish language.  The proposal to translate them into Irish leads me to believe that they are going to be foisted upon elementary schools in this country, and if such a proposal is in the mind of the Minister, I protest against it most emphatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ordinarily, Sir, one would have hoped to hear from the Minister a general review of the policy of the Department in a form which would have made it possible for us to understand and follow him.  In fact we have received from him a long discourse which was presented to us in <Col N="130" /> a form which, as I say, not three members of the Dáil who were present when he was speaking could understand, and in a printed form as handed to us which was unreadable, and which in many parts bore no relation to what the Minister actually said.  Under those circumstances it is difficult to deal with the general policy of the Department as it ought to be dealt with, which is a circumstance that I deplore, but which is inevitable if the Government continues to conduct business as it is being conducted at the present time. However, I have addressed certain inquiries to the Minister, and should be greatful if he would reply to them categorically.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (1) of this Vote contains a reference to the Minister's salary.  I propose to raise this matter again on the salary of the Minister for Finance, but I thought it might be well to give him, at this juncture, notice of my intention to raise it then, so that he may not claim to be unprepared when his own Estimate comes up for discussion. When President de Valera first took office in this country there was a great song and dance about his intention to cut down expenses and show the way himself.  The Minister all got up, piously struck their breasts, and said they were going to set an example. Their incomes were going to be reduced from the extortionist and extravagant incomes which had been enjoyed by the base members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  A figure was going to be fixed which the patriots of the Fianna Fáil Party could properly accept from the Caithlin Ni Houlihan who had been so grossly impoverished by the incompetent Government that preceded them.  I think the Ministers of State before President de Valera came into office were getting £1,700 or £1,750 per annum, subject to income-tax. Income-tax now stands at 4/6 in the £, and I do not know when super-tax begins to operate, but if you take a salary of £1,700 and subtract income-tax, you arrive at a figure of perhaps £1,300 or £1,400.  I ask the House to take note of that figure.  The Ministers under the previous administration, who were threatened with being murdered <Col N="131" /> by the innocent and well-meaning and benevolent members of certain organisations which were supporting President de Valera at the time, required the protection of military and police in order to get safely through the streets, and so on official business they drove under a military escort in a military car.  Then the beloved President came into office.  To his horror he discovered not only that he had to have police and military in his car, but he had to have them behind and in front with machine guns as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, lest the members of this House should be deceived into the belief that the Minister is, in fact, receiving £1,150 as appears on this Vote, I desire to forewarn them that other Votes will arise in the future upon which they will find substantial charges by way of amenities for Ministers <Col N="132" /> which are, in fact, concealed contributions to their salaries and we will give the Minister for Finance an opportunity of answering.  As a matter of fact, those matters arise on the Army Vote, which was discussed this afternoon, and will not arise again.  I think those payments have been concealed in the Army Vote.  £150 is set out here as the estimated income-tax liability in respect of the Minister's income.  The Minister's income free of tax is £1,000, and if the estimated income-tax liability is £150, that would suggest that his income ought to have been in the neighbourhood of £1,150 before income-tax was deducted.  Well, unless I am very much mistaken, the income-tax on £1,150 at 4/6 in the £ is more than £150.  I think the Minister for Finance should hold himself ready when his Vote comes to be discussed to give us a calculation founded on the true figures of what the Ministers are at the present time receiving. I think when that calculation is made it will emerge that the apostles of economy who succeeded the dastards of extravagance in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government are now receiving penny for penny what the Ministers whom they replaced received, with this difference, that the Ministers whom they replaced took their salaries, and made no apology to the people for taking them, because they knew that they were damn well worth what they were getting, but the present Ministers, recognising their own value, do not dare to ask the public for more than £1,000, although they take damn good care to get £1,700.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an tAire do mholadh mar gheall ar an gcuntas a thug sé ar obair a Roinne. Tá cúpla poinnte go mba mhaith liom tagairt do dhéanamh dóibh.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá áthas orm go bhfuil £200,000 sa mbreis leagtha amach chun tithe scoile do thógaint agus do dheisiú. Tá súil agam go rachaidh an foirgneamh san chun cinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do thrácht an tAire ar an gceist acrannach sin&mdash;an Ghaedhilg mar áis mhúinte sa Ghalldacht.  Níl aon cheist is mó atá ag déanamh imnidhe do dhaoine áirithe sa tír seo ná an cheist seo.  Táthar ag cur is ag cuiteamh <Col N="133" /> fén scéal sin ós árd agus os ísealdaoine i bhfábhar múineadh trí Ghaedhilg agus daoine ina aghaidh. Sa gcéad dul síos, ní gádh aon chonspóid fén gceist&mdash;an féidir adhbhair leighinn seachas Gaedhilg a mhúineadh trí Ghaedhilg mar tá deimhin déanta dhe go mion-minic i mbun-scoileanna agus i meadhon-scoileanna, agus go deimhin i gceard-scoileanna, gur féidir sin do dhéanamh agus a dhéanamh go foghanta.  Táthar ag gabháil don tsaghas san múinteoireachta ó cuireadh Rialtas an tSaorstáit ar bun ach dar ndóigh ní gádh a rá nach é seo an chéad uair a thárla seo sa tír mar, in allód, do múintí na hadhbhair uile, idir dán, céard agus ealadha, tríd an teangain dúthchais.  Maidir le scéal an lae indiu ba cheart dhá choingioll a chomhlíonadh sara bhféadfaí an múineadh trí Ghaedhilg do dhéanamh go tairbheach agus go héifeachtach&mdash; é bheith ar chumas an múinteora an cineál teagaisc seo do thabhairt uaidh agus a bheith ar chumas an leinbh an teagasc do ghlacadh chuige féin. Má tá aon cheann den dá choingioll sin ar iarraidh is léir nach féidir an teagasc a bheith go héifeachtach agus má tugtar fé déantar éagcóir ar an leanbh, éagcóir ar oideachas agus gan amhras, deineann an múinteoir dochar dó fhéin.  Ag tagairt don dá choingioll so is cinnte gur tábhachtaí go mór an chéad cheann do chomhlíonadh&mdash;an múinteoir a bheith in ann an teagasc do dhéanamh.  Is riachtannaí é sin go mór ná an leanbh a bheith in ann foghluim, mar, do réir deallraimh, muna mbeidh an mianach san oide ní bheidh an t-eolas agan dalta.  Tá eagla orainn uile go bhfuiltear ag iarraidh na hadhbhair do mhúineadh i Scoileanna annso is annsúd agus gan ceachtar den dá choingioll sin ar fáil ionnta.  Is baoghalach go bhfuil cigirí ag gríosadh múinteoirí chun thabhairt fén obair seo.  Um Nodlaig seo ghabh tharainn bhuail oide liom atá ag múineadh i lár na Galltachta agus atá ag déanamh a chuid oibre uile nach mór tré Ghaedhilg.  Fear é seo go bhfuil eolas maith aige ar litridheacht na Gaedhilge acht níl luas no líomhthacht aige i labhairt na teangan agus, dá bhrígh sin, ní hinchreidthe é go mbeadh sé in ann adhbhair léighinn seachas Gaedhilg do mhúineadh tríd an dteangain sin. <Col N="134" /> D'fhiafruigheas de cadéan fáth go raibh sé ag tabhairt fé na hadhbhair go léir a mhúineadh tré Ghaedhilg agus dubhairt sé liom gurab é an cigire a mhol do san a dhéanamh.  Dar liom, ní hionmholta moladh an chigire sin agus do réir mar a chloisim ní hé an t-aon chigire amháin atá ag tathant agus, dá n-abrainn é, ag bagairt ar mhúinteoirí áis mhúinte do dhéanamh den nGaedhilg i gcóir na n-adhbhar uile.  Im thuairim-se ní théigheann sin chun leasa an léighinn nó chun leasa na Gaedhilge.  Ar an dtaobh eile admhuighim go dtarluigheann, nuair a bhíonn an t-oide ag tabhairt faoi agus gan an acfuinn cheart ann, go gcoisceann cigirí air dul ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá an iomad bolscaireachta á dhéanamh fén gceist seo.  Fé mar atá ráidhte agan tá na hadhbhair léighinn uile dá múineadh tri Ghaedhilg i roinnt mhaith scol sa tír fé láthair ach ní hiontuigthe as san gur féidir sin a dhéanamh i ngach scoil.  Is eol dúinn go bhfuil a shamhail sin d'obair ar siubhal i gcuid mhaith des na meadhon-scoileanna agus an obair ar fheabhas ionnta.  Ach má seadh gheibheann na scoileanna san scoth na mbun-scol.  Ní dócha go dtéigheann thar 5 per cent. de leanbhaí na mbun-scol isteach i meadhon-scoileanna&mdash;cuid mhaith dhíobh san de thoradh scoláireachtaí a bhronnann na comhairlí áiteamhla&mdash;agus de bhrígh gurab iad&mdash;a bhfurmhór ar aon chuma&mdash;na leanbhaí is fearr is léir gur féidir obair fhoghanta a dhéanamh leo.  Ach de brígh go ndeintear san an bhfuil sé iontuigthe gur féidir an obair chéadna a dhéanamh leis an 95 per cent. ná téigheann thar an mbun-scoil?  Níl, ná aon nidh mar é, ach is minic daoine á rádh gur féidir.  Daoine ar bhaoithchreideamh iad san.  Maidir leis sin níl an Aireacht féin ar an aigne sin mar cuireadh bun-scoileanna áirithe ar bun agus fóirne speisialta ionnta le gach nidh a mhúineadh trí Ghaedhilg. Admháil é sin, cinnte, nách bhfuil súil, leis an saghas céadna oibre sa ngnáthbhun-scoil, ná an tráth tagtha fós chun sin do dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Seo mo scéal féin: Tá an séambadh rang agam i mbliadhna agus bhí na buachaillí céadna agam sa tríomhadh. so gceathrú, agus sa gcúigeadh rang <Col N="135" /> agus ins na ranga san dheineas iarracht ar na hadhbhair a mhúineadh trí Ghaedhilg.  Ní mó ná maith d'éirigh liom le furmhór na ngarsún.  Tá suas le caogadh san rang agus ar an méid sin is dóigh líom go bhféadfainn obair thairbheach éifeachtach a dhéanamh as Gaedhilg le deichneabhar&mdash;ach cá mbeadh an dachad eile?  Bheidís ar fán.  Agus ní togha ar an dachad so é. Rugadh is tógadh a bhfurmhór i mbathlaigh Bhaile Atha Cliath&mdash;áiteanna ná cloistear focal Gaedhilge ó cheann ceann na bliana agus gan aon éirim ag móran des na tuismitheoirí ach a leanbhaí a chur ag obair chomh luath is bhíonn na ceithre bliana déag slánuithe aca.  Fé mar atá ráidhte agam thugas iarracht ar na hadhbhair a mhúineadh trí Ghaedhilg agus ar na hadhbhair sin bhí Tír-eolas na hEireann.  I dtosach na scoil-bhliana so bhí roinnt des na buachaillí ag druidim leis na ceithre bliana déag agus bhí fhios agam go mbeadh roinnt díobh san ag tréigeann na scoile i rith na bliana.  Anois bí seo an adhb.  Bhí fhios agam go mbeadh roinnt bheag des na buachaillí ag dul isteach i siopaí, i dtighthe gnótha, nó i n-oifigí&mdash;áiteanna go mbíonn gadh le Tír-eolas&mdash; agus go fóil caithfear admháil gur le tír-eolas as Sacs-bhearla é.  Cad a bhí agam le déanamh?  Bhí, ar mhaithe leis na leanbhaí a chur i n-oireamhaint dá slí mbeatha agus ar son a dtuismitheoirí agus d'fhonn is mo choinsias féin a shásamh, tosnú agus an nidh a bhí déanta agam as Gaedhilg d'aithdhéanamh as Bearla, Níorbh am amú, admhuighim, an t-am a chaitheas leis an múineadh trí Ghaedhilg.</P>
    <P>Sin rud ná tuigeann mór-chuid daoine a bhíonn ag cur síos ar an gceist seo na Gaedhilge mar áis theagaisc.  Tá mórán díobh ar bheagán eolais, nó ar ceal aon eolais, ar mhúinteoireacht agus dar leo súd tá na leanbhaí uile ar chomh-dhul is ar chomh-chomhacht maidir le foghluim na Gaedhilge.  Nílid ná aon nidh mar é.  Na daoine go bhfuil a saothar is a sláinte caithte aca leis an obair seo tuigid nach bhfuil annsan ach baoth-thuairim gan tacaidheacht gan ughdarás.  Is é mo bharamhail féin go bhfuil breis suime á cur sa gceist seo, go bhfuil breis ghríosadh fúithi agus, amhail atá ráidhte cheana, <Col N="136" /> ná fuil an tráth chuige sin tagtha fós. Tuigimíd go léir go mbéarfaidh tráth ar an dtír seo go mbeidhfear ag múineadh gach adhbhair trí Gaedhilg agus dá luaithe sin seadh is fearr ach dul ar aghaidh go réasúnta.  Tá saghas éigin tuairme amuigh anois nách bhfuil aon tsábháil ar an dteangain agus nách féidir Gaedhilgeoirí a dhéanamh de Ghaedhil óga muna múintear na hadhbhair léighinn tré Ghaedhilg.  Ní aontuighim leis sin.  Tá cainnteoirí líomtha agus scoláirí cliste Gaedhilge againn indiú, cuid aca na gcainnteóirí ón gcliabhán, cuid eile aca a fhoghluimigh an teanga, agus níor fhoghluimigh duine aca agus é ar scoil conus a dó is a trí a chur le chéile as Gaedhilg.  Buaileadh aoinne isteach go dtí siopa na bhFoillseachán Rialtais nó isteach go dtí siopa foillsightheora ar bith sa tír agus cuirfead geall go bhfuil gach leabhar Gaedhilge atá ar fagháil ar na cúntuir ó láimh ughdair nár fhoghluimigh adhbhar léighinn ar bith&mdash;seachas an teanga féin&mdash;as Gaedhilg.  Níor múineadh an tAthair Peadar ná Eoin MacNéill ná an tAimhirgíneach ná an Craoibhín ná Máire ná Pádraig O Domhnalláin ná Tórna ná Sceilg ná aoinne de scríbhneoirí na linne seo as Gaedhilg. B'fhéidir go mb'fhearrde iad dá ndeintí &mdash;ach sin mar a thárla.  Nó go mbeidh bunús an phobail i n-ann tabhairt fé labhairt na Gaedhilge agus feidhm dá baint aiste i gcúrsaí gnótha&mdash;bíodh sí briste nó slán&mdash;beidh deacrachtaí ag baint le múineadh trí Ghaedhilg ins na bun-scoileanna.  Ní dóigh liom gur gadh aon argóint fén méid sin.  Is léir do chách an fhirinne atá ann.  Tuigim go bhfuil daoine ann ná haontóchaidh liom agus is eagal liom gurab é buadh na tola ar an dtuisgint ag na daoine sin é.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mba áit shoilbhir beo&mdash; áit ghrinn go minic&mdash;an scoil.  Beidh easba beodhachta agus soilbhireachta ar scoil má bhíonn oidí agus scoláirí ag útamáil le nithe ná tuigid go maith. Ní féidir le haoinne an Ghaedhilg do láimhseáil mar áis mhúinte ach an Gaedhilgeoir foghanta.  Má thugann a mhalairt fé ní bheidh san obair ach briseadh croidhe agus pionós don oide agus do sna leanbhaí.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na meadhon-scoileanna tá scéal eile acu san.  Ní théigheann ionta <Col N="137" /> san de ghnáth ach togha agus rogha na leanbh agus ar an adhbhar san, níl aon chomórtas idir iad féin agus na bun-scoileanna. An té a thugann fén gcomórtas san a dhéanamh agus argóintí a tharrac as, níl sé ach ag déanamh Máire Ní Ogáin de féin.</P>
    <P>Dubhairt an Teachta Diolúin go mba cheart lár-scoil do chur ar bun i nGaillimh, i gCiarraidhe, agus in áiteacha eile.  Táthar chun trí scoileanna do leagadh i gConntae Chabháin agus scoil amháin do thógáilt in a háit. Iarracht é sin ar lár-scoil do bhunú agus tá súil agam go n-eireochaid leis. Dubhairt an Teachta Diolúin nach raibh ag eirighe linn i gcúis na teangan. Ní aontuighim leis.  Dá mbeadh sé ag Feis Ath Cliath seachtain o shoin bheadh a mhalairt de bharúil aige. Fiche bliain o shoin ní chloisfeadh duine an méid páiste agus daoine óga ag labhairt Gaedhilge agus a cloistear sa tram agus sa bhus in Ath Cliath fé láthair.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil ag eirighe linn chó maith agus ba mhaith linn, ach tá dul ar aghaidh ann.</P>
    <P>Mar adubhairt an Teachta Diolúin tá an choitchiantacht pat-fhuar fé scéal na Gaedhilge agus ní heól dom aon obair is mó a rachadh chun leasa na teangan ná an fuaire seo do scaipeadh agus grádh don nGaedhilg agus meas ar a ngabhann léi do mhúscailt ins na ndaoine.  B'fhearr go mór dóibh seo atá ag déanamh buadhartha dhóibh féin fé mhodh mhúinte na scol&mdash;gnó ná tuigid&mdash;tabhairt fén obair seo.  Má dheinid, beidh siad ag cabhrú i bhfad níos mó leis an nGaedhilg agus leis na scoileanna ná bheith ag casaoid fén nGaedhilg mar áis mhúinte.</P>
    <P>Conas atá an scéal indiu ag na Ranna Rialtais?  An bhfuil aon cheataí á dhéanamh don té atá ar ceal Gaedhilge?  An bhfuil aon Roinn den Rialtas ag déanamh a chuid oibre ar fad trí Ghaedhilg?  An bhfuil Roinn an Oideachais féin á dhéanamh?  Níl. Nách é fírinne an scéil é gur cuma don gnáth dhuine Gaedhilg a bheith aige nó bheith ina héaghmais chomh fada is a théigheann cúrsaí riaracháin an tSaorstáit.  Gan amhras má tá sé de mhí-ádh ar aon chathruigtheoir bheith 'na mhúinteoir ní hamhlaidh scéal do san.</P>
    <P>Is eagal liom go bhfuil an Rialtas ar <Col N="138" /> aon aigne leo so a cheapann leó féin gur mhairbh na Scoileanna Náisiúnta an Ghaedhilg agus gur féidir leó í aithbheóchaint.  Má tá an tuairim sin ag an Rialtas agus má ghlacann Aireacht an Oideachais leis an ndualgas atá tuigthe as an dtuairim sin beidh breall ar an Aireacht san agus beidh dhá bhreall ar an nGaedhilg.</P>
    <P>Ní shábhálfaidh Aireacht an Oideachais an teanga.  Níl san Aireacht san ach áis do sna hAireachtaí eile chun an teanga do chur ar fagháil dóibh sin, ach muna mbíonn éileamh ag na hAireachtaí eile ar an dteangain sin deire léi.  Ag tagairt don éileamh san ba mhaith liom mo bhuidheachas féin agus buidheachas Gaedheal Eireann do chur i n-úil do Eamonn O Bróithe de chionn a bhfuil á dhéanamh aige chun an Ghaedhilg a chur i ngníomh na Roinn féin.</P>
    <P>Ach níl an Rialtas ag cur as ar aon bhealach don té atá ar ceal Gaedhilge. Cuirtear amach fógraí puiblí agus a leithéid i mBéarla.  Maidir leis na gnáth-dhaoine is cuma leo ce'ca tá Gaedhilg acu nó ná fuil, mar bíonn aistriú i mBéarla ar na fograí a foillsightear.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Aireacht roinnt nótaí amach ós cionn bliana ó shoin agus más maith is mithid.  Is ait liom gan nótaí díobh seo a bheith scríobhtha i nGaedhilg&mdash; fiú amháin na nótaí ar an nGaedhilg féin.  Pé leath-scéal atá fé no nótaí eile bheith as Béarla níl aon leath-scéal fén gceann so, mar an múinteoir ná tuigfeadh na nótaí i nGaedhilg ní ceart go mbeadh múineadh Gaedhilge mar chúram air.  Cuireann sé seo in úil dúinn nach bhfuil muinighin ceart&mdash; fiú amháin ag Aireacht an Oideachais féin&mdash;ar an nGaedhilg mar adhbhar teagaise nú stiúrtha.</P>
    <P>Foillsigheadh le goirid&mdash;as Béarla ar ndóigh&mdash;toradh fiosrúcháin a dhein Coiste Idir-Ranna ar cheist árdú aois freastal riachtanach leanbhaí scoile, agus ní dóigh liom gurab ion-mholta an tuarasgabháil í.  Is mian liom an chuma a ceapadh an Coiste idir-eatortha so do cháineadh. 'Sé mo thuairim ná raibh sé ceart ná cóir ag an Aire sgéal den tsaghas d'fhágaint fé bhreithniú ag feadhmanaigh Stáit amháin.  Ceist í seo a bhaineann go dlúth le saoghal na <Col N="139" /> ndaoine agus is dóibh is dual agus ní do Stáit-Sheirbhísigh, a mholadh nó é do dhiúltadh.  Ba cheart go n g l a c f a í tuairim teachtairí an phobail.  Beidh na daoine sin lán tsásta suidhe síos agus an sgéal d'infhiúchadh agus a mbreith do thabhairt&mdash;breith go mbeadh aigne an phobail suidhte innte.  Ní ceart, im' thuairim-se, a leithéid de chúram do chur ar Stát-Sheirbhísigh.  Ceist caighdeáin í seo agus ní hé a ndualgas san polasaí do leagadh amach.  Isé a ndualgas&mdash;agus, maidir le seirbhísigh puiblí an Stáit seo, níl a sárú le fáil chuige sin&mdash;an polasaí, nuair ceaptar é i bhfuirm dlí nó reachta nó riaghlach, do chur i bhfeidhm.  Má fágtar bun agus barr an scéil fútha bheadh sé chó maith.  An Dáil do scur agus riaradh agus reachtú na tíre d'fhágaint fé Ranna an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Meán-Scoileanna, chuir an Roinn Oideachais cearcalán thart tamall o shoin ar na meán-scoileanna, ag tabhairt rogha dá lucht stiúrtha an obair theinteain do laigheadú.  Más fíor a gcloisim ó thuismitheoirí, níl mórán toradh ar an gcearcalán céadna, agus ní bheidh no go gcuirfear malairt crota ar an scrúdú agus go gcuirfear deire leis na fógraí gaile agus gaisce seo a foillsightear ar na nuachtáin gach Foghmhar.  Cuirfeadh na fógraí san i gcuimhne do dhuine an méid a foillsightear fé theasbantas an Earraigh a comórtar ag Droichead na Dothra.  Sé mo thuairim go mba cheart cosc a chur leis na fógraí seo&mdash; no go háirithe malairt cuma a chur ortha seachas mar a bhíonn ar a bhfurmhór fé láthair.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire tagairt dosna gairmscoileanna&mdash;scoileanna go bhfuil bainnt agam leo.  Isé an locht atá ar na scoileanna so, im thuairim-se, go mbíonn na mílte ag freastal ar chursa an chéad bhliana, na céadta ar chúrsa na dara bleana, na scóranna ar chúrsa na treas bliana, agus na dosaoin ar chúrsa na bliana deiridh. Ní maith an rud e sin, mar fé mar is eol don Aire, ní árd an grád oidís a bhíonn ar siúl i rith an chéad bliana. Níl ann maidir leis na gnáth-adhbhairléighinn, ach an obair cheadna a bhíonn ar siubhal sna hárd-ranganna <Col N="140" /> sna bun-scoileanna.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon tslí chuige sin ach deontas éigin a bhronnadh ar mhic léighinn i rith na treas bliana.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire tagairt don dontas £2 a tugtar do leanbhaí sa nGaeltacht.  Is léir go bhfuil tairbhe ag teacht as an deontas san.  Téigheann se chun maitheasa athar an leinbh, ach ní minic a théigheann sí thairis sin.  Ach is ag seandaoine na Gaeltachta atáimíd faoi chomaoin i dtaobh labhairt na teangan annsin.  Is dócha nach bhfuil cead agam dlí no reacht do mholadh ar mheastachán, acht ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfadh an Rialtas socrú pinsean sean-aoise a bhronnadh ar sheandaoine na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil a gclann a gcloinne ina nGaedhilgeoirí, ar shroichint aois a 65 dóibh.  Cuirfeadh sé seo árd-chomaoine ar sheandaoine sa nGaeltacht.  Bheadh an scéim costasach acht b'fhiú é do chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Is eagal liom go bhfuil an iomarca ama á chaitheamh, do réir an chláir, ar scríobhnóireacht sna bun-scoileanna. B'fhearr i bhfad dá mbeadh na páistí ag foghluim filíochta, scéaluíochta, no a leitheid, i rith cuid den am so.  Má tá cainnt bhlasta ag páiste is furus do scríobhnóireacht d'fhoghluim agus caithfimíd cuimhneamh go raibh a lán filíochta agus scéalta ag na sean-daoine sa nGaeltacht. Táimid ró-thugtha don scríobhnóireacht agus táimíd ag déanamh balbháin de na páistí.</P>
    <P>Do réir Bhunreacht an tSaorstáit, tá bun-oideachas le fagháil in aisce mar adubhairt an Teachta Diolúin.  Ní leor san.  Caithfear mean-oideachais, agus ceárd-oideacheas, agus árd-oideachas bheith le fagháil in aisce.  Tá £420,300 san meastachán i gcóir na meán-scoileanna. Ba mhaith liom comórtas d'fheiceáil idir an méid sin agus na táillí a híochtar.  Ní dóigh liom go gcimeádfadh na táillí na scoileanna so ar siubhal ar feadh rátha.  Is mar a gcéadna leis na hollscoileanna.  De bhrigh nách sroiseann ach 5 per cent. de lucht na mbun-scoil an mheanscoil agus níos lugha ná 1 per cent. an Ollscoil, is léir go bhfuil an duine bocht ag ioc as árd-oideachas mhic an duine shaidhbhir agus gan aon dul ag a mhac féin ar an oideachas san do ghnóthú.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil <Col N="141" /> scolárachtaí ann acht ní fiú biorán iad i gcomparáid le n-a bhfuil de dhaoine óga ar bhfiú árd-oideachas iad.  Má ólann sean-duine bocht braon uisge beatha, no má chaitheann sé tobac, tá sé ag cuidiú chun árd-oideachas do sholáthar do pháistí daoine saidhbhre agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil éagcóir á déanamh ar na daoine bochta san sa gceist seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tuarastal na múinteoirí náisiúnta, na daoine go bhfuil 95 per cent. d'aos óg na tíre ag brath orra chun oideachais, na daoine atá ag déanamh furmhór mór d'obair aithbheóchana na teangan, na daoine a mhúineann paidreacha agus Teagasc Críostaidhe do 100 per cent. d'aosánaigh na tíre, ní mhothuighim go bhfuil fonn dá laighead ar an Aire an gearradh trom do baineadh díobh do thabhairt ar ais dóibh.  Admhuigheann gach éinne nách bhfuil aon dream sa tír is mó le rá in gach nídh a bhaineann leis an dteangain.  Cloistear daoine ar ardánaibh ag cur alladhoire ar a lucht éisteachta leis an ngairmscoile &ldquo;gan teanga, gan tír,&rdquo; ach na daoine is comhachtaí chun an ghairmscoile sin do thabhairt chun críche an t-aon dream amháin, abhfuil tuarastal suas le 20 per cent. níos lugha acu indiú ná mar bhí acu an tráth cuireadh an Saorstát ar bun.  Is ait an sgéal é &mdash;méadú oibre agus luigheadú tuarastail. Gearradh airgead na múinteóirí i Sasana agus in Alban, ach má seadh, tá an gearradh sin slánuithe arís agus tá súil go ndéanfar amhlaidh ins na Sé Conndaethe.  Níor cuireadh aon bhreis ualaigh ná aon nua-dhualgas ar oidí na gceanntar san le 14 bliana ach mar sin féin, is fearr as iad ná oidí an tSaorstáit.</P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire mar gheall ar an oráid do thug sé i nGaedhilg.  Is maith an rud gur i nGaedhilg a tugadh isteach dhá Mheastachain indiú.  Muna labhrann na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí i nGaedhilg, ní tabharfar deagh-shompla do mhuinntir na tire.</P>

      <P>I think it is to be regretted that the speech of Deputy Breathnach was not uttered in the tongue of the Saxon, because the thoughts to which he gave expression so ably and eloquently in Irish would be of great help to a number of <Col N="142" /> people in this country who really are worried about the position of education, and especially what is known as primary education.  The House to-night is discussing the biggest of the 72 Votes to come before the House &mdash;the Old Age Pensions Vote almost equals it&mdash;and yet the casual way in which it is taken, even by such an advocate of education as Deputy Breathnach should be, is somewhat surprising. It strikes me that all the interest in and the basis, so to speak, of this question of education was the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the beginning that the Irish language is just a very small part indeed of the whole question of education in this country, as in any other country is the language which is spoken by the people, or by the teachers who teach it, or the language through which the education is imparted.  Education should be looked upon in a much broader and larger sense than what I would call the medium through which it is imparted.  Schools, teachers, pupils, school-books, school-furniture, the school buildings themselves&mdash;all these things play their part, but so does the language through which the instruction is imparted.  The education itself is so much bigger than even the type of instruction, the language through which it is imparted, the particular subjects in which instruction is given, that I regret that we have come in this House to discuss education, and particularly primary education, on one basis only, namely, are we teaching more Irish; are we making Irish more compulsory; are we teaching subjects through the medium of Irish which we should not; or are we not teaching subjects through the medium of Irish which we should?  We forget entirely the basic principles and the uses of it, the necessity for education, and what education is and should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that my own experience is that an improvement has taken place in the primary education system in this country as compared with, let us say, as Deputy Breathnach said, 20 years ago.  But, as one who is somewhat of an enthusiast for the revival of the Irish language, <Col N="143" /> I feel that there has been an undue concentration on what is called teaching through the medium of Irish as distinct from the teaching of Irish. I should like the Minister and his Department to think more of teaching children Irish than teaching through the medium of Irish.  Deputy Breathnach spoke of the number of children who go to a school in a certain part of this city who have not a word of Irish when they come in, and who, he said, in two or three years can speak Irish.  He told us that they are learning something through the medium of Irish.  Let us be perfectly frank with ourselves.  How could you learn something through a medium which you do not possess, with which you are not in contact, about which you know nothing?  Deputy Breathnach tells us that after two or three years they know something.  There are two or three years wasted.  Surely there is something more in education than the learning of something through the medium of Irish?  There would be the learning of Irish itself.  Even with the youngest child who goes to school there is always the matter of developing itself, helping to do something for itself, helping to know itself, to know what it is in the world, what it hopes to be and why it is in the world.  Education should not be confined, in this country or in any other country, to the learning of the language even that happens to be the language of the country.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the subject of that school, might I digress for a moment and ask the Minister when he is going to do for the townships what he has already done for the city, namely, establish a school in the townships which will do what Deputy Breathnach said&mdash;enable them to spend two or three years learning something through a medium which they do not understand and know nothing of?  I understand that nearly 50 per cent. of the children who go to that school in the city come from the townships.  It is about time for the Department to consider the advisability of relieving the unfortunate parents at least of the worry of seeing the children safely <Col N="144" /> into the centre of the city and then safely home again.</P>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with the Departmental insistence on what Deputy Breathnach called seriobhaoireacht. He says too much time is spent on writing in the schools.  I think that half enough time is not spent upon it, because what is most required in this country, and more required in this country than in any other, is some attempt at accuracy of thought.  The Deputy suggested that it would be much better that persons should spend their time learning Irish poetry or stories and so get more diffuse and more scattered in their minds and in their system of thinking.  Even in this House it would be interesting if persons who get up to speak here were asked to put what they want to say on a piece of paper and hand it into the Clerk to be handed to the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle. If that were so, we would be rid of many of the unfortunate and regrettable scenes that happen in this House which arise because we have not been trained in that close system of thinking or careful thought.  The only way to get people to think carefully and closely is to ask them to put down on a piece of paper what they think they are going to say.  Even if they spend two or three or four hours a week at it, it will have the effect that the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who will sit here 50 years hence may go to sleep while the work goes on, because there will be none of those wild outbursts, brainstorms, so to speak, as the third generation will have been trained through the system which the Minister is developing of getting even the youth to put it down on paper.  If you have something to say put it down in writing. It will take some generations before that will be developed.</P>
    <P>There is one thing to which I should like to refer.  I do not wish to give any undue publicity to it, but it is certain that it has been brought before the attention of every member of the Dáil; that is what we all hear with regard to the inspectorial system.  I should like to get from the Minister an assurance that the position with <Col N="145" /> regard to the inspectorial system is not as bad as it would appear to be I do not want to go into the matter any further.  There was in this country always an objection to inspection.  I suppose for many years to come there will be an objection to inspection whether it is the inspection of schools or inspection in the Civil Service or in the Army or any other kind of inspection. There will always be an objection to it.  Whether it is our desire for liberty, or whether it is because we do not distinguish between liberty and licence I do not know.  But I will say this that there is nothing more necessary, in my opinion, than inspection whether in the schools, the Army, the Police, the Civil Service or in any other place.  I expect it will be like that for two or three generations. When people begin to think rightly and clearly and put down in writing what they want to say the successors of the Ceann Comhairle and the country as a whole will derive advantage from it.</P>
    <P>In the development of the Irish language Deputy Breathnach said that we should imitate the English and send all our notices, processes, and so on, in the language that we desire to be used.  He said that if the people did not understand it they would go to somebody who did understand it.  The Deputy advised the Government to develop that aspect of the question.  I am surprised that the Deputy said that.  I have here a document the from of which was first printed many years ago.  It was, I think, about 1924.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Tá orm adhmhail go bhfhuaras do leitir agus feucaidheadh mé is teach san sgeul.</P>
    <P>A man came to me with that and asked: &ldquo;What does that mean?  Am I to get the job now?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think really that the Ministry should be congratulated on the way in which the work of the Department is being developed.  But I would not be unduly praiseworthy of its efforts with regard to the language.  Children, no matter where they live, except in the Gaeltacht, learn Irish for four or five years at school; they then go off to the new factories and never speak a word of the language afterwards. <Col N="146" /> What we want to develop, as far as the Irish language is concerned, is enthusiasm for it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer.  Perhaps it has not come within the purview of the Minister.  I refer to a habit that is developing in a large number of schools, or I should say it has developed in the case of a number of teachers throughout the country, of referring to matters of a political nature.  It has come to my knowledge that persons who are now dead, persons against whom the greatest patriot on those benches would say nothing, have been described by those teachers as traitors.  That is a regrettable thing.  That certainly is not educating the children.  I know it is a thing for which the Minister, or anybody in his Department, would not stand.  I hope that every opportunity will be taken by the Department to bring that type of&mdash;I should not call it education&mdash;disgraceful conduct to an end.  After all, if children are to be developed and if they are to be taught a sense of citizenship in the schools it will be impossible for them to have respect either for their teachers or for their Government, if one teacher describes the late General Collins as a traitor to his country or another teacher so describes President de Valera.  That sort of thing should be stopped at once.  I hope that the Minister, in his public pronouncements and the Department and inspectorial staff will do all they can to put an end to that; because whatever our political opinions and are whatever acerbities there may be between us as Parties I think it would be a regrettable thing that that sort of thing should be handed down to the next generation and handed down by persons unworthy or otherwise who certainly were never in contact with the people whom they now attack.</P>

Dubhairt sé ná raibh ann ach amaideacht an meastachán so do thabhairt isteach i nGaedhilg annso indiu.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil aon <Col N="147" /> chosaint annso d'Aire gur mhian leis a chuid oibre do dhéanamh i nGaedhilg.  Bíonn a lán cainnte gach bliain, nuair a bhíonn an meastachán so os cóir na Dála, ar staid na Gaedhilge i gcúrsaí oideachais.  Is ceart san, mar ar an oideachais atá beatha nó bás na Gaedhilge ag brath.

Nuair a bhí an tAire Cosanta ag labhairt bhí an Teachta Diolúin á cháineadh san dóigh chéadna, agus is mór an truagh é.  Moladh in ionad cáinte atá tuillte ag na hAirí seo.  Ón gcéad uair a chuaidh an tAire Oideachais i gceann na Roinne chuir sé an meastachán os comhair na Dála i nGaedhilg agus is droch-shompla do mhuinntir na tíre bheith ag cáineadh Aire mar gheall ar labhairt na Gaedhilge annso.  Bhí a lán cainnte ar staid na Gaedhilge agus ar staid oideachais, agus ní mian liom dul siar ar an gcainnt sin.  Tá a lán ráidhte agus scríobhtha ar an nGaedhilg mar gléas teagaisc ins na mBun-Scoileanna. Do labhair an tAire ar an gceist sin indiú agus tá súil agam do socróchaidh sin an sgéal.  Nuair a cuireadh Coimisiún ar bun fén gcéad Dáil, thug siad isteach molta ar an gceist seo. Leanadh den socrú do rinneadh an t-am san.

Bhí scéim mar sin i bhfeidhm i gCondae Luimnighe roinnt blian ó shoin agus d'eirigh leis go maith.  Ach, chun airgid do shábháil, do ghearr an Comhairle an deontas seo amach.

Do choimeád an scéim sin na daoine óga le chéile agus leanadar de labhairt na Gaedhilge ar fhágailt na scoile dhóibh.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil ag eirighe chomh maith leis an scéim atá i bhfeidhm anois is d'eirigh leis an sean-scéim, agus ba mhaith an rud dá ndéanfadh an t-Aire an sgéal seo d'iniúchadh go geur.</P>

Mar adubhairt an <Col N="149" /> Teachta O Súilleabháin, is é seo an meastachán is tábhachtaí a bhíonn againn le plé.  Caithtear níos mó airgid ar an meastachán so ná mar a caithtear ar aon mheastachán eile agus is ceart é do scrúdú go géar agus go cúramach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, the only question that arises is what method of approaching the teaching of the Irish language is going to succeed in making this country Gaelic.  In my view for the last ten or 12 years we have had in regard to the Irish language the policy of the jack-boot.  I have watched the application of that very closely, particularly in my own constituency, a large part of which is predominantly Gaelic, and I must say that whether it is due to the policy of the jack-boot or for other reasons, the Gaelicising of my county is not advancing; in fact, the Irish language there is going backwards and that, I think, is a very regrettable position.  One might be inclined to use Party weapons in regard to a position of that kind, but I refuse to do that.  Inaugurating a policy for the re-Gaelicisation of the country without having any previous experience in such a mission, it is only natural that difficulties will arise and that there will be errors and perhaps failure will attend the best intentions. It is quite easy to criticise, and the Irish people in general are adepts at that.  As a people, we are very good for criticising, but we lack constructive criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a matter of this kind, what I generally do is I look at it from the historical aspect, and see what the background is.  It is unquestioned that at one time this country was Gaelic; Gaelic was the language of Tara; but to-day the Gaelic speaking people are back in a narrow strip west of the Shannon.  When we speak of Gaelic Ireland we have in mind that narrow strip west of the Shannon. How did that state of affairs come about?  It was due to invasion, the invaders coming from the east, settling themselves in the east and then spreading westwards.  As they proceeded westwards they carried their language and their customs with them and their language was the Anglo-Saxon language.  I wonder can any moral be drawn from that?  Could we not now adopt, in the Gaelicising of Ireland, the policy that was so successful in de-Gaelicising Ireland in the past, and that is to proceed from the west towards the east?  I quite admit, <Col N="151" /> without any reservation, that you are making the country bilingual, that every child who goes to school, whether in Donegal, Wexford, Dublin or Louth, has two languages.  But the question is are you really Gaelicising Ireland?  Are you driving out the English language?  Have you any hope of making Ireland Gaelic-speaking?</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy here who will maintain that Irish is holding its own in the Gaelic areas, the areas, for instance, that were Gaelic when I was a child?  There may be some who will argue that, but it is pure moonshine. In the townland where I was born, at one time there was not a house in which the people did not speak Irish; the entire language of the townland was Gaelic.  To-day, there are only two people, old age pensioners, a man and a woman, who speak the language. The man is bilingual, English and Irish, and the woman speaks nothing but Irish.  All the children going to school from this townland are bilingual, but it cannot be said that they are Gaelic speaking.  The moment they leave school, back they go to the English language.</P>
    <P>If we are to make a success of this language movement, then we must not have organisations competing against each other; one political party must not compete with another.  I think such a thing is a crime against the country.  It is regrettable that politicians should adopt such deplorable methods when seeking the votes of the electors.  In their desire to become politicians there are some who try the backdoor or the side door or come in by the skylight and they will adopt any device in order to get votes. There are certain organisations that will countenance such methods.  Until this thing is wiped out, this attempt by organisations to outshine other organisations in their effort to help the Irish language, I do not think we are going to get very far.  I am definitely of the opinion that if you are going to encourage language development, you must proceed from the Gaelic area towards the east; in other words, adopt the same policy as those who succeeded in stifling the language <Col N="152" /> in the past.  Do not begin in Wicklow, Wexford or Louth, the same policy that you are adopting in the west, because I do not think it will succeed. I do not wish to be dogmatic; I merely wish to propound something that will be helpful in the matter. The policy of the jack-boot is being applied and I must honestly say that it is not succeeding.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the question of school buildings.  So far as very many of our school buildings are concerned, I have nothing but contempt for them. They are, in my opinion, antiquated and some of them are barbarous.  I should like to know from the Minister how many schools in this country are built over 100 years; how many built over 50 years&mdash;between that and 100 years&mdash;and how many schools have been built upwards of 50 years ago, in which there has been no practical reconstruction work done in the meantime. There are such schools in my constituency.  As a matter of fact, there is a school in the parish in which I was born which is, probably, almost 150 years old and there has been no practical structural alteration in that school since.  It is badly lighted, badly ventilated; there is no accommodation for the number of children in it and no sanitary arrangements except such as can only be described as barbarous; no other word describes it.  Now, £200,000 is voted here for new school buildings.  We are spending over £1,000,000 in this State annually for the housing of the people. A lot of people are clapping themselves on the back about what has been done in that connection. Houses are built for people, and the people of the future, generally, are the children of to-day.  The children go out to school each day and, very often, as in many parts of my own constituency, they have to walk four or five miles to school.  They get up early in the morning and they have to leave their homes very early so as to be in time for school.  They come home in the evening and get something to eat and then they are knocking about the fields and laneways till bed time; but, roughly, from eight o'clock in the morning they have to spend the major portion of the day <Col N="153" /> in schools of the type I have described &mdash;over 150 years old, badly lighted, badly ventilated, no proper sanitary accommodations&mdash;and at the same time we clap ourselves on the back for what we are doing in other directions while we herd these children all together in a den of this type during the day.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health pats himself on the back for what he is doing to house the people.  I also would pat him on the back for that, but I would also give a clap on the back to the Minister for Education if he would only take the bit in his teeth and make up his mind here and now that every school of over 50 years' standing in this country would be either rebuilt or extensively reconstructed. So bad is this in the very parish in which I was born that I threatened to get an order from the county medical officer of health closing four schools in the parish&mdash;I felt so strongly about this matter.  Ultimately, when things become a disease of that kind, one tends to become a revolutionary.  I am not a revolutionary, but so far as the rebuilding of these schools is concerned I am prepared to be one on this matter.</P>
    <P>Now, in the rebuilding of these schools I notice that there does not seem to be any tendency at all to make provision for the future with regard to the raising of the school-leaving age. Apparently they are being constructed for, approximately, their present attendance.  It is a very bad thing, I know, to set up to be a prophet, but I venture to suggest that, in the future of this country, it is inevitable that the school-leaving age will be raised&mdash;overwhelming circumstances are accumulating which will make that inevitable.  I shall come presently to one of the most important of these circumstances. Apparently, as I said, no cognisance at all is being taken of the fact that you will raise the school-leaving age, and that probably also we will send children to school earlier, and that there will be a kindergarten section to the ordinary national school. If, as Deputy Dillon suggested, the bus services will be extended to collect children, obviously it will mean that parents will send the children earlier <Col N="154" /> to school, and hence the necessity for this kindergarten in the school.  The population of this country is increasing. There is a serious problem of unemployment, and I think it would be much better, no matter what the cost that for another year or two years at least the school-leaving age should be increased by one year, and that the aim should be to increase it to two years.  I would suggest to the Minister to keep that in mind so far as the building of any schools in the future is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, and that is the question of the reformatory schools&mdash; not so much to the schools themselves as to the figures, because I wish to link it up with, and to direct the Minister's attention to the primary schools and their connection with the reformatory schools.  Deputy Dillon referred to-night, and Mr. Justice Hanna speaking here in the city on, I think, St. Patrick's night, also referred to the increase in juvenile crimes in this country.  Of course, to those of us who are connected with the law, that has been apparent for some time.  Deputy Dillon, speaking to-night, suggested that the reply of the Minister for Education would be that that was a matter for the Minister for Justice, and that the Minister for Justice, when asked, would say: &ldquo;Oh, I have nothing to do with that; that is a matter coming under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education,&rdquo; and that it would be brushed aside in that manner. I do not think we can pass away from this problem so lightly.  It is not a thing to be brushed aside lightly in that manner.  I think there is direct responsibility here, and that this House should not completely brush the question to one side.  If we take into consideration the fact that the children that are dealt with in children's courts are children under 16 years of age&mdash;and I noted that, when Deputy Dillon was speaking, he told us he had visited Summerhill and noticed there a child of three in with children of 11, 12 and 13 years of age; so the House will observe, according to what Deputy Dillon witnessed, that a lot of the children going to reformatory schools are children under the <Col N="155" /> school age&mdash;it makes one consider what is the purpose of the Minister and his Department.  If we had the average number of pupils in the reformatory schools&mdash;and last year we had an increase of 19&mdash;is there not some food for reflection there?  What is our education aiming at?  Where is it leading to?  I venture to suggest that the main purpose of education, over and above language of any kind&mdash;Irish, English or any other language&mdash;is to teach the children the main purpose of their creation, and that is to observe the law of God and the cognate law, the civil law.  It will not do for the Minister to say that it is not his responsibility, because we have all equal responsibility.  We are all here in charge of the affairs of this State and trying to help it, whether we are in Opposition or in the Government.  Last year there was an increase of 19 in admissions to reformatory schools, and you may take it that, in the main, these were school-going children or children only two years after leaving school.</P>
    <P>We find that a sum of in or about £3,000,000 is being spent on primary education.  If education does not teach children to be good citizens, to be obedient to the Law of God and to the civil law, then in my opinion it has failed in its purpose.  It has failed both from the theological and the civic point of view.  Hence, it has failed altogether, and instead of education of that kind it would be better if children were taken behind a bush or a hedge and taught the contents of the penny catechism.  Mr. Justice Hanna's statement revealed an alarming state of things.  It will not do for the Minister for Education to say &ldquo;Well, what can I do?; the Minister for Justice has the responsibility for sending them on to the courts.&rdquo;  I suggest that it is the Department of Education and the children's parents who have that responsibility.  There is a joint and several responsibility between the parents and the schools. In my opinion, this is a matter for very serious consideration.  Of course, there are others as well as the parents and the schools.  The Church has an <Col N="156" /> important part to play in all this. During the last couple of years we have all observed and read the appeals made by the ecclesiastical authorities to parents to exercise stricter control over their children.  But, apparently, their appeals have fallen on barren ground.</P>
    <P>I wonder is this increase in juvenile crime due in any way to the fact that parents have become more tenderhearted and that they resent the correction of their children at school.  I would be very strongly opposed to the infliction of unnecessary punishment on children in school, but it must be admitted that some children require to be corrected.  If there is a bold child in a school giving bad example then the master should have the power to inflict reasonable punishment on that child.  I think it must be admitted too, that there is a good deal of laxity in the exercise of parental control in many homes.  When the children from such homes pass to the schools, the masters are sometimes afraid to correct them, The result is that the children go out into the world without any sense of responsibility, and with no respect for their parents or teachers, or for the Law of God or the civil law.  As a consequence, they find their way into the reformatory schools.  I think if we were to relate these two matters: the fact that a number of the children attending primary schools eventually find their way into the reformatories, we will find that education is responsible for it.  If there is an increase in juvenile crime then there must be something wrong.  That something can only be wrong in two places&mdash;in the home and in the school: in one or other or both. I think that members of this House, irrespective of the Party they belong to, as well as public men, teachers, parents and the Church have a great responsibility in this matter.  If the curve of juvenile crime is rising rapidly then serious steps should be taken to meet that.  Whatever reform is necessary should be instituted to deal with the evil.</P>
    <P>There are numerous complaints about the policy of the Department in the matter of the amalgamation of <Col N="157" /> schools.  Amalgamation, I suppose, is desirable where it can be carried out in suitable cases, but if the purpose behind it is to save expenditure and, thereby disemploy teachers, it is a policy that is to be regretted.  I suppose the case put up for it is that the attendance at the schools concerned has fallen very low.  In my own constituency I have heard that the suggestion has been put forward to amalgamate two schools.  If such a scheme were carried out there, it would mean that in one case the children would have to be brought away from the foot of a very steep mountain and taken to a school on the opposite side of a valley.  The Department suggested that a motor car should be employed to take the children the five or six miles to be travelled.  Some of the parents objected to this and wrote to me about it.  I believe that the parish priest was anxious that the amalgamation should take place, but apparently the parents revolted.  It was discovered, too, that you cannot compel a child who has to travel more than three miles to attend school.  The matter dropped in any case.  In another case there was a proposal to build the new school which would mean the amalgamation of two existing schools.  I do not want to go into details of this case, but I think that this policy can be pushed too far. There are stretches of country where the attendance at schools was quite good in the past, but owing, perhaps, to the passing economic depression marriages have not in recent years been as numerous as in previous years and there are fewer children of school-going age.  It does not necessarily follow that that state of affairs will continue.</P>
    <P>In barren parts of Donegal it is very drastic to expect children to walk four or five miles to school along a mountain road, where there is no protection, in all kinds of weather.  As a matter of fact, I am afraid parents will not agree to that.  Whether parents agree or not, it is unnatural to expect children to leave small homes on a winter's day, perhaps poorly clad and poorly fed, and to walk to school in all kinds of weather.  Even though <Col N="158" /> the juvenile population has fallen in a district, the present attendance at schools should not be taken as a criterion, and the amalgamation of schools should not be pushed too far.  I strongly object to amalgamation when it results in the unemployment of teachers. When schools are amalgamated, it is possible that teachers will be expected to deal with too many children.  There are cases in Dublin which are preposterous, where there are from 40 to 50 children in a class.  It is idle to suggest that any teacher could teach that number of pupils.  It is utterly impossible.  By amalgamating schools in the rural areas, the only result will be the displacement of teachers.  That will put a burden on those in charge of the amalgamated schools that they will not be capable of performing.  No one suggests that a teacher could take a class of adults containing more than ten or 14 persons.  If that is so, how can it be suggested that a teacher could take a class of from 40 to 50 young children?  I think that is bad educational policy.  I think it is folly, and that it cannot be done.  In my opinion it is vital that children from six to 12 years should get personal attention from teachers.  Unless the groundwork is laid, then it will be difficult to do so afterwards.  Where there are proposals for the amalgamation of schools, I suggest to the Minister that he should consider them very carefully, and that he should not take the immediate population as a criterion. Certainly, he should not start cheeseparing on the question of salaries of teachers.  That would be taking a very short view and would be penalising education.</P>
