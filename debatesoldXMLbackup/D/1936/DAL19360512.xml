      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state how many foreigners employed by the Irish Sugar Company have applied for certificates of naturalisation under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935; the positions occupied in the Sugar Company by each such applicant, and indicate whether certificates have been or will be granted in each case.</P>

      <P>Thirteen foreigners employed in the Irish Sugar Company, Ltd., have applied for certificates of naturalisation. Three of the applicants are described as factory managers, two as engineers, one as a machine engineer, two as chief electricians, two as evaporator cooks, one as a fitter, one as a mechanic, and one as a manipulator. Certificates of naturalisation have not so far been granted to any of the applicants.  I am not at present prepared to say whether any such certificates will be granted.</P>

      <P>It is necessary that foreign technologists should be employed in connection with this industry.  Without their assistance no industry of this kind could have been established or kept going. The employment of a very large number of Irish citizens depends upon the competence of the technical staff employed by this company. Its success and their employment depend upon the retention here of the services of foreign technicians. I am aware that efforts have been made by parties acting from ulterior motives outside this House to organise a campaign against the employment of these experts and technicians.  I want to prevent any impression being created that there is any hostility existing against these people on the part of the people of this country or of the Government. We appreciate the assistance they gave us in developing the sugar industry in this country, and hope that their services will continue to be available so long as they are required to keep the industry going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that with a relatively limited outlook for engineers in this country <Col N="4" /> every step should be taken by his Department to ensure that the maximum possible number of such people would be employed in an industry of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what steps were taken by him to ensure that Irish engineers and chemists, employed by the Irish Sugar Company to understudy temporary foreign experts, will be given adequate opportunities of studying in detail their future work with a view to their employment ultimately to fill the positions now held by the foreign experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied from investigations carried out by my Department that arrangements are in force whereby nationals are trained to replace aliens in pursuance of the condition attached to the permits issued to Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann Teoranta under the Aliens Order, 1925 and 1935, in respect of the employment of these aliens, which required that the services of the aliens should be utilised for the purpose of training Saorstát nationals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish nationals who are employed by this company for the purpose of being trained in the various technical processes associated with the industry have been given adequate opportunities of acquiring the information, knowledge and experience that will qualify them at some stage to exercise executive functions and to fulfil the work necessary for the proper conduct of the industry.  The training which they are getting could not have been given to them and could not now be given to them if the foreign technologists in the employment of the company were not available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state why recognition of the Respondency of Trinity College, Dublin, as the equivalent of an honours degree for the purposes of the award of the special honours degree increment of salary under the secondary teachers' salary scheme was withdrawn without any notice by the Department of Education, said recognition having been granted for the preceding ten years; and if he will state why he refused to receive a deputation from the Schoolmasters' Association and the Association of Secondary Teachers to discuss the matter, in view of the objection of the teachers to the absence of notice that the Department intended taking the action referred to; and if he will state why notice was not given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recognition of the Respondency of Trinity College, Dublin, as the equivalent of an honours degree for the purposes of the award of the special honours degree increments of salary under the rules for the payment of incremental salary to secondary teachers was withdrawn because my Department, on consideration of the question, came to the conclusion that this qualification, which is a grading of the pass B.A. degree of the University of Dublin, is not the equivalent of a first or second class honours degree as contemplated under the rules, and the Department could not continue a position which conferred a privilege upon pass graduates of the University of Dublin, which is denied to graduates of other Universities.  It is understood that students who hope to be classified as Respondents do not require to undertake any special course of study for the purpose, apart from the ordinary pass courses of the University, and since only one application for the recognition of the Respondency was received by the Department during the period of nine years preceding the date on which recognition was withdrawn, there seemed to be no serious necessity for giving notice of the alteration or delaying the rectification of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> The Department's decision has been explained in correspondence with the associations mentioned in the Deputy's question, and in the circumstances I did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by discussing the matter further with the suggested deputation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as this degree has been recognised since 1926 with a full knowledge of the position, and since the status of the degree has undergone no change since then, does not the Minister appreciate that the withdrawal of the recognition constitutes a serious hardship on teachers who obtained that degree in preceding years?  I wonder would the Minister see his way to mitigate that hardship by at least restoring the recognition for the current year?  Will the Minister see myself or Deputy Professor Thrift on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Alone, I suppose, among the sons of Adam, yearly I must discipline myself to the reading of what the critics said about the Budget of the preceding year. I make no merry carnival of that tedious task, for I can assure the House that there is more joy to be found in the Book of Lamentations.  My toil fulfilled, however, it is a relief to pass from that realm of dark foreboding into the real and factual world; to find there, as we do to-day, that after all there has been no drying-up of revenue, no failure of the income-tax, and no unjustifiable or improvident borrowing. I admit willingly that for this satisfactory state of affairs we owe much to the general improvement in world economic conditions.  But when every allowance is made for that and other circumstances, there still remains the fact that the buoyancy of the revenue has been so remarkable and so general that some part of the economic recovery which it indicates must be ascribed to the new agricultural and industrial policies which, under the <Col N="9" /> leadership of the present Government, our people have adopted.  A modest claim, which I think no one can gainsay.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the actual figures I should, perhaps, remind you that last year it was estimated that our total revenue from all sources would amount to £29,386,000.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the account, after making the usual allowances, it was anticipated that expenditure at £29,376,000 would fall just within our revenue by £10,000.</P>
      <P>What was the actual outcome?  The revenue rose to £30,601,620 and would have exceeded even this figure by almost another £70,000 if in January last we had not remitted the coal duty. Against this we had issues from the Exchequer on account of the Central Fund and Supply Services amounting to £31,106,840.  But these included payments in respect of property losses compensation, and on account of land, plant and buildings for the new industrial alcohol factories, as well as for land for afforestation, and the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan.  All told, these amounted to £461,003; and as they are all proper to be met by borrowing, reduce the gross figure to £30,645,837.  Against the actual revenue, this leaves an apparent deficit of £44,217.</P>
      <P>The reduced figure of £30,645,837, in turn includes the sum of £2,273,000, which was actually paid out for export bounties and subsidies.  As we had proposed to meet one-half of this service out of borrowed moneys, some would hold that in arriving at the final result for the year we are entitled to take our original intentions in this regard into consideration, and on that basis to say that there was a Budget surplus of £1,092,000.  Not everyone will accept this view, but the figures do in any event show a reasonable margin and afford us the assurance that the Budget, which is the keystone of the public finances, was sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning now to the individual heads of revenue, Income-Tax and Surtax gave us £5,208,000 as compared with the Budget Estimate of £5,005,000 and a receipt of £4,868,000 for 1934-35.  An <Col N="10" /> increase of £340,000 in income-tax is an emphatic indication of the economic improvement which took place during the year.  Then the yield from Corporation Profits Tax rose from £481,000 for 1934-35 to £513,000 in 1935-36, and though the receipt from Stamp Duties at £952,000 showed a falling-off, this was chargeable against the Sweepstakes Duty only, for the return from stamps on ordinary commercial transactions was up by £18,000 on the figures for the preceding year.  From Estate Duties we got £1,125,000 as against a receipt of £963,000 in 1934-35, and though there was a slight falling-off in the Excess Profits Duty, nevertheless, at £227,000 it was £7,000 better than we had hoped for.</P>
    <P>We find, therefore, that in the aggregate the Inland Revenue Taxes, being mainly taxes on income and property, last year produced 32 per cent. of the general tax revenue, or £8,025,000 as compared with the Budget Estimate of £7,630,000 and a receipt of £7,611,000 for the year 1934-35.  The real extent of the improvement, moreover, was masked by the declines in the Sweepstake Duty and the Excess Profits Duty.  If allowance be made for these, the yield from taxes on income and property was up by £553,000.</P>
    <P>Before reviewing the Customs and Excise duties I may remark that the Road Fund secured £1,000,000 from the motor vehicle duties, as compared with an Estimate of £940,000 and a receipt in the preceding year of £942,000.  Further signs of the improvement in business and economic conditions generally will be found in the increased receipts from the Post Office and from wireless broadcasting and in the improvement which has been manifested in the collection of land annuities and local rates.</P>
    <P>A first glance at the figures for the Excise shows that the receipt therefrom, though £425,000 better than in the preceding year, was nevertheless £19,000 short of the Estimate at £5,980,000.  The short-fall occurred under two principal heads.  One was the Excise duty of 6d. per gallon on dutiable home-refined mineral hydro-carbon light oils.  Here the actual receipt, at £11,365, was over £63,000 less than the Estimate, due <Col N="11" /> no doubt to some delay in the refinery coming into full production. The second short-fall took place in the Excise duty on home-grown tobacco. It had been anticipated that a substantial percentage of the 1934 home crop would be cleared from bond to pay duty in 1935-36 and the Estimate was accordingly made at £160,000. The clearance in fact was much smaller, making the actual yield £32,158 or £127,842 less than the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Some time ago when I commented on the fact that for the first time in many years the downward tendency of the beer duty seemed to have been arrested, a Deputy was moved to remark that &ldquo;we were driving the people to drink!&rdquo; It was a fair hit, and commenting upon it now I need only say that as an attack upon the policy of the Government, it was staggering.  Perhaps also, however, I ought to add the warning that even a good thing may be said too often, before I proceed to inform the House that the Excise duty on Irish brewed beer yielded £2,754,088, which, being £86,000 up on 1934-35, was £54,000 over the Estimate and the highest yield since 1930-31.  For the first time also since 1928-29 the duty on Irish-distilled spirits showed an upward tendency and gave us £1,722,474, where in the preceding year we got only £1,673,538.  The return from table waters likewise expanded, the Customs duty on beer almost made a record at £225,519, and from foreign spirits we had the highest yield since 1931-32.  However we may deplore it, there is but one explanation for all this: People last year had more money to spend in this way and they spent it.  Even the wine duty, which had been declining from 1928-29, showed an improvement, and at £178,809 was £7,168 better than the year before.</P>
    <P>Betting duty went up to £169,708, the highest figure reached since 1931-32.  From the duty on bookmakers' premises and clubs and from licences of all descriptions, we collected £318,764 or £11,500 more than the year before.  But from the entertainments duty we got only £255,291, <Col N="12" /> as against an Estimate of £260,000 and £205,743 in the year before.  Last year the entertainments duty on cinema shows was substantially but not altogether profitably increased.</P>
    <P>The Excise duty on sugar, at £301,772, exceeded the Estimate by £1,772, and the preceding year's yield by £215,057.  This represents not a great gain but a great loss to the Exchequer, for the Excise duty chargeable at the moment is only ½d. per lb. and must be compared with the 2¼d. per lb. levied as a Customs duty on foreign-manufactured sugar, which brought us in £653,063. I hope I shall be pardoned if I dilate a little on the question of the sugar taxes.</P>
    <P>All sugar consumed in Saorstát Eireann is chargeable to one or other of two duties: Excise duty at the rate of ½d. per lb. if it be of Saorstát manufacture; or a Customs duty of 2¼d. per lb. if it be of foreign manufacture. From these duties the Exchequer last year secured altogether £954,835, the average rate of duty levied on all the sugar consumed being 1d. per lb.</P>
    <P>For the greater part of 1931-32 Customs duty on foreign-manufactured sugar was charged at 1¾d. per lb., while the Excise duty, which I should emphasise is the duty which is chargeable on the Irish-made article, was ½d. per lb., just as it is now.  But in 1931-32, 91 per cent. of our total consumption, or 83,500 tons, was imported from abroad as against only 32,479 tons last year.  And duty at the rate of 1¾d. per lb. was collected on most of that 83,500 tons, bringing £1,331,012 into the Exchequer that year.  Furthermore, duty at the rate of ½d. per lb. was charged in the same year on the 8,500 tons of home-produced sugar, which represented the remaining 9 per cent. of our total consumption, and it brought in £40,889.  Thus in 1931-32, £1,371,901 was collected off 92,000 tons of sugar consumed, and the average rate of the tax was 1.6d. per lb.</P>
    <P>The House may care now to compare the position with Northern Ireland where all foreign manufactured sugar brought in bears a tax of 1¼d. per lb.  On our present yearly consumption of sugar alone an all round <Col N="13" /> duty of 1¼d. would give us about £1,200,000.  We could bring our revenue from sugar up to that level quite easily, therefore, and in addition reduce the present retail price of the article by 1d. or 1¼d. per lb., if we were to do as is done across the Border&mdash;import all the sugar we consume. But are we prepared to throw the beet-fields back into pasture and to leave our sugar factories to the rats and the moss?</P>
    <P>I must refer to the duty on pig carcases and parts, which in 1934-35 brought in £289,442, before I pass to a consideration of the Customs revenue. At the date of its abolition last year it had brought in £241,249.</P>
    <P>The Customs for the year gave us £10,223,000 against an Estimate of £9,607,000 and an actual yield in the preceding year of £9,445,552.  I have already mentioned the very satisfactory returns from the Customs duties on beer and spirits, wine and other commodities.  The House, therefore, will not be surprised to learn that the Customs yield from tobacco was well above the Estimate.  But when I say that it was £387,754 above it, and at £4,177,754 was £500,000 more than last year, many will think of the plant not as a weed but as a mint.  The tobacco duties, therefore, gave us £4,209,912. But this was not their only satisfactory feature.  Last year we had to increase the tobacco duty.  All other things being equal, a tax increase on any article is calculated to decrease consumption, for which when making an Estimate an allowance must be made.  But what actually happened? The consumption of tobacco did not decrease; it soared to a new high level at 9,792,147 lbs.  This Government has a lot to answer for.  We have been told that it is driving the people to drink more, but apparently it is compelling them to smoke more as well! And there may be even worse to follow.</P>
    <P>There is worse, in fact, because what happened with tobacco happened also with petrol.  The Customs duty on the commodity produced £1,179,991, against an Estimate of £1,010,000, making with the Excise the highest yield ever recorded.  It is indeed an infamous Government under which not merely <Col N="14" /> are the people spending more on wines and beer and spirits, and more than ever before on tobacco and entertainment, but are spending more on motorcars and petrol as well.</P>
    <P>Then we have sugar.  Because the sugar Customs only gave £653,063 as against £1,003,743 in 1934-35, the total revenue from sugar was down by £135,623.  But the consumption of sugar went up from 100,435 tons in 1934-35 to 102,304 tons in 1935-36.  Incidentally the average rate of duty charged on the sugar consumed fell by 4d. per lb.</P>
    <P>The tea duty was slightly disappointing. It gave us £353,783.  We had hoped for £365,000.  From cinema films we got £63,949 or £10,000 more than in the preceding year.  The duty on wheat brought in £172,134.  This year, due to increased native cultivation, it is not expected to yield more than £150,000.  The duties on boots and shoes, clothing and apparel produced £704,389 against £816,374 in the preceding year, while the coal duty had brought in £392,644 when it was withdrawn as from 25th January last.  The abolition of this tax was a heavy loss to the Exchequer and has forestalled an alternative remission of taxation which in the normal course would have been made in the present Budget. From remaining miscellaneous Customs duties we got £1,598,924.  Our Estimate for them was £1,764,600.</P>
    <P>Before I deal briefly with the position of our State debt I should refer to the conversion of the First National Loan.  The operation was undertaken last December and its success surpassed our most sanguine hopes.  No less than 93.6 per cent. in number of the holders, representing 97.4 per cent. of the amount held, elected to convert, while the amount of cash applications received for the new Loan was £2,422,100.  To show how our public issues are widespread among the community, I may mention that just prior to the conversion offer there were no less than 9,091 subscribers of the original stock whose holdings were £500 or less nominal value.  And these included 3,844 holders of £100 and less. There were also 2,189 applications for £500 and under among the cash applications <Col N="15" /> for the new Loan and these included 772 for £100 and under.</P>
    <P>It would not be fitting, and I should be most unwilling to pass away from this section of my speech without acknowledging heartily and sincerely the ready support and co-operation which was afforded the conversion proposals by all sections of the Oireachtas, by those who sit opposite us, by those who sit here and on our left, and by our banks, by the Stock Exchange, by the Press and by investors and the public generally.  It was a manifestation of public-spirited unison which I am sure commended itself to all who wish our country well.  I have only to add that the success of the conversion operation has reduced the annual burden on the Exchequer by £391,000.</P>
    <P>The conversion and redemption of the First National Loan mark a stage in the history of our Exchequer.  It is therefore opportune to review our State debt.  On occasion I may have made this a tedious business, and it is an aspect of our affairs which may engender much controversy.  But I shall try to be as brief as possible. Indeed, in order to curtail controversy I shall at once present to any Deputy who may claim them as many millions of gold-ounces as he may need to gild his arguments.  For now we can only look back to the days of the old gold standard as to a far-receding shore, and must consider our position on a purely objective basis in relation to the tide of world tendencies as it is flowing to-day.</P>
    <P>The burden of our direct Exchequer obligations at the 31st March, 1936, amounted to £55,356,678, and was constituted as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It will thus be seen that, while on the face of the figures we appear to have direct Exchequer obligations amounting to £55,356,678, we likewise have offsetting cash assets and sound advances to the value of £31,502,335, so that our actual net debt would appear to be £23,854,343.  The figures, however, are subject to certain adjustments which I shall make later and at this stage I merely give them provisionally.</P>
    <P>In view of the radical currency <Col N="17" /> changes which have taken place since September, 1931, the earliest year with which a valid comparison may be made is 1931-32.</P>
    <P>The published statements available show that, at 31st March, 1932, comparable State liabilities amounted to £38,686,000, against which there were cash and other assets valued at £16,312,498, so that the actual uncovered net debt at 31st March, 1932, amounted to £22,373,502.  Again the figures are given provisionally.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Other Capital Liabilities the most notable increase which has occurred since March, 1932, is to be found in the item Land Acts 1923 to 1933, which then stood at £2,397,000, but at 31st March last totalled £14,605,000.  The increase arises from two causes; first, the increased activity of the Land Commission under the 1933 Land Act; and second, the reductions of from 50 per cent. to 55 per cent. in land annuities, granted by that Act to all tenant-purchasers.  In the case of purchasers under the 1923 and subsequent Acts the capital liability remitted to the tenants and assumed by the State in consequence of these reductions is no less than £12,000,000 and is expected ultimately to rise to about £16,000,000.  Even at its present figure it is more than four times the annual value of the land annuities which were formerly paid over to Great Britain.  The aggregate capital value of the concession granted to those who purchased under the pre-1923 Land Acts is much larger, and if by any chance its cost had to be met, would fall much more heavily on our resources, but as no additional debt charge has been created in regard to it there is no corresponding entry in the list of State liabilities.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase also in the State's liability in respect of Savings Certificates (principal and interest) which at 31st March last was computed to be £10,175,000 as compared with £8,151,288 on the corresponding date in 1932; while the net principal, after deduction of accrued interest, of the Savings Certificates outstanding was £7,754,000 as against £7,030,088 in 1932.  I have no <Col N="18" /> doubt whatever that were we to make the yield on certificates slightly more attractive we could considerably increase our borrowings under this head.  But for reasons with which I do not wish at this stage to burden the House.  I do not consider it advisable to do so.  I shall merely say that of set policy I have so regulated the rate of interest upon our Savings Certificates as to keep our liabilities in regard to them within modest and reasonable limits.  It is therefore not a matter of concern to me, nor need it be to others, that the amount paid out of the Exchequer last year in respect of the principal of Savings Certificates exceeds by £28,000 the amount paid in.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact to which I have just referred it has been argued that among the less well circumstanced of our population the rate of saving has declined.  A glance, however, at the records of that great thrift institution, the Post Office Savings Bank, and of the Trustee Savings Banks, will disprove such a contention.  At 31st March, 1932, the amount due to depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank was £3,750,333.  At 31st March. 1936, on a safe estimate, the final figures not being available, it was £6,734,000; while as between November, 1931, and November, 1935, the deposits of the Trustee Savings Banks here rose from £1,265,602 to £1,754,485.  Need I say more?</P>
    <P>It is convenient, however, to give just now the combined figures for the Savings Certificates in issue and the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks for the same two years.  In 1931-32 the aggregate figure for Savings Certificates and deposits in the Savings Banks was £13,167,223, while for 1935-36 it was £18,663,485&mdash;an increase of almost £5,500,000 in four years.  Figures such as these give no support to the more reckless controversialists who allege that since March, 1932, the poor have been growing poorer, and that we have been consuming our substance and living on our reserves.  On the contrary, they show that we are adding to our reserves.  More important still, they indicate that, so far as its financial basis is concerned, the expansion <Col N="19" /> which has taken place in our industrial activity has not been excessive or unwarranted.</P>
    <P>I had intended to deal in detail with the Exchequer assets which constitute the other side of the State's balance sheet; but as I wish to elucidate the true position in regard to the Local Loans Fund, I shall pass on at once to a consideration of it.</P>
    <P>The advances to the Local Loans Fund constitute the biggest Exchequer asset.  On 31st March last these were taken at £12,841,195, and in the figures which we have given for 1932 stood at £2,536,237.  The former figure, however, includes the disputed item of £5,432,087 in respect of old Local Loans.  So that to make the figures comparable it is necessary to add to the 1932 figure the sum of £6,192,665 in respect of old Local Loans outstanding on that date, together with a further sum of £343,000 in respect of interest on these advances, or a total of £6,535,665.  The truly comparable figures for the advances are, therefore, for 1931-32 £9,071,902, and for 1935-36 £12,841,195&mdash;an increase of £3,769,293.</P>
    <P>Leaving the disputed item out of account for the moment, the total sum advanced to the Local Loans Fund at the 31st March last amounted to £7,409,108 as compared with £2,879,237 at 31st March, 1932, showing an increase of £4,530,000.</P>
    <P>Loans for slum clearance schemes, under the Labourers Acts, and for other housing schemes contracted since the passing of the Housing Act of 1932, are included in this last figure to almost £4,000,000.  In regard to all these loans, the State has undertaken to bear a very large part of the loan charges, and in fact in regard to about £3,500,000 of the advances, pays either 60 or 66 per cent. of them.  The obligation to bear a specified part of these housing loan charges is fixed by statute, and, therefore, a corresponding proportion of the moneys borrowed by the local authorities directly from the Local Loans Fund is really borrowed by them on behalf of the State.  The sum with which the Exchequer asset is credited in respect of the Local Loans advances ought then <Col N="20" /> to be written down to cover this position.  The allowance to be made for such writing down is £2,450,000.</P>
    <P>But the matter does not end there, for the assistance which the Government gives by subsidised loans for housing is not confined to local authorities who borrow from the Local Loans Fund.  On the contrary, it is given also to those large municipalities which are in a position to go direct to the money market and borrow on their own account.  The total amount so borrowed from March, 1932, to 31st March last by local authorities from lenders other than the Local Loans Fund was roughly £3,300,000.  The capital liability of the State which arises in respect of its contribution to the charges on these loans may be taken to be about £1,570,000.</P>
    <P>It is now necessary to revise the provisional figures for the State Debt in the light of the facts which I have just elucidated.  We must first add to the debit side of the account for 1935-36 a sum of £1,570,000 to cover the liability which certain local authorities have contracted on the State's behalf outside the Local Loans Fund.  This raises the present total figure for our open and our concealed, as distinct from any contingent, State Debt to £56,927,000.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the account, among the Exchequer assets, we have to make a deduction from the figure for the Local Loans Fund.  I do not propose to make any adjustment in respect of the old local loans, as I believe that the asset is rightfully ours.  There is, however, the State's liability for portion of the housing loans advanced to local authorities from the fund.  This amounted on the 31st March last to about £2,450,000, and, if the real position is to be disclosed, must be deducted from the gross figure for local loans advances. The net effect is to reduce the figure for our present assets from £31,502,335 to £29,060,000.  We have, therefore, this new position, that at the 31st March last the State liabilities amounted to £56,927,000.  Against these at the same date we had offsetting assets to the value of £29,060,000, leaving a net burden of £27,867,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> The adjustments which I have just made in the State's balance sheet arise from the fact that under the Housing Act of 1932 very generous subventions are given to meet loan charges on money raised for housing purposes.  No subventions of this character were issued under any previous Act of the Oireachtas.  It is not necessary, therefore, when comparing the present position with that of 1931-32, to make similar adjustments in the figures for 31st March, 1932.  We must, however, make an adjustment in respect of the old local loans by adding to the assets side of the account the sum of £6,192,665 to cover the value of those loans at that date.  But we were also at that date paying an annuity of £600,000 to the British Government in respect of these loans, and it is therefore necessary to increase the 1931-32 liabilities by the sum of £6,192,665, the then value of that annuity.  The 1931-32 figures then become: Liabilities, £44,878,000; Assets, £22,848,000.  So that the net State Debt at 31st March of that year was £22,030,000.</P>
    <P>The difference between the adjusted figures for the years which we wish to compare shows that between the 31st March, 1932, and the close of the last financial year our net debt increased by £5,837,000.</P>
    <P>In order to give a true presentation of the position I must contrast the tax revenue for the year 1935-36 with the figures for 1931-32.  In that year the general tax revenue, excluding motor vehicle duties, amounted to £20,345,000; in 1935-36 it had risen to £24,228,000, an increase of £3,883,000 &mdash;unquestionably a considerable sum.</P>
    <P>The question at once arises as to how the increase has been spent, because it is by the manner of its spending that the issue as to whether it was wise and justifiable or unwise and unjustifiable to raise it is to be determined.  I claim that it has been wisely spent in improving the condition of the people.  Practically all of it has been devoted to the extension and improvement of the social services, including education and housing; whereon the aggregate actual expenditure last year was £3,600,000 more than 1931-32.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Let me give a few details.  Old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions last year got £3,695,000, as against £2,756,000 in 1931-32.  Unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, and national health insurance took £2,164,000, as against £514,000.  For free milk, cheap beef and school meals there was £408,000, against £25,000; while housing, education, relief schemes and other miscellaneous services absorbed £5,371,000, as against £4,743,000.  Thus the total expenditure last year on these social services alone was £11,638,000, but was only £8,038,000 in 1931-32.</P>
    <P>Again, the expenditure under the Land Commission Vote in 1931-32 was £614,159.  Last year it rose to £1,390,000.  The work of the Land Commission is regarded by all Parties in the Oireachtas as being of the highest social importance.  Within my experience, no vote has been cast in the Dáil for the curtailment of its activities and no one has ventured to deny the social value of its work. Accordingly, we may regard it as a social service and add the expenditure thereon to the figures which I have given, bringing them up to £8,652,000 for 1931-32, and to £13,028,000 for 1935-36.</P>
    <P>If we have collected £3,883,000 in increased taxation, it will be seen that we have provided against this sum additional social services to the value of £4,376,000.</P>
    <P>No doubt there are people who believe that we are spending too much on the social services, but they do not seem to be represented in this House.  We are told that we have a vigorous and alert Opposition here, forceful in debate, searching in criticism.  Yet when our proposals to spend even more upon these services came before them this year there was none among them to speak against us or to vote us down.  Our critics know that increased expenditure almost inevitably involves increased taxation.  If they are sincere about reducing taxation they should have voted against the increased provision for old age pensions, or housing, or unemployment assistance, when they had the chance some weeks ago.  For <Col N="23" /> any section of them now to complain of the burden of taxation is to make a mockery of representative Government.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer before I pass on to a consideration of our proposals for next year.  In the forefront of its social programme the Government has placed the task of providing better homes for the mass of the people, yet I fear there is no general appreciation of the herculean effort which it is making to solve the housing problem.  We hear of what this local authority and that local authority has done, but comparatively little of what has been done and is being done by the State.  At the 31st March last the total amount which had been raised or provided for housing purposes in Saorstát Eireann since 1st April, 1932, was £8,670,000. Towards this sum the Government has provided directly out of taxation free grants amounting to £1,370,000; and, as I have already shown, it has made itself wholly responsible for the loan charges on £4,000,000 of the balance.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in regard to the balance of the advances from the Local Loans Fund on which it does not itself provide the charges the State may be said to have borrowed no less than £1,550,000 which it has re-advanced through the fund to those local authorities, who cannot borrow in the open market at economic rates.  Thus the State, being itself directly and solely responsible to the original lenders, has, in fact, guaranteed these loans.  The State, therefore, has given as a direct contribution to the housing campaign £5,370,000 and has become guarantor for an additional £1,550,000. I have no desire to detract from the credit which is due and should be given to those others who are earnestly endeavouring to grapple with this first and greatest of our social problems. But I do claim recognition for the help which the State is giving, help which is gigantic in proportion to its resources and which overshadows and surpasses every other active element in the campaign.</P>
    <P>We may turn now to consider the position for the current year.</P>
    <P>Deputies have received the White Paper containing the Estimates of <Col N="24" /> Receipts and Expenditure to the 31st March next.  According to it the amount required for the Central Fund Services is £4,600,217, while the Supply Services will want £27,884,783.</P>
    <P>Included in the Central Fund Services is £360,000, which is required to complete the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan, and for which I propose to borrow.  This item, therefore, so far as revenue appropriation is concerned, may be left out of account, and there is no other budgetary adjustment to be made in this part of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>As the Government has already indicated its intention to ask a further grant of £370,000 in aid of the relief of rates on agricultural land, bringing the total grant for this year up to £1,870,000, the White Paper Estimate for Supply covers that provision accordingly.  There is one adjustment to be made in it however.</P>
    <P>On compiling the original Estimates the sum of £285,000, representing the amount to be collected at the then prevailing rates from the levy on cattle and sheep, was brought in as an Appropriation-in-Aid of the Vote for Agriculture.  This levy was intended to cover portion of the cost of services provided under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts, 1934 and 1935, amounting in all to £670,918.  In view, however, of the marked reduction which has occurred in the indisposable cattle surplus, and the generally satisfactory position of the revenue, it was decided to reduce the levy on cattle and sheep by 50 per cent. as from the 1st April last.  The reduction will cost the Exchequer £142,500 in the current year and, as in the case of the abolition of the import duty on coal, forestalls a relief of taxation which otherwise would have been announced by me to-day.  I may say also in passing that the aggregate cost to the Exchequer in the current year of these two remissions, if they had not been previously announced would have been £582,500.</P>
    <P>The loss to the Exchequer by the remission of the coal duty has already been allowed for in estimating the revenue.  But the reduction in the cattle and sheep levy was decided upon after the Estimates for the Supply Services had been fixed, and accordingly <Col N="25" /> it must be allowed for now.  We have, therefore, to write up the White Paper figure by £142,500, which will increase the total figure for the Supply Services to £28,027,083 and bring the gross figure for expenditure up to £32,627,500.</P>
    <P>Included in this total, however, there is £106,700 for property losses compensation; £360,000 for the repayment of the Dáil External Loan, and £134,800 for capital expenditure on the new industrial alcohol factories; all items the cost of which, if necessary, may be properly defrayed out of borrowed moneys.  Also there is the sum of £75,000 for volunteer halls, in regard to half of which, £37,500, I take the view, for the reasons which I detailed last year, that it too may be provided for out of borrowings. Then the export bounties and subsidies account for £2,180,000.  In regard to these, I propose to do as last year and borrow, if necessary, one-half of the total requirement.  These items together make a sum of £1,729,000, which I do not consider it necessary to provide for out of taxation.  We may, therefore, reduce our grand total for taxation expenditure by this amount, bringing it down to £30,898,500, and may reduce it still further by allowing, as last year, the figure of £950,000 for over-estimation.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now for a moment to the other side of the account.  Tax and non-tax revenue together are estimated to bring in £30,363,000.  Of this sum £1,000,000 is expected from the motor vehicle duties and £23,735,000 from general taxation.  A very important element in the latter figure is the yield which is expected from taxes on income, property and profits generally. Last year they accounted for no less than 32 per cent. of our total tax revenue.  Though they may appear to those who pay them to be heavy, these taxes are fair and equitable.  They are progressive in their character, that is to say, the rate of tax is in general proportioned to the taxpayers' ability to pay, and they are economical to collect and administer.  It is essential, therefore, that any attempt to evade them should be sternly checked and any loophole for evasion promptly closed.  An eminent authority recently <Col N="26" /> has given particulars of devices which elsewhere have been resorted to by ingenious but ungenerous taxpayers, and has foreshadowed legislation to defeat them.  One would require to be over-credulous to believe that our taxpayers adopt a more liberal attitude towards the Revenue Commissioners, or are not the equals in ingenuity of those to whom the British Chancellor referred.  In any event, it is well to safeguard them against temptation.  I am considering whether legislation is necessary for the purpose, and if it be, the necessary supplementary resolutions will be introduced in due course.</P>
    <P>But a much more serious matter has been brought to my attention.  Under the present law the Revenue Commissioners cannot recover tax from a person who succeeds for six years in escaping assessment on his true income unless they are in a position to prove fraud or wilful neglect.  A provision of the kind is likely to intensify the defects of a taxpayer's memory in regard to the details of his income, so that a deplorable carelessness creeps into the preparation of his returns.  It may do worse, it may even tempt certain taxpayers to try to pass on their burden to the shoulders of their less well-circumstanced fellow citizens.  It conduces in short to tax-evasion which may be wilful and deliberate, but not provably so.  Therefore it is antisocial, may lead to dishonesty, and should be ended.</P>
    <P>In the course of my Budget speech on the 11th May, 1932, I referred to this problem of tax evasion, and said that I intended &ldquo;to have explored the question of the adequacy and effectiveness of the present provisions relating to income-tax penalties, especially the penalties for making declarations which the taxpayer knows to be false, with intent to defraud the revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of the past four years, it has been impossible to examine this very difficult question thoroughly, and therefore I am not in a position to introduce definite legislation to deal with it. But I feel that, without prejudice to our powers and penalties, taxpayers who have been making inadequate <Col N="27" /> returns for income tax and surtax (or supertax) since 1922-23 should, as a minimum, be compelled to make full restitution.  I propose, therefore, to introduce legislation which will abolish the time limit of six years for the making of assessments and additional assessments to income tax, supertax, and surtax, and provide that such assessments may in future be made for the year 1922-23 or any subsequent year.</P>
    <P>In doing this, I am fortified by the knowledge that within the past few years the State has lost very large sums by reason of the immunity the present condition of the law has given to certain taxpayers.  Four typical and recent cases have just been brought to my notice.  In one the taxpayer's approximate wealth was £350,000 and the revenue loss £9,000; in another £150,000 and the loss £3,000; in a third £74,000, the loss £1,000; and in the fourth the loss was £600 and the estate £35,000.  All the persons originally concerned had died before their successful evasions came to light.  And now, owing to this absurd limitation in regard to assessments, we find ourselves powerless to collect the tax which years ago should have been paid. A resolution to remove this anomaly is being presented accordingly.</P>
    <P>As a result of the legislation to which I have just referred, I expect to obtain an increased revenue of £50,000 in the current year.  I may say at once that I propose to utilise the whole of it to relieve income taxpayers who are heads of young families.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add, in order to prevent any misapprehension, that a taxpayer who has already made a full disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners and paid an agreed sum, which the Commissioners on their part have agreed to accept in settlement of the taxpayer's liability to income tax and surtax up to a certain date, need not fear a reopening of his case as a result of the proposed legislation.  It will not be used to reopen such settlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is anxious to afford better protection to certain newly-established industries and to encourage the establishment of further new industries.  A <Col N="28" /> tariff resolution giving effect to his policy in these matters will be submitted in due course.  It is anticipated that incidentally it will produce about £23,000 for the Exchequer.  Towards the cost of certain proposals which I shall outline later, the Road Fund will contribute £100,000.  By reason of this, and the changes I have mentioned, we may bring the figure for the year's revenue up to £30,536,000.</P>
    <P>We shall now revert to the other side of the account.  The Dáil will remember that we had fixed the expenditure to be provided out of this year's revenue at the net figure of £29,948,500. Accordingly, with a prospective revenue of £30,536,000, a generous reduction in taxation would seem to be warranted, but for one factor: the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that the State has made and is making great and generous efforts to provide for those of our citizens who may be in want through lack of employment.  The mere consideration of what is being done now in regard to Housing; the contrast of the little that was done previously to assist unemployed persons with the fact that £1,610,000 was provided last year, and that £1,500,000 will be provided this year for this service; the increasing amounts which the Government since it took office has provided year after year for afforestation, for the improvement of estates, for public health works, for turf development, for minor relief schemes, are all emphatic indications of the liberal and humane spirit in which this problem, which has defeated so many Governments, has been approached.  But even the most conservative elements in the community have been far from satisfied with what we have been trying to do. They have told us, in the Press, on the platform and, of course, most emphatically here in the Oireachtas, that doles are no substitute for work.  The Government is in hearty accord with that view.  Two years ago, visualising this problem as no other Administration in our history had visualised it before, we set up an Inter-Departmental Committee, under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, to whose labours in investigating <Col N="29" /> this problem of unemployment and endemic poverty the country is greatly indebted.  The Committee was given the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To consider the extent to which it is practicable to devise a scheme of useful and desirable public works to be carried out within a period of four years with a view to reducing expenditure on unemployment assistance to a minimum, and to report upon the nature and extent of such works, the steps to be taken to initiate them, the best method of financing them, and the organisation to be set up to carry them our.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Committee aroused great public interest, and we have been pressed&mdash;a little impatiently &mdash;from time to time for information as to the progress which it was making with its heavy task.  For instance, just a week or two ago a certain Deputy put down his third or fourth Parliamentary question in relation to this matter.  I am quite sure the Deputy was not merely trying on behalf of his Party to embarrass the Government. I have no doubt that sincere zeal for the cause of the unemployed made him a little impatient in the matter, and I have no doubt also that as a proof of that sincerity we shall hear no complaint from that Deputy about high taxation during the course of the Budget Debates, because it is not possible in present circumstances to do more for the unemployed than we are doing, certainly not in the way of providing work for them instead of doles, and at the same time drastically or generously reduce taxation.  I am not yet able to say that the Inter-Departmental Committee has completed its task.  But I can say this. It has indicated that a large amount of useful and highly desirable works, such as public health schemes, road works, site development for housing, harbour works, airport construction, miscellaneous minor works and experimental schemes, including such schemes as it is customary to finance out of the Relief Schemes Vote, could be undertaken if the necessary finances and, no less important, labour of a suitable kind, were available.  This latter desideratum, contrary to the prevailing <Col N="30" /> belief, is not going to be the easiest element to provide.  I have had before me recently one instance in which an essential and useful public work has been held up because of the fact that of 73 recipients of unemployment assistance who were detailed by the employment exchange for the work, only nine turned up on the job.  Some of the remainder thought the walk was too far for them.  The incident would indicate that there are some people on the unemployment register who are not so badly in need of work or so desirous of obtaining work as to be entitled to be paid unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Committee, I should say, have not found it necessary to recommend the execution of any work of an abnormal or unusual character, though they have examined many such proposals &mdash;some of a quite fantastic kind&mdash;and have been moved to reject unreservedly most of them on the ground of their lack of social or economic utility and labour-employing capacity.  It is estimated that, making allowance for contingencies, as much as £2,500,000 will be required to finance the programme which it is believed can be undertaken in the current year.  Local authorities, on the usual basis, will be expected to bear part of the cost of many of the works contemplated, e.g., public health works, harbour works, airports, housing development and town improvement schemes.  Some, indeed, have been pressing already for sanction and assistance to undertake them.  For works of the kind usually classified as minor relief works no contribution or but a small contribution will be insisted upon; while for schemes intermediate between the two classes special arrangements may be made.</P>
    <P>After making allowance for the local authorities' share of the cost of the programme a balance of about £1,675,000 will remain to be provided. The Government proposes to undertake that formidable task and, for the purpose, to set up an employment fund of that amount, which will be under the detailed control of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  In order to cover the provision for the employment fund it is necessary to add, on the expenditure side of the account, the sum of <Col N="31" /> £1,675,000 to our previous figure of £29,948,500, bringing our total gross requirements up to £31,623,500, a sum which exceeds our disposable revenue by £1,087,500.  It is to the problem of covering this deficiency that we must now turn our attention.</P>
    <P>Included in the programme of works which has been envisaged is £600,000 for roads of all classes, other than accommodation and similar roads which will continue to be financed as minor relief schemes.  Normally, the greater part of the cost of these works would be borne by the Road Fund.  At the moment, however, the fund would not be in a position to shoulder its appropriate share of the burden and accordingly I propose to be content with a contribution from it of £100,000, the item for which credit has already been taken on the revenue side of our account.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made in the programme for the sum of £675,000 for public health works, which covers fully all the proposed schemes available and likely to be undertaken this year.  The balance of £1,225,000 is intended to cover harbour works, site development works, airports, minor relief works, miscellaneous works and experimental schemes of various kinds. It is obvious that these works will be of permanent and lasting benefit.  They are development works which will improve the amenities of the country, making it more attractive even if only as a holiday centre to others, and they will become a source of profit as well as of health and pleasure to our citizens.  I do not think we should be justified, however, in rating too highly the Exchequer's prospects in regard to them.  I think in all wisdom and prudence we must discount these very drastically.  Furthermore, we must remember that the Exchequer may be called on through the Local Loans Fund to borrow largely on behalf of the local authorities.  Accordingly, I would not feel justified in making a further large addition to the State's loan commitments by borrowing more than £250,000 for the fund.  We may, however, immediately place to its credit the sum of £500,000, representing <Col N="32" /> the original provision contained in the Estimates for grants towards the relief works which are now included in the comprehensive £2,500,000 programme; and after allowing for the Road Fund contribution to which I have referred, we are left with £825,000 to find out of the proceeds of new or existing taxation.</P>
    <P>No one may cavil at our attempt, for all Parties in the House have united in demanding work or maintenance for the unemployed, and work rather than maintenance.  Neither can any be so short-sighted as to assume that unemployment is an ephemeral phenomenon, to be dealt with for only one year and in that year to be disposed of for ever. For every advance in science and in organisation tends to reduce the human element in all works and in all processes, and to make manual labour more and more redundant.  If we are to attack this problem earnestly and sincerely we must take a long view of it, as something which is going to be with us year after year, and which year after year has to be provided for out of the current resources of the community and the State.  Any other approach than that is bound to end, as it is ending elsewhere at the present day, in social and financial disaster, and in an intolerable aggravation of the evil of unemployment itself.</P>
    <P>We shall, of course, consider carefully our existing resources before we have recourse to new impositions. And here the continued improvement in the cattle position is of great assistance to us.  The Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts of 1934 and 1935 were enacted to deal with the situation which had been created by a large unmarketable surplus in our cattle population.  It is no secret that the Acts, while effective in dealing with the crisis for which they were designed, were costly and difficult to administer. The surplus of cattle to be disposed of having substantially diminished, it is no longer possible to operate the other provisions of the Acts and at the same time maintain beef distribution as at present.  Accordingly, a more convenient scheme of subsidised beef distribution, which will be simpler and cheaper to administer, is being devised on the lines of the existing <Col N="33" /> milk distribution, to enable us to deal with such otherwise indisposable beef surplus as may exist.  We are, therefore, in a position to amend the Cattle Acts of 1934 and 1935 so as to reduce very substantially their present cost, particularly on the administrative side. This will give us a saving on our present Estimates of £140,000, which it is intended to devote to the purposes of the Employment Fund.</P>
    <P>We have next to consider the saving which the execution of a public works programme costing £2,500,000 will have on the Vote for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance. It is obvious that it must be considerable.  The whole position in that regard has been exhaustively investigated, and I am satisfied that we shall have a saving under this head of not less than £550,000.</P>
    <P>We may now review our problem again.  With our expenditure reduced to a net figure of £29,948,500, we had to add £1,675,000 to cover the cost of the Employment Fund, leaving us with a gross figure of £31,623,500, towards which we propose to raise £250,000 by borrowing.  In addition we shall get £500,000 by a re-Vote to the Employment Fund of the amount already included in the Estimates under Vote 69 for relief schemes; we shall get a further £140,000 as the result of savings arising from the amendment and simplification of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts; and, as a result of the employment which the comprehensive scheme of public works will give, we shall secure £550,000 by savings on the Vote for unemployment assistance.  These savings, with the £250,000 to be borrowed, will amount to £1,440,000, and, deducting that sum from the previous figure of £31,623,500, we get £30,183,500 as the final figure for the year's expenditure.  Against this we have provided a revenue of £30,536,000, giving us an estimated surplus for the current year of £352,500, which is now ours to dispose of.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the surplus should be distributed widely and in such a way that the benefit should accrue in as large a measure and as equitably as possible to that ultimate taxpayer, the general body of consumers.  At the <Col N="34" /> same time, in the case of certain consumable commodities, care must be taken that no undue loss falls on merchants and distributors who in general hold large stocks.  It is, therefore, essential that due notice and ample time should be given to enable these to be cleared and to avoid unfair price-cutting and competition.  With this in mind, I have decided to reduce the Customs duty and the Excise duty on sugar by ¼d. per lb. as from 1st August next.  This concession will cost the Exchequer £170,000.  I am sure nothing need be said to recommend it to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the intention of the Minister for Agriculture to amend and simplify the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts.  The necessary legislation will be brought in at an early date and, it is hoped, will speedily become law.  In anticipation that our hopes in that regard will be fulfilled, I propose to agree to the complete abolition of the levy on cattle and sheep as from 1st August next.  This, in addition to the £142,500 which the Exchequer forewent when the levy was reduced by one-half as from 1st April last, will cost us a further £95,500.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that by alterations in the law relating to income tax we expect to secure £50,000 this year and have already informed the Dáil that it is intended to pass this on to the section of income taxpayers who, in my view, are most deserving, that is to the heads of young families.  This will be done by increasing the allowance in respect of children from £50 per child to £60 per child.  The effect will be to exempt from income tax many struggling people who are at present paying the tax and in other cases to give very substantial relief, especially to taxpayers on the lower ranges of income.  Thus, a married man earning £9 per week who has three children at present pays £1 16s. income tax per annum.  In future he will pay nothing.  A married man earning £8 per week who has two children at present pays £2 7s. 3d. per annum; in future he will pay only 2/3 per annum.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that there are certain professions in which <Col N="35" /> plant and machinery are used for the carrying on of the profession, and that it is unjust that an allowance for the wear and tear of such plant should not be given for income tax purposes. I propose accordingly to include in the Finance Bill a clause to provide that the rule of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918, which authorises the allowance of a deduction in respect of the wear and tear of plant and machinery used for the purposes of a trade shall be extended so as to authorise the granting of a similar allowance in the case of plant and machinery used for the purposes of a profession.  The concession is estimated to cost £3,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Certain interests have represented very strongly to me the disabilities under which they labour by reason of the changing habits of the people and the high cost of the articles which they retail.  When granting tax remissions it is sound policy to put first things first, and I think it will be generally agreed that the reductions which I have just announced should take precedence of any other concessions. Costing £318,500, they will absorb practically the whole of our surplus.</P>
    <P>There is still a trifle left with which to give a little further relief.  Many deputations have pressed me very hard for concessions, and among those which made a convincing case was one which represented the principal newspapers. When the import duty of 5 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on unprinted paper was imposed in last year's Budget, I indicated that though the duty was imposed primarily for revenue purposes, it had also a protective aspect in so far as it indicated that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to ask for adequate tariff protection for the newsprint industry if it could be established here.  Plans are now complete for the enlargement and further development of the paper-making industry in the Saorstát, and I understand that in connection therewith the existing mill at Clondalkin, County Dublin, is to be re-equipped and reopened.  But these plans do not <Col N="36" /> provide for the manufacture of newsprint, and I understand that it is now considered impracticable to attempt the manufacture of that commodity for many years to come.  I do not feel justified, therefore, in maintaining the existing 5 per cent. import duty on unprinted paper imported for the printing of newspapers and periodicals, and propose to abolish it as from 13th June next.  This concession will cost £13,000.</P>
    <P>Among the revenue tariffs imposed simultaneously with the tariff on unprinted paper was one of 10 per cent. on glass sheets and strips.  Unlike the duty on unprinted newsprint, the glass tariff induced certain interests to consider the possibility of making such sheets and strips here.  The possibility has been found to be practicable, and the necessary protective duties, with the usual licensing provisions, are included in a Resolution to come before you this evening.  I have accordingly decided to ask the Dáil to abolish the existing duty of 10 per cent. as from 1st September next.  The concession will cost £6,000.</P>
    <P>Also among the revenue tariffs imposed last year was an import duty of 10/- per cental on wool and wool waste other than flock.  At the urgent request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who represents that these materials form the raw materials for the home manufacture of certain kinds of yarn, I have decided to ask the Dáil to abolish this duty as from to-day.  The revenue will thereby lose £4,000.</P>
    <P>Last year certain increases were made in the entertainments tax on cinema seats.  As I have already indicated, the results were not satisfactory either from the viewpoint of the cinema proprietors or the Exchequer.  There was, indeed, a very considerable falling off in the attendances during the first two months that the new scale was in operation.  There was some recovery during the remainder of the year but in general the recovery has not been complete, so that this form of entertainment has been hit harder than was intended. Moreover, the adverse effect was much greater in the case of working-class <Col N="37" /> cinemas, where the top inclusive price is 1/- or less.  Such houses were severely affected by the fact that under the new scale an inclusive price of 8d. could not be charged; and it may be admitted that in the existing peculiar circumstances of their case a 3½d. tax in respect of an inclusive price of 1/- is excessive.  These considerations suggest the restoration of an 8d. inclusive price, with a duty charge of 1½d., and the reduction of the duty charge in the case of the 1/- inclusive price from 3½d. to 3d.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the law in relation to cinema tax which ought to be amended.  Under Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1931, it is provided that where more than half of an entertainment consists of personal items as distinct from cinematograph shows, entertainments duty shall not be payable on payments for admission thereto.</P>
    <P>This concession has had unexpected reactions.  The recent tendency in cinema entertainments is to lengthen what are called &ldquo;feature&rdquo; films so that they will cover a run of from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half.  The programme is then filled up with &ldquo;shorts&rdquo; of various kinds, e.g., short news reels, travel films, Nature study films, etc., the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; film being the real attraction to the public. Thus by showing &ldquo;feature&rdquo; films only and using personal items instead of &ldquo;shorts&rdquo; merely for filling-up, a house which is in effect nothing more than a cinema can escape payment of the cinema duty.  In this way the revenue suffers an extensive loss, which is likely indeed to increase as the policy in question becomes more widely adopted.  The strain on the revenue is intensified in the case of those houses which, being licensed by Letters Patent as theatres, offer to their patrons the additional attraction of a licensed bar.  To protect the revenue some adjustment of this position is necessary.  Accordingly, as regards theatres in respect of which Letters Patent have been issued, that is, theatres which are legally entitled to have a public bar, it is proposed&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that when 75 per cent. at least of an entertainment consists of <Col N="38" /> personal performance such entertainment shall be duty-free;</P>
    <P>(2)  that when less than 75 per cent. but not less than 50 per cent. of an entertainment consists of personal performance duty shall be paid on payments for admission to such entertainment at one-half of the rates applicable to cinematograph performances;</P>
    <P>(3)  that when less than 50 per cent. of an entertainment consists of personal performance duty shall be payable on payments for admission to such entertainment at the full rates applicable to cinematograph performances.</P>
    <P>It is to be observed that the payment of half-duty rates under (2) is confined to theatres as regards which duty is paid on the basis of certified returns. This privilege is granted unreservedly to any theatre proprietor who gives the necessary security, makes his returns correctly and promptly, and pays the duty when it becomes due.  It is proposed to make these changes in the cinema duties operative from the 1st July, 1936.  As an immediate result the Exchequer will probably experience a net loss of about £3,000 in the current year.  But I am satisfied that next year the changes will more than pay for themselves.  At any rate they are essential in order to secure the yield from entertainments tax, which at over £250,000 has now become an important element in our revenue.</P>
    <P>A minor amendment of the entertainments duty will be brought in to exempt from the duty two indoor sports of which public exhibitions are sometimes given, but which through an oversight, were not specifically mentioned when the proposals giving effect to the general policy of exempting such entertainments were before the Dáil. The revenue derived from the exhibitions in question is infinitesimal and the cost and inconvenience of collecting it are much more than it is worth. There will be also a resolution strengthening the law in relation to the duty-free importation of dutiable articles on a permanent change of residence.  Such a resolution is necessitated by the fact that in a number of cases motor cars have been bought or <Col N="39" /> acquired solely with a view to use in the Saorstát, and attempts have been made to import them free of duty. The Revenue Commissioners have refused duty-free importation in such cases, but it is considered advisable to make it quite clear that the concession is not intended to apply in such circumstances. There will also be a minor proposal in relation to the motor vehicle duties.  After making all the provisions, changes and concessions which I have detailed, I expect to close the year with the nominal surplus of £8,000.</P>
    <P>And that brings me to the end of the financial statement.  We are meeting the needs of all our services, we have provided fully for the continuance of our campaign for the better housing of the people, we have planned for a comprehensive attack on the problem of unemployment and, on the balance, we have reduced taxation. We have devised, as the indispensable foundation for all this, a sound Budget.  There has been no recourse to inflation and no tampering with the currency.  We have not resorted to the nostrums and panaceas which are held out so often as easy ways to encompass a most difficult thing: The provision of a frugal sufficiency for everyone's need.  It has been done, as the phrase has it, &ldquo;Within the System.&rdquo;  We have those among us who advocate Communism, State Socialism, Totalitarianism.  To me these are but aspects of the one tyranny, and as they are all repugnant to the essence of human liberty, the freedom of the mind and of the conscience, I hate and abhor them all. I do hope most fervently that they will never take root here.  This Budget shows that they need not, if Governments but satisfy the essential requirement of good government, which is to try to do social justice. Within a short period there have been provided by this little State social services adapted to our particular needs, which for liberality, comprehensiveness and practical utility are not surpassed by any in Europe.  They have been built up on a sound foundation of private enterprise and individual thrift&mdash;sources which for thousands of <Col N="40" /> years have furnished our material progress. I feel that they will be no less fruitful in the future; and that it is by the proper utilisation of what they provide, that the people will be afforded, not merely higher standards of living but greater opportunities for spiritual and cultural development.  It is with that philosophy that I have taken my part in framing this Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to avail myself of the opportunity, usually afforded at this time, for a few preliminary remarks on the statement we have just heard, prior to the general discussion which will, of course, take place on the last Resolution.  I take all the more pleasure in speaking at this point this year because of the obvious disappointment with which, <Col N="41" /> the Minister's statement has affected his own followers.  One has only to compare the rather perfunctory applause&mdash;which it would be insulting not to give to the unfortunate gentleman&mdash;this year with the enthusiasm that there was, say, four years ago, damped though that enthusiasm has become in the three years intervening. As Deputies opposite heard all the figures being rolled out, I saw them straining anxiously to know if there was going to come any one of three things which properly presented themselves to them&mdash;if production was catching up on unemployment; if production, under even subsidy and bounty, was making some progress in the country, if the unemployment problem was either being solved or nearly solved, and, if these things could not be given to them, if they could, at any rate, go to their constituents with some promises of decent remissions of taxation.  I think that most of them began to read into the framework of the Budget, that there was more receding than the Republic and that these other things were receding more quickly than the Republic. I refer to the fulfilment of all that swung them into office: remissions of taxation, increased production which would break the back of unemployment, the new system within the system that was to bring us, with all the hopes we had this year for better cultural and spiritual development into a &ldquo;haven of peace in a shattered world&rdquo;&mdash; which was the phrase, I think, was used last year&mdash; not to speak of all the other gaudy flights of fancy we had during the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks that some part of the prosperity&mdash;mark the word&mdash; that afflicts the country at the moment might be ascribed to Government policy.  I would prefer to phrase it that we can entirely ascribe to Government policy the failure to reach the derided prosperity of 1930 and 1931.  The Minister tells us that he has balanced the Budget, though he hasn't said this with last year's assurance.  He knows that it is futile to repeat such a phrase. He has not told the House of the new <Col N="42" /> method of taxation, the financial resolution which can be and has been shot in so many times during the year. The finances of the country were so perilously near being on the rocks on several occasions that, for protection, the life boats had to be launched. Even so, in hypocritical phrase, the Minister ascribes some part of our prosperity, if prosperity we have, to Government policy.  Last year the Minister imposed taxation, and between the Budget taxes and the additional tax on cement, the new taxation amounted to £1,250,000.  He gave remissions, supposed to carry relief, to the extent of £250,000.  In the result his new impositions came to the sum of £1,000,000.  Not even that extra £1,000,000 has been remitted this year, but a mere £350,000, and for that relief we are told we have to thank Government policy.  Is this small remission to be ascribed to Government policy?  Is there not a possibility that any increase in revenue in this country is due to the fact that British prosperity is on the increase, that the dividends that Saorstát investors get from British securities have raised our income-tax returns? Is anything further to be learned from the consideration that, contrary to the avowed policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, this year they made their second coal-cattle arrangement?  Does what the Minister gain correspond in any way to the amount accruing from increased dividends on British securities? Will he tell us how much of the newly-found prosperity is due to the fact that, even at low rates, more cattle can be sold?  Would it be surprising to find that the Government have been able to give relief, even to the extent of £350,000, simply because an increase in the prosperity of the country which is so hostile to us has enabled us to get by a side-wind some assistance from our enemy's good fortune?</P>
    <P>The Minister evaded one other notable matter.  This country is represented as a poor country normally, but the present boast is that we have advanced materially, and have been able to establish a wide range of social services.  We are now, in the fifth year of Government, making an attack, in <Col N="43" /> a well-planned and comprehensive way, upon our unemployment.  The Minister forgot to tell us that we have given to Britain, our enemies, £500,000 more than they set out to collect last year. We gave them that notwithstanding their pledge that &ldquo;they set out to obtain only the amount they claimed&mdash; not one copper more.&rdquo;  The House of Commons approved that pledge given to them that when they obtained that amount they would cease, that not one copper more did they want.  The Budget statement made about three weeks ago by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer showed that the Irish Free State duties had brought in £500,000 in excess of his expectations. In that, at any rate, the Minister might have taken some little pride.  He knows right well that the coal-cattle pact could only have been arranged on a studied calculation that a stated number of cattle at the rate of duty imposed would bring in the amount to be collected.  When the result is shown to exceed his best calculations he might have recognised that an extra £500,000 has been extorted from us and might have indicated his intention of keeping the British to their pledges&mdash; so recovering this overpayment for us.</P>
    <P>This is the best of the Fianna Fáil Budgets.  There is no remission of taxation from the 1931-32 figure as had been promised.  There is £350,000 of a reduction, but that must be related to last year's Budget, with the £1,000,000 that was slapped on then.  What has the Ministry done with the revenue they got since they became a Government? They have been four years in office and, in that period, with this year's estimated taxation added in, they gather in from our people £26,750,000 more than used to be taken from them in 1930-31.  They have also had the spending of an annual sum of £2,000,000 which in the last Government's time used to be remitted to England.  Over five years that is an extra £10,000,000.  This is then £36,750,000 that they have had to spend.</P>
    <P>In this period we are told that the National Debt has advanced only by £5,885,000.  I question the accuracy <Col N="44" /> of that figure, but let it pass.  I was informed, in answer to a question a fortnight ago, that the debts of local authorities had increased in two years by £5,000,000.  There is, of course, overlapping somewhere.  The Minister, apparently, only takes over from local authorities something like £1,500,000 for housing.  Is it possible that there is a further £9,500,000 as between the debt of local authorities and the State, and have the Ministry enjoyed the spending of this also?  If they have had this also to spend, the full tot of their spending is the £26,750,000 got by way of extra taxation, the £10,000,000 repayments to the Local Loans Fund retained for use at home, and the other £10,000,000 represented by the increased indebtedness of local authorities and the State. The debt corresponding to the last will have to be repaid by this and the succeeding generation, but the fruits of the expending of it have been enjoyed by the present Government. There is a complete sum of £46,000,000 in a five-year period.  It is the minimum for what the local authorities' debt has amounted to since 31st March, 1935, and we do not know what the State debt will be by 31st March, 1937.  What we do know is that this Government prides itself on having taken from the country by taxation £26,750,000 more than it used to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Over what period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over four or five years&mdash;the four past years and the one we are entering.  There was also £10,000,000 spent that was not reserved for spending here, and in three of those years there was at least £9,000,000 added between State and local authority debt.  One would have imagined with all that, that there might have been some betterment of the country's condition.  The Minister told us that practically all the money that had been raised by way of an increase has been for social services. I do not believe it, but again let us assume it to be an accurate statement. Let us leave out of consideration the millions that were promised by way of savings&mdash;the £2,000,000 per year down on the old 1930-31 taxation. <Col N="45" /> Let us leave that aside.  We shall give you a present of the £10,000,000 you were going to save in that way. The Minister tells us that all this is spent on social services.  So much the worse for the future of the country. Where is the increased production, the increased production that will give strength to the taxpayers' back to bear the burden?</P>
      <P>We have discussed these figures at length before.  We know that as far as agriculture is concerned the Government policy is founded on wheat and beet and on certain payments towards the producers of milk.  We know that in the last year wheat and beet have cost us about £2,000,000.  We know that what we pay as consumers brings in over £1,000,000 that might go to the man who produces milk but of which only £630,000 odd goes to him.  At any rate, with all these subsidies, we find that the increased employment in agriculture as far as paid labour is concerned is nil.  There is a decrease of 600 odd in the number permanently employed on the land and there is an increase of 2,400 in the number of those employed for about one quarter of the year.  The two items balance each other.  We are supposed to have about 9,000 extra, including the members of farmers' families, working on the land.  We know that is the figure given for the purposes of the distribution of the agricultural grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume that for the £3,000,000 we are spending for subsidies for these new crops, and as an additional help to the old type of economy, we get a return of 10,000 people extra employed.  The Minister for Agriculture knowing that problem goes faintheartedly to the country and says: &ldquo;It is to industry we must look for increased employment&rdquo; while his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, talking in terms of Couéism, says: &ldquo;Agriculture is the mainstay; it is to that we must look for employment.&rdquo;  The Couéism fails before facts.  We do know that there is £100,000 extra in the Unemployment Insurance Fund which represents 25,000 workers all the year round. There is more than that accounted for by new employment in the building industry in the Minister's calculations. <Col N="46" /> So that the Ministry have taxed this country to the extent of £26,000,000 mere in the five-year period, have run up debt at least to the extent of another £10,000,000 and have had £10,000,000 to play with that we had not.  They show 9,000 extra on the land, if they are there, and they show such a position in regard to industry that if the money was not there for the building of these subsidised houses, the Unemployment Assistance Fund would sink to its old figure. Where is the production that is going to make these burdens in the way of permanent social measures easier for the people to bear in the future?</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us with pride of the success of the Conversion Loan. We can think of it with some pride, but let us temper our pride with the thought that we paid, as a minimum, one point more than it was worth.  We had to buy confidence by bribing with that point extra.  The cheapest thing in the world to-day is money.  There is not an issue of the smallest county in England, there is not an issue of the refunding type of any decent-class country right over the world, that does not show a conversion loan carried through at least a point cheaper than we had to pay.  The Minister talks of thrift, and by taking certain figures he makes the pretence that thrift has increased in the country.  Will the Minister bring into the Dáil the figures from about 1927 onwards in respect to Savings Certificates and the Savings Banks Funds and, if he has the calculation already, will he agree with me that although this Government have not completely destroyed the habit of thrift, they have slowed down, year by year, the accumulations by at least one-third? The Minister has for years dodged about between Savings Bank deposits and Savings Certificates.  Let us get a calculation based on the two, and the Minister will find that although he can boast that thrift has not been completely ousted from the country, the amount put by for the last four years is down by at least £350,000 on what the average figure used to be.  The most saddening feature of the Budget must have been the open acknowledgment of failure in regard to the unemployment <Col N="47" /> position when we think of the way the people were deluded about it. The Minister told us that it is not an ephemeral thing, a thing to be stopped this year, next year or at any moment. That is a changed tone.  Does the Minister remember the time when we were told: &ldquo;The problem that faced Hoover, Hindenburg and MacDonald was the problem facing us, and if these statesmen had the cure staring them in the face, as we have here, they would have cured unemployment long ago&rdquo;? So we had a cure staring us in the face! The Minister has sat and looked at it since he came into office.  Last year on the 15th of May the Minister told us of the great Committee under the presidency of Deputy Hugo Flinn, that was going to end all our woes in that regard.  His announcement in regard to it last year was that it had been set up a long time before the 15th of May. So long had it been set up that on the 17th December, 1934, it had decided to look for special information.  A Deputy who put questions in this House every day for a fortnight, would not have been as impatient in looking for results as that Committee which had got going on the 17th of December, 1934.</P>
    <P>We are going now to amend unemployment and to end it.  We are going to mend it in a particular way this year.  How?  The Committee, after two or three years' incubation, produces, what?  The same old solution&mdash; roads and public health services. There is one new item&mdash;air-ports.  I should like to find the calculation upon which that is based.  If we leave out the item of air-ports there is not a thing mentioned as going before Deputy Flinn's committee that was not before every Government the world has seen since depression started. Roads were the only item for which we were given a figure&mdash;a sum of £600,000. That leads to an interesting comparison. In 1932 the Government spent £856,000 on roads.  In 1933, working up to an election, the amount spent was £1,400,000.  The programme, of course, that had been arranged for the election could not be slowed down too shabbily, with the result that next year there was £1,000,000 spent.  In 1935 that had dropped to £715,000, and <Col N="48" /> on the good old highways of the country another £600,000 is to be landed out to them now.  That is the answer to unemployment.  Have the Ministry at last accepted the idea that, jacking up industries with tariffs and subsidising with bounties all sorts of business in the country, is not a paying game?  Have they decided that production, as far as they can achieve it, is not an answer to unemployment? If not, can they not give us some more hope with regard to production?  Can they not tell us, even if we are increasing the national debt and taxing the people at a scandalous and outrageous rate, that there is at any rate a hope in the future that some of these subsidised crops are going to take root and will eventually be able to get on in a healthy condition without artificial aid from the State?</P>
    <P>Can we be told, with regard to any of these industries, that they are going to occupy any large number of people, or must we now take it that there are to be permanent features of our life here an unemployment insurance fund &mdash;an old-time fund&mdash;an unemployment assistance fund, which is the sole resort of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the problem, and now, if you please, an employment fund under Deputy Hugo Flinn to scatter money on roads and on public health services?  Is it possible that, in the fifth year of their existence, this Government cannot say to the people of this country anything more satisfying than this: &ldquo;We will spend £600,000 on the roads; we have a certain amount of extra money to fling around on harbour works, air-ports and things like that, and if you are not too lazy to walk to your work you will get some help from these.  The too-lazy-to-work theory has been developing apace in Fianna Fáil.  I think it was the most recent recruit to the House from the County Galway who started that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I may ask a few questions about it next week. It is a phrase that ought to become popular.  Remember, this is a definite change of mind.  I remember the time when Deputy Donnelly would certainly have wept had anyone outraged his knowledge of the people and his feelings for them by suggesting that any of them would not run to get work.  Is not that right?  There is no doubt that the view is percolating through Fianna Fáil, by their using it as an excuse, that there are quite a number of people now drawing unemployment assistance who ought not to be doing so.  That is the view that seems to be spreading among them.  I do not believe that they are convinced of that.  I would like to see some more proof of that than this one instance.  But it is an obvious resort when you find that you cannot pay all the people who are idle in the country and when you cannot get work for them despite all the promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the Minister's idea of relief on the other hand, relief of the taxpayer and of people who are struggling. A taxpayer, on the lower range of income, is going to get what the Minister has described as very substantial relief.  The £9-a-week man with three children at present pays £1 16s. in income tax, and he will pay nothing.  In the Minister's eyes, £1 16s. represents very substantial relief to the £9-a-week man.  I wonder would he accept that standard when he is thinking in terms of taxation?  Would the putting of £1 16s. on the £9-a-week man <Col N="52" /> with three children be regarded as a very definite hardship?  The taking off is a very substantial relief?  In this Budget in which income-tax is buoyant, in which Government policy is succeeding, in which we have an apparent surplus of a £1,000,000 and an actual surplus of £350,000, the best that can be done for the taxpayer is the very substantial relief of £1 16s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy tell the House what the children's allowance was when his Party was in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us just start from the terrific height we had climbed to in last year's Budget.  Over and above that, this £1 16s. has not any relation to what the children's allowance was four or five years ago.  The increased price that any family has to pay for tea would submerge that £1 16s. many times over.  That is thrown out here as a sop.  The Minister hopes that the family with the £9 a week, and the three children, and the £1 16s. relief, will have increased spiritual and cultural development by reason of it.  There are many things that can be spoken of afterwards on the more general debate, but it is clearly revealed now, when we take a look at them four years in retrospective, that all the promises that were made have turned out, at any rate&mdash;whether they were sincerely made or not I do not know&mdash;in a way that has been most disappointing to the deluded people who had some belief in them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not delude us, and the fact that they cannot be carried out does not surprise us. But something does surprise us.  It is a scandalous thing that a Government which, by deluding people with promises, got itself into office, most cynically turns its back upon all that was promised, never even attempts to excuse itself, never even allows the people to know what they have realised in office different from what they thought when they were out.  They never attempted to justify themselves before the people.  They have simply <Col N="53" /> brought politics to the point where nobody expects anything better than promises, and nobody counts a promise worth anything.  We might have expected some discussion on that.  We might have expected the gentlemen who are now wiser than they were five years ago to tell us and to reveal frankly to their own supporters why they cannot give those remissions. Surely, having realised something, they might at any rate refrain from increasing the permanent burden of social services until they had some appreciation that there was a future before the country in the way of increased production.  Does the Minister believe, if agricultural production and sale are to be permanently pegged back to the point at which they are now pegged back, that this country can carry on and give the social services it is at present providing?  Does the Minister believe that, if he suddenly withdrew all the subsidies to housing and the 25,000 men so occupied went out on the roads, he could take on himself the burden of giving them social services equal to what is being given to the rest?  Why should there have been this benevolence without any provision&mdash;in fact, without any thought of providing for it&mdash;for the future?  There is only one answer. The Government got their power by bribery.  The day it is realised and confessed that it was bribery, that day the Government ends.  As long as there is money to be spent on the roads and on public health services, on getting people jobs, on getting people places through political influence, there is a chance for a Party unconscientious about the use of public money to remain in power, but each year pulls the curtain back a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we got to the point where tea, sugar, tobacco and bread had to bear various increases.  In this year of abounding prosperity the Minister is able to give a remission of the extra they put on sugar last year, and all the other taxes are kept on.  I believe that while all this is going on the national debt situation is much worse than what the Minister has revealed.  There has been no <Col N="54" /> proper accounting of the debts that have been accumulated by the local authorities.  There has been no statement at all by the Minister as to whether he knows that his attempts to balance the Budget&mdash;not always successful&mdash;have only been achieved by unbalancing the budgets of many families through the country.  You can get a glimmer of prosperity about a city like Dublin, where you have people to whom money comes so easily that they will spend it more easily still on drink or entertainment, but you have got a very poor return if you have a lot of families in the country ruined and bankrupt, and the production they used to give destroyed, while you only get as a substitute this subsidy and bounty-fed business with which Dublin is destroyed at the moment.  That, at any rate, is the tendency which Fianna Fáil policy has achieved so far.  There is very little hope of spiritual or cultural development, and no hope of material prosperity, as long as the situation remains as it is.</P>

    <P>This is a Resolution to correct an anomaly which arose in connection with the Local Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1934.  A Resolution was <Col N="57" /> introduced to enable inspectors of taxes to make allowance for the fact that those reductions had been imposed, and it was necessary, as it was in the case of civil servants, to bring in another amendment to restore the original position.  It was not possible to do that until December of last year, as the local authorities had a right to make certain adjustments in the position up to that date.  This is to enable inspectors of taxes to charge income-tax upon the actual income of a local officer.</P>

    <P>(b)  that prior to the commencement of such permanent residence in Saorstát Eireann or to such importation (whichever is the earlier) such article had been used by the importer thereof or his family or household living with him or had been used (otherwise than as stock-in-trade or as manufactured or partly manufactured stock-in-trade, or as material ingredient, or component part for the manufacture of stock-in-trade) by the importer for the purpose of his trade or business and in either case had been bought or acquired by such importer or by a member of his family or household living with him for substantial use outside Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that such article is being imported into Saorstát Eireann for the use of the importer or his family or household living with him or for use (otherwise than as aforesaid) by the importer for the purpose of his trade or business,</P>

    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This Resolution is introduced at the instance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It will be remembered that the Finance Act of 1933 provided for the payment of road tax at the rate of £20 in the case of commercial vehicles exceeding 1 ton, but not exceeding 1¼ tons.  Section 7 provided for the payment of road tax at the maximum rate of £16 in the case of private motor vehicles in respect of which it was shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that such vehicles were assembled in Saorstát Eireann in a manner and to the extent for the time being approved by the said Minister. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has now suggested that this concession should in future be limited to vehicles not only assembled in the <Col N="138" /> manner and to the extent required by the Minister in Saorstát Eireann, but that are also in the manner and to the extent required by the Minister assembled from parts manufactured in the Saorstát.  This Resolution is accordingly designed to achieve that object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That section of the Resolution effects exactly the same change in respect to the ordinary private car as (a) effects in relation to commercial vehicles.  This road tax concession was given in the case of the commercial vehicle particularly in order to sustain the body-making industry.  The bodies of commercial vehicles were being made by coach-builders, but recently certain firms have been putting all-steel bodies on the market for commercial cars, with the result that the very device which was designed to protect the coach-builders and give them whatever trade in commercial bodies was available, was being used for the purpose of taking away the trade and having these all-steel bodies substituted. The effect of the change is to give power to require that cars, in order to get the road tax concession, shall not merely be assembled here, but must also be assembled from parts manufactured in the Saorstát to whatever extent may be approved from time to time.  As the law stands, if the car is assembled in the manner and to the degree approved, the road tax concession must be conceded whether the parts are manufactured here or not.  Apart from the position of the commercial vehicles, the manufacture of parts for the bodies of private cars is being proceeded with, and it is desirable that the very special concession given, the reduction of the horse-power tax, should be confined to cars which use Saorstát manufactured parts to whatever extent may be required.</P>

As I have indicated, the bodies of commercial vehicles were being made by coach-builders until, quite recently, the all-steel commercial vehicle body was put on the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 27th November last we heard about the Labourers Bill.  Now, nearly six months have passed, and in a most remarkable way the dust has to be <Col N="141" /> taken off the Minister's papers and off ours in order to discuss the matter to-day.  When we dealt with the matter last month the Minister and his backers in the country took exception to some of the words used here.  I think it is important that the Minister would clear away any misconception there was at that particular time, and deal here now with what this Bill is going to cost the State and to some extent indicate what it is going to pay for that cost.  On the Second Reading Stage I described this Bill as the raising of the curtain on the third act of the great Fianna Fáil swindle.  The Minister considered that I hardly knew what the word &ldquo;swindle&rdquo; does mean or might mean, or even if I did not, there was very little excuse for my using the language I used at the time.</P>
      <P>On the barely financial side of things, I would like to bring this to the notice of the Minister&mdash;a committee was set up in November, 1932.  It was understood that there was six months' work in front of it.  On the 13th of January, 1933, after I expect a general election had been declared, we all read in the columns of the <i>Irish Press,</i> and in the <i>Irish Press</i> alone, an elaborate statement as to what the <i>interim</i> report, said to have been issued by the committee, contained.  We read therein what the report set out could be done for 42,000 people; we read that in the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 13th January, 1933.  The two other Dublin papers and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> were only able to get that report on the 14th of January, but the members of the Dáil never got an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the document that was then called an <i>ad interim</i> report.  However, what we are now concerned with is what the <i>ad interim</i> report contained.  According to the <i>Irish Press</i> that report stated: &ldquo;Rents are to be reduced by 25 per cent., payable quarterly instead of weekly to save collection expenses&rdquo;; and it stated that the rates were to be relieved to the extent of £50,000, while the cottier tenants would benefit to the extent of £32,000, and that the scheme proposed by the commission was one &ldquo;which would not impose any further charge on the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, the House wants <Col N="142" /> to get some kind of clear information from the Minister as to whether this measure before us is intended to relieve the tenants of £32,000 a year; whether it is expected to relieve the local authorities or the ratepayers of £50,000 a year, or whether it is expected to put no charge on the State?  Anybody who knows anything on the subject will agree that the tenants cannot be relieved to the extent mentioned, and that the local authorities cannot be relieved to the extent mentioned, without putting an increased burden on the State.  We would like to know from the Minister what increased burden, if any, is to be borne by the State as a result of this measure being put into operation, and what other expenses are going to arise as a result of it.  If the Minister cannot make this measure in its working out live up to the statements that were so prominently and enthusiastically published on the 13th of January, 1933, then all that has been done up to the present in connection with the promises and hopes held out to the cottage tenants is nothing but a gigantic Fianna Fáil swindle.  Before proceeding with the Committee Stage, I think we should have a full explanation of the financial implications and proposals of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, in asking this House for money, and in his endeavour to put the House in possession of the facts of the amount of money required, the Minister might have told us to what extent he was to finance this Bill by moneys received from the local authorities at present, and which were repayments of loans received from the British Government in the old days&mdash; moneys which are now supposed to be used as revenue.  When the Minister comes in here and demands money for this particular Bill, he should give us that information.  This Bill, I am afraid, on the face of it, is not a Bill of which advantage will be taken. When the Second Reading of the Bill was being debated, the case had been made, and I think rightly, that these moneys were due to the local authorities throughout the country under the head of local loans, which are now being collected by the Government as <Col N="143" /> revenue.  These loans had originally been used to build those cottages.  I do not think there was any satisfactory answer given to this line of criticism at the time.  I had rather hoped, as this Bill has been so long in its incubation period&mdash;since November last until now&mdash;that the Minister would drop it and give us something of use. I say that, because under the Bill which we are proposing to finance to-day purchase is optional as far as the tenants are concerned.  Obviously, in an optional scheme, there must be some attraction to the purchaser.  If there is anything to attract the cottier to buy his house under this Bill, it has not been shown at any time by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As far as the figures supplied by the famous Commission are concerned, figures to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred, it would appear that the charges upon the cottiers are to be increased.  If that is so, and if the purchase is optional, it does appear on the face of it that the purchase scheme of the Bill is not going to be availed of.  But with all these facts in front of him the Minister comes in and asks the Dáil to finance this particular scheme.  I do not think the scheme deserves to be financed.  I do not think it is going to be taken advantage of.  At present the Government is in possession of certain moneys which ought to be devoted to this purpose. I should like to hear something on that matter from the Minister.  The whole question of labourers' cottages has been so advertised by the present Government Parties that the House is entitled to know what are the advantages of this Bill to the ratepayers or to the labourers, so far as the purchase scheme is concerned.  None of these matters has been made clear to the House, and we are entitled to have some information from the Minister on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is evident I <Col N="144" /> think from the remarks of Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Brennan that it is not really for the purpose of looking for information they made their speeches, but to try to impede as much as they can the passage of this Bill through the Committee Stage.  Deputy Mulcahy rehashed the old stale charges he made here during the discussion on the Second Reading.  The House was then given the full facts relating to the Bill.  The information that the Deputy then asked for was, if I recollect correctly, put fully before him. He had not anything new to say nor any new question to ask, so he looked up his old speech just to see if there was anything of an insulting kind particularly, though I am so used and the House are so used to that kind of thing from Deputy Mulcahy that it flows very easily over us.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that there is no increased burden to be put on the State.  But the fact that he knows it would not prevent him from making a speech of that kind.</P>
      <P>There is a contribution of approximately £74,000 payable by the State in respect of the pre-war cottages and that is not going to be increased. There will be certain advantages to the tenants of the cottages if they wish to avail themselves of the Bill, if it passes the Oireachtas.  Deputy Brennan says that in his opinion there will be none and that it will not be availed of.  As the House knows, the principle of the Bill is permissive.  It is not mandatory in any way, except that the local authorities must produce a scheme.  That is the only thing that is mandatory.  If there is not any attraction for the tenants in it, then they need not avail themselves of it. If Deputy Brennan thinks that the terms are not good enough for the tenants, he has not put down any amendment.  Deputy Morrissey has, I know.  Deputy Brennan, so far as I know, has not.  Probably Deputy Morrissey speaks for Deputy Brennan in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it will be found that the tenants will find it to their advantage to become the owners of their cottages and plots on the terms offered.  I am strengthened in that <Col N="145" /> belief by the number of letters I have received from various cottage tenants' organisations pressing for the early discussion and passing of the Bill.  If I had been free from other duties, I would have been glad to have the Committee Stage of the Bill taken earlier. It was owing to pressure, that I think might be obvious to the House, of work on my own shoulders in particular in the last couple of months that the Committee Stage was not taken earlier.  Why Deputy Mulcahy thinks it is being rushed to-day I do not know. Deputy Mulcahy says it is being rushed and is being taken as a matter of urgency.  Deputy Brennan complains that it has been delayed too long. There is not much unanimity of opinion between these Deputies, although they both occupy the Front Bench.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan said that it was discussed last November and that we are only getting the Committee Stage now. What was that intended for but a complaint?  He complains that it has been delayed and Deputy Mulcahy complains that it is brought up too quickly.  They can fix up the row between themselves.  Any information that is wanted on the finances of it I think has already been given.  If there is anything else in the way of figures that the House wants I shall be glad to give it.  It is the right of the House to ask for it and it should be given.  I would, however, suggest that the type of speech that Deputy Mulcahy started out upon is rather one for the Second Reading and one that he made on the Second Reading, and he added nothing new or novel to it to-day.  He loved his offensive remarks so much that he thought he must repeat them.  The financial effect of the scheme, as compared with the existing position, is estimated as follows&mdash;the figures for the existing position are taken for the year 1931: Expenditure:&mdash;Annual loan charges, £267,533; repairs, £50,138; fire insurance, £2,451; cost of rent collection, £16,367; other outgoings, £9,806&mdash; total, £346,295.</P>

That gives the balance. Under the proposed sale scheme the position is estimated as follows:&mdash;Estimated annual loan charges, £267,533&mdash; the same figure; fire insurance, £2,251; cost of rent collection, £12,000; other outgoings, say, £7,400; total, 289,384. Receipts: rents, £97,000; State subsidies, £73,593&mdash;the same as before; other receipts, £1,914; total, £172,507. Deficit to be raised from rates, £116,877.  Under the scheme the loss falling on the local authorities would be reduced by £24,566&mdash;that is estimated, of course.  Tenants' rents will be reduced by £32,356, while the cost of repairs and maintenance will be borne by the tenants.  In 1934 the gross cost of repairs was £44,000.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say how, within the framework of this Bill, we are to get at these figures? Having made it mandatory on the local authorities&mdash;the boards of health&mdash;to prepare schemes in certain circumstances, what data have they to go on which, worked all over the country, would produce the figures which the Minister has read?  I see nothing in the Bill that would give that information. There is no data, no formula by which a scheme would be prepared and submitted to the Department of the Minister.  The Minister may consider a scheme, reject it or send it back, and have a new one prepared.  As a member of a board of health, I ask, if the Bill becomes an Act, pending a requisition for a scheme, are we to set about preparing one?  If so, I see nothing in the Bill to help me to prepare such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> The Minister must have some formula in mind if he can read out figures here that will be produced by his scheme.  Suppose we had one general scheme in the whole country&mdash;and that is what the Minister bases his figures on&mdash;and if boards of health were to proceed to work in harmony, and all to start at the same time, must they not have some formula such as the Minister had?  Where are we to get that formula?  Will the Local Government make orders and regulations, and when the boards of health are ready will they get their plans, or receive from the Local Government Department instructions how they are to fill in their schemes?  If not, I cannot see how the Minister could give the figures he quoted here.  I would like some enlightenment on that.  In my opinion that is the great flaw in the Bill.  The Minister is throwing the onus on the local authorities and not giving them any direction.  The Minister ought to give some clear and specific directions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that the only thing that was right in the statement issued by the Government Press in January, 1933, was that there would be no additional charge upon the State.  The figures, as quoted now, and for which Deputy Belton cannot see any basis, are based on the complete operation of this Bill, so that every cottage now built is transferred to every tenant.  On that basis, and assuming the Minister has machinery, and that there is so much general oil to run that machinery, all this is going to come to pass.  The Minister's figures disclosed that instead of relieving the rates of £50,000 per annum, there will be a reduction in that relief to the extent of £24,000.  And instead of relieving tenants to the extent of £32,000, the tenants, if they purchase their cottages under this well-oiled scheme of the Minister, are going to have an increase of £17,782 in cost of repairs; so that, under the Minister's scheme, where the tenants are going to be reduced £32,000 in their rents, instead of getting that reduction of £32,000 there is going to be an increase of £17,782.  Even though tenants can <Col N="148" /> reduce the cost of repairs, as compared with what the Minister says took place in 1935, nevertheless repairs are going to cost the tenants £12,000 a year more to keep the roofs over their heads.  For that reason, all that has been said by the Government Party, up to this, in encouraging tenants to think that they are going to retain their homes at a reduced cost, is nothing but a swindle.  The Minister is asking us to sanction the expenditure of moneys for a variety of machinery that is going to bring such a state of affairs about.  I do not think any money should be voted that would bring about such a state of affairs as will increase the cost to the tenants by from £12,000 to £17,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no machinery of the detailed kind that Deputy Belton called attention to provided in the Bill.  But instructions will be issued in accordance with the Bill when it becomes an Act.  Individual counties will be taken into consideration and boards of health will be asked to put up schemes on the basis of the Act and to act in accordance with the instructions.  We found it would be too great a task to put into the Bill machinery to cover all the conditions that exist in all the counties in regard to these matters.  There are such a variety of conditions with regard to the building of these cottages and such a variety of regulations in these Acts under which they were built that it was thought better, from the point of view of the boards of health and the cottagers, to leave that matter as elastic as possible, so that in arranging schemes later on, the best possible terms for the boards and the cottiers and such as would be fair and just to both should be arrived at.  It would be very difficult to set out all the details in connection with the various cottages built under the various Acts, and where the financing has been so very different under the various schemes.  With regard to the arrangement of a scheme that would be produced by the boards of health in consultation with the Department of Local Government providing for as even a division of the financial responsibility for tenants coming under this scheme, <Col N="149" /> it was thought it would be better to leave that matter for discussion between the boards of health and the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I do not think that tenants or boards of health will suffer because we have not set out in detail what this scheme should be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy says it is a swindle. Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.  If the tenants think it is a swindle they will not have anything to do with it.  Perhaps, from the tenants' point of view, it would be a good thing for them to hear that Deputy Mulcahy calls it a swindle, that is if any of them pays any attention to Deputy Mulcahy's words.  I do not think there are many that will.  They will weigh the pros and cons and will see for themselves the value of Deputy Mulcahy's figures, and whether it is worth while to pay £12,000 more as he says, on the whole, to be the owners of their own cottages and plots in perpetuity. If it is worth that, they will put in their applications to be considered under the purchase scheme.  If they think it is a swindle, as Deputy Mulcahy said, they will not purchase and there the matter will end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A person shall be an agricultural labourer within the meaning of the Principal Acts if at any time of his life he worked as an agricultural labourer and is now engaged in agricultural pursuits on his own account on land he has rented in conacre or grazing agistment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting this amendment, seeing that this section gives a much wider meaning to the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; than the Principal Acts have given up to the present.  The Bill also contemplates, where estates are being divided by the <Col N="150" /> Land Commission, that a parcel of land, the size of which is not defined or limited, can be given to the occupant of a labourer's cottage.  If a man can be so helped by the State and remain in his cottage, I do not see why a man who has, by his own effort, climbed up a bit of the ladder and ceased to be in the narrow definition of the term an &ldquo;agricultural labourer for hire&rdquo;&mdash;a man who has purchased cattle or obtained conacre&mdash;should not be allowed to live in and purchase a labourer's cottage.  If he has not a right to purchase it, he has not a right to be living in it.  I make no special pleading on the matter, but, considering that the Bill really deals with that principle in a larger way though in a different direction, I do not see why the Minister should not take in this principle, which is really similar.  It was the practice heretofore that a person with over a quarter-acre could not occupy a labourer's cottage.  Henceforth, there will be no limit to the land that a man may legally own and still reside in a labourer's cottage. Why should not a man who has taken conacre be permitted to be the occupant and purchaser of a labourer's cottage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is unnecessary.  If the Deputy will look up my amendment to Section 16&mdash;amendment No. 9&mdash;he will see that what he proposes is covered.  The only difference is that Deputy Belton does not make clear in his amendment that the person he refers to is now a tenant of a cottage.  If he is now a tenant of a cottage, and if he was an agricultural labourer when he first occupied the cottage, he will have the right, when the Bill is passed, to become a purchaser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the Deputy knows that the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; has a very wide meaning. It covers persons who do agricultural work for hire at any season of the year in any area, urban or rural. Sub-section 2 (a) of the amendment refers to &ldquo;a person (i) who is the tenant of such cottage, and (ii) who <Col N="151" /> either is an agricultural labourer or was, when he first became tenant, an agricultural labourer.&rdquo;  Would not that cover what the Deputy has in mind?</P>

      <P>I do not know that we could stretch the provision so widely as that.  If the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; were to cover persons who were not agricultural labourers, when they became tenants, it would be stretching its meaning very widely. At present it excludes practically nobody who, when he became a tenant, was an agricultural labourer.  The amendment might make for hardship on cottiers.  You might have people who were never agricultural labourers coming along and purchasing those cottages over the heads of others who were.</P>

Would it not be a hardship not to give such a man a labourer's cottage?  Having given it to him, would it not be a greater hardship not to give him facilities to buy it, especially since the State, under this Bill, can give the occupant of a labourer's cottage a parcel of land at its own expense?

      <P>The definition &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; is pretty wide at present.  In many cases boards of health have given cottages to such people.  There are already conditions in the Housing Acts enabling very generous grants to be given to such people to build houses for themselves. They can get up to £80 for the building of houses.  Why should they claim labourers' cottages?  However, that is getting into another aspect of the question, and I do not think that is what Deputy Belton has in mind.  I am inclined to think that what the Deputy wants to achieve can be done under the Bill as it stands.  I will look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where by process of law or in pursuance of an order made under statutory authority a cottage the ownership of which was transferred from a rural district council, a county council or a board of health to an urban district council, a borough council or to the council of a county borough (in this Act referred to as the &ldquo;urban authority&rdquo;) and such cottage is at the commencement of this Act vested in an urban authority the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say, not later than six months after the appointed day such urban authority shall in relation to every such cottage which is not situated on State lands, prepare and submit to the Minister in accordance with this Act a purchase scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section the provisions of this Act relating to the preparation and submission to the Minister of a purchase scheme under Section 12 of this Act and prescribing the powers and duties of the Minister in relation to a purchase <Col N="155" /> scheme so submitted shall apply and have effect as if such provisions were re-enacted <i>mutatis mutandis</i> in this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this Act the expression &ldquo;board of health&rdquo; shall be deemed to include an urban authority for the purpose of this section and this Act shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>The House will be familiar with the fact that from time to time there is a certain extension of the boundaries of borough councils and urban district councils.  In recent years there has been a greater tendency in the direction of extending the boundaries of urbanised towns and cities, and that process is likely to continue so far that these extensions will result in tracts of land being taken in, on which there was erected in the past labourers' cottages. The persons living in these cottages will not have changed their occupations, merely because of the change in municipal control, but will still be agricultural labourers, and presumably following their normal occupation.  It seems to me that if it is desirable in the view of the Government to arrange for the sale of these cottages, the tenants in the extended areas should be given an opportunity of coming within the scope of the Bill, so that they will get the same benefit as other agricultural labourers obtain.  There does not seem to be a provision in the Bill whereby an authority that might secure a strip of territory on which cottages were erected would have imposed on it the obligation of setting up a purchase scheme.  The object of the amendment is to enable them to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cottages that might be affected by the amendment are probably largely situated in County Dublin.  There are others at Bundoran and Passage West in Cork.  They have been included in municipal areas as a result of the extension of boundaries or for some other reason.  Since they were transferred these cottages are being dealt with by the municipal authorities.  Under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and in accordance with these Acts, any local <Col N="156" /> authority so inclined can at any time submit a purchase scheme.  I do not see why we should differentiate between cottages that have come under municipal authority and cottages already dealt with by urban councils or municipalities.  I do not see why there should be preferential treatment. If local authorities, urban councils or municipal councils, wish to put up purchase schemes, as some have done, for instance, in County Dublin, under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, there is nothing to prevent them doing so and offering terms perhaps as generous, or may be less generous, to attract tenants of labourers' cottages in urban areas to purchase their holdings. I do not think it would be fair to the rest of the tenants that the holders of the cottages referred to here, some of whom perhaps may have an acre of land, should get preferential treatment in urban areas or municipalities, by being able to purchase an acre of land at a price at which the local authority could never dream of purchasing it for itself.  It would be unfair to the local authority and unfair to the other occupants of cottages and small houses in urban areas or municipalities. I do not think it would be fair to make it mandatory on the local authority to give preferential treatment to one particular class of its citizens.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I am rather amazed at the way in which the Minister has met the point raised by Deputy Norton.  He talks about preferential treatment, about nnfairness to the local authority, and to the occupants of other houses built by the local authority.  But we are dealing with cottages that were built and financed as cottages for agricultural labourers.  They were put up at a different period, financed in a different way, and tenanted by different people from the people who generally occupy houses built by urban councils and corporations. They are occupied practically altogether by people who are in occupations that usually do not command as high a wage, as the occupations of tenants of other working-class houses.  It seems to me that it would be a great hardship to exclude them <Col N="157" /> from the Bill.  As for the Minister's point about the acre of land, I do not see anything in it.  Whether there may be administrative difficulties in the way of working this amendment I do not know, but I cannot see any other sound reason for opposing it.  It seems to me that we should deal with this matter as a whole and we should not leave out these few cottages because they are brought within a municipal area.  I cannot see any reason why, if there are any benefits to be conferred by this Bill, they should not be extended to these cottage owners.  It seems to me that, if anything, they are more entitled to these benefits and perhaps paid a higher price for these benefits, than those to whom the benefits are to be extended.  The Minister has made no case at all against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather suprised at the attitude adopted by the Minister towards this amendment.  I suppose we may assume from what the Minister has said since the extension of boundaries, the administration of these cottages has been taken over by the urban authorities concerned.  As far as I have been able to ascertain, the rents in some of those cases have been increased.  I suggest to the Minister that that is all the more reason why he should take power under this Bill to enable him to deal with these cottages in the same way as cottages which are 20 or 30 yards outside the urban boundary.  The liability taken over by the urban authority is a great deal less than the liability which they have to meet for houses of similar capacity inside their area which they have built themselves.  Deputy Norton has pointed out that these people are working in similar occupations to those followed by people to whom it is proposed to extend the benefits of the Bill.  They are still working as farm labourers, as far as I know and I think they should get the same treatment as their brother farm labourers a few perches away.  I do not think there will be any difficulty in the matter. Any urban council concerned will be satisfied to carry out what the Minister lays down in this Bill.  Such information as I have is to the effect that the urban authorities concerned are quite <Col N="158" /> satisfied to have these tenants included in the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider his attitude and agree that these people should receive the same treatment as people employed in similar occupations and living in similar houses.</P>

      <P>Might I be permitted to ask the Minister a question which I forgot to put to him when I was previously speaking?  Is it not a fact that many of the cottages which are at present within urban areas are still the responsibility of the county board of health?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask that is because the Minister said that there were a few cases where there were cottages within the urban area.  There are certain areas which he did not mention where, to my own knowledge, there are labourers' cottages, and I was wondering whether these were still the responsibility of the board of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine that the Minister believed that he had a convincing case against the amendment, because certainly the arguments he adduced this evening were far from convincing, and I do not imagine that they could have made a very great impression on his own mind.  The Minister said that it would be unfair to treat agricultural labourers, whose cottages had been annexed by an urban authority, differently from the occupants of houses erected for the working classes generally.  Here we have a position in which the State sets out to confer what it believes to be certain benefits on the occupants of easily defined houses, houses which are defined as the residences of agricultural labourers.  Everybody knows what an agricultural labourer's cottage is.  It is easily defined by Act of Parliament, by the method of financing it and almost by its structure.  There is no difficulty, therefore, in the Legislature saying, and in the local authority <Col N="159" /> recognising, that it is possible to confer ownership on the occupants of those houses, but the Minister now wants to have a sub-division of this class.  You have a broad category of people there, in the main resident in rural areas. The Minister wants to say that any of these cottages situate on land, which for other purposes has been annexed by the urban authority, is not to be sold to the occupant.  Does the Minister think that there would be an unfair preference given to persons of that kind if their cottages were sold to them, while the general run of cottages or houses owned by the local authority were not disposed of to the occupants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in his endeavour to appear consistent as between one cottage and another owned by the local authority, he is in fact creating a far bigger anomaly. As Deputy Corish has pointed out, we may have two labourers' cottages erected for the one purpose originally, financed in the same way originally, owned by the same local authority, one situate a short distance within the urban area and another situate a short distance outside.  The persons occupying both cottages follow substantially the same craft, yet one is entitled to become the owner of his cottage and the other is to be prevented from becoming the owner by the Minister's refusal to accept the amendment.  I think that is an anomalous state of affairs, an anomaly dealing with one well-defined class, which the Minister should not persist in maintaining by refusing to accept the amendment.  You may have the peculiar position that the Dublin Corporation and the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council acquire portions of County Dublin.  In respect of the portions so acquired, if the Minister persists in his present attitude, there will be no sale of the labourers' cottages situated on that land, but when this Bill is passed the County Dublin Board of Health may submit to the Minister a purchase scheme.  He may sanction it, and the tenants of cottages owned by the board of health may have the ownership of those cottages conferred on them.  At a later date the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council or the Dublin Corporation <Col N="160" /> may desire to extend their boundaries further, and if permitted to do so they will take within their area not merely cottages which they will not sell, but cottages which have already been sold to the tenants. Therefore, you will have within the one urban area two categories of people: (1), those resident in cottages which were acquired before this Bill was passed; and (2) those resident in cottages on land acquired by the urban authority after this Bill was passed. You will have two classes of people within the urban area, one, with the right to purchase its cottage, and, secondly, another class prevented from purchasing its cottage.  I suggest to the Minister that, in his effort to appear to avoid an anomaly, he is creating a much bigger, a much more indefensible, anomaly than the one that he is seeking to avoid.  I trust, therefore, that he will reconsider and meet the point that I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the remarks that have been made by Deputy Norton and others, I cannot see any reason for changing my attitude. What the Deputy has said as to what may happen in Dublin City or in the Dun Laoghaire Borough is probably correct: that, at some future date, both bodies may extend their boundaries and take within them cottages erected originally for labourers in connection with which a cottage tenant purchasing scheme may have been adopted by the Dublin County Council. But, there is a certain number of such cottages already within the urban area, and who will say that these cottages, built originally for agricultural labourers, are now occupied by people who would come within the definition of an agricultural labourer?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Every purchase scheme prepared under and in accordance with this Act shall provide or be deemed to contain a provision that the annuity payable by a tenant under this Act in respect of any particular cottage shall be a sum not exceeding 50 per cent. of the rent at which such cottage was let to the original occupier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, Sir, that the value of this Bill as a practical proposition to existing tenants must be related to the price at which it will enable them to purchase their cottages.  If we are to provide for the tenants an annuity based on a certain percentage of the present rent, and at the same time to throw on to the tenants burdens which far outstep the relief which they are to be granted in the form of the reduced annuity, then I think we are going to make this Bill unacceptable to the tenants.  Even in the case of those tenants who might have the temerity to purchase their cottages under the Bill, I think we will find that many of them will be unable to bear the burden which they will voluntarily undertake, and in a short time the local authorities will find themselves in the position not merely of being unable to collect the present rent of the cottages, but unable even to collect the annuities which are to be the <Col N="165" /> tenants' contribution in payment for the cottages.  In order to get some picture of what this Bill does in respect of the tenants, it is necessary to ascertain what the tenants pay at present in the form of rents, and what sum is spent in repairs on the cottages, and to compare that information with the rents which the tenants will pay in the form of annuity when the Bill becomes law, and the liability they will be undertaking in respect of keeping their cottages in repair.</P>
    <P>When the Commission which dealt with this whole matter was sitting in 1932, it had submitted to it by the Department information to the effect that the rents received by local authorities from the tenants of labourers' cottages amounted to £129,000, and that the local authorities were spending a sum of £50,000 on repairs.  If we take the present position, we find that the local authorities are still securing in the form of rents a sum of £129,000, and are spending, approximately, £44,000 on repairs. These, I think, are the figures given by the Minister.  The tenant under this Bill will become the owner of his cottage when he pays an annuity for a certain substantial period of years. He will be asked to pay 75 per cent. of the present rent of £129,000, which means that he will be required to contribute, in the form of an annuity, £97,000, and to undertake responsibility for repairs, which at present cost the local authority £44,000.  The tenants, thinking of them as a collective community, are at present enabled to occupy their cottages by paying not less than £129,000, but, when this Bill is passed, they will become the owners of their cottages by paying £97,000 for rent and undertaking repairs which at present cost the local authorities £44,000.</P>
    <P>If we assume that that sum of money was genuinely spent on repairs, and that the local authorities did their duty in ensuring that they got value for the money they spent, this Bill will impose on the tenants, as a body, an obligation to meet annually, for the required period of years, a burden of £141,000 instead of the burden of £129,000 which they are being asked to pay at present.  I <Col N="166" /> think it is clear that, in existing conditions, the occupants of labourers' cottages are not able to pay even the present rates of rent.  According to information supplied by the Minister on Second Reading, the arrears in respect of labourers' cottages, a few years ago, amounted to £33,000.  I think he also indicated that that figure which was for 1932 had risen to £53,000 in 1935, and, in that vast amount of arrears, I think we have abundant evidence that the tenants of labourers' cottages, due to the depressed state of agriculture, due to the low rates of wages paid in the agricultural industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and due to the low rates of unemployment assistance benefit, find themselves in a situation in which they are unable to pay the rents for labourers' cottages with the ease and promptitude with which everybody would desire the rents of community-owned cottages of that kind to be paid.  This Bill is not going to ease the burden on the tenant.  Even the Minister to-day admitted that, so far as the tenants are concerned, between repairs and rents, they will now pay a sum of money in excess of the present rents, and in view of the fact that we have evidence that they are not able to pay the present rents, and that the burden is too onerous for them, I think it unfair to impose on these tenants a burden which they can never discharge. I think it will not be many years before this, or some other, Minister comes to the House for some kind of powers to deal with the situation created by the inability of the agricultural labourers to pay even the annuity on the scale conceived by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenant, of course, might be able to shed some of the burden, if he were to say, &ldquo;I will take this Bill in the belief that my only outgoings on the cottage will be 75 per cent. of the present rent,&rdquo; and many persons may be disposed to look on the Bill somewhat in that light.  They will pay the <Col N="167" /> annuity under pressure from the local authority, but it may be found that, through economic necessity, or some other equally good cause, it is not possible for them to purchase the materials necessary for the repair of the cottages, and, in that case, the repair of the cottages will be neglected.  The boards of health will not ensure in the way in which they ought to ensure, or in the way in which one might expect them to ensure, that the cottages are, in fact, kept in a proper state of repair from year to year, and it may well happen that the tenant, finding it difficult enough to pay 75 per cent. of his present rent, will not be able to meet the cost of repairs, with the result that a very valuable national asset in the form of labourers' cottages may well be allowed to fall into a state of disrepair, and the national advantage of these cottages considerably impaired from the standpoint of being a national asset.</P>
    <P>If that situation developed, it would be a very serious loss to the community, and it would constitute a considerable-damage to a community-created asset, in the form of labourers' cottages.  If the imposition on the labourer of the responsibility of repairing the cottages means that the cottages are allowed to fall into disrepair, through his inability, by reason of economic necessity, to discharge that responsibility, I am greatly afraid that labourers will be unable to keep the cottages in repair.  If we take the present average rent of these cottages as approximately 1/2 per week, 75 per cent. of that will amount to 10½d., and the saving to the labourer, therefore, by reducing his rent to an annuity of 75 per cent., will be approximately 3½d. per week, or 15/- per annum. That is the sum of money which the labourer has to store by to meet the cost of repairs.  I do not think he can do it on that slender margin.  We have got to remember that many of the 42,000 cottages which will be purchased under this Bill&mdash;the cottages erected under earlier Acts, and not under recent Acts&mdash;were erected over 40 years ago, and some of them are in existence for approximately 50 years. The burden of repairing those is going <Col N="168" /> to become heavy.  It is not a case of wanting some minor repair in this or that respect.  The repairs of defects which show themselves in houses which have been in use, often by a large family, for a period of 50 years, are going to be extremely costly, from the standpoint of the tenant, and to meet that burden the tenant has a sum of 3½d. per week.  The saving to him will be in an amount of 3½d. per week, but the obligation on him will arise, not in a form he can meet at the rate of 3½d. per week, but in a form which will require him to get together some pounds, in order to undertake the repairs at a particular time.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House the relatively large sum which is spent on repairs at present, but the Minister, on Second Reading, admitted that boards of health in many cases had done little or nothing in the way of repairs.  So that, to get a real picture of the repairs to be carried out in any particular year, you really require to take the present figure of £44,000 or £50,000, according to the year you select; but you have got to make allowance for the fact that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has the view that boards of health, in many cases, have done little or nothing in the way of repairs, and therefore repairs on a scale larger than that revealed in statistical returns here by the Minister must be undertaken if the houses are to be in a proper state of repair.  Again, that is the kind of burden that is going to be borne by the tenants of labourers' cottages.  I think that if we are really desirous of assisting the agricultural labourer, if we really realise that we have a responsibility to the agricultural labourer to ensure that, because of his low wages and the general environment of the agricultural industry, he must be provided with a homestead on the easiest possible terms, then I think we should be taking the burdens off the backs of the agricultural labourers instead of piling them on, as this Bill will do if a burden of 75 per cent., plus the cost of repairs, is imposed on the agricultural labourers.  I think that the State must realise that the agricultural labourer is in a difficult position.  The <Col N="169" /> agricultural labourer follows an avocation which goes hand-in-hand with a very low standard of living, and if you are going to keep him on the land and provide him with a homestead as the rallying base for his family, and if you are going to endeavour to ensure that he gets accommodation at the cheapest possible price, then I think the State must face the responsibility of sharing, on behalf of the agricultural labourer, a substantial portion of the burden that is necessary to carry out a reform of that kind.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, I think, will impose on the agricultural labourer a burden that it will be difficult for him to bear, and I can well imagine some Deputy of this House putting down a question five years hence asking the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of that period what is the amount of annuities outstanding in respect of agricultural labourers' cottages, and I can imagine him receiving a reply that, I rather think, will confirm the forebodings that I had in respect of this Bill if the burden contemplated by this Bill is put on the agricultural labourer.  In this amendment I sought particularly to say that the rent of a cottage should be a sum not exceeding 50 per cent. of the original rent at which such cottage had been let to the occupier.  My reason for that was that some years ago&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy, probably, could throw more light on it than I can&mdash; local authorities were encouraged to increase the rents of labourers' cottages and, in a number of cases, did increase the rents.  In some areas they carried out the instructions of the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and in other areas they did not do so.  Now, the man under a local authority which refused to carry out such instructions is probably holding his cottage at the original rent, whereas in other cases, where such instructions were carried out, a newcomer will be expected to pay 75 per cent. of the increased rent, although he is in the same kind of cottage as the other man.  That is a matter to which, obviously, the Minister should pay attention.  Apart from that, certain local authorities have established a practice whereby, when a cottage becomes vacant, 6d. is added to the rent <Col N="170" /> of the incoming tenant, and when a newcomer comes in there is probably an increase of 100 per cent. on the original rent, not because the cottage is better, but because it has changed hands so many times.  That is not right.  To ask a person to pay 75 per cent. of that enhanced rent is unfair. I know of cases in my own constituency where, in fact, rents have been increased two or three times merely because a particular cottage had changed hands that many times.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that this Bill will be regarded as a boon and a benefit to the agricultural labourers who will be the occupants of these cottages.  I think that this amendment, if it is accepted, will ensure that local authorities can look forward with reasonable certainty to their ability to count upon the regular payment of annuities under this Bill from the labourers to local authorities.  If the Minister should persist in passing the Bill in its present form, I think it will impose a burden on agricultural labourers which will break down community credit and which will help to break down community transactions of the kind contemplated in this Bill. That is neither a desirable thing to occur, nor is it a desirable thing to encourage by the creation of a set of circumstances under which conditions of that kind thrive.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment, I think he can look forward to the certainty that the Bill will be regarded as a boon by agricultural labourers, and not as something which increases, instead of lessening, existing burdens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, earlier to-day, speaking on the Money Resolution, I think, talked about the advantages that this Bill is going to confer on the tenants.  I should like to say, in regard to this amendment standing in Deputy Norton's name and my own, that whether the Bill is going to be beneficial or not will depend on the Minister's attitude to this amendment. It seems to me that if this amendment is accepted by the Minister, then the Bill may be said to be conferring a benefit on the tenants; but if the <Col N="171" /> Minister refuses to accept this amendment, and if he insists on the Bill in the form in which he brought it before the House, I have no hesitation in saying that, rather than benefiting the tenants in any way, the Bill will impose a burden.  We want to get a few points clear in this connection.  The average rent of cottages at the moment, as has been stated, is 1/2 per week.  The Bill proposes that the annuities will be 75 per cent. of that.  In other words, the tenant is to get a reduction of 3½d. per week, but he is to be made responsible for the repairs.  We have got various figures regarding the cost of repairs. We are told that, in 1931, the bill to be shouldered by local authorities for repairs was £50,000, in respect of 42,000 cottages.  We are told that the amount last year was £44,000, but we know, and the Minister has admitted himself, that whether it was £50,000 or £44,000, it was not the amount that should have been spent&mdash;it was far from the amount that should have been spent&mdash;if the repairs which were necessary to be carried out had been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know quite well that certain county boards of health have done their best to carry out whatever repairs were necessary.  On the other hand, we know that many county boards of health did not do anything at all approaching what they should have done.  Perhaps the county boards of health themselves were not always responsible; perhaps in certain cases responsibility might be placed on certain officials.  Whoever was at fault, £50,000 does not represent the amount which repairs should have cost in 1931 any more than I believe does £44,000 represent the amount last year.  Whatever reluctance there was on the part of local authorities to carry out repairs to labourers' cottages in 1931, that reluctance has, perhaps, increased considerably during the last three or four years, for many reasons.  If we put it at the lowest and take the Minister's estimate as to the average cost of repairs, he puts it at 5½d. per week, and the benefit to be conferred on the tenant is the benefit of paying 2d. a week more for his cottage than he has been paying.  Accepting the Minister's <Col N="172" /> figure of 5½d., the tenant gets a reduction of 3½d. in his rent and is saddled with 5½d. for repairs.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why the reduction should be substantially more than 25 per cent.  We know that as regards agricultural labourers, even if we take into account the official figures, their wages have been substantially reduced.  We know that many of them are unemployed and we know still further that the cost of living has fairly substantially increased for those men. Generally speaking, we know that they are not as well off or likely to be as well off as they were some years ago. I think there is hardly anybody who has any knowledge of this matter who will deny that the cost of repairs is more likely to increase than to diminish.  So far as some cottages are concerned, it has gone beyond the stage of repairs and it will mean, in many cases, replacements rather than repairs.  We know that many of the cottages have been built for a long number of years and it is admitted that quite a number of these cottages were not built of the very best materials. We are aware that shortly after they were erected repairs were necessary in many instances and naturally those houses are going to be a growing burden during the coming years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what Deputy Norton has said.  Deputy Norton covered the case fairly fully.  I do want to emphasise that if the Minister does not accept this amendment and if he insists on 25 per cent. as the maximum reduction to be given to the tenants, then the Bill confers no benefit whatever on them.  Notwithstanding what the Minister told us about the letters he has received from the Cottage Tenants' Association to push the Bill through as quickly as possible, I wonder did he get any other letters from Secretaries of Tenants' Associations, or any resolutions?  I am sure he did.  So far as I, and I am sure other members of the House are concerned, we got resolutions from tenants' associations speaking of the Bill in terms other than the Minister told us about to-day.  One could hardly expect the Minister to bring copies of these letters and read them for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is universal agreement that the Minister is to be congratulated on implementing the recommendation of the Cottage Tenants' Commission in respect of cottage purchase.  The beneficial effect of ownership is obvious to anyone keenly interested and intimately acquainted with rural Ireland.  The legitimate and laudable ambition of cottage tenants to become owners of their own homes is at last about to be realised.  There is no better or more deserving section of people in the community than the cottage tenants.  In looking over the report of the Cottage Tenants' Commission I find that one of its recommendations in respect of the matter of rent reduction is a general reduction of 25 per cent. on the rent at present being paid.  Notwithstanding that recommendation of the Cottage Tenants' Commission, I would urge the Minister sympathetically to consider the widely expressed view in favour of making that reduction greater than 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated at some length and very clearly by both Deputy Norton and Deputy Morrissey, the cost of repairs, which is a statutory obligation on the local authorities, is substantially in excess of the 25 per cent. reduction proposed in respect of cottage tenants.  The case has been so forcibly put to the Minister that there is hardly any necessity to stress it further.  We will also have to take into account the expressed intention to put all cottages in a proper state of repair, certified by an engineer from the Department before the purchase <Col N="174" /> arrangement is entered into.  The cost of putting those cottages into a proper state of repair must be considered. Some of them are in a bad state in many counties.  That will, to some extent, equalise the difference between the 50 per cent. reduction advocated by Deputy Norton and what I believe the Minister will, on a unanimous recommendation from all Parties in the House, give to the cottage tenants by way of increasing the proposed 25 per cent. to a greater figure.</P>
    <P>The Cottage Tenants' Commission seem to have dealt entirely with existing tenants, and there is the difficulty of segregating existing cottiers from those who will come into possession of houses that are now being built and those who will occupy cottages that will be erected in future.  That is a problem that confronts the Minister, and it was not given expression to in the terms of reference of the Commission, so far as I can gather.  I assume that the reductions proposed by the Minister in respect of existing cottiers will apply to tenants who will occupy houses now being built and those who will occupy houses that will be constructed under future schemes.  It has been stated that a good many of the cottages at present occupied have been in existence for quite a long time. Some were built more than 40 years ago.  There are some very substantially built, decent houses, and there are others not quite so good.  Rents have been paid during all these years in respect of the cottages built under various schemes during the last 40 years or a little longer.  I did not know that this Bill was coming on this evening, and I have not the advantage of having the Minister's speech by me, but my recollection is that he mentioned that the purchase or redemption period was 35 years in respect of new cottages and 65 in respect of the pre-war cottages. The loans on the cottages built under different schemes fall in, of course, at different periods, and I would suggest in justice to those who have been in occupation of cottages for a number of years that the equated purchase period should be reduced from 65 years to 50 years, from which would be <Col N="175" /> deducted in each case the age of the cottage.  I seriously make this suggestion to the Minister as an equitable way of meeting the cases of those living in the older houses.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to comparisons, we have all seen comparisons made from time to time with regard to the favoured treatment of cottiers in the matter of low rents, aid from the rates and contributions from the Central Funds.  But anybody who has considered the question closely knows that some of the points made in respect of that matter do not deserve serious consideration.  I came across a statistical return lately in which it was set forth that 80 per cent. of all agricultural holdings do not exceed 50 acres, the average acreage of these holdings being something less than 18.  As the average (revised) annuity is 3/3 per acre, the cottager whose rent is 1/2 per week is paying an annual charge greater than 80 per cent. of our landholders of the average holdings in the State.  I find in the report that has been made by the Commission of Inquiry into the Sale of the Cottages and Plots in respect of the reduction of rents, that the Commission reported very fully on the matter, and I find appended to that report a separate recommendation signed by four members which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have signed and agree with the general report, but desire to add that in view of the fact that substantial reductions to the extent of at least 50 per cent. are being made on all annuities payable by tenant farmers and others, under the various Land Acts, we suggest that in this connection favourable consideration should be given to the position of existing cottier tenants whose rent formed portion of the payments hitherto made to the British National Debt Commissioners by an Saor-stát.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that the terms of reference, and also the time at which the annuity payments were withheld precluded that recommendation from being developed.  However, I urge as strongly as I possibly can and as sincerely as I can that the Minister will <Col N="176" /> sympathetically consider the recommendations that have been so widely made in respect of cottage tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude adopted by the Minister in this Bill will, in my opinion, determine the extent, if any, to which financial advantage will come to the cottier tenants under the terms of this Bill.  I am convinced that the Bill, as it stands at present, will not confer any financial advantage on the cottier tenants.  I have advised members of the Cottage Tenants' Association at meetings to which I was summoned that they should carefully consider their position as between the rents they are now paying and the reductions proposed by the Minister, together with the average cost of repayment, which they will have to bear after the Bill comes into law, if it comes into law in its present form. The moneys withheld by this Government from the British Government, including various sums such as R.I.C. pensions and land annuities, amount to a considerable annual sum.  I think the amount payable under cover of loans comes to between £80,000 and £100,000. These had previously been paid over to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £600,000 for loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the total sum is £600,000.  That certainly includes a very big sum to cover loan repayments in connection with labourers' cottages. I would like to have from the Minister when he is replying the figure of the amount previously paid to the British Government previous to the financial dispute under the heading of Loan Charges in connection with the administration of the Labourers Acts.  The farmers of this country got a benefit by the passing of the 1933 Act in connection with moneys withheld under the head of Land Annuities.  There was and there is for the very same reason an equally good case to be made for the cottage tenants to be given the benefit of the moneys withheld covering charges recently paid to the British Government.  That money should be set aside for the purpose of reducing the rents of the cottages or in some way conferring a benefit on the cottage tenants.  The Minister, I presume, may <Col N="177" /> argue that there is no comparison as between the cottage tenants and the farmers.  But the Minister should take into consideration what he cannot deny &mdash;that is, that the cottage tenants of this country, or the majority of the tenants occupying labourers' cottages, are themselves agricultural labourers. We know that agricultural wages between 1931 and 1935 have been reduced by 3/- a week in many counties. In some cases figures could be quoted to show that the reduction is much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events the Minister cannot deny the truth of the information in the statistics circulated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which show that there has been this average reduction of 3/- per week between 1931 and 1935, in the wages of agricultural labourers.  That is as great if not a greater sacrifice than the sacrifice borne by the average small or big farmer in this country. From that point of view there is a strong case to be made in support of endeavouring to put aside £100,000 or whatever the amount is for the purpose of reducing the rents of the cottage tenants.  The figure quoted in 1934 in connection with the loans due on labourers' cottages was about £120,000. That money is being set aside for the purpose of conferring a benefit on some other section besides the cottage tenants.  If it is not so set aside I would like to hear from the Minister how that money is being used or for what purpose it is being used, because certain moneys previously paid to the British Government out of the rents collected have been withheld by the Minister's Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of my colleagues say that this money is going into the Suspense Account.  I think the Suspense Account is now in a state of suspended animation. It was at any rate a Suspense Account up to a certain period.  Deputy Flinn may tell us something about the Suspense Account or whether any of the moneys withheld&mdash;and which were previously paid to the British Government covering loans in connection with labourers' cottages&mdash;are hidden somewhere in the files of the Board of Works.  Some members of the Cottage <Col N="178" /> Tenants' Association who have been speaking in different parts of the country were apparently given to understand by somebody or other that the financial clauses of this Bill would be much better than what they now appear to be.  I quote here from a speech delivered by Mr. Bradley, who is chairman and, I understand, president of the Cottage Tenants' Association executive and a very prominent Fianna Fáil supporter.  Speaking in Kanturk on the 7th August, 1934, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with the forthcoming Cottage Tenants' Bill, it was his information, and he spoke subject to correction, that the occupants of the cottages built under the first schemes 40 years ago or their present tenants would probably get their cottages free.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As reported in the local papers, there was loud applause at the end of that statement.</P>

      <P>Subject to correction, I am sure he got a shock when he read the financial clauses of the Bill.  At any rate, I have reason to know that Mr. Bradley is one of the most discontented officers or members of the Cottage Tenants' Association.  He so informed representatives of this Party in a committee room when pressing us to bring forward the amendment, and we, at his request, are pressing the Minister to accept the amendment in the name of Deputy Norton.  If the Fianna Fáil Party in County Cork wish to retain the goodwill of Mr. Bradley and the other people to whom such rosy promises were held out before the Bill was introduced, I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the modest amendment moved by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am very sceptical as to the way the Bill is likely to be worked when it comes into operation. I fear that there is likely to be, under the present scheme, a considerable amount of contention and argument, and perhaps court cases, as a result of the powers to be conferred in future <Col N="179" /> on boards of health regarding the necessity for repairing cottages.  I, personally, would prefer some scheme to be put forward by the Minister which would leave the responsibility in the future, as in the past, on the local authorities for the repair of cottages. I dare say an engineer or an assistant can, after the Bill comes into operation, go out and instruct, if he likes without justification, a tenant to carry out repairs costing a fairly decent amount, and if the tenant refuses to carry out the repairs as ordered by the engineer, I presume the Bill will give him the power to bring the tenant into court and pile up additional expense on him.</P>

      <P>I am giving a reason why, in my opinion, there is a good case for a reduction of the annuity proposed in the Bill as it stands by 50 per cent.  Deputy Gibbons pointed out that four members of the commission set up by the Minister to advise him on this whole question recommended a reduction of 50 per cent.  I think he will admit that the members concerned are persons who, from his own intimate knowledge in some cases of the members of the body who made the recommendation, knew a great deal about and made a very careful study of this question before ever they were appointed members of that commission. However, I hope the Minister, in view of the representations made, perhaps made with greater force personally to himself, and through the Fianna Fáil organisation by the representatives of the cottage tenants, will see his way in order to make this Bill work smoothly, to reduce the annuity by 50 per cent. as proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Not having at any time any illusions about the Bill, I can appreciate the motive behind the amendment.  I think it is only right that we should endeavour to get down to the figures as presented by the commission which sat at that time in order to see whether it is possible for labourers to purchase their cottages on the terms set out in the Bill, which the movers of the amendment are endeavouring to have amended, and continue to live.  The Minister gave figures, the same figures which the commission had, which showed that the annual rental of these cottages, which are at present the subject of discussion, is £129,356.  Seeing that the scheme is an optional one, the Minister must certainly offer some inducement to these people to buy.  The advantage of ownership, I am afraid, is not an inducement in itself if it is going to cost them too much.  If this rental of £129,000 is reduced by 25 per cent., that brings it down to something like £97,000.  If we take the figure of £50,000 as representing a fair sum to allow for repairs, which the boards of health have apparently, on the average, being paying annually, that will bring up that £97,000, not as Deputy Norton said to £142,000, but to £147,000, so that this new scheme will entail an expenditure on the labourers <Col N="181" /> of £147,000 as against the present £129,000.</P>
      <P>On the Money Resolution I endeavoured to point out to the Minister that, as this was an optional matter with the tenants, there must be some inducement to buy.  The Minister afterwards spoke of certain people being offered preferential treatment by being allowed to purchase under this scheme while others were not.  I do not see much preferential treatment in being permitted to have your outgoings raised from £129,000 to £147,000.  I think that the modest demand made in this amendment is something that the Minister, if he wants the Bill to operate, ought to accept.  Personally, I have a very poor opinion of the Bill and I do not see very much of a future for it.  If, however, the Minister thinks the Bill ought to operate, he certainly will have to offer some inducement to the tenants to purchase.  If he thinks the fact that they are going to become registered owners is an inducement, while the outgoings are increased from £129,000 to £147,000, I personally do not agree with him.  I do not think it is.</P>

      <P>It is hardly possible, I think, for anyone to say anything fresh on this amendment, as almost everything that could be said has been said in its favour by Deputies in all parts of the House.  It is only owing to the importance that I consider attaches to this amendment that I intervene at all for a few moments.  I welcome the fact that there has been a unanimous chorus of appeal to the Minister in favour of this amendment.  As one who has given a good deal of study to this question of the purchase of their cottages by labourers, and the desire all over the country to have such a scheme put into operation, I think that the success of the policy very largely depends upon the acceptance or rejection of the amendment now before the House.  I have been in close touch with the cottage tenants' organisations throughout the country, and especially with those in my own constituency, where almost 100 per cent. of the occupiers of these cottages demand purchase. I say with equal emphasis that they will not avail of this measure if <Col N="182" /> they do not get the 50 per cent. allowance for repairs.  They know from experience that 15/- a year is a hopelessly ridiculous proposition to put before them to keep their houses in repair, and to undertake the responsibility of being liable to surprise inspection under the Bill which would enable repairs to be enforced at the expense of the cottier, irrespective of the meagre amount stated here, 25 per cent., representing an average of 15/- a year.</P>
      <P>Various figures were mentioned as to the cost of the repair of the houses.  Anyone who knows the cost of repairs, anyone connected with a public authority, would be prepared to admit that local authorities would be considered very stupid if they made provision for less than an annual outlay of 30/- for repairs in rural areas.  In urban areas the expenditure would be very much greater. There are about 42,000 houses concerned and an expenditure of 30/- per year would represent about £63,000. That is the minimum figure that ought to be considered for repairs of those cottages.  It is no use talking of what occurred in the years 1931 to 1934 because we know that the cottages were not repaired to the extent that they ought to have been.  If inspection, under this Bill, is to be as lax as it was under the boards of health when they had responsibility for maintenance, is there any doubt but that the State would have reason to fear a continuance in the dilapidation of its property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would welcome regular inspection as to the proper maintenance of these houses, but before that, I would like to see the foundations laid of an equitable deal for the purchasing tenants.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider this matter in the light of what has been urged from all parts of the House including Deputies on the Minister's side.  I welcome Deputy Gibbons' contribution in this debate.  But I think the Deputy should have gone the whole hog, and not ask for a compromise between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent., the figure mentioned in the amendment of Deputy Norton.  I do not think the Minister will do any nibbling in <Col N="183" /> this matter.  I rather think he will go the whole hog.  Upon the Minister's action depends the failure or success of this measure.  For the last 30 years there has been keen agitation and demand for such a purchase scheme as this.  Credit is due to the Minister and to the Government for introducing this scheme, but it ought to be such a scheme as will be acceptable to the cottiers themselves instead of being the distinct reverse.  If this amendment is not accepted and as a consequence the measure becomes unacceptable, it will mean the prevention of a cottage purchase scheme in our lifetime.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very serious matter. After the long campaign by this very deserving section of the community I think we owe them something better than a mere dangling of the carrot.  I think in justice, and fair play, we should give them an opportunity of availing of this scheme for which they have been so long waiting and to which they are so justly entitled.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this in 1933, on the occasion of the discussions of the Land Bill, and I personally contended that these tenants were as much entitled to a 50 per cent. remission of rents as were the farming community.  The Minister for Defence who piloted that Bill through this House said it was an inopportune time to discuss the question in view of a Cottage Purchasing Bill being in the offing.  That was over three years ago.  I contend that in equity and justice the cottier tenants are as much entitled to that reduction as the farmers.  These tenants were in the second-line trenches if the farmers were in the first-line trenches as we were told they were during the economic war.  Many of the agricultural labourers have been deprived of employment; many of them have lost 3/- a week in their wages as agricultural labourers, and many of them have no work at all and have to go to the labour exchanges in order to get a few shillings.  Their position has worsened and they certainly have got no corresponding advantage.  If there was 50 per cent. <Col N="184" /> reduction in rents given to the farmers to enable them to maintain their position, the labourers were equally entitled to their share.  Now they are not offered 50 per cent. as an equitable remission; they are only offered 25 per cent. for the responsibility of relieving public authorities of the cost of repairs to their cottages.  I think it is an absolutely unfair proposition.  I trust the Minister will see the reasonable ness of the appeal made to him, from all parts of the House, to accept this amendment.  If the Minister took a plebiscite of the people of the country he would find the same unanimity as amongst Deputies here in asking him to accept the 50 per cent. in this amendment in order to make this Bill worthy of acceptance if it is to become an Act.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the appeal made by Deputy Gibbons and my colleagues from Limerick for a more equitable division of the cost in regard to the repairs of cottages.  Everybody admits that the farmers suffered through the economic war, but so also did the labourers. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to consider sympathetically the appeal made to him and to give a more substantial figure than the 25 per cent. mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I also want to support the point of view put forward by Deputy Norton and other Deputies in connection with this matter.  I cannot see how the Minister could be so hardhearted as to withstand the appeals made from all parts of the House on this matter, even from Deputies in his own Party.  It is quite apparent, to anybody, that if the Whips were withdrawn when the division takes place, if a division should be necessary, the House would be in favour of a reduction of 50 per cent.  It has been pointed out by Deputy Davin and other speakers, and by Deputy Gibbons, that members of the Commission appointed to look into this matter suggested that as farmers got a reduction of 50 per cent., cottage-holders are entitled to the same treatment.  I would urge the Minister to examine that in its proper perspective.  I suggest that it is the <Col N="185" /> labourers who have borne the brunt of every fight we have had for freedom in this country.  The labourers have borne their share as well as anybody and they are entitled to the same treatment as other people in the country and as the farmers have been given in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin pointed out that up to recent years the sum of £600,000 was being paid to the British Government by the predecessors of the present Government.  That money is not at the moment being paid, and with that I agree.  But at the same time the money is being collected from the cottage tenants.  I suggest that a good deal of that money could be used in order to help the Minister to reduce the annuities from what he suggested to 50 per cent.  I think it will be recognised by the Minister that if the Bill goes through in its present from, with the reduction of 25 per cent., the cottage tenant will be called upon to bear a greater burden than he is capable of bearing at the present moment. It was pointed out, in the course of the report of the commission, that the average amount required for the repair of cottages over a period of five years was £1 3s. 8d. per cottage.  I do not think it was suggested by the commission that that average sum of £1 3s. 8d. covered all the necessary repairs. It was merely the sum expended over five years.  We all know that, due to some reason or other, cottages have not been repaired as they should be repaired, and that the amount of money necessary to put cottages into a proper state of repair has not been laid out upon them.  Under the Bill, the cottages will have to be put into a decent state of repair.  I know that the Minister is taking precautions to ensure that these repairs will be carried out as he would like to see them carried out. However, as already pointed out, some of these cottages are 30, 40 and 50 years old.  Even though repairs be carried out, immediately this Bill becomes law, these cottages will fall into disrepair very soon again, because of their age.  In certain counties, tenants have been harrassing engineers for some years with a view to having certain repairs done.  They have been dissatisfied with the amount of repairs carried <Col N="186" /> out by the engineers in past years. One can imagine the boot being placed on the other foot now, and the engineers insisting that repairs to the extent of 100 per cent. be carried out. We know quite well that the tenant will not be in a position to do everything the engineer wants him to do. He will not be in a position to provide the necessary money.  The engineer can then report to the board of health, and the board of health can insist on the repairs being carried out in accordance with the specification of the engineer.  The Minister will agree that if a sum is expended on a house, and the annuity is to be increased in consequence of that, the county boards of health and the local Government Department will have a state of chaos created which will not be good for the tenant, the board of health or the Local Government Department.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in the report of the commission that about 5½d. per week would be the average for repairs.  In the case of the cottages in my county, the average rent is, I think, 1/- per week.  Twenty-five per cent. off that would leave the sum 9d.  If we are to add the 5½d. suggested by the commission, which to my mind is a very small sum, it will run the cost up to 1/2½ per week.  That means that the tenant will have to pay 1/2½ as against 1/- which he is paying at present.  In view of the fact that agricultural wages are very low at the moment, the Minister should consider what has been said in connection with this amendment.  As I pointed out at the beginning, members of his own Party have urged that the Minister should accept this amendment. The amendment has been supported from all sides of the House, and if the Minister ascertained the views of the different county boards of health, I am sure they would be in favour of a 50 per cent. reduction.  They are quite satisfied, if the liability for repairs is lifted from their shoulders, that they will be making a very good bargain.  Fifty per cent. of the rent would then be collected from the tenant.  I suggest to the Minister that he should either accept this amendment or have a free vote of the House upon it.  If he does that, he will find that the majority of the members are <Col N="187" /> in favour of it, and he will find also that the vote recorded will be merely a reflection of the opinion of ratepayers and boards of public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been enthusiastic about the purchase of labourers' cottages.  It is hard to conceive any scheme of cottage purchase which would confer much benefit on the tenant.  In that view I differ from a number of my colleagues.  It seems quite clear now that if the amendment under discussion is not given effect to, this scheme will confer no advantage on tenants of labourers' cottages.  In the absence of a provision of this kind, the scheme will impose a considerable burden on tenants, having regard to their financial limitations.  I happen to know the position intimately in the constituency which I represent.  In the rural district in which I live, there are 442 labourers' cottages, erected under various schemes.  The overwhelming number of these cottages were originally defectively built.  Now is not the time to apportion the blame for that position, but a legacy of extremely defective labourers' cottages&mdash;damp and entirely unsuited to the needs of the average family&mdash;was left to the board of health.  The chairman of what used to be known as the county board of health in Cork is a member of this House, and knows the facts as well as I do.  Since I became associated with the board of health in 1927, we have been faced with a very heavy burden, year after year, in an attempt to improve the condition of these cottages. It is an extremely difficult task, because anything that can be done in the way of repairs will not put a large number of the cottages in a proper condition.  When one defect is remedied, some other defect clamours for attention, and the repair of originally defective work goes on unceasingly. It is not unusual to find a specification for repairs running into about £15.  I have known some cases where it amounted to £20, and there are no items in the specification which did not require attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been repeatedly stated, and it <Col N="188" /> cannot be emphasised too often, that labourers in possession of these cottages in the future will find it impossible to cope with the ravages of defective construction and time.  The average amount spent on repairs to cottages in West Cork is 30/-.  The benefit to be conferred by the reduction proposed in the Bill, which it is now sought to amend, will be something like 13/-.  Taking the average rent as it is in West Cork, at 1/- weekly, it will mean that tenants will be instantly faced with an added burden of 17/- yearly for the rather shadowy hope that at some time in the future, if they live long enough, they or some members of their families or their successors will become the owners.  I think this a very bad bargain for the labourers.  I am more steadfast in that view in present circumstances, taking into account the existing rents of cottages and plots, and the 50 per cent. reduction given in the annuity on a 25 or 30-acre farm. There can be no comparison in the opportunities provided on holdings of that size and on plots attached to labourers' cottages.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that the average yearly expenditure in West Cork area on labourers' cottages is about 30/-.  That amount has proved entirely inadequate, as in a number of districts the amount to be allocated over the period of 12 months ending 31st March, 1937, has been already earmarked for a certain number of cottages, so that at the rate of 30/- per cottage no money is left to provide repairs for the remaining cottages.  That clearly proves that the amount provided is inadequate.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to accept what is the general view in the House, and what is very definitely the view of members associated with local authorities and that, at least, the concession sought in the amendment should be provided for, or the position ought to be faced that the tenants of labourers' cottages ought to be told definitely that the Bill is not one to give them any benefits whatever, but to impose certain definite financial disadvantages upon them.  Let the matter be faced in that way.  There is another aspect <Col N="189" /> that should be stressed, that in the event of tenants not being able to meet the cost of repairs, if the amendment is not accepted, it will be within the power of the board of health to compel certain repairs to be done. If they are not done possession of the cottages could be sought.  That would be a serious prospect for a large number of tenants.  The absence of such a provision as is contained in the amendment, which I think represents the only possible attempt to improve a Bill the general advantage of which seems to be doubtful, will be an intense disappointment to tenants generally, and the logical result will be that the whole principle underlying the Labourers Acts is likely to be very seriously undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment and to appeal to the Minister to do for the tenants of labourers cottages what the Government has done within the last few years for the farmers, namely, to reduce their rents.  I understand that the £129,000 which is paid as rent by tenants of the cottages is collected by the Government of this country at present, and that £129,000 is also paid by the farmers in penal tariffs to the British Government.  I see no reason why the Government, which has given a 50 per cent. reduction of annuities to the farmers, should not deal in a like manner with the tenants of cottages.  A great many of these cottages were never repaired since they were built.  The £44,000 spent on repairs last year does not indicate that 42,000 cottages were repaired, because that would represent a little over £1 a cottage.  In many cases repairs to cottages cost £8 or £9 each.  The cost of repairs would be more than £44,000 yearly, probably £60,000, if any sort of substantial repairs were carried out.  If the Minister accepts the amendment and gives a reduction of 50 per cent., there will be no difficulty in future with regard to repairs.  Deputies spoke of 17/- yearly covering the cost of repairs.  I consider that 17/- would not whitewash a cottage twice yearly, and would not go any distance towards carrying out the repairs that are necessary, especially to cottages that were not <Col N="190" /> repaired since they were built.  If the Minister accepts this amendment there will be no further difficulty about repairs.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I have listened to the arguments in favour of the amendment and I am in agreement with them.  An unanswerable case has been made for the amendment.  In the first place, in view of the fact that farmers have received a reduction of 50 per cent in their annuities, it is only fair and just that labourers who are akin to the farming community, should receive the same consideration.  In justice and equity they have a right to this reduction.  I do not think the Bill as it stands, exacting 75 per cent. of the former rent as an annuity, would make any improvement in the position of labourers at the present time.  I know that when the Minister brought in the Bill he calculated on improving the labourers' position, but from the financial point of view I do not think it will improve their position very much, if at all.  Cogent arguments have been put forward for the amendment and I do not think a case can be made against it.  Nobody will begrudge this little boon to the labourers.  I am sure the farming community will not.  If they did, they would be taking up an ungrateful attitude because the labourers always assisted in any agitation to advance the farmers' interests. Some of us are old enough to remember the fight the farmers had to make in the Land League days to secure a reduction in rack rents as well as the security of tenure that they now enjoy.  It may not be very generally known amongst Deputies that when farmers were agitating, and when monster meetings were held in connection with the land movement, the labourers were the backbone of that movement.  It would be regrettable if farmers to-day begrudged this concession to the direct descendants of those who assisted them.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. If he cannot accept it in its entirety, I would like him to go as far as he can, and to reduce the annuities on cottages by at least 60 or 70 per cent.</P>

      <P>I desire also to support this amendment.  I might say that there is general disappointment amongst the cottage tenants in my area at the terms of this Bill, especially in regard to this section which it is sought to amend.  I think that it is only fair and just that, as the farmers of the country under the 1933 Act were relieved of 50 per cent. of their annuities, the labourers of the country, who are also in the front line trench of the economic war, should in the same way be relieved of 50 per cent. of their rents.  I happen to know the position in my area, and I believe it is well known to the Minister also, in connection with the state of collection of the rents of labourers' cottages.  We have in my area 2,500 labourers' cottages, and it is well known to the Minister that the tenants of these cottages are not able to pay their rents at the present time, or have not been able to pay them for the past two years. It is well known to the Government that the wages the tenants of these cottages are receiving from the farmers would not enable them to keep body and soul together, not to speak of paying rents and wages and other calls which they have to meet. If the Government and the Minister are honest in their anxiety about the welfare of the labourers of the country, the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting the amendment. We have had cottages built for the last 23 years, some of them for the last 40 years, and, as pointed out by other speakers, these cottages were not properly built when they were first erected.  They were built on swamps and the plots were anything but good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill it is proposed that they are to be relieved of only 25 per cent. of their rents and that they are to be responsible for all repairs afterwards.  I cannot see that that will be of any benefit whatever to the labourers of the country.  I wonder what would be the position, under this proposal, of one tenant in my area who returned from his work a few days ago to find that the gable end of his house had gone down?  If he had purchased, I wonder how he <Col N="192" /> would repair his house?  That case only shows the way these houses were built and the way the sites were selected.  If we are going to hand over those houses to the tenants we should give them a reasonable reduction in their rents to enable them to repair their houses when repairs are necessary.  I say again that if the Minister and the Government are really honest in their desire to promote the welfare of the tenants of labourers' cottages in this country, they should have no hesitation in accepting this amendment.  If the Minister does that, he will make the Bill a good Bill.  If he does not, the Bill will be a failure.</P>

I think that when the matter is considered from the viewpoint of the treatment meted out to the farmers who purchased their holdings and who got from this Government a 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities, the Minister should favourably consider giving a decent reduction in the purchase price of labourers' cottages. I think, in all fairness to the labourers who have gone through strenuous times and who have at any rate always been national, when we are <Col N="193" /> bringing in a purchase scheme under which these labourers are to be made owners of their own homes, the Minister should be at least as generous. I would remind the Minister, also, that a certain amount of this money has been withheld from the British. I think that as he has given the farmers a 50 per cent. reduction, he should now be as decent to the labourers when he is proposing to make them owners of their own homes and not to leave them at the beck and call of anybody who wishes to give them a week's notice, and eject them from their cottages.  I think that when he is bringing in a purchase scheme he should be more generous than to give them merely a reduction of 25 per cent.  I would urge him to consider this matter very carefully and to do the decent thing by the labourers now that he has the opportunity.</P>

      <P>I agree with the points put forward by the previous speakers and I would ask the Minister if it is at all possible to extend this concession. The objection to the amendments, as far as I understand it, is that there is no analogy between the position of farmers who purchased their holdings and the position of tenants in labourers' cottages.  It is also said that these plots were purchased and handed over, more or less, as gifts to the labourers.  On the other hand, the tenants of labourers' cottages were given the cottages and the plots on certain conditions and they had to submit to certain restrictions.  For instance, they could not dispose of these cottages or plots.  The farmers' position is quite different.  When they obtained their holdings they had certain <Col N="194" /> liberties and certain privileges which were not enjoyed by the labourers.  I would point out that in our county the agricultural labourer is indispensable to the farmer.  He is continually assisting the farmer, working day in and day out.  The point has been made that the labourers have done their part in the national struggle.  I think everyone will agree with that, and also that there has been such co-operation between farmers and labourers as has made it possible for both to work out an existence.  I would appeal to the Minister that, if it be at all possible, he should go some distance to meet this amendment. The question of the repairs of labourers' cottages has been mentioned. To my mind the system of repairs carried on has been a failure. I think it would be much better if a decent concession could be given to the labourers, and then make them responsible for the repairs themselves.  That, from every point of view, would be a much better arrangement than the system that obtains at present.  I think it would give satisfaction to all concerned.</P>

In the county I represent, the tenants of labourers' cottages, while believing that this Bill is a great advance towards meeting their requirements, and is a great gesture on the part of the Minister, indicating that he is prepared to meet them as far as it is possible for him to do so, are still of the opinion that if the Bill is to produce the beneficial results expected from it: that if they are to be placed in the position they anticipated a year or two years ago, a further reduction should be given as regards the annuity. Now, it may be that the Minister has not at his disposal sufficient money to enable him to do that.  At the same time, I would ask him to reconsider his decision and to take into account the position of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> Some Deputies have attempted to draw an analogy between the position of farmers who have secured a 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities and that of the tenants of labourers' cottages. I do not know that the analogy holds, because Deputies are aware that so far as the repairs of labourers' cottages are concerned, and other charges in connection with the cottages, a great share of that burden was borne by the State and the local authorities.  Therefore, I do not think that the case made on that line was very convincing.  The position, as I see it, is that the tenants of labourers' cottages will be prepared to accept this measure with acclamation, provided there is some further reduction in the amount of the annuity.</P>

      <P>I just desire to say a few words on this amendment.  With the other Deputies who have spoken, I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the case that has been made for it.  I am quite well aware that there are considerable difficulties in the way.  I agree with Deputy Kelly that there is no parallel at all between the position of farmers and their annuities and the rents of labourers' cottages, but at the same time I would ask the Minister to see whether he could not offer better terms under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the appeal that has been made by Deputy Kelly, Deputy O'Reilly, Deputy Gibbons and other Deputies to the Minister to reconsider his decision on this matter.  I am sure that the Minister is sincerely anxious to do the best that he possibly can for the tenants of labourers' cottages &mdash;to give them the greatest possible relief&mdash;but, perhaps he is not fully conversant with the conditions prevailing generally throughout the country.  Labourers at any time have not a very happy existence.  The rate of wages paid to them in rural areas are not more than 14/- or 15/- a week with board.  Those of them who are married, and have to support young families, must find it very hard to carry on after paying their rents and <Col N="196" /> rates out of their wages.  Those of them who have young families are not able to utilise their cottage plots to the full extent.  I am quite sure that the farming community would not quarrel with the Minister if he were to give the concession asked for. I think his doing so would please everybody.  If he is not able to give the full 50 per cent. reduction, I hope that at least he will be able to go further than the 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk this evening about the cost of repairs of the cottages and of the burden that this puts on the local authorities.  If the Minister is not able to give the 50 per cent. reduction in the annuity, I do not know that there is anything in the Bill that would prevent the local authority from making up the difference by way of meeting the cost of repairs to the cottages, and thus relieving the tenants of that liability.  If the Minister were to agree to that, it would cut out all the argument we heard about the cost of repairs and of the burden that this will place on the tenant.  I hope the Minister will do his best to meet the unanimous representations that have been made to him on this matter from all sections of the House.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident, judging from the speeches that we have had on this amendment, that the tenants of labourers' cottages have many eloquent friends in the House.  They are not wanting in people to put forward their case. Some eloquent speeches have been made here on the position of the agricultural labourer, his past, his present, and his future.  I am not as closely in touch with agriculturists, labourers or farmers, as probably I might say most members of this House, but I am not unmindful of their position, in the past or in the present.  I know, as some Deputies have reminded us here, that they are not the best paid class in the community. I know as a matter of fact that in some areas of the country they are very poorly paid.  I hope that before this year is out, as a result of the promise that was made <Col N="197" /> recently by the Minister for Agriculture on behalf of the Government, that that problem is going to get consideration which will I hope lead to an amelioration of the position in the areas where that consideration is most urgently needed.</P>
      <P>The question of agricultural labourer cottier tenants and their wages is to some extent entitled to consideration when we are dealing with this Bill.  It is an argument I suppose that can be used, but it is not altogether to my mind <i>ad rem.</i>  We are not dealing with the question of agricultural labourers wages at the moment We are &mdash; and I say it despite the speeches that have been made&mdash;trying to confer a benefit upon them in introducing this measure here.  We are trying to convince the House that it is a good thing&mdash;and the House has adopted that idea in principle at any rate&mdash;to give to cottage tenants, agricultural labourers and others, an opportunity of becoming the owners in fee-simple of their own cottages and plots, and of doing so on terms which to my mind are reasonable and advantageous to the present occupiers. It is a popular thing of course&mdash;this applies all round&mdash;to plead for more generous treatment for the agricultural labourer.  Judging by one or two of the speeches which I heard from gentlemen whom I would not suspect of much sympathy with the agricultural labourer, one would almost imagine that a general election is near at hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You can wait and see.  I am not a prophet; I am just giving you the facts.  I do not deny that Deputy Morrissey takes an <Col N="198" /> interest in agricultural labour, and in all classes of labour, but I cannot say the same for some of his colleagues. Certainly I think I have good reason to resent the remark made&mdash;whether it was intended or not&mdash;by Deputy Daly a few minutes ago, when he talked about what would happen if the Minister or his Government were honest in their interest in the agricultural labourer.  From him or his Party a questioning of the honesty of the Minister and of the Government in their interest in that class of the community comes very badly.  Why, in the area he represents in Cork, they did not build a labourer's cottage all the time the last Government was in office, and they have not built many even since the 1932 Bill was passed. We have been pressing and pressing, and it is only in the last few months that they have been making any move commensurate with the size of the problem in North Cork.  I believe that in this Bill we are offering a good proposition to the agricultural workers who are tenants of cottages or who may become tenants in the days to come.  As Deputies have said here&mdash; I have said it myself earlier to-day in speaking of this Bill&mdash;if the offer is not a good one they need not accept it.  Naturally, there are as hardheaded business men amongst the cottier tenants as there are among any other class of the community, farmers included, who are usually regarded as fairly tough when it comes to striking a bargain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have nothing on the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is a good offer and a generous offer to give them an opportunity of becoming owners in fee-simple of the cottages and plots they occupy at what can be made practically the present rent that they are paying to the local authorities. Even if we take it on the last figures given for the cost of repairs, £44,000 a year, making a 25 per cent. reduction in the present rents as they have been read out here earlier, and adding the total cost of the repairs, the total as given here for the year 1935 would mean that there would be <Col N="199" /> an additional £12,000 a year, or 6/- a year per cottage, added to the present rents that the occupiers are paying. That is, I think, the worst side of the picture.  I do not believe that the repairs which the cottiers may do themselves under the terms of the Bill if they adopt the purchase scheme will cost them anything like the amount that the local authorities are obliged to pay at present for doing the same work or probably inferior work.  I think the cottiers will have an interest in keeping their cottages in repair, and that they will keep them in repair, and in better repair than before in most cases.  Unquestionably, some of the cottiers have kept their cottages splendidly in the past, although they did not own them.  In many cases&mdash; not in all&mdash;it is a pleasure to go around the country and see how they are not alone kept in repair but kept beautifully.  It is certainly very gratifying. Those of them who wish to do so will be able to keep their cottages in repair for less than the amount which the local authorities have had to pay in the past for frequently poor workmanship.</P>
      <P>There are even boards of health which have not spent anything like enough money in keeping those cottages in repair in the past.  Under the terms of the Bill the boards of health in all cases must put the cottages into proper repair, to the satisfaction of my Department, before they can hand them over to the purchaser. They must spend a considerable sum in some cases.  Already local authorities have budgeted for spending large sums of money to put those cottages into repair.  When the local authority has spent the money necessary to put the cottages into proper condition to the satisfaction of my inspectors&mdash; and, in many cases, as is known, they are not in repair at present&mdash;I think it will be possible for the tenants to keep them in repair for less than it has cost the local authority per annum recently, and, in many cases, they will probably get much better work done for less money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the principle is a good one of inducing the tenants to become <Col N="200" /> the owners of their property.  It is the best kind of Christian and Catholic philosophy, and I think the terms that are being offered are such as will attract the tenants, in spite of the eloquent speeches of Deputy Norton, and many others on my own side of the House as well as on the Opposition. I should like to remind the House that there is nothing in the Bill which says that the reduction is to be 25 per cent.  I stated, on Second Reading, that I adopted the recommendations contained in the report, and the recommendations included a reduction of 25 per cent. on the present rents, and that future tenants should bear the cost of the repairs, provided the local authorities first put the cottages into proper condition.  I did not, however, put into the Bill anything to say that the reduction was to be 25 per cent. or any other percentage, and I did not do it because I know there are such differences in conditions, not alone between county and county, but between scheme and scheme of labourers' cottage building in each county, that it will require very skilful handling to draft purchase schemes that will be equitable and fair to all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>When the boards of health get together, with the information they have and with the information their officials can give them, to draft schemes, and come to our Department with their schemes&mdash;they can come to the Department with their schemes before they are finally adopted&mdash;they will get advice and assistance of every necessary kind, and our desire will be to make the burden as light as possible on the tenants, bearing in mind the responsibility of the Ministry to the ratepayers as well.  But again, I insist that there is nothing in the Bill which limits the reduction to 25 per cent.  I certainly would strongly resist, and do intend to resist, the demand that we should state in the Bill that there must be a 50 per cent. reduction.  I do not think that would be fair; I do not think it would be just and equitable to all concerned.  I do not think we could do it with justice, but I do again say that there is nothing in the Bill limiting the reduction to 25 per cent.  We will take each scheme as it <Col N="201" /> is put up to us by the local authority, and we will examine it and discuss the anomalies that do exist in each county at present.</P>
    <P>There are many schemes, which have been put through in different counties where the cost of money differed very materially.  At one time, the cost of loans raised for the building of these labourers' cottages was 2½ per cent. and 2¼ per cent., and later, it was 4¾ per cent.  The period over which the loan had to be repaid differed very materially, and all these different problems will have to be taken into consideration.  The different rents that exist must also be considered.  There are, in most counties, cottages, the rent of which is 9d. and there are cottages, the rent of which is 2/- and 2/6 per week, and we must try to strike an even balance between all these, and reach a figure that will be fair and equitable to all concerned. It will take some serious thought and working out to get a figure that will be fair to all parties.  Where there is a doubt as to what should be done when a particular problem comes to be solved in relation to any of these schemes, I would certainly be inclined to lean to the side of the agricultural labourer, but I certainly must resist the attempt to tie us up, and to insist that 50 per cent. of the present rents be lopped off, because I do not think it would be equitable.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have made the case that, now that the farmers have got a reduction of 50 per cent. in their annuities, it is only just that agricultural labourers, tenants of cottages built under the Labourers Acts, should get a similar reduction, but the cases are not comparable.  The farmer was not subsidised by the taxpayer or by the ratepayer as was the labourer. There is no agricultural worker who is a tenant of a labourers cottage who can be said to have paid at any time an economic rent, a rent in any way approaching the figure which it cost the State and the local authority to provide that cottage and plot.  The local authority, frequently to a greater extent than the State, has provided the difference between the rent paid by the agricultural labourer and the <Col N="202" /> cost of supplying the house and the plot.  That is not true of the farmer. The farmer has paid an economic rent.  We were reminded here this evening that farmers&mdash;perhaps not the present generation, but former generations&mdash;paid much more than an economic rent and it required a very great struggle indeed and much sacrifice and suffering to get justice for the farmer. We were reminded and, properly, too, to-night, that in these fights the labourers frequently bore as much of the brunt of the battle as did the farmers.  They suffered in various ways with the farmers during the course of that struggle, but the cases are not on all fours, and I do not think it is just to present the case in that way.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I think might be mentioned, and it is that the Government is spending out of the taxpayers' money, and intends to continue to spend, a very considerable amount of money in helping to provide decent homes for the agricultural workers as well as for other similarly circumstanced people in the community.  In order to do so, however, we have to get the help of the local authority.  The local authority has to tax itself to a certain extent, and if we put heavy burdens&mdash;as heavy burdens as would be necessary in order to give a 50 per cent. reduction to the present cottier tenants&mdash;I am rather afraid that cottage building will certainly decrease, if not cease altogether, in many areas where the local authorities will not be prepared to face the additional burdens that they must face if.  I were to give way to the amendment.  I do not want to see that. I do not think it would be fair, because I think there are still in the rural districts many thousands of agricultural labourers who are living in hovels and who require to be housed, and they are entitled to houses just as well as those who have got them in the recent and remote past.  We have a duty to them; and it is because I bear in mind our duty to the people who have not yet got houses or plots that, in justice to them, to the local authorities, and to all concerned, I feel I cannot go any further than I have gone in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I really put down this amendment to get an explanation from the Minister as to what we are to understand from that word &ldquo;forthwith.&rdquo;  The section reads: &ldquo;Where (a) a purchase scheme for a county health district has come into force, and (b) either (i) the board <Col N="205" /> of health for such county health district has provided an additional cottage (not being a cottage situate on State lands) under the Principal Acts, or (ii) such scheme has ceased to apply to a cottage which was vested in a parchasing tenant under this Act by reason of possession of such cottage having been recovered by such board under this Act, such board of health shall forthwith prepare and submit to the Minister a purchase scheme in relation to such cottage.&rdquo;  I want to know from the Minister what meaning is to be attached to the phrase &ldquo;shall forthwith prepare and submit ... a purchase scheme&rdquo;.  Does it mean that the board of health, having put up a scheme of 50 cottages, may be compelled every time they finish a cottage to put up a scheme and advertise it, as it has to be advertised under this Bill?  Are they to go to all that expense and trouble and do that every time they build a cottage?  If that is the meaning we are to attach to it, I suggest the Minister should give the board of health at least 12 months; instead of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; he should substitute the words &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I came to the conclusion, with regard to sub-section (3) and (4), that there is duplication.  Of course I know there is a certain distinction between them. Sub-section (3) sets out: &ldquo;the board of health of such county health district shall, if the Minister so directs, forthwith <Col N="206" /> prepare and submit to the Minister a new purchase scheme in relation to such cottage,&rdquo; and sub-section (4) says: &ldquo;the board of health for such county health district may, with the consent of the Minister, prepare and submit to the Minister a new purchase scheme in relation to such cottage&rdquo;.  I think the two ought to be welded into one and let sub-section (3) read something like this: &ldquo;Where&mdash; (a) a purchase scheme which applies to a cottage in a county health district has come into force, and (b) a person, who is the tenant of such cottage and who has not purchased such cottage under this Act, cases to be such tenant, the board of health of such county health district shall, with the consent of the Minister, forthwith prepare and submit to the Minister a new purchase scheme in relation to such cottage.&rdquo;  If you had the two welded into one, it would not be so cumbersome. In sub-section (3) we have the Minister forcing the board of health to prepare a scheme, and in sub-section (4) we have him allowing the board of health to prepare the same scheme. There is no necessity for duplication.</P>

    <P>(1)  In addition to any other powers conferred on him by the Principal Acts or by this Act, the Minister may if he considers it expedient so to do before making an order under paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of the next preceeding section by an order made under this section require the board of health to prepare a scheme (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;enlargement scheme&rdquo;) in relation to any cottage within the functional area of such board of health to which there is attached a plot or garden less than one acre in extent for the purpose of enlarging the area of such plot or garden.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever an order requiring a board of health to prepare an enlargement scheme is made under this section it shall operate and have effect to require the board of health to which it relates within six months after the making of such order to prepare and submit for the approval of the Minister an enlargement scheme in accordance with the provisions of such order.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of this section the provisions of Section 3 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906 shall, subject to such modification as the Minister may by order prescribe apply and have effect in relation to anything done by a board of health in pursuance of an order made under and in accordance with this section.</P>
    <P>I am moving this in order to enable the Minister to give authority to the boards of health to acquire more land, if needed by the tenants of the labourers' cottages.  This amendment would confer upon the Minister power to enable the local authorities to increase the area of land attached to a cottage.  I think the Minister would be well advised to accept this amendment, because at the moment the tendency for labourers is to apply for more land.  I think it will be admitted that the policy of the present Ministry is to get the people back to the land. The industrious agricultural labourer should be encouraged to acquire more land in order to grow more food for <Col N="208" /> himself and his family.  The Minister should take power in this Bill to enable the boards of health to give more land to the labourer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a purchase scheme which <Col N="209" /> applies to a cottage in a county health district is in force, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such cottage is occupied by a person who is a qualified person, and</P>
    <P>(c)  no rent is due in respect of such cottage,</P>
    <P>such person may send an application to the board of health for such country health district for the transfer to him of the interest of such board of health by means of a vesting order made under this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Each of the following persons shall, for the purposes of this section, be a qualified person in relation to a cottage, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  who is the tenant of such cottage, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  who either is an agricultural labourer or was, when he first became tenant, an agricultural labourer;</P>
    <P>(b)  a person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  who is the widow, child or other relative of a person who, at the date of his death, was tenant of such cottage and who either was, at the date of his death, an agricultural labourer or was, when he first became tenant, an agricultural labourer, and</P>

    <P>(iii)  who is declared by the board of health, in whose county health district such cottage is situate, to be a qualified person.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to meet a number of points that were made during the discussion on the Second Reading in order to clear up all doubts as regards the position of those who would be entitled to purchase their cottages.  The section in the Bill confines the right to purchase to an agricultural labourer, the widow of a deceased agricultural labourer or a person who, when he first became such tenant, was an agricultural labourer. The amendment down in my name will extend the section to a person who is a widow, child or other relative of a <Col N="210" /> person who at the date of his death was tenant of such cottage and who either was at the date of his death an agricultural labourer or was when he first became a tenant, an agricultural labourer.  I think it is a desirable amendment.  As far as I could gather from the discussion on the Second Reading it is one which the House desires to have inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 17 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  When there is due in respect of rent arising out of the occupation of a cottage a sum exceeding the amount of the weekly rent of such cottage multiplied by thirty and the Board of Health consider it expedient to include in a purchase scheme any cottage which if no rent were due by the tenant of such cottage would be so included it shall be lawful for the Board of Health at their discretion to do either of the things following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  remit the amount of the rent due, or</P>
      <P>(b)  provide in the purchase scheme that the amount of the rent due shall be deemed to be a sum due in respect of the annuity payable in respect of such cottage.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever a Board of Health determines in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of the immediately preceding sub-section of this section to regard as a sum due in respect of the annuity payable in respect of a cottage the rent due arising out of the tenancy of such cottage the said sum shall be payable as part of the annuity in equal weekly amounts spread over the whole period during which such annuity is to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make some provision for a number of tenants who might be desirous of participating in a scheme but who might find that that is impossible because of <Col N="211" /> the accumulation of arrears.  Deputies will observe that there are alternative proposals in the amendment.  The first proposal gives the boards of health power to remit the amount of the rent due or alternatively to incorporate the arrears in the annuity to be subsequently paid.  In other words, to fund the arrears.  The principle underlying the alternative to the original proposal is well established already in the Land Acts and there is, I think, a well-known precedent for this proposal as to arrears.  In certain counties at the same time the arrears of rent are fairly heavy.  The amount outstanding in Dublin is small but in Cavan, Cork, Clare and Kerry the average amounts outstanding would be very much higher.  In Cork the arrears are 21/- per cottage; Clare, 70/8; and Kerry, £7 5s. 7d. per cottage.  It would be utterly impossible for a very long time to avail of the provisions of the Bill in the case of a number of tenants but my amendment would provide an easy method of regularising the position and giving the tenants an opportunity of participating in the purchase scheme on fairly reasonable terms.  It would be a very useful arrangement to make in regard to tenants who owe sums like those I have mentioned. The amendment would give them an opportunity of paying that over the period that the annuity would have to run, or over a portion of that period.  I think that in a number of cases the Minister ought to consider giving the boards of health power to remit entirely.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this case that I think is related to the viewpoint underlying the amendment. Boards of health in many cases have collected rents or have imposed obligations for rent on tenants who are not liable.  In many counties there is a practice of asking the incoming tenant to be responsible for the arrears that have accrued during the previous tenancy.  In the anxiety to obtain possession of a cottage the successful applicant has entered into the liability of paying the arrears, although there might be very little hope of his honouring <Col N="212" /> that obligation.  To such people is due the need for doing something to rid them of that obligation.  Having regard to the recent reply by the Minister to Deputy Keyes, I am well aware of the fact that boards of health cannot legally collect these arrears, but there are ways of making it difficult for the applicant for a cottage to refuse.  I have frequently seen cases where the boards of health give preference to the applicant who agrees to accept liability for the arrears.  I suggest to the Minister that one or other of the proposals, certainly the first in a number of cases, should be accepted.  The second proposal would give an opportunity of providing reasonable means to tenants who desire to benefit under this scheme to do so, so that they could come in on equal terms with those who may be more fortunate.  Tenants of labourers' cottages generally are desirous of meeting their obligations, but there are many reasons in certain circumstances why it has not been found possible for them to do so.  I think, having regard to the well-known precedents that exist for arrangements of this kind, that the Minister ought to entertain the proposal contained in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the statement made by Deputy Murphy with regard to this.  It should be emphasised, of course, that what we are asking for here is that it should be left to the discretion of the board of health as to whether this concession will be granted.  By doing that, of course, there will be a certain check. There is no doubt that the figures for arrears of rent in certain counties are rather alarming.  There must be some reason peculiar to these particular counties, as it is not general.  I have no doubt whatever that there are certain cottage-holders in arrears, if you like, through carelessness or otherwise. But I believe that the vast majority are in arrears through no fault of their own, many of them, who have large families, perhaps through long periods of sickness or unemployment, and a certain number at least for the reason that Deputy Murphy has advanced, that in order to obtain <Col N="213" /> possession of these cottages they had to undertake the liability for meeting substantial arrears left by the outgoing tenants.  I know the Minister does not stand for that.  He said more than once that there was no legal authority for it.  Apart from its legality, however, it is the practice in a great many counties.  It is a very unfair practice, to say the least of it.  The Minister and the House would be well advised to accept the suggestion contained in the amendment.  I think we can depend upon the members of the boards of health, with their knowledge of local conditions which we have not here, to investigate the claims and the applications and deal with them either under (a) or (b).  Probably most of them would be dealt with under (b), and some of them may be met under (a).</P>
      <P>I realise, of course, that there is the other side of the case, that there is a danger that people who, if you like, avoided the obligation of meeting their rent, are going to get preferential treatment as against those who faced up to their responsibility and paid their rents in full.  I do think we can carry that too far.  That is the reason I say it should be left to the discretion of the boards of health, because I am satisfied that, in the majority of cases anyway, taking the State as a whole&mdash;as I said, there may be special reasons in a particular county&mdash;these arrears have accrued through the inability of tenants to meet them, that they accrued probably during a period of illness or unemployment. It would be a hardship on these people if that was to be held against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  I personally know of cases where arrears of rent up to £15 and £20 have been handed over with the cottages to the incoming tenants.  It is very hard to blame the board of health, who are anxious to incur as little loss as possible for the ratepayers.  These arrears were to be paid at the rate of 2/6 per week, and in a great many cases have not been paid off.  I should like to point out to the Minister that if he does not accept the proposal, the purchase <Col N="214" /> scheme is going to be a piecemeal one &mdash;only one or two out of every ten cottages will be purchased, the purchase in the other cases being held up owing to arrears.  As I say, you will have a patchwork scheme of purchase all over the country.  To my mind, the difficulties in the way already are numerous enough without adding this difficulty of arrears.</P>
      <P>I honestly think that this proposal ought to be accepted.  I do not know whether it would be wise in some cases to leave it to the board of health, but I would urge that something of this nature should be done, and that the arrears should be either wiped out or funded.  It is the only way in which you can meet these particular cases, otherwise you will have a patchwork purchase scheme which will be dragging along from year to year, judging by the way the arrears stand at present.  It will be just as bad as the old Land Acts, because so long as there are arrears on a cottage that cottage cannot be purchased unless the tenant pays up the arrears.  If this was done, there would be undoubtedly an incentive in some cases to the sale of cottages.  I have looked up the arrears sheet as a member of the South Cork Board of Health, and it will mean that only two or three cottages out of every ten will be purchased if the Bill is passed as it stands.  We are anxious to have a clean sheet as far as possible&mdash; to get the purchase scheme through.  I honestly think that any loss that would be entailed on the ratepayers by so doing would be more than met by the relief which this purchase scheme would give to the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons why the rents were not paid so well in Cork is that the unfortunate labourers were penalised very much for the past two or three years because the miserable pittance they got in wages was <Col N="215" /> reduced in some cases by 50 per cent. just because this Government was in office.</P>

      <P>I said their wages were reduced by 50 per cent. just because the Party opposite did not come out on top and the labourers were blamed for that.  I consider that this Bill is only a very small instalment of what is due to these labourers.  I certainly would suggest that the Minister ought to accept the amendment. The boards of health will have trouble enough in preparing purchase schemes without this added question of who is going to be allowed to purchase or who is not going to be allowed owing to arrears of rent.  To my mind, this is the most feasible way of meeting the difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever sympathy I had with the last amendment, which we discussed at considerable length, as to the reduction in the rate of annuity, I have none with this amendment.  I think it is, morally speaking, an entirely wrong principle. It would introduce a differentiation between those who have loyally and justly met their obligations and those who have not.  I think the principle is bad.  If we are to encourage people, as I think we will be encouraging them, to become the owners of their own cottages and plots, we ought not to give preferential treatment in that scheme to those who have failed to meet their obligations up to the present and, in many cases, failed through their own fault, I believe.  I have here before me a return of arrears of cottage rents in all the counties of the Saorstát.  When one looks at that return and compares county with county, and parts of one county with other parts of the same county, one is driven to the conclusion that it is not because of inability to <Col N="216" /> pay that there are arrears, but for some other reason.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry referred to Deputy Davin's constituency or to part of his constituency, Laoighis.  I do not imagine that the labourers in Laoighis, taking them all round, are much better off than those in South and West Cork. They are probably no better off than the labourers in South Cork.  I am sure, that, taken as a whole, they are no better off.  But according to this return, while there were 1,522 cottages built in Laoighis there is not one penny due.  Is not that very creditable?  And almost equally creditable is West Cork, where there are 1,346 cottages and only £636 due.  That is very creditable.  Who will tell me that the labourers in West Cork are better able to pay their rent than those in North Cork?  I could not believe it. The same applies in Kerry, where the payment is simply a disgrace.  No other word can be used for it.  No one will deny that the County Cavan is a poor county.  The labourers there are as poor as the average agricultural labourer.  In Cavan there are 996 cottages and only £604 due.  That is creditable.  Taken on the average the probability is that those people in Cavan, who owe only £604, suffer from the same disabilities as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, such as periods of sickness or unemployment or things of that kind, just the same as other labourers.  It is reasonable to expect that there should be some arrears in any county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carlow is a prosperous county as a whole.  I do not know whether the agricultural labourers there are better paid than in other counties.  They may not be better paid than the labourers in counties, not so rich, but there is nothing due in Carlow.  There is very little due in Roscommon, part of which is very rich land, but whether the richest lands pay the best wages to labourers I cannot say.  Parts of Roscommon are very good and parts bad but the fact remains that while they have 719 cottages there, only £228 is due in arrears.  That is very creditable. The list I have before me conveys to me the impression that there is better organisation for the collection of rents in some parts of the country <Col N="217" /> than in others.  It may be a question whether the authorities or their collectors do their duty when rents are available.  I am sure and certain that the labourers generally want to meet their obligations.  Frequently it happens that collections are neglected; rents are not called for at the time when the labourers have them to pay, and, then, when they are called for later they have been spent, possibly, for some legitimate purpose.  Deputy Belton probably knows conditions in County Dublin.  There, 2,607 cottages were built, and the arrears due amount only to £379.  That is very creditable. It is far better than in some other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>It is the wrong council.  But, on the whole, Dublin County farmers pay fairly decent wages, so far as I know, and I think the council approves of that.  That is what this list conveys to me, and I am prepared to give a copy of the list to any Deputy who wants it.  The labourers in this country pay fairly well, and are reasonable people, and meet their obligations.  I think it would be quite unfair to the decent labourers to allow the scamp to get away.  It would not be fair to the people who pay their rents, although it may be very hard for them to do so, small as the rent is, to let the scamp get away free.  I do not think it would be a wise thing to do from the purely moral standpoint; it would not be wise or proper to allow such people to get off.</P>

      <P>If the Minister turns to the discussion on that section of the Act of 1933, he will find that I emphatically opposed the inclusion of that amendment in the Act of 1933.  If the Minister and his Party thought fit to insist upon the insertion of an amendment, containing the same principle and penalising the taxpayers to the extent of £250,000, at the time, I do not see what is wrong in accepting this amendment now and giving similar benefits to the cottage tenants to-day. I dislike being a party to any legislation that will allow the dodger to shift his responsibility, and pass it on to his next door neighbour, whether he be a farmer who fails to pay his annuities or a cottage tenant who fails to pay his rent.  I think it was the present Minister for Defence, then acting for the Minister for Lands, who put forward strong arguments for the insertion of such an amendment into the Land Act of 1933.  I do not see why the Minister for Local Government who voted for such an amendment in the Land Act of 1933 should be so emphatically opposed to this amendment.</P>
      <P>This amendment is, in fact, copied from the Land Act, 1933.  I know it is a fact, and I am delighted to see that the cottage tenants of Laoighis have not attempted in the past four or five years to pass on their responsibilities to anyone else.  A strong point in favour of this amendment was mentioned by Deputy Corry, that unless something of this kind is done&mdash;I am in favour of the funding side rather than the remission side&mdash;I can see that in the counties where there are numbers of tenants in arrears this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be inoperative.  I suggest there is a strong case in favour of that part of the amendment which asks the Minister to agree to a funding of the arrears, and I prefer funding to total remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a bad principle involved in this proposal, there is, I think, a very good precedent for it.  This Bill is going to be judged side by side with what was done for the farmer.  If collections are as good as the Minister states all over the country, he will not be giving away much.  If there are a few bad spots <Col N="219" /> here and there, due, as the Minister said, not to the tenants but to bad organisation&mdash;collectors not calling when they should call&mdash;the tenant should not be blamed and nailed for that.  I wonder how we are going to get over the difficulty which has prevailed all over the country, and, to my knowledge, in South Cork for a long number of years, where a cottage on which arrears of rent were due was given to a new tenant, who was assessed for the arrears, sometimes to the extent of £15 or £20.  Is that unfortunate man to be kept from purchasing because of the arrears which he inherited?  Is the unfortunate man who fell into arrears because of sickness or bad collection to be deprived of the little benefits that are conferred by the Bill?  I suggest to the Minister that if the Bill is to be a success&mdash;as we all hope it will be&mdash;he should give way on this question and enable the purchase scheme to go through.  If there is not to be a funding arrangement, I wonder how the Minister or his advisers expect an unfortunate tenant to find £10 when he could not find 1/- per week rent.  A large number of these tenants are widows, whose husbands were farm labourers.  Some of them are rearing young families on home assistance.  Where are they to find the lump sums to purchase their cottages and be on an equality with their neighbours?  I honestly think that the Minister ought to give way on this amendment.  If there is a bad principle involved, it is a principle that was supported by the Minister himself in the 1933 Act, when this was done for the farmers.</P>

He says that the organisation was bad, and that the arrears are due to collectors not calling when they should call and calling when they should not call.  The boards of health will be responsible for working <Col N="220" /> this scheme and it should be left to their judgment as to whether a man is a &ldquo;welsher&rdquo; or not.  They should be able to judge whether there is a proper system of collection or not.  I think the matter should be left like that instead of introducing a cut-and-dry product from a Department.</P>

The Minister deduces from the fact that there is inequality in payment of the cottage rents even in the same county that those who are black-sheep must necessarily be black of their own volition and that those who are white are perfectly honourable.  On the same reasoning, you could not get any solution of that kind of problem.  In all counties, there are some people more fortunate in securing employment than others.  Those who did secure employment are reflected in the good payments.  Many tenants in the various counties who would be equally willing to pay their arrears may not have been able to do so because of lack of employment.  In many cases, workers under county councils had to wait for months for the moneys due to them.  I know cases in my county where proceedings were taken against cottage tenants for failure to pay rents of £3, £4, or £5 at a time when considerably more than two or three times those amounts were due to them by the county council and they had no chance of receiving payment for three or four months to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That occurred in my own county, and several other counties were in a similar position.  In County Limerick eviction proceedings were brought at a time when more than twice the amount of cottage arrears were due as wages by the local authority to the tenants.  I know that some of those tenants who are in arrear are perfectly honourable men. They would not willingly owe a shilling to anybody.  Some of them have <Col N="221" /> large families and big responsibilities. I do not stand for the fellow who wilfully shirks the payment of his cottage rent, but I think that some consideration should be shown to the man who is deserving of it and who, through no fault of his own, finds himself in arrears.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy of a different kind for those who have been trapped under an illegal pretence by various boards of health into shouldering liabilities of from £15 to £20.  That is a most undesirable practice, and it is still being carried on, notwithstanding that the Minister has stated on more than one occasion that he would notify boards of health that they had no legal authority to collect those arrears.  He made that statement in reply to a Parliamentary question by me.  Still, that practice is going on and there is no sign of its diminishing.  That would represent a good deal of the arrears. People went into these cottages and undertook to pay £15 or £20 or £30 which was due by the outgoing tenant. I am not so much in sympathy with a tenant of that kind as I am with the man who legitimately finds himself in arrear because of illness or lack of employment.  Surely power should be given to the boards of health to exercise a discreation and to segregate these cases from those of the really bad tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the second proposal in this amendment, no hardship will accure to anybody if the arrears are funded over the period of the purchase.  I think that that is a reasonable and a fair proposition.  There are plenty of opportunities to deal drastically with persons who deserve to be so dealt with, while permitting the beneficent provisions of this Bill to be extended to those tenants who have been so long <Col N="222" /> looking forward to them.  If the Minister cannot see his way to accept the amendment in full.  I think he should intimate to the House that he is prepared to bring in some other proposal that will at least cover the second portion of the amendment and provide opportunities for funding.  By that means justice and equity would be done, and those who would have the working of the Act would be spared a great deal of dissatisfaction.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendment in its entirely, I ask him not to turn it down flat, thereby depriving some of the most deserving tenants, who through misfortune have fallen into arrear, of the benefits of this long-sought purchase measure.  If he cannot accept the amendment in its entirety, I hope he will indicate that he has sufficient interest in the working of the measure and sufficient sympathy with the boards of health, who are to be asked to draft schemes, to remove this difficulty and to enable these boards to exercise a discretion so that tenants be enabled to pay the arrears over the period of purchase.</P>
